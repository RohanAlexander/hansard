I submit that if Ministers are not prepared to answer questions, they should boldly ask that the questions sliould be put on the notice paper, but you are taking up the attitude that you will not allow Ministers to answer questions. you are giving the House?

When he has been here a little longer he will understand that the rules of order. orable member is out of order in interrupting. lecture from the honourable member for Wannon when he made his first speech, and we did not mind, because he did it in a very nice, smiling way; but he will find, after he has been here a little time, that the Standing Orders were drawn up by a Committee representing both sides of the Chamber, and acting in calm moments, and were agreed to by the House when it was not in a heated state, but i u a calm mood, and realized tliat it was necessary, i u the interests of minorities, that there should be standing orders, because majorities, if allowed, always get their own way. In calm and cool moments the Standing Orders were agreed to as embodying what was considered a fair code. I submit that if an honourable member asks a question, and he deems it necessary to enlighten the Minister concerned, to state facts, he is entitled, under the Standing Orders, to do so; and surely, sir, it is a privilege of the members of the House that a Minister should be allowed to answer a question if he is willing to do so. question of privilege raised by the honourable member for Capricornia, I desire to point out that I have not attempted to interfere with the right of Ministers to answer questions put to them, provided those questions are in order. Buti t is distinctly laid down by parliamentary authorities, as well as by the practice of this House, tliat if a question is not in order, a reply to such a question is equally out of order. 1 have ample authority under our own procedure for the course of action I have followed in this case, and the rulings given by my predecessors are well supported by abundant authority relating to the practice of the House of Commons. Irregular questions should not be answered, and debates on the answers of Ministers to questions are not permissible. As I pointed out on a previous occasion, a It is a lecture on the mainquestion, to be i u order, must relate to business of which Ministers have chargeto the administration of their Departments, or to matters of a public character with which they have to deal. Questions which do not come within that category .are not in order. A question must seelr information, not give it . I gave to the House only a few days ago the decisions of the most eminent iDarliamentary authorities bearing on this subject, so that it is unnecessary for me to repeat them. Under our own Standing Orders, questions may be put to Ministers in reference to public affairs, but it is the practice of this House, as well as of. every Parliament of which I know, to l i m it an honourable member' when asking a question, and especially a question without notice, to only such an explanation as is absolutely necessary to make the question clear. No further amplification is permissible. The honourable member for Ballarat was going beyond it . He was making a speech, which, as I understood it , could not be regarded as being only such a limited explanation as was necessary to make clear the purpose of his question.. Speaker, to ask whether you still rule that the honourable member for East Sydney was not in order in addressing his question to the Minister of Trade and Customs? ber was not in order if he was asking a question arising out of an answer given by a Minister to a question previously put and f u l l y replied to.

137,Mr King O'malley (Darwiii),"not mind paying this toll if we could get -our produce transported at the same rates as are charged for the transportation of produce from the other States. But it costs from 25 to 50 per cent, more to forward produce from Tasmania to Sydney than it does to carry it from Brisbane or Adelaide to Sydney, notwithstanding that 'the distance is some hundreds of miles less. I think that my honourable friends opposite, who have come here to represent the producers of this country, ought to sympathize with the people of Tasmania. If the Labour Government had not suffered a temporary set-back on the 31st May last, there is no doubt that we would now be establishing a fast line of steam-ships between Tasmania and the mainland. Mr Graham, one of the eminent Ministers of Victoria, is not only in favour of fast lines of steam-ships to carry produce between the different States, but he is also in favour of the establishment of a Commonwealth line of steamers to carry our.pro-duce to the Old Country. I have no ill feeling towards the Government. They are -doing their best according to their light, but their light on this occasion is a dark lantern. They have agreed to give the Union Steam-ship Company a sevenyears' contract for the carriage of mails to and from Tasmania, and -that company a subsidy of £15,000 annually. But they have not made the company sign an agreement to reduce its fares and freight charges. challenge my friends opposite to search the history of the steam-ship lines pf the world, and to point to one which charges as much for carrying a passenger a similar distance as does this particular company. It is 215 miles from Melbourne to Burnie, and the Loongana can cover the distance in twelve hours. Yet a passenger is charged £ 2 I2s. 6d. for a return ticket. saloon. If a passenger desires a .deck cabin to Launceston, a return ticket costs him £ 3 5s. Now, in the United States, where the people are almost crushed by monopolies, one can travel from Portland, Maine, to New Yorka distance of nearly 500 miles-for £ 1 . A return ticket can be obtained for 30s. is much greater. not half as great proportionately, because the steamers have to compete with great railway lines, and the passengers have to be two nights at sea. Yet, in my day, oue could purchase a return ticket for 7^ dollars, or 30s. My honourable friends' will doubtless say that what they are doing is semi-Socialism. If it is, and the Union Steam-ship Company is a benevolent in stitution, I would sooner have the American monopolies, because they provide better accommodation, with more conveniences, and at half the cost. A Select Committee was appointed by the Tasmanian Parliament to inquire into the whole question of the freight and passenger charges made by the steam-ship companies. That Committee was appointed at the instance of Mr Bakhap, who is now a senator representing that State. This body took a great deal of evidence, from which I propose to read a few extracts. Most of the towns in Tasmania are small, because, after a l l , Launceston would make only a suburb of Melbourne or of Sydney, and the same remark is applicable to Hobart. Mr. E. T. Clemons, a commission, agent doing a large business in Devonport, was examined by the Select Committee as follows : to pay Do you consider them [the freights] unreasonably high compared with those on the mainland?-Yes; compared with those on the mainland. Will you institute any comparison?-To give I you one clear instance, the freight from Devonport to Newcastle on chaff is 23s. bd. a ton, and from Adelaide to Newcastle it is only £1. Adelaide, it must be remembered, is double the distance from Newcastle that Tasmania is. It is a four days' journey from Adelaide to Newcastle, steaming all the time, and yet the freight ' is less than from here. Consequently, our quotations have to be from 5s -to 7s. under the mainland price to get business. A Tasmanian producer, is at a gieat disadvantage compared with the producers on the mainland. In that respect the freight rates cnarged are so high as to constitute a handicap?-Un doubtedly. This evidence in regard to freight charges was given by. Mr G. Finlayson, who is connected with a large engineering firm in Devonport. Are they reasonable or excessive?-They are _ . very excessive. How do vou arrive at a standard of comparison?-The charges from the Old Country to Melbourne, for instance, are sometime? less than from Melbourne to here on heavy lifts.",20,Tasmanian Mail Service

Vou find this a disadvantage in your trade? which, for a further period of years,, -Undoubtedly . Those who start industries in these small towns find it almost impossible to compete with rivals in the big cities of the mainland. According to the evidence, a 6-ton l if t that was brought from England to Victoria for £ 1 8 cost £ 3 5 to be taken from Victoria to Devonport. No wonder it is asked, "" Is this not daylight robbery?"" I shall quote now from the evidence of Mr Unsworth, of the firm of capable of travelling from twenty-five to Irvine and McEachean, one of the biggest thirty miles an hour.

That was all the satisfaction I Rot. The rates were raised on ordinary goods some little time ago from ios. to us., wines and spirits were raised 13s. 6d.; but about three or four months ago, without 'notice of any kind in any shape or form, wines and spirits were raised to 1.5s. per ton, or 4s. more than for ordinary cargo. On bottled beer we only pay the same as for ordinary cargo. It is monstrous. from England and Scotland, when the rate was jos. per ton, we used to be charged ;s. 6d., and it is now 14s: for wines and spirits. Those figures are strictly for freights ?-Yes. In connection with your transhipments from Fn^land and Scotland there has been an increase of almost too per cent.?-Yes. They used to charge 7s. 6d., and now we pay 14s. and the charges. Mr Edward Ingledew, a leading merbefore ? chant of Launceston, was examined by Mr Whitsitt,' a prominent member of ber sure that the increase, in freights is the House, and an eminent financial man. not due to the action of the wharf This is some of his evidenceIt seems to me there is an unholy combine existing at the present time, OT shall we call it an ""honourable understanding""? Do you consider the present charges are fair and reasonable?I consider the rates of freight are too high. I will Give you an instance. In regard to chaff, prior to the rate on potatoes being raised from ios. to us., the rate on chaff was ljS. It was then put up to 16s., a shilling increase to apply to chaff the same us to potatoes. There was some trouble at the Sydney wharfs, and they raised it to 17s. per ton, maximum, 25 bags lb the ton. Straw-chaff, though perhaps 27 or 28 bags to the ton, would be charged freight as 25. If weighing 20 bags to the ton, you would declare it_ on 20, so that they cut it both ways. A r e there facilities for The existing rate now to Sydney is 18s., as against 12s. 6d. from Adelaide to Sydney.

The fruit-growers of Tasmania are called upon to pay double the freight the fruit-growers of Queensland pay. Here is another instance from the report of the Royal Commission:On 23,737 cases of Tasmanian fruit sent by one of the A.US.N. steamers in a season from Sydney to Brisbane the freight was £1.760, whilst on 46,594 cases of fruit sent from Brisbane to Svdney the freight charged was only ^1,241. So that Tasmanian growers were called upon to pay £500 more in freight tlian was charged to (Queensland growers for the carriage of exactly double the quantity of fruit.

McDonald, I am taking the general manager of the Australian' Company, gave this evidenceI f the Royal Commission We have elicited in evidence that there is an arrangement between the various shipping companies'relative to freight charges. Is that so?Yes, we have an arrangement to run at fixed rates of freights and fares. That arrangement was arrived at after a very grave consultation in conference; the rates were fixed at that con, ference. So there is a thorough understanding. There are one or two small lines of steamers, but there is little difference ii» the freight: and I am told that the big; gentlemen have the inside of the little fellows-that they have everything that is worth having. The little fellows cannot find the capital. It is no f a u l t of theirs. If we had our Commonwealth Bank im f u l l operation working conjointly w i th the States, we could do away with all this, because we could help these small producers and small business men. There is no need to plead for the big men; they can look after themselves. Wealth needs no protection; she protects herself. I.shall give one or two more instances. MrW H o w can H .

I put the case verbally before the Minister as clearly as I could, and in due time. I received the following reply, dated 27th March of the present yearWith reference to your inquiry on the 4th inst., on behalf of MrD . Crosbie, Strathbogie North, as to whether the Department would approve of tenders being invited for the construction of the proposed telephone line between that place and Strathbogie, I beg to inform you that approval cannot be given for tenders to be so invited, as it is not the practice of the Depart25th August of the present yearment to have telegraph and telephone lines erected by contract. I thought, in my innocence, that it was the province of this Parliament to determine matters of policy, and I am disposed fco think that when honourable members are made aware of the fact that the Department has adopted a method which, in the case to which I refer, would prevent a saving to the people of £120 on tlte construction of a small line, they will be behind me, and not behind the Department. I wish to impress upon honourable members that this is not by any means a singular case, but I doubt whether any other member of the House has received such a letter as that which I have just read. It certainly contains a most important statement. It should be an eyeopener to the public at large to know that, in this huge Department, which is in a position to exercise most beneficial effects in many of our outlying centres, the methods adopted stand in the way of anything being done which will reduce the cost of the construction of these tele phone lines. I have another case to submit, which I take from the Argus, and so I cannot vouch for its correctness. 1 quote the following telegram from Buninyong, which appeared in the issue of 7th June, 1913The erection of a telephone line connecting Mount Mercer, Grenville, Durham Lead, and Hardie's H ill with Buninyong, is now almost completed, and it is expected the line will be open for business before the end of this month. The residents of the districts named have subscribed the money, and, under supervision, built the line by contract work at a cost of about £130. flects credit on the contractors, especially as the Postal Department's estimate for the same work was over £480. By doing the work without the aid of the Government the residents have saved about £350. It will be admitted that that is a very important statement, and it should lead -honourable members to decide whether they can permit a public Department to be run in such a way and to make estimates of that kind. The big saving which was possible when the people took the matter into their own hands seems tome to reflect to some extent upon the motion submitted this afternoon by the honorable member for Darwin for the establishment of a State-owned line of steamers. I submit a further case, thefacts in connection with which I can vouch for, as it is in my own constituency. I quote the following letter to myself, dated Dear Sir, Referring to your letter of the 11th instant handed to me by Councillor Speirs for reply. The Department was asked to construct a linefrom Heathcote to Toolleen, but declined doing so, as the cost would be too great. Their estimate for a tree and fence line, in which I bake it they intended to use few if any poles, was £320 2s. od. We then entered into an agreement with the Department to erect the line by private subscription, and successfully built the line-the exact cost being jfiSo 19s. 8d. The line is one 15 miles in length, and in its construction we used 331 poles, as follows :-sin . 15-feet. 79 iS-feet, and 33 25-feet. The work was all done by contract. I am quite well aware that the fact that certain districts have been able to secure telephone lines at so very much less than the Government estimate of cost may detract from the value of my motion, but I point out that the regulations under which this is managed are very complex. The matter is dealt with under regulation No. 18 of the Public Telephone Regulations. Honourable members are aware that in many country districts it is very difficult to find persons who will take the lead in matters which require some personal responsibility and involve the payment of money. Where such men can be found, these things are possible of accomplishment, but in districts that are not so fortunately circumstanced, and where there is no real leader among the people, it is found exceedingly difficult to grapple with the Department, and. to know exactly how the residents stand. The result in most cases is that the line asked for is not built. The people acThe line is splendidly built, and it recept the departmental estimate; they find that it involves more than they are prepared to pay, and they do not get thenline. As so much of our prosperity depends on the work of our country people, it should be our policy to give them every facility we can. I have therefore suggested in my motion that tenders should be called for the work in every district where the people desire that that should be done. They could understand a plain specification, and it would become a mat-ter of business for some person to put in -a tender. while to do so if he saw an opportunity of making a few pounds out of the work. -should ask that all the work should be -done by coutract. to the length of asking that all this work should be done by contract if that is the desire of honourable members. -that course were followed, the result would be to bring into existence a number of contractors with the necessary plant and equipment. They could follow up the work, and be prepared to put in prices lower than those for which such work can be doue in a haphazard and .spasmodic way by an occasional contractor. I want to show that regulation No. 18, to which I have referred, is somewhat complex. Clause2 readsThe persons constructing and maintaining the line shall nominate and submit to the Postmaster General the names of one or two persons as the trustees for the line, to represent them, and to receive on their account the amounts payable by the Postmaster-General, as hereinafter provided, for the use. of the line for public purposes. That involves personal responsibility, and I say again that it is not easy to get in dividuals to accept a personal responsibilit y for the benefit of all and sundry. That is why I object to the present system. The Postmaster-General may at any lime take question of the day-labour as opposed to possession of the line, paying to the owners thereof such compensation as is agreed upon. That is a provision which must impress the rjersons interested in any particular line with the idea that they cannot know where they are. a loss, the people concerned are required to keep it , but if it results in a profit, the Postmaster-General takes it over. a representative of New South Wales the motion, and wish to bring under the stated in this chamber that the telephonic notice of tlie Minister representing the extensions in that State' were eighteen Postmaster-General a few matters, w it h a months in arrears. almost a chronic condition in Victoria and get anything in the nature of telephonic in other States. It indicates that the construction work carried out in the counDepartment is becoming water-logged. try districts. Whilsti t can easily control a large numline proposed w it h which I am very conber of contractors, difficulty is experienced versant-as was also my predecessorin controlling an army of men engaged in running from Colac to the Carlyle River carrying out telephonic construction under the day-labour system. A good deal of trouble is encountered in transferring bands of men from one district where a line has been erected to another district It would be worth a man's where a line has to be constructed. The whole thing bristles w i th difficulty, and I assert, without fear of contradiction, that if the telephonic construction work required throughout the Commonwealth were undertaken by private contractors, I am prepared to go the public would get that work done for considerably less than it costs now, that it would be completed at a very much If earlier period, that the workmanship would be up to the Government standard, and that an advantage would result all round. The Department would be relieved of the responsibility of looking after individual men, and the public would benefit by getting telephonic communication at a very much less cost. I could point to a number of instances which have come under my notice in which savings have been effected by the people doing this class of work themselves. I am pleased to know that the Postmaster General is entirely in favour of the contract system not carry it out? I know that one of the most difficult things to overcome in any Department is the red-tapism which pervades it , and which was not broken down by the honourable member for Darwin, or by any other Clause6 readsmember of the late Administration. The the contract system is one of policy, and I would like this House to affirm what the policy of the Postal Department should be. I do not intend to occupy the time of honourable members any further. The proposition is a self-evident one, and the facts which I have adduced can be easily verified.

Thus there would be no carting to be done, though there might be a little scrub which would require to be cleared. hand from the Deputy Postmaster-General, dated December, 1911, shows that the Department is f u l l y informed as to the reasons why this line is required. Yeti t is impossible to get anything from it beyond a bald assurance that inquiry w ill be made. As a matter of fact, I do not get even an acknowledgement to numerous letters which I write to the Department. This projected line, which would traverse a distance of about 20 miles, according to the departmental estimate, would cost £318 13s. 9d. In the case of another line which the residents were permitted to erect for a distance of 7 miles, the cost was £ 1 4 0 . The poles of that line carry nine wires, and on the same basis the line from Colac to Carlyle River, which would carry a single wire, could be constructed for less than £200 . however, will not permit of that singlewire line being erected under contract. They will not allow the residents interested to erect it themselves. A consider° tion of my constituency. separated by some distance from a railway station, and are engaged in carrying on the cheese industry. their representations, the Department has estimated that the revenue from the line would be insufficient to make it a paying proposition within eight years. It affirms that, before the line can be erected, these persons must contribute a sum of £ 2 0 0. Surely they should be given an opportunity to construct the line under contract. The undertaking, I believe, could be carried out for about £ 1 5 0 , and there would be no loss of revenue whatever. On the contrary, the revenue would increase at an enormous rate. I wish now to refer to a regulation which provides that if people wish to put a wire along departmental poles, they must pay a rental of 10s. per mile per annum for the privilege. I need scarcely point out that, in the case of a man living in a township where there is a telephone exchange, the Department erects the poles and wires for hint. mile per annum if he is more than 2 be made applicable to country residents. miles distant from an exchange. ment will construct the line for him for a distance of 2 miles, whereas it extracts' from the resident i u the country a rental of 10s. per mile per annum. Only the. A letter which I hold in my other day certain individuals interviewed the Postmaster-General, and offered toerect the j>oles required by the Department for a distance of about 30 miles. They then inquired what would be their position if they wanted to attach wiresto those poles. Notwithstanding that they had practically carried out the work of erecting the line, they were told that they would have to pay a rental of 10s. per mile per annum for the right to use t h e i r own poles. I advised them to put up their own poles, and to have nothing to do with the Department at all. That is the condition of affairs which obtains in the country to-day. The Department w ill take over only lines which are paying. I hope that we shall effect some alteration in these regulations.

Further, many lines which have been erected are in such a condition owing to the anxiety of the settlers in years gone-by to obtain telephonic communication, that the Department will not take them over. Honourable members who represent city constituencies do .not appear to realize that country residents are suffering a grave injustice at the hands of the Postal Department. There is no doubt that telephonic facilities are more necessary in rural areas than they are in the cities. In my opinion, the telephonic service should be such as to permit of the rapid despatch of the people's business.

We know that, in the past, it has been very difficult to obtain the material necessary for telephone extensions. In my opinion, past Governments have done very well with the machinery that they had at hand, and I trust that this Government will also do all that it can to extend telephone communication into the country, j l y doing so, it will greatly assist settlement, inducing persons to live in the country who now remain in the towns. The honourable member for Gippsland is right in saying that telephones are needed in the country to get people to live there. The extension of telephone communication, and the increasing use of motor-cars, w ill revolutionize country conditions. honourable member for Barrier, when Postmaster-General, did everything he could for the convenience of country districts. We should indeed be proud of what has been done. If Australia makes as much progress in tlie next six years as she has <lone in the past six years, she will do remarkably well. In my district, in no case has a guarantee had to be called up, all the lines that have been made' having proved profitable. There is, -of course, a good deal of red-tape in departmental methods, but you w ill find that all over the world, and I think that you can hardly get r i d of it . When application is made for a telephone line, the first thing that the Department does is to ask, "" W h a t will it pay?"" I agree with the honourable member for . Echuca that it would be a good tiling to call for tenders locally for the construction of lines, because local people can always get material more cheaply, and do work more cheaply, than can the Department. But the work done should be always done under official supervision, to secure something like uniformity.' I am sure the Postmaster-General keenly desires the development of Australia, and w ill put no obstacle in the way of telephone extensions. brought a deputation before him, he said, ' ' If you think that the departmental estimate is too high, submit an estimate of your own in proper terms. Do not say that the work can be done for so-and-so, but write to me, setting down exactly is no doubt that there is congestion of what you would construct it for. If you do that, you may depend that you will get all the help I can give you. If you offer to do the work, I promise to give you I the best material and supervision."" There could not be a fairer promise than that. I feel confident that the Postmaster General w ill do a great deal for the development of Australia by extending telephone lines, and if he does as well as his predecessors, he w ill do very well indeed. In Australia we have great difficulty in -getting the material that we need. For years past we have not been able to get letter-boxes made fast enough. Our country is progressing so fast that it is almost impossible to. keep pace with its requirements, especially in the matter of telegraphs and telephones. Estimates are made to-day which, six months later, are found to be quite insufficient. The Postmaster-General has a tough job The ahead of him, and I hope it will always be a tough job, because it is in the interests of Australia that this great progress should occur. It was pleasing to hear the honourable member for Maranoa speaking of what has been done in regard to telephones in his electorate. I recollect when one could go miles and miles in that country without the slightest means of communication. The honourable member has been energetic, but he will never get all he requires, because his district will still be progressing, and, in addition to the hundreds of miles already connected, hundreds and hundreds of miles of country will need to be linked up. The honourable member has pointed out how many lives have been saved by the extension of telephones. I know that in my district, since we have had telephones extended to outlying districts, there has been a great change in regard to people going out to live in the country; and I venture to say there is not one man in this House who will vote against extending telephonic communication still wider and wider all over Australia. I know that every Postmaster-General from whom I have sought information in connection with this matter has done his level best The other day, when I with the material and money available, and the Miuisters controlling the Postal Department deserve our very best thanks in this regard. work in regard to telephone extensions.",32,Lines Countr Y This Connexion And I Suggest That I N

232,Mr Poynton (Grey) [5.16],"Ther eWe cannot altogether blame the Department for it ; the officers have done remarkably well i u the circumstances; bu t the trouble is that it is impossible to lay down a hard-and-fast rule to apply all over Australia. In the first place, the material must be found by the Government for these telephone services; but I think the Department could well make a concession on the rate, which would make the difference between a paying concern and one which they will nob undertake to build. The charge is now 10 per cent, on the cost of construction; but it is a monstrous charge. moved' in the House to t r y to reduce this rate. much out of any motion that has been moved so far. reflect on the Government. matter with silent contempt. might facilitate the construction of work they have already agreed to undertake.

The Department receive any amount of applications for them, b u t they have no stock of letter-boxes ou hand. The same thing applies to wire for telephones. They wait unti l the last moment before they order the material, b u t I maintain that large quantites of letter-boxes, telephone wire, and other telephone equipment, should be kept in store. There is a great deal to be said in favour of allowing the people in districts to do their own particular work, and I lar trunk lines are necessary, a substantial line quite up to date must be erected, but there are scores of plac«s where a line that would not now be approved by the Department would serve ail the purposes required. The Department have a stereotyped specification for wire they require, b u t that standard is ouly needed for t r u n k lines. I am anxious to know the result of a telephone service recently constructed in my district. While the Departmentwere considering the matter of whether it would be a paying concern or not, the people took the matter into their own hands, and had the line p u t up in about twenty-four hours, and I am told that this line has passed the in Some time ago I spection, and that the work was done well. No doubt, a little more latitude should be given to the Deputy PostmastersW e have not got Generali n the different States. If they were allowed to accept oilers in the localities where work is required it could be I do not intend to done more expeditiously. A t the same time 1 agree with the honourable member for Barker that the figures relating to the telephone mileage erected during the last ten years are amazing. There was absolutely nothing done previously. There are 400 miles of coast-line in my electorate, and ten years ago there were only two places along tliat coast from which telegrams could be despatched; there was COOK -Only two years! no telephone service at a l l ; but to-day there is hardly ten miles between the spots where one can get into telephonic communication with other districts. An y f a u lt is where where the number of the population is reasonable a service has been provided. There were no telephoues in the middle north of South Australia ten years ago, b u t now there is hardly a place that is not connected. The difficulty is in Ihe outlyY e t these lettering districts, when the Department require the. stereotyped standard of 10 per cent, ou the cost of construction, and applicants get the stereotyped replies that the work cannot be done, as the revenue w ill not meet the expenditure.

Where Mr Poynton,"I have no sympathyby the States, we have had great difficulty in getting telephone services. have no doubt great improvement could be made in getting the work done more cheaply, and with greater expedition. The officers of the Department in South Australia have their hands' absolutely f u l l in carrying out works, and the alternative is to increase the permanent staff, or to allow a lot of this work to be done by people outside the Department, the Government supplying the necessary material. all they can to be up to date in connection with the extension of telephones.

In the event of t h is amendmen t being agreed to , the m o t i o n w ill r e a d That in order to cheapen the cost of country telephone lines tenders should be invited for their construction in all districts where practicable, and that the district concerned should be given the advantage of any saving upon the Departmental estimate thus secured.

The honourable member for Echuca, in submitting his motion, quoted three cases to show conclusively that an enormous saving would be effected to the Department by the adoption of the contract system. Doing work by contract will get over the I trust the Government w ill do difficulty of the block that has existed for a long time, because of the fact that the Department have not had the gangs of men to overcome it . Another cause for delay in connection with many of these works has been pointed out by the honourable member for Grey. He spoke of the Department not having sufficient stock in hand, and he referred particularly to letter-boxes. A letter-box pays for its cost in three years, and is a most profitable t h in g ; but, despite this, applications for letter-boxes are not fulfilled for twelve or eighteen months, and even two years. The reply to applications is that the Department have no stock, and that the boxes cannot be supplied until the end of the year. them manufactured. get them manufactured. I have been told by the Department that they have subThey say in Queensland mitted so many orders, and that they have had them supplied in accordance with the number ordered; but the trouble is that, while they have submitted a certain number of orders, in the meantime applications have been received for two or three times the number. not anticipate what will be required in the future. to letter-boxes, the Department admit that they have applications that it w ill take them twelve months to f u l f i l , but they admit that they have not submitted orders for the boxes that have been applied for. It is the same in regard to telephones. They say they have not the wire, and when a question is asked as to whether the wire is ordered, it is found The reason why I suggest that it has not been ordered.

I know how these additional costs are incurred. I brought under the notice of the Postmaster-General a case on the Marnoo line, where six or eight men were doing the work of one man. Sometimes they were at work, and sometimes they were not. TheM in ister, after making inquiries, I believe, had these men dismissed. Naturally those who had to provide the money to pay the men growled at the way at which the work was being carried out. I do not believe all that I hear, but the case to which I refer gives us an illustration of what ocurs under the "" man-on-thejob "" policy. is establishing civilization in the backber mean that it will leave us up againis& blocks, is being made to pay for the in the minimum wage ?

I hope that the motion, as amended, will receive the As to his complaint unanimous support of the House, and that it will be carried to-night. This question has been so f u l l y discussed that I should not have risen to speak but that I prefer the motion in its original form. . It seems to me that those who A continuous telephone ask for a line should be best able to judge whether it ought to be constructed under tender conditions or otherwise. If the In the case of Department is to determine whether or not it is practicable to invite tenders for such works, people in country districts will still be in the hands of the departmental officers in this regard. I wish to see telephonic cannot judge a matter of that kind, it ought to be wiped out. circumstances of which the Department Under such a system, cannot always have f u l l knowledge. I had not been a member of this House very long when I received from all parts of As a matter of fact, it took my electorate requests for new telephone lines, whilst old propositions were resuscitated. Upon examining the figures relating to specific lines, I found that certain localities were up against the reguIt lations, and that the estimated cost was altogether out of proportion to what, i h my opinion, was a reasonable amount to allow for the building of those lines. I pointed out to the Postmaster-GeneralA n d probably they were that the figures in certain cases were altogether unreasonable. I saw the Chief Electrician, Mr Hesketh, in regard to two or three specific cases, and I am pleased to say that Mr Hesketh and his chief of staff in Victoria are both common-sense, practical men. I found that they had been endeavouring for some time to put forward the desirableness of having lines constructed upon what are called "" . l i g h t l in e"" principles, and I think that many honourable members have but themselves to blame for the fact that their districts have not obtained quicker aud cheaper telephone construction. The motion, as it stands, will leave us up against the conditions that obtain to-day as far as the regulations are concerned.",38,Lines Countr Y This Connexion And I Suggest That I N

Why not give any particular locality the benefit of local timber, which is being utilized today in fencing and in the erection of buildings? Why should not the local timber be used in such cases, instead of 20-ft. and 26-ft. poles being taken at much cost from a forest 200 or 300 miles away ? Let us revise the whole of the regulations relating to the construction of country telephone lines. The motion, as it stands, only covers in part the case that we have to meet. I would ask the mover of the motion to embrace within its terms a direction that the whole question of country telephone construction sliould be revised. I agree with the honourable member for Darwin that we want business propositions and local handling. We should adopt the system of transmitting responsibility to the Deputy Postmasters-General, and from them to local postmasters. bined with the adoption of the contract system, should secure for us cheaper telephone construction. should prefer to support the motion in its original form. If more requests are made for the construction o.f telephone lines than can be complied with, each district should be given a fair show. I mention that, because in my electorate we have wanted a new post-office in one town for the last ten or eleven years. Recently, the man who owned the building previously occupied as a post-office gave the Department notice to quit. They did not go out when they should, although the landlord had a hotel licensee ready to come in, and when .they ultimately did go out at a day's notice, the post-office business has to be carried on in a little wooden building, which is entirely unfitted for the purpose. No site has been purchased for a new post-office in the town, and there is no money on the Estimates for the purpose, although the authorities must be aware that the district is a progressive one, and is deserving of attention. I mention this because one honourable member has told us that during the last three years fourteen post-offices in his electorate had been brought up to date. He said, further, that he had had 248 miles of new telegraph lines constructed in his electorate in 1911, and 587 miles in 1912, 172 miles of telephone lines in 1911, and 274 miles in 1912, and that altogether he had had expended in his electorate, during the three years, over £37,000. Chanter? been, I should not be getting three or tour letters every day on the subject. The honourable member who gave this information is the honourable member for Gwydir, as .honourable members will see if they refer to Hansard, page 769. the result of the. honourable member's efforts on the Postal Commission. in reading from a debate of this. session, what the honourable member said wasAdding together post offices ^8,344 14s. 6d., telegraphs ,£9,293, and telephones ^19,572, we have a total of £37,229 14s. 6d. spent on postal works in the electorate of Gwydir. Local propositions, comIn view of the huge increase in Post Office expenditure, I say that every electorate should be given a look in. There are many reasons why the construction of telephone lines costs a good deal of money. I do not favour what might be called a "" poddy "" line. Many lines are being constructed in my district, which is progressing from a pastoral to an agricultural district, and they will require to carry more wires than can be put on one of these stumpy lines. I am in favour of compliance with the departmental regulations as to the poles to be erected. MI . ORCHARD -What height of pole does the honourable member suggest? height-1 2 feet. I hope that the ScotchAmerican, who the honourable member for Darwin suggests should be brought from Chicago is a practical man, and will do a number of practical things which should have been done long ago. In the district in which I live it has been the practice for the last twenty-three years, and I do not know how much longer, for a man to go out once a year and chop down a few suckers in one particular place underneath the telegraph lines.

288,Mr Falkiner,"The regulationfor all time. may be objected to is that of putting up poles of the local colonial pine in a green state. A man gets a contract for. repairing a line, and puts up pine poles when they are green, with the result that in a few years they rot. An y one possessing practical knowledge of the matter knows that if seasoned timber, and especially seasoned pine, is used, the poles will last for a generation. Again, where poles are used of a certain height, it has been a common practice, in repairing a line, to put up an iron pole about 3 feet shorter. If the iron pole is high enough, the old wooden pole for which it has been substituted would do very well again if the rotten part in the ground were cut off. In progressive districts that are changing from pastoral to agricultural, the Department should endeavour to anticipate the requirements of the people. A few years ago a post-office was built in my electorate, and it was hardly up before the outside wall was pulled down and the building enlarged. The Department makes no provision for the future , and I say they should anticipate the probable requirements of progressive districts. hope that, if it is decided to make the departure proposed and call for tenders for the construction of telephone lines, the Department will see that decent wages are paid to those who are engaged in the work. say that. called for , it must be the duty of the Post and Telegraph Department to see that the ruling rates of wages are paid for the work done under the contracts. of the conditions of the specification. his sons are prepared to do this work in their slack time ? and his sons will stick to their farming, and will give men ordinarily engaged in this kind of work a chance to live. feel confident that the present Postmaster General will see that no hardship is done to the men engaged in this work under contract. members, to see as many telephone lines as possible constructed, but I am not so anxious that they should be constructed as cheaply as possible. Another practice which system is to be adopted, proper specifications must be drawn up, and if the work is to be done in the cheapest possible way the specifications will not be very strict. a reasonable price. above all things. If we are to have lines erected too cheaply, and must then employ an army of men in keeping them in repair, they will be found to be very expensive in the long r u n . The Post and Telegraph Department might have done more in this direction, but what has been done under the Department has been done substantially. We must demand stability if we are to spend the taxpayers' money in paying contractors to do this work. single wire is to be carried the posts stipulated for are altogether too big. forgets that where a single wire is sufficient for a l l purposes now, five or six wires may be required in a few years' time, and the Department must look ahead. member talks like a city man, and does not understand the conditions in the country districts. have as much experience in the matter as a man whose business it is to l if t ink out of a bottle with a pen.

I wished to' know whether the delay was due to a shortage of staff, and, if so, whether the Postmaster-General would not see the advisability of increasing the staff, in order to avoid delay in the construction of lines within the Nepean and other country districts. following answer to the question I put on the subject: The Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, has furnished the following information :No public telephone lines authorized by this Department in the Nepean electorate are being delayed through shortage of staff. There were a few telephone subscribers' lines in that electorate delayed through shortage of material, but they are now in hand. I can assure honourable members that no more misleading answer could have been given. Deputy Postmaster-Generali n Sydney, as I believe there is no more conscientious officer, but the information supplied to him by his subordinates was certainly misleading, because, in every instance where the*construction of a telephone line or telephone cabinet has been approved, the approval has been accompanied with a stereotyped footnote to the effect that the work cannot be undertaken for some time owing to the amount of work already in hand. members must have received the same kind of answers as those which I have received.

Later on, dealing with tlie same subject, the honourable member for Parramatta saidIt is a mistaken policy to repeal such an Act in view of the future history of the Empire in relation to Naval Defence. How can we insure any protection unless we take steps to protect our trade? If ever there was a reproductive work, the building of a navy adequate to protect Australia is, in its very essence, a reproductive enterprise. I do not hesitate to say that the flotation of a Naval Loan would have been a good thing for Australia in many ways. l i e gave other reasons, but they are all on the same line. He was against the repeal of the Naval LoanA c t , because he thought we could not finance the affairs of the country without resorting to borrowing.

Prime Minister to keep up a running commentary on the speech of the honourable member for Wide Bay. There is a habit growing in this Chamber this session, and it is assuming very serious dimensions. When an honourable member is speaking, it is a frequent occurrence that another honourable member who thinks he has a reply endeavours to get in that reply straight away by interjection. It is impossible to carry on a debate in that way. The Standing Orders provide for any reply to be made by way of a speech, and I hope that during this debate honourable members will remember that their predecessors and themselves, the present Government propose in this Budget to expend a certain amount out of loan moneys for defence purposes other than that I have already indicated of a permanent nature. I believe it is absolutely false financing in times of peace,especially in times of abounding prosperity in regard to finance, to pay anything for defence purposes out of loan moneys. We heard during the elections ihat the Fisher Government had been revtlling in We revenue; that they did not know what to do with it ; but the revenue of the present Government is as high as was ours. They calculate it for the current year as practically the same, and they propose to spend the £2,650,000 we left them, as well as the £3,080,000 they seek to borrow. And notwithstanding all their in All transferred propercome from revenue, they propose to expend loan moneys for defence purposes. They have introduced a bad system. It will be an evil day for this country if , It was a new obduring times of peace and prosperous years, it pledges its credit, and, in times of difficulty and trouble, when there is fighting to be done and destruction takes place, it has to fall back on loan resources, when, perhaps, its credit is exhausted. If anything shows shrewdness or foresight in the management of a country, it is when its people conserve their energies in good times and in times of peace, so that their credit may be good when adversity arises, and they can protect themselves in that way.

It is quite true that from time to time he has said that it was his own idea, and it is quite true that he has said that lie would have treated the matter very differently; but I may remind him that the same principle was brought into existence in 1893 in Queensland, and worked well through all the years until the time the Commonwealth took it over. vided for a gold basis of not less than 25 per cent., with a working basis practically up to 33 per cent., and we cannot find a responsible man in Queensland who believed that this basis was not absolutely sufficient as a gold margin. There are some people, of course, who will not go from home for any idea u n t il it suits their own political convictions. I notice that we are promised, in the Governor General's Speech, an amendment of the Australian NotesA c t for some particular purpose. I presume it is to restore the old provision entered into when the Act was first passed. If so, I shall not be able to support it , and I hope the majority of honourable members w ill not support it . It is quite unnecessary. It is proposed to bring the amount held in gold back to 25 per cent, up to £7,000,000 , and pound for pound after that. member introduced it . Treasurer is going to further increase tlie present money stringency, because that other money is available for investment. The Treasurer also failed to point out that there is a provision in the Australian NotesA c t by which the whole of the earnings from the investments are capitalized, and re-invested, and their in terest is re-invested again compoundly, so that within a very short period the reserve will be, as I think, ridiculously high, and a great loss wil l ensue to the The people know better people of Australia. The earnings from I wish to go back to say a word the Australian Notes Account amount to £210,000 annually. That is nearly a The right honourable gentlequarter of a million pounds of annual in terest which the Treasurer w ill get, and still he proposes to keep down every pound above £7,000,000 an excessive amount. Victoria is a gold State. Somehow its people prefer gold, but the I am not complaining people in the more widely scattered places are far more t r u s t f u l , and have far more confidence i u their own country than have the people in the big communities. Is there a man on the Ministerial side who will say that the credit of the Commonwealth is not ample and sumcient with a not less than 25 per cent, gold backing for tlie Australian notes? The question has often beeu asked, "" W h a t would you do if there was a rush for a million or two?"" We should simply pay it , and by the time they carted it away they would The Queensland law probe glad to cart it back again. I do not believe the people of Australia would ever create any panic against the Commonwealth. They have too much sense, and I believe the Government are doing this niore to save their faces than because of their honest convictions on the question. The other Trust Funds speak for themselves. They are part of'the accumulated surplus of the previous Government, and other useful funds belonging to various trusts that have been established by this Parliament. The accusation of the Treasurer that I , during my term as Treasurer, invested too much of these funds, is unwarranted. If he had been in office, he evidently would not have placed the money at interest, but would have allowed it to remain un-interest bearing. Instead of it earning over £338,000, he apparently would have been quite content to leave it with other institutions earning nothing. sumption. member complain? dates. member like any dates shorter than a few months?

There is another point to be considered. One wonders whether the Government, which is so much attached to a State-rights' policy, consulted tlie States in this matter. There is no evidence that the Government did. I believe that three State Premiers have said that they -heard nothing of the proposal. In my opinion, the better plan would have been to consult the States and all parties in the Commonwealth. I am convinced by the manner in which the proposal has been brought in that it is a placard evidencing a very laudable desire on the part of the Treasurer to deal with the matter again during his term of office. I congratulate him upon the attainment of an ambition, which, I think, has been long and very honorably held, to settle this question. In this Parliament other members have proposed schemes for dealing with the question, and I am bound to say bhat all had their origin in what I consider the most business-like proposition made by Mr Robert Harper, the late member for Mernda. I have always said that from my point of view his was the most sensible scheme. The other schemes were hybrid attempts to deal with the question, founded on his facts and ideas. I believe that this is not the way to deal with the matter. I think it will be ruinous to the Commonwealth, and not good for the States, to leave the States absolutely free to borrow as they think fit. T/his settlement of the question them. He can take over the State debts will not establish one borrower, because there will be seven borrowers, each with an obligation of its own. The idea in consolidating the State debts has been to have one borrower with a council composed of men drawn from the States and the Commonwealth, who, even if they could not agree on all principles, would be able to agree tjhat two loans should not be put on the London market together, that there should be no competition where it could be avoided. A council of that sort would have done good work. A t the same time, I believe that the better plan would have been for the Commonwealth to pass legistaking over the whole responsibility of the State indebtedness now, and the whole behalf. By that means, I venture to say, there would have been established a Commonwealth stock which would have commanded a better credit than any State stocks, and would at the same time have saved money to the community. MrW . H . IRVINE -That is the object which we all want to attain. The only question is as to the means. means now proposed are not good. The consideration of the question has been precipitated in a wrong way. I think it is not doing the States much credit to say that they should be brought into an arrangement without the slightest consultation with them. that. made by MrW a t t , Mr Barnes, and, I think, Mr Cann.

He can take over on behalf of the Commonwealth, if the Parliament w ill allow h i m , the whole of the responsibility for the State debts without consulting the States, but the States can go on in the same old way, and the last stage will .be worse than the first. That is what the right honourable gentleman is proposing, owing to what I call a little personal ambition. It is not like him in many respects.

We did all this, aud yet left a deficit of only £450,000. ber's Government got a surplus of about £600,000 from us when they came into office on that occasion. right honourable member talks about this deficit of ours, he always omits to tell the country that his Government increased ib by the end of that year to £1,100,000. Our deficit of £450,000 for a whole year was increased by our successors by £650,000 in six months. That is a fact which the right honourable gentleman never puts before the country. He increased the deficit at the . rabe of £1,300,000 a year. member omits to tell the country is that we concluded the year with a financial surplus. owing to the arrangement is attempting to mislead. member for Adelaide reminded me of my duty last night, and I know that I have but to recall the fact to him to secure his assistance to-night in maintaining order. they had a surplus on the year's transactions, for the simple reason that -we had made an arrangement with the States, which gave them that year an extra revenue of £3,000,000. Who would not.have had a surplus in those circumstances? They could not spend the money, try as they might, and, therefore, they had a surplus. -this extra revenue was coming in, the honourable member's party went for a loan .of £3,500,000. member does not know what he is talking about. He is speaking of something -that occurred long before the time to which I am referring. The complaint -made up and down the country by the Xeader of the Opposition is that, with .£3,000,000 extra revenue coming from 'this one source alone, we did not impose iresli taxation to liquidate a paltry deficit -of £450,000. But is it fair to say that -we left them a deficit at all? I wonder -what honourable member, if an arrangelment had been made to increase his income for the year by £3,000,000, at the same time that he owed £450,000, would think he was in debt at all ? That was exactly the position in this instance, and it would have been criminal on our part to attempt to liquidate the deficit in any other way than by leaving it to be squared by the extra £3,000,000 which was coming immediately from the States. The right honourable gentleman, not satisfied with taking all this money from the States, in order to liquidate the deficit of £1,100,000 at the end of the year, ante-dated by six months the expiration of the operation of the Braddon section, so as to lake from the States money with which to pay these debts. able member's proposal. kind. kind. agree with that statement? The honourable ment was a different one altogether. half of that year the honourable member for Wide Bay, as Treasurer, only returned to the States, I think, about 2s. per head of their population. A t all events, by ante-dating the expiration of the Braddon section, he took the money from the States to liquidate this precious debt of his. ment made by the Deakin-Cook Government, which the people rejected jected only as to one point. I have put the position plainly, and shown how thislittle deficit is to be accounted for. We made an arrangement with the States which gave our successors £14,000,000 extra revenue for the next few years, but because we did not raise extra taxation to liquidate the deficit of £450,000 we have had all this denunciation on the part of the Leader of the Opposition from every platform in the Commonwealth. A Government which leaves a deficit of £450,000 to be paid off, but makes an arrangement for £14,000,000 of extra revenue to go into the Exchequer makes, I think, very good financial provision indeed.

That is a perfectly true statement to make, and it should not have caused all this pother in the mind of the right honourable gentleman.

628,Mr Roberts,"The division is on rethe popularity of old-age pensions, the Fusionists assert that they created a deficit to provide for the payment of the pensions, and they claim that we are to be satisfied because they made a provision with tihe States that would bring in £3,000,000 of revenue to the Commonwealth in the succeeding year. Was that provision made with the States to bring in £3,000.000 for 1910-11 because the money was not wanted ? Was' it made merely for the f u n of the thing, so that there should be that amount of surplus in the Commonwealth revenue? Or was it made because the Ministers of the day knew that the money would be required ? Necessarily, they knew it would be required. The then Fusion Ministry had, in conjunction with the State Governments, in a secret Caucus-no t one word of the proceedings of which has ever been allowed to transpire to the publi<5-com e to a particular arrangement by which the Braddon section should be practically annulled, and that in future, instead of paying back to the States three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue, the Commonwealth should pay back to them only 25s. per head of the population That meant, of course, that the Commonwealth revenue would be largely increased; and, believing, as they did then, that they would remain in office, they had some object in increasing the revenue becaase they intended to expend it. Fortunately, the people ejected them from office, and the Labour Administration came in . All they did was to meet the expenditure then necessary to provide for the ordinary obligations of the Commonwealth out of the revenue that they were then receiving. Where is the reason for objection, for cavilling, for complaining? Where is the reason for the talk indulged in about our colossal expenditure? vision, so they say, with the money coming in , for the obligations of the Combeen made, and would not have been made monwealth to be met in an honourable and proper way, and the money was expended by the Labour Government in such a way that, in this House, at any rate, not one fault could be found. During the whole of the three years, there is on record scarcely a division of any description called for by the party opposite against any item of expenditure. They approved of the expenditure in each year. approved, practically, of every penny that was expended; and yet, during every election, and subsequently, the Prime Minister, and others of his side, have been going up and down the country asserting that a colossal expenditure was indulged in , and insinuating that there was something radically wrong with the finances. on the platform, such a nice, lucid statement as you have now made in the House, to show how the Liberal party had made provision in advance for your Government getting those extra millions to expend? best to make it clear to them and what it meant, and to show them that we should have more money to spend in the Commonwealth. The result was shown at the elections, because the people, knowing that there would be so many millions more to spend, put the right party in to spend them. This shows that the people thoroughly understood the question. We took serious exception to the secrecy of the Caucus; and, while we had no objection to the 25s. per head being paid back to the States, we seriously objected to putting that in the Constitution, and the people took the same view. I see no reason for the Prime Minister's loud denunciations of our expenditure, when he now admits that he made the arrangement by which the money was obtained. He made it because it was essential that the money should be expended. It was not expended in any direction of which he could complain, for , during the three years, there is not on record one serious objection to our expenditure. The diatribes indulged in at the elections, and the in sinuations about something of a character which could not be very well explained, but which would necessitate very grave Those gentlemen made procaution on the part of the people, were unjustified. They ought never to have had party politics in a certain direction been more clean, clear, and upright. The Prime Minister tried to deal with what we proposed to do in a particular year, and actually asserted that, at the end of the year, there was a deficit of £1,100,000. Note the curious cunning of that statement, which leaves in the minds of the public an altogether erroneous impresThey sion.

Their statements led the public to believe that some sort of economy was to be practised; that tlie ' finances were going to be straightened because, of the allegation that they were not straight. Now that they have complete control, and can do just as they like, have they proposed to cut down the expenditure in any direction? Is there one item on which they propose to do that? Not one. They have increased the total expenditure. They propose to expend £27,200,000 this year.

658,Mr Roberts,"Will they blame meyesterday, they brought forward a proposal to commit the Commonwealth to the expenditure of another £400,000 to which it was not committed by the previous A d ministration-a n expenditure which they said, only on the 12th August, in the Senate, they would not undertake. The interval between that date and the 10th October has provided ample time for honourable gentlemen opposite to change their minds, and now they propose to commit the country to that additional expenditure. In the Estimates there are other lines with which we shall deal when they come before us in detail, showing clearly that these commitments have not been made by a previous Government, but are undertaken by the present Government of their own volition. But, quite apart from that, they do propose an expenditure to which they are not committed, and in which there is no necessity for them to indulge, if it be not their policy. Why have they not the courage to tell the public that it is their policy, that they intend to spend the money, and that all their statements to the electors during the recent campaign in respect to "" torrential "" and other expenditure were false, misleading, and unjustifiable, and ought never to have been made? That would be an open, upright, and honourable course, but apparently it is not to be taken. The Prime Minister said that we took over the Cockatoo Island Dock; so we did. He is careful not to say that he disagrees with that act. I challenge him now to say that he does not approve of the policy. a dishonourable thing to do after promising this Parliament that you would consult it first. tleman does not dare say that he disagrees with the policy. He dare not say that the amount agreed to be paid for bhat property is one penny too high. He will throw gibes at us about old boilers, since he thinks that such statements will remain in the minds of some of bhe people, and he is prepared bo talk about obsolete machinery, although he knows that he is misrepresenting the position in doing so, because the condition of all the machinery was taken into account in determining the amount to be paid. These statements about old boilers, however, will remain in some minds, just as when you strike a man ou the point he will remember it . The Prime Minister is a pastmaster in the art of making insinuations that will remain in the public mind, and serve to overcloud the real issue. The true issue in bhis case is whether he disagrees with the taking over of the Cockaboo Island Dock. The Prime Minister dare not say that he disagrees with it , and he dare not say thab we promised to pay for the property a penny more than ought to be paid for it . Those, after all, are the two chief factors to be considered, rather than the question of whether any one boiler in use at bhe dock is ben years or twenby yeirs old. The Prime Minisber, however, prsfers bo deal wibh comparatively trifling items, knowing that he can in that way mislead some of the public. The Cockatoo Island Dock was taken over in conformity with our naval policy, which, I am afraid, is now in very bad hands from a t r u ly Australian point of view. The dock was taken over at a valuation made by independent and competent men. The individual members of the late Ministry had nothing whabever to do with the matter, and had the dock been taken over whilst honourable members opposite were in office, there is no doubt bhab the valuation would have been made by these self-same gentlemen, against whose honour and inbegriby there is not even a breath of suspicion. Ib was necessary to take it over, and we took it over because we were a Ministry of action rather than a Minisbry of mere promises or misrepresenbabion. We believed honestly and conscientiously in the establishment of an Australian Navy which should form an integral part of the Imperial Navy should the necessity arise for their working togebher. I fear, however, thab bhab policy is nob to be pursued. There are indications of a regrettable characber which point to that conclusion. Returning bo bhe quesbion of commibments, I would remind bhe Commibbee that while the Government propose to expend money on the Naval Bases at Cockburn Sound and Westernport, bhey are nob committed to that expenditure. The Prime Minister will not say that they are. He knows that these works need nob be carried on by bhem if they are not in accordance with their policy. As a matter of fact, for some peculiar reason the presenb Governmenb have stopped the expenditure on the Naval Base at Cockburn Sound. This proves conclusively that so far as the works there are concerned,",65,Budget
659,Mr Joseph Cook,I say that it was,66,Budget
660,Mr Roberts,"The honourable gentheir statement about being committed to them is false and inaccurate. Here may I point out that we are told that they have stopped the expenditure at Cockburn Sound because they wish first of all to obtain the opinion of an expert as to what should be done there. It seems. singular that this expert is to report upon the proposed Naval Base at Cockburn Sound, and also at Westernport, b ut that, whereas the works at Cockburn Sound have been discontinued, those at Westernport are still being carried on. Sir vernment only began the expenditure at Cockburn Sound just about election time. accurate. The work was undertaken at the earliest possible moment, and the few men engaged there could have had no effect upon the elections. more than 180 men employed there. ber for Fremantle, who naturally takes an interest in this question, has had the Ministry quite recently on the horns of a dilemma. They cannot explain why they have stopped the works at Cockburn Sound, whilst at the same time they are continuing operations at Westernport. They Cannot explain why the expert who is coming out is not to be allowed a free hand in the case of tlie Westernport Naval Base, just as he is to have a free hand in regard to the Naval Base at Cockburn Sound. Isi t that the Ministry dare not stop the works at Westernport? member wish them to be stopped? sire that the works at Cockburn Sound shall be stopped. Sir member knows nothing about the matter. fore long that the right honourable member knows a little too much about it . Sir deal more than any one else in this House knows about Cockburn Sound. able member be careful, for there is an instance in the State records of his having stopped expenditure in a particular direction because it did not please him, notwithstanding that an expert of undoubted knowledge and ability had reported in a certain direction. Perhapsi n the circumstances we can appreciate more f u l l y now the statement of the PrimeM in ister that the expert is coming out to do what they "" want him to do."" They say that they will be guided by his report. If they are to be guided by his report as to the suitability of Cockburn Sound for a Naval Base, why should they not be guided by his report regarding Westernport ? We shall deal with this matter, more lengthily, however, when the items come before us. statement. JOHN FORREST -The Fisher Gomatter now if the right honourable member will cease grumbling. He invariably grumbles when these matters are brought forward. I note his mental attitude in respect of Cockburn Sound, and intend to watch it very carefully. I have referred to this matter only to show that, so far as the Naval Base at Cockburn Sound is concerned, we have not committed the present Government to any expenditure, as shown by the fact that they have actually stopped the expenditure there. We shall find that the position is the same in regard to scores of other items-that if the Government disapprove of them, they need not indulge in the particular expenditure relating to them, but they are going to do so, and I fear that they may land us in financial chaos unless the devout wish of the Prime Minister that Providence will be as good to them as He was to the previous Administration is realized. I do not know whether Providence differentiates be'tweeu Administrations, but certainly the revenue does not seem to be coming in as rapidly as it came in last year. I sincerely hope, however, that the revenue will continue to come in freely, and that the Government will not be embarrassed as long as they remain in office. I trust that we sliall always be able to JOHN FORREST -The honourable meet the just and ever-increasing obligations of the Commonwealth.

669,Mr Roberts,"I shall deal with thecome before us. side may not have much effect on honourable gentlemen opposite; but we shall at least be able to place the position clearly before the community. I say that when the first Fisher Administration l e ft office they l e f t a surplus of £650,000 . The Fusion Government then held office for eleven months, and l e f t a deficit of £450,000, and in each of the three succeeding years during which the second Fisher Administration remained in office there was a surplus, and when they l e ft office three and a half months ago they left a surplus amounting to £2,652,000 . Further, I say that, at the beginning of the financial year 1912-13, when it is said that the then Treasurer proposed to spend more than he received, it must be remembered that he proposed to spend the surplus he had himself accumulated. Owing to the promise at the outset of a lean year, in order that there might be continuit y of construction of the Navy, and the other defence proposals, and continuit y of expenditure upon telegraphs, telephones, and post-offices, it was reasonable that the Government should spend the surplus they had accumulated. That is what they proposed to do. that the statement was frequently made during the elections that the late Government paid for the Fleet as well as leaving a surplus. over £3,000,000 . £1,000,00 0 on the Estimates this year for the Fleet. pend, during a year which at the outset promised to be lean, the surplus we had accumulated during the good years. Fortunately, tlie revenue came in in sufficient volume to obviate the necessity of spending the surplus, and we left it in tlie Treasury for the present Government. We did not, as alleged by the Prime Minister, spend every penny we could get our hands upon. statement of the Prime Minister. has said that during the elections statements were made to the effect that the Fleet was paid for.

It was not my intention to speak at all to-night, and I should not have done so but for the extraordinary statement made by the Prime Minister. The honourable gentleman has, happily, failed once again in the attempt he made. When the State debts proposal comes before us I hope to be permitted to say a few words on what appears to be an attempt to gamble on the increase in the population. The Government's scheme, if put into force, is calculated to financially embarrass the Commonwealth, as, even at the outset, it proposes to gamble on the increase in the population.

This afternoon there appeared to be some misunderstanding as to a question which I desired to ask regarding the small-pox outbreak in Sydney. had no desire to infringe any standing order, though you, Mr Speaker, ruled that I must not ask the question. subject on which I wish for information is of great importance, and the flippancy with which I was treated by the Minister is not creditable to him in the high office that he holds. mation quarantining Sydney was first issued, I told him that the course which he was taking was unnecessary, and I still hold that opinion, as do the citizens of Sydney. him this afternoon was an expression of opinion as fo whether there are not more persons in Sydney now suffering from the effects of vaccination than there have been victims of small-pox quarantined at North Head, and whether there have not been more deaths from vaccination than from the epidemic? Minister whether those well qualified to give an opinion have not stated that there is no need for the quarantining of Sydney, and that there is no likelihood of the epidemic spreading. know from him whether that opinion had not been expressed by the Board of Health of New South Wales. Replying to the honourable member for Gwydir, the honourable gentleman said that the matter was entirely in the hands of the Board. The Board, however, has expressed the opinion that there is no need for the further quarantining of Sydney, and that it is quite prepared to take the responsibility of recommending the removal of the quarantine without fear of bad results.' newspapers stood by the. Minister, defending his action in quarantining Sydney.

We have the statement of the honourable member for Brisbane, of all others, that he is here for the purpose of exposing what he says are the enormities of the Liberal Government. These enormities consist in sending out the ordinary notices. There has been no change made of any kind. no change made at all.
