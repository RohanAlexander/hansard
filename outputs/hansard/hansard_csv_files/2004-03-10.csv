This is one of the most critical issues facing all Australians, and there can be little doubt that improved work and family policies will also halt the decline in our birth rate. Yesterday I was delighted to read the report in the Daily Telegraph concerning a very family friendly workplace in my electorate of Lowe, and I am very proud to bring it to the attention of the parliament. The report, which was by Matthew Denholm, in part, read: A radical change in attitude to the needs of women teachers has saved a school from a mass staff exodus. Santa Sabina College, at Strathfield, was being stripped of experienced staff who could not find adequate child care. “They felt compelled to give up work because of inadequate childcare arrangements for their children,” principal Sister Judith Lawson said yesterday. In a bid to reverse the “flow of resignations” she began offering work-based child care and jobsharing for teachers-the only school in NSW to do both. It worked. Five years on, 18 teachers job share and 19 teachers have children in child care. Yesterday I spoke with the Principal of Santa Sabina College and congratulated her and her staff on her achievement. Sister Judith told me that five years ago Santa Sabina College established a 40-place long day care centre, Mary Bailey House, within the college grounds for babies six weeks old to children five years old. Nineteen staff of Santa Sabina College have at least one child at the centre, which is also a community based centre. The centre has gone through a process of accreditation by the Department of Community Services for a second time, with top ratings in each of the 10 categories of accreditation. A recent study of the centre which was undertaken by Macquarie University has also reported very positive feedback. I salute Sister Judith on this wonderful family friendly initiative to provide work based child care and job sharing for her staff. Clearly, Sister Judith and her staff’s long day care centre has led to the retention of staff and good teachers, which can only be very beneficial for the students of Santa Sabina. In the hectic life that parents lead today, Santa Sabina College has shown us all that it is possible to create a family friendly work environment. Well done to Sister Judith Lawson and Santa Sabina College, Strathfield. I am very proud of you and very pleased to bring your remarkable achievement to the attention of the parliament today. I trust that other schools will follow your shining example. Veterans: Vietnam proportion being Vietnam veterans, and I am honoured to represent them.

270,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (9.43 A.m.),"In my electorate we have many veterans, with a largecontribution forgotten or ignored when they returned home. But, as with Australians everywhere, they knew that they had to get on with the job at hand and find comfort where they could. And sometimes we forget that the Vietnam War was the longest war that Australia was involved in and that over 500 young Australians gave their lives in that conflict. One of those Australians who served his country in Vietnam is my constituent Ned Falconer, who, with the help of his wife, has now published a small book of poems called The Funny Side of Nam. Some were written in Vietnam and some were written after his return home. They show how, even in a hard place, mankind will always look at the funny side of life to get through the day. I would like to share with the House some of Ned Falconer’s poetry. The first one takes us through a helicopter flight and it is called Clean Greens. It states: They picked us up from OP’s one day in this bloody clapped out chopper We thought, “To get aboard this bloody thing, we’ve got to be off our rocker”. We thought, “Keep the foot on the pedal mate, don’t let the motor stop, ‘cause the way it was coughing and spluttering, it was only running on one pot”. Well he lifted off and away we went, and he pulled back on the stick. We headed for those two bloody trees and thought, “My God, we’re going to hit”. These two big trees were coming up fast so he turned it on its side. Thank Christ the other guys grabbed my pack, ‘cause by then I’d started to slide. Now we knew our government was lousy, and sometimes downright mean. But we thought they’d dig down in their pockets and give us a decent machine. Well, the government spent some dough that day, and I don’t mean Government grants. There were seven guys in that chopper mate, and we all needed a set of clean pants. Then he recorded one of his contacts with the local population. But it is perhaps his short opening verse which tells a story we should all take heed of: You give us light to show the way But we still stumble thru darkness each day. You give us love for one another But still we fight, brother against brother. There are many other thought-provoking and humorous contributions in the book, and I recommend it to members. Recently we commemorated Vietnam Veterans Day, and a reading of Ned Falconer’s poems helps the rest of us to understand something that our troops went through. Thank you, MAIN COMMITTEE Ned and Di, for reminding us of the importance of Vietnam-but in a way that we can absorb that importance through humour. Well done, and may you both go from strength to strength. Chifley Electorate: HSC Results Workplace Relations: Legislation to give notice that I shall move that this House (1) passes on its congratulations to all those Chifley students who completed their HSC or equivalent in 2003; (2) recognises the outstanding performance of 92 students in the Chifley electorate who scored a band 6, a mark of 90 per cent or above, in one of more subjects; (3) notes the vast improvement in HSC completion rates in results in the Chifley electorate in 2003; and (4) conveys its best wishes to all those Chifley students who are sitting for the HSC in 2004. Without doubt, I am inordinately proud of the results of those 92 students and I am also proud of all the students in Chifley who bettered their best. We certainly have many more hundreds of students who sat for the HSC and bettered their best. I also wish to make a few remarks about Joel Exner. You might recall, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, that he was the 16-year-old from Doonside who fell to his death at a construction site at Eastern Creek on 15 October 2003. I congratulate his family and friends on assiduously collecting 4,000 signatures on petitions regarding strengthening occupational health and safety laws to prevent such tragic deaths. I also want to place on the Hansard record and draw the attention of all members to my sincere belief that we need to utilise existing federal legislation as well as some of the instrumentalities involved so that we can get national laws in each state and territory to prevent the tragic death of someone like Joel Exner. It is an utter tragedy that such a young life should be lost. To give meaning to that loss, I believe it is incumbent upon us as legislators to do all that we can to ensure that there will no further such deaths-no more 16-year-olds on building sites or in factories who lose their lives because of the absence of appropriate health and occupational safeguards. I certainly hope that, if we are fortunate enough to win the next federal election, we would so move. (Time expired) Middle East: Israeli-Palestinian Conflict Israel at the invitation of the Australia-Israel Jewish Affairs Council. I arrived in Tel Aviv on Monday, 23 February and had the opportunity to spend the following six days going through Israel looking at various sites, particularly an issue of some international controversy-that is, the security fence around the nation state of Israel. At the outset, I would like to thank Dr Colin Rubenstein from the Australia-Israel Jewish Affairs Council, Ms Orna Sagiv, the charge d’ affaires of the Embassy of Israel, as well as the member for Melbourne Ports, Mr Michael Danby, MP, for the role that they played in making this a very successful, very informative and highly educational opportunity for the delegation to learn more about the state of Israel and some of the conflicts that it faces with its neighbours.

272,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff) (9.48 A.m.),"I had the great fortune some weeks ago to travel toIt would be remiss of me not to comment on my observations after having had the opportunity to spend six days in Israel. In particular, it was almost uncanny that on the day that we arrived in Tel Aviv two events occurred. One was during the night as we were flying to Israel. There was another horrific terrorist attack on the nation state of Israel-a bus bomb that killed seven Israelis as well as injuring scores of others. On the day that we arrived, as I was in my hotel room getting prepared for the day, I turned on CNN to watch coverage of what was the first day of trials in the International Court of Justice regarding Israel’s security fence. After having spent six days in Israel, I came away with the following conclusions: one cannot travel to the nation state of Israel without feeling the burden that rests on one’s shoulders out of fear for one’s personal safety. It may be more pronounced for those not born in Israel, but most certainly the air is thick with apprehension. Another observation is one of fatigue-the fatigue that obviously exists not only with Israelis but also with Palestinians; the fatigue that has arisen as a consequence of three years of intifada launched by the Palestinians against the Israelis, which has seen nearly 1,000 Israelis, mostly civilians, killed. All in all, the Israeli security fence, from my observations in the six days I was there, is a most necessary element. Whilst there may be some discussion about the actual path it takeswhether or not it follows the green line-unless you have the opportunity to travel to Israel and witness first hand some of those instances where the security fence deviates from the green line, you cannot possibly be in a position to accurately judge the reasoning for it. Agriculture: Dairy Industry my electoral district about some serious issues which their industry is confronting over the milk price. At the moment, at the farm gate the milk price is around 24c a litre. If you, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, and I go down to the supermarket we pay about $1.60 a litre. There is a massive disparity, probably one of the largest in Australian industry, between what consumers are paying for milk per litre and what farmers are getting paid for it. This creates an enormous problem for the dairy industry. The different groups of dairy farmers that I have been speaking to on this issue are telling me that it is putting their future plans for their farms at risk. They have no certainty in relation to the milk price that they might get next year or the year after. This makes it very hard for them to plan their investments, improve productivity on their farms and take out loans with some certainty of being able to meet the repayments. I say to the parliament today that these people I have met with in the industry are right: there is something crook in the dairy industry. There is something very wrong when we have a situation in this country where dairy farmers are only able to choose between four or five different dairy companies, who all offer them almost exactly the same price. If you go to Murray Goulburn, the milk price is 24c. If you go to Burra Foods, it is 24c. If you go to United Dairy Power, it is 24c. If you go to Pauls, it is 24c. There is something crook in the dairy industry when people are charging more than $1.60 per litre of milk and ordinary farmers-who are the ones who work hard in their daily lives, who make the investment and who take the riskare only getting 24c a litre. If we want to be serious about this industry, we have to give these people some certainty and we have to recognise how hard their work is. We must recognise that we need to put in place a principle of reward for effort in the dairy industry, like we do in all other industries.

273,Mr Zahra (Mcmillan) (9.51 A.m.),"I have met with several groups of dairy farmers insubstantially less. This is an appalling market signal. There is something crook in the dairy industry and we need to take it seriously in the federal parliament. The call from this group of farmers and other groups of farmers around the country for a proper inquiry into what is going on in the dairy industry, addressing some of these market power issues, is appropriate. I support their call for this inquiry. We should have a proper inquiry, instigated by the Commonwealth parliament, to address this serious issue. Education: Funding Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (9.55 a.m.)-We have heard a lot lately about the alleged underfunding of state schools compared with Catholic and independent schools. In my electorate of Petrie we have plenty of proof that this is another Labor Party myth. We have proof that the federal government is generously funding schools which are in fact being short-changed to a shameful degree by the Labor state government. If the federal opposition wanted to see real short-changing of state schools, it could take a look at what state Labor is doing in Queensland. TodayI was able to advise the North Lakes College, a brand-new state school in one of the fastest-growing parts of my electorate, that it received $2.5 million for new facilities under 2003 federal education funding. This $2.5 million will build three new learning areas, a new teacher-student amenities area, a carpark and a sports oval. These facilities are vital for the school, which is now serving a new community that is estimated to grow to 25,000 people in the next few years. The college was only opened in January 2002-and do you know what one of their first tasks was, soon after opening? They had to write to me, a federal member, asking for a letter of support and begging for playground equipment. That is how well the state Labor government has funded this brand-new school in a growing suburb. A Labor government could not spend a few measly thousand dollars on playground equipment. No wonder the principal was so excited when I spoke to her earlier today and advised her that the federal government had awarded them $2.5 million in major building funds. What is really frightening is that what is happening at North Lakes is not happening just there. It is not an isolated case. In recent weeks I have received three requests for funding from state schools short-changed by Labor’s state education authority. Another school approached me to fund some ramps for disabled children to get to the toilets. They had been turned down by state Labor for this and were told that disabled children would simply have to make do with the classroom which had been in use for 15 years and was still a demountable. That is the reality of the underfunding of state schools where I come from-and it is a Labor government that is doing it. By contrast, over the period 2001-04, the Australian government will provide around $25.2 billion in direct funding to more state schools like North Lakes College. So before anyone swallows Labor’s myth that state schools are being deprived under a federal coalition government, they should take a look at the reality of schools like North Lakes College getting massive funding from the federal government to make up the shortfall from the state Labor government. The figures do not lie. While 2.25 million students of state schools get $19.9 billion in public funding, 1.04 million Catholic and independent school students get $6.2 billion. State schools like North Lakes College, which are the responsibility of the state government, are reliant on the generosity of the federal government to fund playgrounds and disabled toilet access. They are not getting that funding from state Labor. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE der 275A, the time for members’ statements has concluded. Cognate bill: BILL 2003 Second Reading Debate resumed from 4 March, on motion by Mr Slipper: That this bill be now read a second time. Legislation Amendment (Application of International Trade Modernisation and Other Measures) Bill 2003 and the cognate bill at an earlier sitting, and it is very good that I am able to continue now, because I want to move on to some of the other elements of this legislation. Anyone following this debate will recall that I spoke last time at some length about the impact of the various steps in firearms legislation that the Commonwealth government has undertaken and the impact of that in the wider community. This legislation does have some ramifications in relation to the importation of firearms. That is quite significant and I covered it at some depth in the earlier discussion. However, there are other elements to this bill, and I think one of the major things we must look at is the improvement that it provides to the handling and processing of cargo, particularly through our wharves, modernising the processes so that we gain some advantages from it. Once again, this is in line with a series of initiatives that the Commonwealth has undertaken to improve the flow of cargo through our wharves. I would like to draw members’ attention-I know it has been done before but I want to do it again here-to the improvement under this coalition government in the crane rates for the various ports. I sought from the office of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations information on the improvement in crane rates following the earlier reforms of the waterfront made by the government. In 1998 in the March quarter, crane rates for the port of Brisbane, which is the one that is closest to my home town of Ipswich, were 21.6 lifts per hour-the crane lifting 21.6 times in an hour. In 2003 in the June quarter, crane rates for Brisbane were 26.7 lifts per hour. That is a significant improvement, in the region of a 25 per cent increase. In Sydney over the same period, crane rates have gone from 22.5 to 27.2 lifts per hour-once again, an increase of about 25 per cent. And in Melbourne crane rates have gone from 24.3 to 27.8 lifts per hour-once again, a significant improvement in the number of crane lifts per hour. I looked also at total container movements in those ports for the June quarter 2003 compared to June 2001. I am not picking one or the other here; the reason I am saying June 2001 is that prior to 2001 there was no measurement that counted containers. It was purely a measurement of tonnage. Over the shorter period, between June 2001 and June 2003-two yearstotal container movements in Brisbane improved from 84,854 to 92,872; in Sydney, from 152,650 to 194,177; and in Melbourne, from 174,149 to 240,028. I think that is case closed as far as the contribution that this government has made to improve those movements. MAIN COMMITTEE",159,Statements By Members

275,Mr Cameron Thompson (Blair) (9.58 A.m.),"I began my remarks on the Customsquestion? any reduction in container costs for importers and exporters; andcreases: a reduction in costs for importers and exporters? bourne Ports. I think it is not only about improvements to be gained in the cost per container but also about businesses not having their product delayed on the wharves. This is something that has always dogged trade through those ports, and being able to improve that is also significant. I am sorry I cannot answer the member’s question specifically, but I think on the face of it those increases that I have noted do show that there is a solid improvement to businesses’ ability to progress their cargo through those ports without delay. I was about to discuss the fact that we will have continued improvements under this legislation that is being put forward. We have seen increased burdens placed on Customs processes because of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in New York. The world over we are seeing the need for stronger and stronger border controls to be implemented. Part of the absolute requirements is that Customs’ scrutiny of cargo be done in the most efficient manner possible. What is happening at the moment is that we are transiting from an existing system to a much more improved system. This legislation puts in place transitional arrangements that enable Customs and the importers and traders in cargo to finalise arrangements under the old system and that provide methods with which to transit to the other system. This will mean that there will be no uncertainty there. It is important when it comes to supporting trade that we do not leave areas of uncertainty and that we continue to progress and to move towards a more robust customs process while we endeavour also to make it more accessible for business in Australia. This is an omnibus bill. It affects a range of different legislation: the Customs Act 1901, the Customs Legislation Amendment and Repeal (International Trade Modernisation) Act 2001, the Customs Legislation Amendment Act (No. 1) 2002, the Import Processing Charges Amendment and Repeal Act 2002 and the Migration Act 1958. I am pleased to note that we will continue to progress towards this more effective system of customs monitoring. I would like to highlight that improvements in this regard will continue to provide benefits to the Australian economy over the forthcoming period. I hope that this government is able to continue to provide advances of the nature that I outlined earlier. The improvement in the crane rates has been significant, but if we can support business by making our customs system work more effectively then that also will provide a benefit all around.

283,Mr Prosser (Forrest) (10.07 A.m.),"The Customs Legislation Amendment (Applicationvarious Customs related statutes: the Customs Act 1901, the Customs Legislation Amendment and Repeal (International Trade Modernisation) Act 2001, the Customs Legislation Amendment Act (No. 1) 2002, the Import Processing Charges Amendment and Repeal Act 2002 and the Migration Act 1958. This bill has several purposes in terms of implementing and dealing with the operations of these acts. The bill has no central theme. However, a significant part of the bill deals with the transitional arrangements that will occur during the ongoing program of international trade modernisation in Customs and the transition between the current Australian Customs Service electronic reporting systems and the new Integrated Cargo System. The overall aim is to create an integrated system to replace the several computer programs now in use. This platform is referred to as the cargo management re-engineering project. This bill clarifies aspects of the major reform associated with new electronic communications arrangements aimed at facilitating the program of international trade modernisation in Customs and the Integrated Cargo System which this parliament has examined on several occasions since 2000. The mandatory electronic reporting requirements of cargo movements and the demands of the modern competitive trade environment have created a significant challenge in terms of information technology systems required by Customs. A significant amount of time has been necessary to focus on the system’s sophisticated functionality. It has ultimately been designed to process and collect some $6 billion annually. The current legislation provides for no overlap in the operation of the two systems and assumes the transition occurs immediately upon turning off the previous systems. Consultation with industry has identified that the nature of the import business requires that there be a period of time for finalisation of import transactions commenced in the legacy system, as well as early access to the integrated cargo system, to allow compliance with reporting requirements. These amendments will ensure that importers can continue to operate during the transition without undue administrative burden or interruption to the flow of international trade. The cargo management re-engineering project is being implemented in three stages. The first stage connected the new integrated cargo computer system, which handles risk assessment and reporting of imported and exported cargo, to the smaller number of express carriers. This stage served as a pilot to test some electronic reporting functions because of the large volumes of cargo and the limited number of express carriers. The first stage was successfully implemented in April 2003. The second stage is to implement cargo integrated system export functions across the industry. Release of the Integrated Cargo System export software was due to be completed by 1 December 2003 but was delayed until early this year. Because the testing of components by the industry was delayed from May until August 2003, Customs will not cut over from the existing system until later this year. The final stage of the cargo management re-engineering project is the implementation of Integrated Cargo System import functions. According to press reports, both industry and Customs agree that the import cargo declaration software is the most complex piece of the new system. This may be because there are many more categories of imports, they come from MAIN COMMITTEE more sources than our exports and there will be more users of the import software. Testing of the imports system by industry will commence in the first half of this year. The statutory cut-off date for the completion of the cargo management re-engineering project has already been extended to July 2005. The act currently sets out the computer systems that must be used to communicate with the Australian Customs Service. There are several systems specified. The international trade modernisation reforms, including those covered by the Customs Legislation Amendment and Repeal (International Trade Modernisation) Act 2001, will see the specific legislative references to computer systems replaced by notices in the Gazette. The act also contains transitional provisions that need to be modified, including the replacement of provisions relating to the arrival of ships and aircraft and to cargo reporting. The transitional provisions need to take into account that there is a period when the unamended Customs Act will apply and when new provisions dealing with imports under the Customs Act, as amended by the Customs Legislation Amendment and Repeal (International Trade Modernisation) Act 2001, will commence. Broadly stated, there is an overlap during which both computer systems will have to be used leading up to the turn-off time of the current computer systems. The bill also contains amendments which will deal with cargo reporting requirements. These amendments include allowing timing requirements in respect of outward manifests to be amended by regulation, and removing the requirement to pay a cargo report process charge in respect of in-transit cargo reports. The requirement to provide in-transit cargo reports was introduced by the Border Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2002, but it has always been the government’s intention that there should be no financial impost on industry because of the new reporting requirements. Division2 of part VI of the Customs Act 1901 deals with the notification and clearance of goods for exporters. At present the provisions allow certain wharves used for bulk loading, such as the export of grain, to be exempted from the more detailed notification requirements. Some of these bulk-loading wharves are now expanding their operations to handle non-bulk exports. Item 14 will allow the exemption to be more specific-for example, on the basis of the nature of goods exported, such as bulk grain, rather than the bulk loading facility itself. Schedule1 deals with international trade modernisation import amendments and contains provisions relating to self-assessed clearance declarations and document retention and a number of minor amendments to the provisions of the Customs Act that will be inserted or amended by the Customs Legislation Amendment and Repeal (International Trade Modernisation) Act 2001. Information contained in the self-assessed clearance declaration enables the goods to be assessed by Customs and Quarantine for compliance with prohibitions and restrictions, and collection of duties and taxes where required. These amendments will provide certainty as to how electronic communications are processed and how the release of goods is communicated to the owner. Section 68 of the Customs Act 1901 imposes an obligation to enter for customs purposes goods that are imported or intended to be imported that are on board a ship or aircraft that has commenced its journey to Australia-including, where applicable, the importation of a ship or aircraft itself. The requirement does not apply to personal items of the passengers or crew, containers, low-value items or certain goods that are exempted by regulations. However, secMAIN COMMITTEE tion 71 of the Customs Act 1901 enables Customs to require the owners of such excluded goods to provide information. Where necessary, Customs may refuse entry of goods or, alternatively, authorise the entry, subject to any duty that is payable. This is the self-assessed clearance declaration procedure. This legislation also contains amendments to enhance Customs’ border controls. The first deals with a provision that will allow the minister to order the detention of certain imported goods that are subject to Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 where the minister considers that it is in the public interest to do so. The second set of amendments relate to maritime provisions to amend the definition of a commander in relation to Commonwealth ships and aircraft, under the provision that allows ships to be detained, to make it clear that those ships can travel on the high seas to reach the place where they have been taken. Amending the definition of ‘commander’ will ensure vessels being used by Customs officers have the authority to detain and escort other vessels. Under the Border Protection (Validation and Enforcement Powers) Act 2001, amendments were made to Customs legislation to the effect that a commander of a vessel in the service of the Commonwealth was defined to include a commissioned officer of the Australian Defence Force. This definition is being expanded by items 18 and 19 to include ‘the most senior officer of Customs’. This recognises that Customs officers may also be on a state water police vessel or a chartered civilian vessel, rather than on an official defence vessel or an Australian Customs vessel, and the Customs officer may need to make a request to board or, if necessary, chase another vessel. Item 35 makes the same type of amendment in relation to the Migration Act 1958. Items 20 and 36, in relation to the Migration Act 1958, clarify that moving a detained vessel may require travel by that ship across the high seas to an Australian port for the purpose of an inquiry before a competent authority. These provisions are consistent with paragraph 7 of article 111 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The proposed amendment to the Customs Act expands the definition of arrival in respect of ships and aircraft and clarifies where an officer may impound goods without the need for a seizure warrant. This does not increase Customs seizure powers; rather, it clarifies an ambiguity in the Customs Act. Schedule2 caters for other amendments, wherein items 1 and 3 amend existing provisions to broaden their application. The effect of item 1 is to specify that a vessel has arrived when it is in port, rather than being limited, as at present, to when it has docked and unloaded passengers and/or cargo. Item3 corrects a legislative amendment made in 2002. The correction will include the nonmovement of aircraft until the removal of cargo destined for that port of call has transpired. This bill also clarifies the calculation of customs duty on alcoholic beverages. Division1 of part VIII of the Customs Act 1901 deals with the computation of duties. Division 1A deals with rules of origin of goods in respect of which a preference applies. Item 17 will insert a new division 1AA after the existing division 1 to remedy a technical problem in calculating duty by reference to the percentage alcoholic content of the import. The problem arose when some cans of alcoholic beverage were imported and labelled as containing five per cent alcohol by volume, but the technical measure of the fluid in the can turned out to be 4.8 per cent. Proposed new sections 153AA to 153AD provide rules on how to calculate the rate of duty that should apply. These amendments are therefore necessary to clarify any ambiguity under MAIN COMMITTEE the legislation. Finally, the bill contains three technical amendments that correct references to the goods and services tax, luxury car tax and wine tax legislation within the international trade modernisation legislation. To demonstrate the increased complexity of the task facing the Australian Customs Service over time, I have researched the dollar value of imports over the periods 1988-99 and 200203. During that time, Australia’s imports rose from some $47.039 billion to $115.445 billion-an increase of 145 per cent over 14 years, or an average of 6.6 per cent per annum. These figures, however, do not take account of fluctuations in the value of the Australian dollar or of other sources of changes in the prices of imports, some of which have been increased or decreased. Obviously over time, too, the composition of imports has altered with different source countries, different products and different relative weights. I am further aware that the forms processed by Customs-each form being termed an entry-are perhaps the best representation of their workload over time. In 1985-86, 1.4 million import entries were processed; in 1992-93, 2.8 million import and export entries were processed; and in 2002-03, some 3.043 million import entries were processed. All this has led to Customs coping with an increased workload which has necessitated the change of systems, especially now, considering the examination requirements for containers. The 1992-93 Customs annual report states that 735,680 containers were landed in Australia and 5,213 were examined. With new container X-ray facilities, it is expected that in the 200304 period sea cargo inspection rates will increase to around 80,000 a year, or five per cent of the total loaded import containers across the ports in which the facilities are installed. Obviously, the security stakes for Australia are now higher and examining containers is a far more complex activity than in the past. This represents an enormous task for the Australian Customs Service. Indeed, I agree with my parliamentary colleague Senator Chris Ellison, who reiterated last month to Emma Connors of the Australian Financial Review that the government’s commitment to international trade modernisation and the cargo management reengineering project is one of the largest e-business undertakings currently under way in Australia. I commend the bill to the House. Administration) (10.23 a.m.)-in reply-At the outset, on behalf of the government, I would like to thank all of those honourable members who participated in the debate on these two very important bills, which are largely technical in nature: the Customs Legislation Amendment (Application of International Trade Modernisation and Other Measures) Bill 2003 and the Import Processing Charges (Amendment and Repeal) Amendment Bill 2003. In particular, I commend the previous speaker, the member for Forrest, a former minister for customs, who perhaps knows more about this area of government activity than most other members of the House of Representatives. The two bills being debated today introduce a number of important legislative changes to further enhance and improve the movement and control of cargo across our borders and other amendments involving maritime operations. I thank the member for Barton for the opposition’s support of this legislation, although the government wishes to reject the unfair criticism that he uttered during his speech. The details of these bills have been outlined in the second reading speech and discussed in the debate in the Main Committee. The bills include legislative changes to support the AustraMAIN COMMITTEE",162,Import Processing Charges Amendment And Repeal Amendment
284,Mr Slipper (Fisher,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance andlian Customs Service’s international trade modernisation-in particular, transitional arrangements for imports as well as other measures relating to cargo-reporting requirements for the new Integrated Cargo System. International trade modernisation is a major project that will significantly improve Customs processes for managing the movement of cargo across Australia’s borders. The legislative framework for this project was initially provided through the Customs Legislation Amendment and Repeal (International Trade Modernisation) Act 2001. The dates for implementing the new Integrated Cargo System have yet to be finalised. Customs has agreed a new approach with industry and will work with key industry stakeholders to ensure there is broad agreement that the new systems are ready before insisting on a new date. This way, Customs and industry can be certain that there will be time-about three months is proposed-for full deployment between systems readiness and production usage. A similar approach is expected to be adopted for the imports release. The contingency option created by last year’s passage of the Customs Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) 2003 will ensure that there is then sufficient time for all parties to prepare for imports cut-over. Overall, the trading community has welcomed this extension of time to adapt to the new requirements for reporting cargo. This legislation also contains amendments to the Customs Act and related legislation in relation to Customs border controls. These include measures to restrict the delivery of goods where it is not in the public interest and the clarification of Customs impoundment powers, powers involving maritime operations and the transit of apprehended vessels across the high seas. The amendment to restrict the release of goods where this is considered to be in the public interest is a significant initiative to ensure that the government can more closely regulate the release into the Australian community of goods classified as prohibited imports by Customs regulations. As you would imagine, this power will not be exercised by the minister every day and will be exercised only in exceptional circumstances. I want to reassure the Main Committee that this is not a power that can be delegated by the minister but a power which must be exercised by the minister personally. The introduction of this power will give the government greater flexibility to control the entry of prohibited imports and also to respond to community concerns at any given time. When the member for Melbourne Ports, who is still in the Main Committee, spoke he claimed that the cost of imports and exports has risen. The situation is that the customs import processing charges have been changed for only two reasons since 1997. I am pleased to reassure the honourable member on this point. Those two occasions were entirely noncontroversial. Firstly, there was concern about foot-and-mouth disease and other diseases and, secondly, there were container X-ray facility charges. I do not think anybody, including the member for Melbourne Ports, would object to that. I am happy to point out to him that any concerns that he had are misplaced and that he can be quite happy with the bill and the government’s performance in this area. Mr Danby interjectingsaid earlier, that the opposition does support the bills, and we welcome this. He did, however, claim that he was worried about what he perceived as being the government’s ongoing mismanagement of the CMR project and the negative impact on border security. The member for Barton went on to claim that he was concerned that industry had not been consulted and was MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Import Processing Charges Amendment And Repeal Amendment
285,Mr Slipper,"I thank the honourable member. The member for Barton mentioned, as Ibearing an additional financial burden. Just as I reassured the member for Melbourne Ports, I am also happy to reassure the honourable member for Barton. The arrangements for CMR implementation are the result of a long period of consultation with the stakeholders, including industry. Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, as you would know, this government does take great pride in consulting with stakeholders, and this has certainly occurred with respect to the two bills currently before the Main Committee. Also, contrary to claims made by the honourable member for Barton, these bills will allow for a continuing collaborative approach with industry, and this is the best way to facilitate a legitimate import trade and protect our borders effectively from day one. So this is the approach of the government. I believe it is a meaningful and appropriate approach in all of the circumstances. This legislation also makes amendments to the Customs Act to rectify anomalies or inconsistencies, to allow regulations to be made exempting specified communications from record retention obligations, to address tribunal decisions about the operation of the act and to address unintended consequences imposed by other legislative amendments. In summarising, this is important legislation that supports the activities of the Australian Customs Service in regulating the movement and control of cargo whilst also clarifying and enhancing border controls. On this basis, I am pleased to commend both bills to the chamber. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment.

Drug Agency Amendment Bill 2004, which outlines a number of changes to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990. Labor supports these amendments on the basis that the changes outlined are essential in enabling the Australian Sports Drug Agency to comply with provisions necessary to fully implement the World Anti-Doping Code. Labor is fully committed to the fight against doping in sport and to the adoption and implementation of the World Anti-Doping Code. On a number of occasions in the past, Labor has raised concerns regarding the gross inconsistencies of current national and international doping policies. One of our major concerns has been that, up until now, each sporting organiMAIN COMMITTEE",167,Import Processing Charges Amendment And Repeal Amendment
286,Mr Tanner (Melbourne) (10.32 A.m.),"Labor supports in principle the Australian Sportssation had developed their own lists of prohibited substances and infraction bans. This resulted in significant variations in antidoping guidelines not only between sports but also within some sports at the national versus international level. Variations in prohibited substances lists and discrepancies and infraction bans being applied across sports for similar doping offences were issues that were largely overlooked up until 1988. It finally took the uncovering of a major doping scandal during the 1988 Tour de France to highlight these inconsistencies as major problems in the fight against doping in sport at both the national and international level. In response to these concerns, the World Conference on Doping in Sport was held in 1999. The outcome of this conference was the creation of the World Anti-Doping Agency, an independent international body that was charged with the duty of developing and implementing a standardised set of antidoping rules across all sports and all countries. Subsequently, the World Anti-Doping Code was developed by WADA to provide a framework for standardising antidoping policies, rules and regulations within sporting organisations and among public authorities. The main purposes of the World Anti-Doping Code which was approved at the Copenhagen World Conference on Doping in Sport in 2003 were: To protect the Athlete’s fundamental right to participate in doping-free sport and thus promote health, fairness and equality for Athletes worldwide; and To ensure harmonised, coordinated and effective anti-doping programs at the international and the national level with regard to detection, deterrence and prevention of doping. The adoption of the WADA code would provide the opportunity to eliminate many of the discrepancies that were constantly arising as a result of inconsistent doping policies across sporting organisations. Knowing the importance of enforcing greater consistency across sports, Labor called on the Howard government to commit to the WADA code. In a move that was applauded by the federal Labor Party, Australia became one of the first countries to sign up in support of the WADA code at the Copenhagen conference in 2003. With the acceptance of the WADA code came the requirement to accept a number of conditions for adoption of the code. These requirements included that the government sign a declaration of acceptance in which they state that they recognise and support WADA and the antidoping code and that they will implement the code in their legislation and other regulations before the 2006 Winter Olympics. The IOC, international sports federations, national Olympic committees and national antidoping organisations among others must sign an acceptance of the approval of the code and implement the code in their rules and regulations before the start of the 2004 Olympics in Athens. National antidoping organisations are the entities designated by each country as possessing the primary authority and responsibility to, amongst other things, adopt and implement antidoping rules. As an identified national antidoping organisation, the Australian Sports Drug Agency therefore is required to make some changes to the current governing act in order to provide the relevant powers and functions required to adopt and implement the WADA code. The amendments outlined in the bill make the changes that are required. While Labor supports the ASDA Amendment Bill before us today, a number of specific areas of concern have been raised. In particular, these concerns relate to the impacts that the new WADA code infraction notification requirements could potentially have on an individual’s privacy. Under current guidelines, disclosures of an infraction to the relevant sporting MAIN COMMITTEE administration body are permitted after both A and B samples have been tested and returned positive and the competitor has the opportunity of making a written submission to the ASDA. Under the new WADA code, disclosure is required immediately upon the A sample revealing a positive test result and the ASDA being satisfied that there is no therapeutic approval and that the relevant international standard for testing has been complied with. This represents a substantial dilution of the protection afforded to competitors who are under suspicion but whose status has yet to be determined through B sample testing and hearing processes. Under new WADA code guidelines there is also the requirement to make a public disclosure of information relating to entries on a register-in effect, to release the name of an athlete who tests positive. While this is not a concern in a case where an athlete is guilty of a doping offence, there is some concern that relaxing a number of current protective measures may increase the potential to name an innocent party. Should this situation arise, the avenues available for clearing an athlete’s name are limited. In particular, the probability of removing the public stigma that comes with being named a drug cheat is very small. Labor has been advised that these concerns relate to ASDA regulations which are currently under review. Labor has advocated that these regulations must provide a stringent set of guidelines to take every measure to ensure that the risks of this situation arising are minimal. Labor will continue to closely monitor the progress of this review to ensure that these issues are appropriately addressed. In the meantime, Labor supports the bill before the chamber today. Amendment Bill 2004 is to allow the Australian Sports Drug Agency, ASDA, to comply with the World Anti-Doping Code. It is important to have these changes in place before the Olympic Games to be held in Athens this year. In the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games the world saw the first confirmed evidence of doping entering the sporting arena. When Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was stripped of his gold medal after returning a positive result in a drug test the world saw the beginning of what was to become a very controversial issue in sport. In 1987 Johnson set a world record time of 9.83 seconds and then broke it at Seoul. He lost both world records and the medal when he tested positive for an anabolic steroid. After Mr Johnson’s lifetime ban, which was handed down in 1993, doping became an issue for all professional bodies. It was decided that doping was destroying the essence of sport and the spirit of sportsmanship. Australia has enjoyed a good record of drug-free competition with few exceptions. We have been at the forefront of antidoping since it became a global issue. In fact, a number of Australian officials serve on antidoping boards within the IOC. Australia should also be at the forefront of establishing within our own legal system changes that will seek to create a better spirit of sportsmanship. The Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill 2004 does just that. As well as the aim to have the ASDA adopt the World Anti-Doping Code’s new requirements by the start of the Athens Olympic Games, the bill also aims to build upon Australia’s world-class reputation with respect to its anti-drugs in sports programs, by ensuring a timely implementation of the code. This is especially important considering Australia’s very active role in campaigning for the code and our impeccable standards and record for the disciplining and administrating of athletes caught doping. MAIN COMMITTEE",168,Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill 2004
287,Mr Baird (Cook) (10.38 A.m.),"The key purpose of the Australian Sports Drug AgencyPrior to the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000, the government launched its Tough on Drugs in Sport campaign, which detailed measures for funding antidoping research and supporting Australia’s commitment to the World Anti-Doping Agency-known as WADA. In 2001 there was a new sports policy launched by the government, Backing Australia’s Sporting AbilityA More Active Australia. This extended on the federal government’s original commitment to cracking down on drug cheats in sport. The existing legislation governing the ASDA does cover certain aspects of the new World Anti-Doping Code. However, an amendment is required in order to extend the boundaries of the current legislation to better allow for the ASDA to maintain these standards. The Australian Sports Drugs Agency is responsible for the detection of doping in Australia and is currently governed by the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990. Its primary mission is to deter the use of doping practices in sport. It aims to do this through effective education, testing and coordination of Australia’s antidoping program. It does it predominantly through educational programs. The agency also works in cooperation with other agencies and organisations, both in Australia and internationally, to improve the antidoping standards. The ASDA is required to administer drug tests to all elite sports men and women competing in Australia, often without them knowing that the test is about to occur. The World Anti-Doping Agency set out the new code last year. The WADA was formed by the International Olympic Committee after the Copenhagen conference in 1999 and is responsible for conducting unannounced doping control tests amongst professional athletes both during and out of competition. It is also responsible for the development of an antidoping code to be followed by those parties associated with the WADA, to fund scientific research into the development of new detection methods; to provide education to athletes, coaches and administrators about antidoping; and to foster the development of specific national antidoping organisations. Its funding is sourced equally by the Olympic movement and governments around the world. I am sure we would all agree that those are worthy objectives. The Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator Rod Kemp, is one of 11 members of the executive committee of WADA. This amendment bill aims to recognise a better flow of technical and operational antidoping procedures which are designed to be incorporated into each country’s antidoping program. Given the international nature of sport these days, it is important to have this interrelationship between the codes in different countries. These standards will also provide specific technical detail required for the implementation of the code. As well as the new technical and operational procedures, the bill proposes new antidoping rule violations. If certain requirements of the code are not followed, the ASDA is permitted to issue offenders with these rule violations. Examples include more stringent requirements on athletes to notify their whereabouts so they can be tested. Failure to do so will result in an antidoping rule violation. A refusal of testing or evasion or failure of a test will also result in a rule violation. Tampering at any stage in the process, be it collection, analysis in a laboratory or a hearing or appeal, will also result in a violation of the antidoping rule. The bill permits the ASDA to share and report information, which it has previously not been table to do. Australian athletes will be required to provide details of their whereabouts, so they can be tested on a regular basis. This information, including other personal details, will be permitted to be relayed to relevant bodies such as WADA, other international sports MAIN COMMITTEE federations, national sports federations within Australia, or other national antidoping agencies for the purpose of administering a regime which falls in compliance with the antidoping code. While it is important to protect the rights of competitors in these circumstances, there are also compelling reasons for the relevant agency to be able to deal with the issue quickly and effectively once it has been raised. Under appropriate conditions and circumstances, the ASDA will be permitted to publicly name athletes who have committed an antidoping rule violation after the process has been completed justly and fairly. They will also be able to publish the names of those who return negative results, which is also fair. They will be able to pass on any relevant information to the Australian Federal Police and the Customs Service in relation to criminal activities associated with the antidoping code, such as possession or trafficking of banned substances. ASDA will have the ability to notify the relevant sporting bodies of a possible positive test at the A-sample stage. This will allow an organisation to conduct its own provisional hearings and apply the necessary sanctions or action against an athlete who is subject to the ASDA result management process. As mentioned by Minister Williams on 19 February, Australia’s domestic anti-doping program has a reputation as a world leader, and we want to keep it that way. The World Anti-Doping Code and Agency, WADA, were established to protect an athlete’s fundamental right to participate in doping-free sport and promote healthy, fair and equal competition for all athletes on a worldwide basis. It ensures harmonised, coordinated and effective antidoping programs at the international level with regard to detection, deterrence and prevention of doping. The code lists a range of banned substances, from steroids to stimulants and blood-boosting hormones. Of course, there are some issues involved with the masking drugs that could hide the actual drugs being used; however, with new testing methods, most performance-enhancing drugs can be detected at an early stage and we are able to catch the drug cheats. The legislation will allow ADSA to conduct tests in line with WADA’s worldwide out of competition testing program. It encourages more testing on the part of antidoping organisations. The program adds to existing programs in ADOs by providing the world with test planning and sample collection which is completely independent of sports federation countries. WADA has formed partnership agreements with authorised collection agencies, such as the national antidoping agencies, for sample collection and with accredited laboratories for sample analysis. In 2003, WADA established or renewed agreements with 26 out of 28 summer Olympic federations and all seven winter Olympic federations. Additional agreements are in place with six other sporting federations. We would ask why the others have not signed up yet. It is important that Australian legislation allow for ASDA to confirm these regulations. In summary, this is a forward step. It allows for Australia to coordinate its own legislation with WADA’s requirements and with the IOC requirements in the lead-up to the Olympic Games. It attempts to provide an environment in which drug-free sport is possible and to undertake testing out of schedule, the timing of which is unknown to the competitor. It also ensures that the relevant agencies are brought into coordination and it effectively coordinates on a global basis the crackdown that is necessary on drugs in sport. What we want to see with our young people involved in these elite sports is an environment that not only promotes being higher, faster and stronger, which is the aim of all of the Olympics, but also recognises the integrity of those individuals who put in the hard yards-who do the work-and do not want MAIN COMMITTEE to be gazumped by the drug cheats we have seen in previous years. I think ASDA have been effective in achieving these objectives. We wish the organisation well in the lead-up to the Olympics. The Olympics will be the critical test to see how drug free the current environment is, but this piece of legislation does assist in coordinating Australia’s requirements into the international regime. ment the member for Cook and I acknowledge his very strong interest in and commitment to sport in this country and to promoting a climate in sport where drugs are not used by our athletes, particularly our elite athletes. I am pleased to speak on the Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill 2004. This will amend the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990 and has some important implications which I think members of parliament should be aware of, particularly those with an interest in sport. As the federal member for Ryan it is important for me to convey to my constituents what is happening in this very important area. All Australians have an appreciation of sport. It is very much part of our culture, and all of us would wish that our athletes, particularly at the elite level, perform without these drug and medical enhancements. Australia has a very proud sporting tradition in a great many sports, and our athletes have a great reputation for fair play and sportsmanship in the international arena. One of the biggest highlights for all Australians in recent years was hosting the Olympics in Sydney in 2000. It was a wonderful occasion for our country and a wonderful occasion for all Australians to come together and showcase for the world our enviable climate, our warm hospitality and our sporting excellence. Last year we had the Rugby World Cup, which again showcased our sporting success. More than that, these were opportunities for Australians to showcase our belief in fairness and honesty in sport, to demonstrate on the world stage what we mean by having a go and doing our best. Australians expect nothing more of their elite athletes than to do their very best and to do it without performance-enhancing drugs. We are very much a country defined by the characteristic of trying to do our best, whether we are students at the local school sports carnival or elite athletes pursuing record times and Olympic gold medals. The use of performance-enhancing drugs and therapies flies in the face of the great tradition that I just alluded to. It offends our sense of justice and honesty and very much sullies the reputation of all Australian sports men and women who perform to the best of their natural abilities. But, more than this, it also endangers the very lives of the athletes. This country has a very proud reputation as a world leader in antidoping technology and administration, and all Australians feel very strongly about the importance of this administration and this stewardship. I will comment very briefly on doping. Doping is the use of a banned substance or method to unfairly enhance sporting performance. Doping degrades the value of sport by creating an artificial performance and can seriously damage the health of athletes who take such substances. Just as science and technology are making great changes in health, the unscrupulous are also using scientific and technological advances to cheat in international sports. This is completely unacceptable to all Australians. As efforts to stamp out drug use and abuse are stepped up by the international community and national sports bodies, the efforts to cheat become in fact more insidious and dangerous as some athletes try to get away with as much as MAIN COMMITTEE",170,Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill 2004
288,Mr Johnson (Ryan) (10.49 A.m.),"I am pleased to follow my colleague in the parliathey can, with new methods of enhancing performance such as growth hormones, blood doping and gene doping. The dangerous effects of steroid abuse on athletes’ bodies and long-term health are well known to us now, but these new methods are more invasive and more dangerous, involving experimental and questionable techniques, with little known about their long-term consequences. We must be ever vigilant to stop these practices. The Australian government is very much at the forefront of trying to do this and I know that it will have the full support of the Australian community in trying to protect the integrity of sport at both national and international competition levels. The Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill 2004, as I said, will amend the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990. The amendments will enable the agency, ASDA, to perform the functions required to meet the World Anti-Doping Code. ASDA and the Australian Sports Drug Medical Advisory Committee will be empowered to adopt and implement the code’s requirements by the commencement of the Olympic Games in Athens in August. This will position Australia as a leading nation in the implementation of the code and the fight against those who would cheat in international sport. ASDA is recognised as the leading antidoping organisation in Australia. ASDA is a government statutory authority that deters the use of banned doping practices in sport. Education is a very important means by which it tries to promote sport without the use of drugs and illegal substances. Through these activities-drug testing, education, advocacy and coordination of Australia’s antidoping program-ASDA tries very genuinely and very proactively to protect the value of sports and the right of all athletes to compete on a level playing field. Sport is a very powerful cultural force in our country. All of us would acknowledge that it promotes health and a spirit of community mindedness as well. These proposed amendments will allow ASDA to recognise the new international standards while retaining a strong base of an already effective and efficient antidrug regime for sport. The amendments will introduce more stringent antidoping regulations and comprehensive rights for ASDA to release information on testing to the World Anti-Doping Agency, other sporting bodies and other government agencies. My colleague the member for Cook spoke very eloquently about some of the details and I will not go into them to the extent that he did. But I will make some references to what I think are some of the important points. Terms such as ‘trafficking’ and ‘possession’ are clearly defined in relation to sports. The definitions take into account the new technologies that drug cheats have adopted. For instance, trafficking can mean selling, giving, transporting, sending, delivering or distributing or-in relation to a doping method-trafficking the skills, knowledge, substances, equipment or technology to engage in doping. The code provides for the public release of athletes’ identities as a further disincentive to cheating. This is a very important step in addressing this important issue in our country. ASDA will be permitted to record violations on the register of notifiable events and make all relevant information public-within the context of the nation’s privacy laws. Those athletes who record negative results will also have their results released for the purposes of accountability. This will also act as a way to encourage and, equally, to commend those athletes doing the right thing and promoting the values and the importance of drug-free sports in the wider community. MAIN COMMITTEE This country has exceptional sporting superstars. We compete with the very best on the world stage. I might mention some of those. From my home state of Queensland we have Cathy Freeman, Grant Hackett, Ian Thorpe and Susie O’Neill. They all are Olympic gold medallists. All have in their own way achieved great success in their respective sports through their natural talent and abilities without ever contemplating the use of illegal substances to promote their performance. They are wonderful role models for all Australians. They are wonderful role models particularly for our young people who aspire to achieve equal success with them in international sport. We can hold them up not only as individuals who have performed successfully in the world of sport but as individuals of character and integrity who stand as shining lights of how to be the very best in the world-how to be No. 1 in the world-without the aid of illegal substances in terms of drugs. Unambiguous guidelines and consequences are established for athletes who fail to comply with requests for samples. Violations are recorded as antidoping violations. ASDA will be able to register the names of competitors who fail to comply with a request for samples. It will also inform government agencies which provide support to competitors. A clear appeal mechanism will also be set in place for therapeutic use exemptions. This will be overseen by the Australian Sports Drug Medicine Advisory Committee. Guidelines for dealing with tampering are also introduced. Tampering will now be a registrable and notifiable event. Where the tampering is not necessarily by a competitor but by someone who is involved in the sport, ASDA will be able to inform the relevant sporting administrative body. The World Anti-Doping Agency produced the antidoping code in 2003 as a world standard to align international and national regulations on drugs in sport across all sports and all countries. As the representative of the people in Ryan in Queensland, I commend them on doing that. I know that my constituents will be pleased that such an important agency is doing its bit to ensure that international sport is free from substances that we would wish it to be free from. I want to congratulate the government on supporting the work of the agency. I also take this opportunity in the parliament to congratulate those at ASDA who are doing a very fine job. They are part of a statutory body that ensures that the very best is achieved in our sporting fields through our athletes doing their best through natural talent. On behalf of the people of Ryan, whom I very proudly represent in this parliament, I extend my congratulations. I know that the government is very vigilant in this area. I commend the bill to the House. the Arts) (11.00 a.m.)-in reply-The concerted efforts of government and sport have come together to develop the World Anti-Doping Code which, at its core, is all about ensuring that athletes have the confidence that they are competing in an environment that is free from performance-enhancing substances. The Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill 2004 will enable the Australian Sports Drug Agency and the Australian Sports Drug Medical Advisory Committee to adopt and carry out functions required as a result of the introduction of the World Anti-Doping Code. It is about ensuring that those who compete in sport do so without the aid of performance-enhancing substances and that those who do attempt to cheat have more chance of being caught than ever before. In the interests of accountability and transparency, athletes and sporting organisations want to know that everyone is treated equally. In particular, the code aims to ensure that all athletes are treated in the same way by sports bodies and governments on antidoping issues.

289,Mr Williams (Tangney,"Minister for Communications, Information Technology andto the result management requirements within the act will see no diminution of athletes’ rights; while the amendments will see ASDA advising the athlete and the relevant national and international sports bodies, ASDA is not permitted to publicly name any athlete until the due process is completed. The issue of harmonisation is of great concern both nationally and internationally amongst governments and the wider sporting community. Athletes want the harmonisation of antidoping programs at the national and international levels. They also want an internationally coordinated testing program where they are not subject to multiple tests by different agencies. The introduction of the World Anti-Doping Code is a significant step forward in the harmonisation of antidoping policies and practices. That is precisely why the Australian government has put so much effort into achieving harmonisation of the antidoping effort through its Tough on Drugs in Sport policy. The work of ASDA is critical to the success of the tough antidoping regime in place in Australia. In putting forward the proposed amendments the government has given consideration to Australia’s existing procedures, structures and legal system. Importantly, the amendments will ensure that the operation of the Privacy Act 1988 is not limited and that athletes’ rights are protected. Athletes want to know that sporting administrators and governments are doing everything possible to ensure that their right to compete in an environment which is free from performance-enhancing substances is protected. The proposed amendments will strengthen Australia’s existing antidoping framework and ensure that we are well positioned to meet the continuing challenges in the fight against doping in sport in the lead-up to the 2004 Athens Olympic Games and beyond. I thank those who have contributed to the debate: the members for Melbourne, Cook and Ryan. I believe that the issues raised in the debate have been well covered in the drafting of the bill. I commend the bill to the Main Committee. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. ASIO, ASIS and DSD Committee Report Debate resumed from 1 March, on motion by Mr Jull: That the House take note of the report. modern times, was driven by intelligence. In the lead-up to the conflict, intelligence assessments prepared in the UK and the US, with some contribution from Australia, painted a picture of Saddam Hussein building threatening stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and seeking to reconstitute his nuclear program. The political case for war derived its urgency and power from the grave and gathering threat this supposedly represented. The international community could not afford to wait for Hans Blix’s weapons inspections to conclude-so the argument went. Saddam had to be disarmed immediately. This was, in fact, the totality of the MAIN COMMITTEE",175,Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill 2004
290,Mr Rudd (Griffith) (11.05 A.m.),"The pre-emptive war on Iraq, more than any other inHoward government’s rationale for war-not the desirability of regime change in Iraq or the obligations of the US alliance. In June 2003 the opposition called for an Australian parliamentary inquiry into intelligence on Iraqi WMD. Let us not forget that this was not entirely embraced by the government at the time, which by that stage was running the argument that Australians had ‘moved on’ from the Iraq war. Before turning to the findings of this inquiry, it is worth recalling the terms of reference it was given. In referring this matter to the committee, the Senate asked it to examine and report on: (1) the nature and accuracy of intelligence information received by Australia’s intelligence services in relation to the existence of, the capacity and willingness to use, and the immediacy of the threat posed by, Iraq’s WMD; (2) the nature, accuracy and independence of the assessments made by Australia’s intelligence agencies; (3) whether the government presented accurate and complete information to the parliament and the Australian public on Iraq’s WMD; and (4) whether Australia’s preconflict assessments of Iraq’s WMD capability were sufficiently accurate and comprehensive to underpin decisions to commit the Australian Defence Force to war. While the first two terms of reference dealt with the quality and accuracy of intelligence assessments, both Australian and foreign, the last two put the spotlight firmly on the government’s use of this intelligence in making a public case for war and in committing the ADF to prosecute that war. The parliamentary committee report devotes a great deal of attention to the accuracy and honesty of the government’s intelligence related claims-an entire chapter, in fact. This chapter is in many ways the centrepiece of the report. It offers example after example of exaggeration, selectivity and misleading statements from Australian government ministers. The opposition has identified at least 12 examples-although there are probably moreof this sort of exaggeration of the pre-war Iraqi WMD threat. It is important to catalogue those examples for the parliamentary record. In paragraph 2.5 of the report there is a reference to an Office of National Assessments report admission that intelligence on Iraq is ‘slight on the scope and location of Iraq’s WMD activities’. This contrasts, of course, with statements by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, among others, who said: I don’t think there’s any doubt about Saddam Hussein having stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons. Paragraph 2.40 of the parliamentary report states: The agencies provided hardly any explicit assessment on the question of the immediacy of threat posed by Saddam Hussein. This contrasts with the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs when, in reference to the UN Security Council veto, he said it had: ... denied the Security Council any further role in the disarming of Iraq, but it did not deny ... the clear and immediate threat posed by Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction to global security. Paragraph 4.40 of the report says: Both the US and UK documents, as published in September/October 2002, ... did not recognise the gaps in the intelligence, the problematic nature of much of the new intelligence or the uncertainties and disputes within the agencies about what the intelligence meant. Taken together, the omissions and changes constitutedMAIN COMMITTEE A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.10 a.m. to 11.18 a.m. incarnation of this place, paragraph 4.40 of the parliamentary report states-and I think I was at this point of the quotation: Taken together, the omissions and changes constituted an exaggeration of the available intelligence, since established as an exaggeration of the facts. But the report also notes: The statements by the Prime Minister and Ministers are more strongly worded than most of the AIC judgements. This is in part because they quote directly from the findings of the British and American intelligence agencies. I refer there specifically to paragraph 5.20 of the report. Paragraph 4.82 of the report says: There was an expectation created prior to the war that actual weapons of mass destruction would be found and found in sufficient quantities to pose a clear and present danger requiring immediate preemptive action. Such action is only sanctioned under international law where the danger is immediate ... The existence of programs alone does not meet that threshold. This is in fact the most fundamental challenge to the credibility of the government’s preemptive case for going to war in Iraq. Furthermore, it was reinforced by subsequent statements by the chair of the parliamentary committee, Mr Jull, when he said in a television interview that it was also his personal view that that threshold test had not been met-that is, the international legal legitimacy of the government engaging in a pre-emptive attack on Iraq. Paragraph 5.16 says: ... the case made by the government was that Iraq possessed WMD in large quantities and posed a grave and unacceptable threat to the region and the world, particularly as there was a danger that Iraq’s WMD might be passed to terrorist organisations. Paragraph 5.17 goes on to say: This is not the picture that emerges from an examination of all the assessments provided to the Committee by Australia’s two analytical agencies. Paragraph 5.21 says: campof the Defence Intelligence Organisationthought it was not a judgment that DIO would have made. This is a clear repudiation of the Prime Minister’s statement to the parliament, where he explicitly referred to Iraq’s WMD threat as real and unacceptable. Paragraph 5.22 says: Government presentations were in some areas incomplete, notably in respect of some of the available United Nations information on Iraq. Here the report refers specifically to the debriefing of Kamal Hussein-once again an example of government selectivity in the use of the information at its disposal.

292,"In Response To A Question About The Threat Of Iraq’s Wmd Being ‘Real And Unacceptable’, Mr Lewin","Here there was a specific reference in the report to the selective use of Hans Blix’s report to the United Nations Security Council on behalf of UNMOVIC-once again an example of the government’s selective use of information. Paragraph 5.28 says ‘the conclusions of the IISS were more complicated than is suggested’-in the 17 September 2002 presentation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the parliament. Once again, a reference to the government’s selective use of information. Paragraph 5.29 says: Other significant intelligence not covered in the government presentations included an assessment in October 2002 that Iraq was only likely to use its WMD if the regimes survival was at stakeOnce again, we see the government’s selective use of the information at its disposal and, in this case, its complete omission of that aspect of the intelligence advice to government... and the view of the Joint Intelligence Committee of the UK, available at the beginning of February 2003, that war would increase the risk of terrorism and the passing of Iraq’s WMD to terrorists. Once again, we see the government’s selective use of information and, once again, this material omitted from the government’s public presentation to the Australian people. Paragraph 5.32 says: ... the Australian agencies did not think the amounts of WMD to be large-they were described as ‘small stocks’-and the Defence Intelligence Organisation always expressed doubts about any production of biological or chemical weapons beyond 1991. The presentations by the government seemed to suggest large arsenals and stockpiles, endorsing the idea that Iraq was producing more weapons and that the programs were larger and more active than before the Gulf War in 1991. WhatI have read out are 12 sets of excerpts from this parliamentary committee of inquiry’s report. It was a committee chaired by the Liberal Party, a committee dominated by the Liberal Party and it was a unanimous report. These are 12 direct criticisms of the government’s exaggeration of the pre-war Iraqi WMD threat. Yet Mr Downer, in his statement on the day this report was handed down, said to the Australian people that this report vindicated the government’s handling of pre-war intelligence on Iraq. Mr Downer’s understanding of this report is, I think, remarkable. I have not been in this place when a majority report, a unanimous report, has come down with such a telling series of condemnations of the way in which the government has dishonestly handled information at its disposal and the way in which it has communicated that information to the Australian people. The other part of this committee of inquiry’s terms of reference dealt with the question of intelligence accuracy and intelligence failure. The findings there are equally explicit and they point to a pattern of flaw and of failure. Paragraphs 441, 451 and 438 all point to the fact that the Office of National Assessments in particular produced a series of assessments which relied on faulty intelligence from untested sources even though doubts were expressed about the trustworthiness of that intelligence at the time. However, the question that arises in the public debate is: given the intelligence failure, why did it occur? There are two major reasons which I think the Australian people need to address. One is the way in which this government resources the intelligence community. It is now more than two years since September 11 and it is more than 12 months since October 12 and the horrible events of Bali. We have a government which has said repeatedly, ‘We are living today in a war against terrorism in which intelligence is at the front line.’ We have also had a government this last year or more which has embraced publicly a doctrine of global military MAIN COMMITTEE pre-emption and regional military pre-emption where once again the accuracy of first-class intelligence is paramount. Yet what we have catalogued here is an extraordinary series of intelligence failures. We have a government which has preached loudly on the centrality of intelligence in the new security age in which we live, yet it is a government which, when it comes to the first substantive test, is found to be fundamentally wanting in terms of the way in which it has resourced, tasked and equipped our intelligence community to deal with the particular challenges represented by Iraq. Who is to blame for that? The Prime Minister has been Prime Minister for eight years. He has run the show. He has told us that intelligence is at the forefront of the national security debate. Yet, despite all of that, he embarks upon a pre-emptive military attack on Iraq without increasing the resources significantly to the Office of National Assessments to deal with this challenge, mindful of the fact that the ONA in its entire bureaucratic history of nearly a quarter of a century has never had to deal substantively with major military crises in the Middle East where a direct, on-the-ground Australian military commitment was contemplated. The traditional concentration of Australia’s intelligence assets has always been here, in broader East Asia, South-East Asia and the South-West Pacific. This Prime Minister embarks upon a strategy of global military pre-emption with the United States and we find ourselves in an exotic theatre of operations but with an intelligence community fundamentally underresourced to deal with the challenge. There were three part-time staff in the Office of National Assessments dealing with the avalanche of incoming assessments from the US and UK and the expectation by government was that they could provide effective independent vetting of the intelligence material coming towards them-you have got to be dreaming. The second reason which is pointed to in this report as to why we have had intelligence failure is equally important. It deals with the whole dilemma of policy driven analysis and what the report describes as ‘policy running strong’. What does that mean? It means an intelligence community which sees the fact that government, to all intents and purposes, has made an internal decision to go to war-a policy and political decision already taken-and then subtle, indirect, covert influence being exercised on the intelligence community to shape their analyses in a manner which fits the policy and political decision already taken. If you look back at the chronology of 2002, that is precisely what happened. The intelligence community is made up of intelligent people. They saw a government whose Prime Minister and foreign minister went to Washington in the middle of 2002. They saw a Prime Minister address the US Congress and come back. Internally, the debate then began in Canberra as to what quantum the Australian military commitment would be to Iraq-not whether there would be one but what quantum it would be. The internal debate began about whether there would be an Australian battalion committed to Iraq, and we all remember that debate well. It surfaced from time to time in parts of the Australian media. The intelligence community, therefore, by September 2002 had gotten the message loud and clear that this government was taking us off to war. Is it any surprise, then, that the intelligence community felt that it was under the political thumb when it came to producing analyses which substantiated the government’s already taken political decision to go to war? The commission of inquiry-the Flood inquiry, which has been established to examine these matters-will not deal with this whole problem of policy driven analysis. That is its fundamental MAIN COMMITTEE flaw. Its terms of reference are inadequate and that is why Labor has no confidence in the inquiry. (Time expired) 12 months ago that the Howard government unnecessarily placed Australian Defence Force lives at risk in the US-led war against Iraq based on a fallacy-a fanciful fallacy, cleverly manipulated and deceptively exaggerated by the Prime Minister in the pre-war scare campaign. The government were so selective in the review of the intelligence evidence they received that they had convinced all involved in the debate that Saddam Hussein had a mammoth stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. That mammoth stockpile has, of course, never been found. Perhaps if the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence were less subjective in their assessment of the intelligence provided to them, had taken their Bush and Blair blinkers off and read a little more carefully the advice provided to them by Australian intelligence agencies, Australia would not have committed to war-a war that did not have United Nations sanction. To highlight a few examples of where the government chose to ignore intelligence advice, in September 2002 the Office of National Assessments reported that intelligence was ‘slight on the scope and location of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction activities’. But at the same time the Prime Minister was declaring on the 7.30 Report on 9 September 2002: There’s no doubt, on the evidence-intelligence material available to us-that not only does Iraq possess chemical and biological weapons but Iraq also have not abandoned their nuclear aspiration. Australia’s intelligence agencies provided initial advice that did not pre-empt large stocks of weapons of mass destruction, and the Defence Intelligence Organisation has always expressed doubts about any production of biological or chemical weapons beyond 1991. However, as the parliamentary committee report points out, the government presentations pre-war all ‘seemed to suggest large arsenals and stockpiles, endorsing the idea that Iraq was producing more weapons and that the programs were larger and more active than before the Gulf War in 1991’. Of course, by early May 2003, not one single weapon of mass destruction had been found in Iraq. At this stage, even the United Nations Chief Weapons Inspector, Hans Blix, was questioning intelligence information sources. Even in mid-June 2003, the Prime Minister was continuing with his same line of reasoning and justification for involving Australia in the war against Iraq. When asked if he thought weapons of mass destruction would be found in Iraq, he replied: YesI do. I have no reason to doubt the intelligence information that we were given and that information was not in any way massaged or induced by the Government. It’s information that came from our intelligence agencies, they formed a view, it was my view that Iraq had a WMD capacity at the time the war started. Where did they go, Prime Minister? You can hardly think that Saddam Hussein could fit 819 ScudB missile launchers in his back pocket as soon as the United Nations weapons inspectors knocked on his front door. The Howard government chose to tell half-truths to the Australian public in their premature assessment and commitment to the war with Iraq. The government were warned before the war that there was an unclear assessment of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction, and Australian intelligence agencies provided hardly any explicit assessment of the question of the immediacy of the threat imposed by Saddam Hussein. The Howard government were told in MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Committees
293,Mr Wilkie (Swan) (11.28 A.m.),"In speaking to this report, I note that it was less thanOctober 2002 by the ONA, via Greg Thielman from the US Bureau of Intelligence and Research, that claims about Iraq importing uranium from Africa for a nuclear program were not correct. However, in his ministerial statement of 4 February 2003, the Prime Minister said: Iraq continues to work on developing nuclear weapons-uranium has been sought from Africa ... Minister Downer also massaged the facts for political expediency. Mr Thielman says the Howard government were told before the war that the imported aluminium tubes were not destined for Iraq’s nuclear program. But the Minister for Foreign Affairs went on later to say: Australian intelligence agencies believe there is evidence of a pattern of acquisition of equipment that could be used in a uranium enrichment program. Iraq’s attempted acquisition of ... aluminium tubes may be part of that pattern. The government simply chose to read what they wanted in the intelligence assessments provided to them. They went ahead and committed Australian Defence Force personnel to a US led war based on inconclusive information provided in good faith by Australian intelligence agencies. The Prime Minister admits that the intelligence basis on which he took Australia to war may have been inaccurate. He said on 3 February this year: History may… in the fullness of time it might be demonstrated that the advice was inaccurate, but to say it was bogus, is an unfair observation on the integrity of an intelligence agency. I could go on. There are numerous examples of where advice from the ONA was glossed over by the government to compel the Australian public to think that Australia was doing the right thing by following the US lead. Perhaps the Prime Minister had dug a hole too deep for himself in mid-2002 when he addressed the US Congress, effectively committing Australian troops to support an US led incursion, while selectively considering advice from his own national intelligence sources. The opposition has noted the government’s recent not-so-subtle shift away from the weapons of mass destruction reasoning for going to war and their new focus on Saddam Hussein, who had to be removed to save Iraq’s innocents. Once the weapons of mass destruction interpretation of intelligence was exposed as the fallacy that it was, Mr Howard quickly backflipped to justify Australia’s involvement by walking the humanitarian line of reasoning. It bewilders me no end. The Iraq war is now all about military intervention to dispose of a dictator who was in breach of humanitarian rights. No-one would disagree that Iraq is better off without Saddam Hussein, but using this argument to justify war does not stand up without the weapons of mass destruction. Whilst not advocating this course of action, if you use the government’s new-found logic, why then shouldn’t Australia pursue a similar course of action against Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe? Perhaps his breach of international human rights warrants a similar type of war as that against Saddam Hussein. The Minister for Foreign Affairs said on 26 March last year: The government is appalled at the unprovoked, violent repression and intimidation that has taken place. Just in the last few days, several hundred-possibly as many as 500-opposition activists have been arrested. Many of those people have been beaten and some of them have even been tortured. Over 250 people have been hospitalised and one opposition member has apparently died. Children have been beaten and soldiers have been sexually assaulting women. Australian diplomats have witnessed first hand the result of several vicious beatings by army personnel, including beatings with sticks wrapped in MAIN COMMITTEE barbed wire. It is disturbing that this violence follows a speech which was made last Friday by President Mugabe in which he said he could be ‘a black Hitler tenfold’. The foreign minister has also acknowledged that in Zimbabwe seven million people are in desperate need of food. It is a graphic picture-one that the Minister for Foreign Affairs paints clearly. However, given the argument now used to justify the Iraq war, wouldn’t the Howard government have been right if they had used military intervention to quash Mugabe? But no; on this occasion the Prime Minister thought about seeking some special intelligence on the Mugabe regime and, just to be sure, he sent the Australian cricket team to Zimbabwe. Perhaps Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist or another member of the Australian World Cup cricket team was sent to Zimbabwe on double duty: intelligence gathering between overs, perhaps. It is not fair to be flippant about Australia’s World Cup cricket champions in this way. But, going on his past record, I would say that the Prime Minister treated the Iraq assessments of the Office of National Assessments and the Defence Intelligence Organisation in the same way he would treat an intelligence assessment by a member of the World Cup cricket team: with scant regard. The sudden turnaround by the government, with the legal justification for war on the grounds of possession of weapons of mass destruction debased and the new focus now firmly on the regime of Saddam Hussein, brings me to the point that the Prime Minister and his trigger-happy government should have acknowledged right from the beginning: the war action was unnecessary. Iraq could have been disarmed peacefully, without loss of life and without risking the lives of Australian Defence Force personnel. The United Nations resolutions did not authorise action against Iraq without Security Council consent. Perhaps, in hindsight, a diplomatic resolution, originally called for by the opposition, would have been a better choice. Given the failure to locate the stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and the failure to date to establish any evidence of the rebuilding of Iraq’s nuclear weapons capability, the opposition was right in taking a resolutory rather than a reactionary position. The matter of intelligence on Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction was referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD in June last year. I welcomed the decision although, along with many others, I questioned the terms of reference of the inquiry and was also curious as to why the Prime Minister believed that the consideration was premature. Surely after the UK and US realised the insufficiencies in their intelligence, wouldn’t it be obvious that Australia’s intelligence information would be compromised? As the opposition knew all along, the Howard government jumped the gun. They were so keen to deploy Australian troops to Iraq that they failed to listen to their own specialists. The joint committee report at section 4.82 finds: There was an expectation created prior to the war that actual weapons of mass destruction would be found and found in sufficient quantities to pose a clear and present danger requiring immediate preemptive action. Clearly the government exaggerated the urgency of the situation in Iraq and further consultation with Australian intelligence sources would have been more suitable. The committee report states: MAIN COMMITTEE ... the case made by the government was that Iraq possessed WMD in large quantities and posed a grave and unacceptable threat to the region and the world, particularly as there was a danger that Iraq’s WMD might be passed to terrorist organisations. However, the report goes on to conclude in section 5.17: This is not the picture that emerges from an examination of all the assessments provided to the Committee by Australia’s two analytical agencies. As I said before, the government presented a scenario of massive stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. However, Australian intelligence agencies did not think that the amount would constitute anything more than small stocks. There is a clear gap here between what the government claim and what the Australian intelligence community advised. I welcome the findings and recommendations of the committee’s report and I agree that there needs to be a further inquiry. The government’s handling of the pre-war intelligence assessments provided to them needs to be assessed. As I have outlined, these assessments were massaged to suit the policy decisions of the government of the day. An independent assessment of the process that led to Australian commitment to the war in Iraq needs to be able to fully expose individual representations to the government from agency personnel and how the government used selective information for their own purposes. Furthermore, the agencies themselves need to be reviewed. Recommendation 1 of the committee’s report states that the capacity of the Office of National Assessments needs to be evaluated, especially in the current global climate. Government intelligence agencies need to be independent to provide advice that protects our national security and protects the Australian public. These recommendations are fine; however, government policy in these matters should not be the basis for assessments. As the Prime Minister said in March 2003, prior to announcing that Australian troops would join US military action against Iraq: ... if there is a military conflict there will be casualties, there will be civilian casualties. Just last week, figures showed that the liberation of Iraq claimed an estimated 55,000 lives, including 9,600 civilians. These numbers will grow as unexploded cluster bombs are detonated in urban areas by ill-fated civilians. The joint committee, chaired by the Liberal member for Fadden, David Jull, should be commended on their work. I agree with the chair’s opening statements in the report, where he makes the following observations in relation to the inquiry and its recommendations for a further inquiry: The reference, like the matter into which the inquiry was conducted, involved some controversy. There was a view by the Prime Minister that the inquiry was premature. Some Senators were unhappy with what they perceived to be the limited scope of the Committee. The limitations imposed by the statute under which the Committee operates are real: it does not have a broad right to call witnesses, reports written by the Committee must be vetted by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Defence and the Attorney-General ... to ensure that no matters affecting national security are revealed in the report’s contents. In other words, they were gagged. Further, the committee notes: ... unlike the Intelligence Services Committee of the British Parliament, which conducted a similar inquiry, we received excerpts only of the assessments made prior to the war in Iraq. The Committee’s conclusions, therefore, must be qualified. The Committee recommends that a more comprehensive inquiry should be conducted by suitable experts ... MAIN COMMITTEE The committee has also unanimously agreed that Australia’s intelligence assessments prior to the war in Iraq were flawed and that the government chose to pursue military intervention regardless of pre-war acknowledgement that the intelligence provided was compromised. I believe there is a need for a royal commission into this whole sordid affair, an independent commission of inquiry to review material and interview witnesses to fully assess the process of representation to the government on issues of national security. Sadly, the inquiry announced by the government falls well short of what is required. Its terms of reference are limited to intelligence agencies and not the manipulation of the facts by government. An inquiry will not have the powers of a royal commission. I am reminded of an episode of Yes Minister in which the minister, following a departmental leak, calls for an inquiry. Sir Humphrey stuns both the minister and Bernard by suggesting an independent inquiry. When the minister departs, Bernard asks Sir Humphrey: ‘Why an independent inquiry? Surely such an inquiry with a mind of its own may actually get to the truth of the matter.’ Humphrey is not fazed. He advises Bernard that an independent inquiry is a little bit like a freight train: ‘Both have a mind of their own, but lay down the tracks and that’s the path they follow.’ Sadly, that is what this government have done with the terms of reference for this further independent inquiry. They have laid down the rails in order to get to the destination they want. WhatI want to see exposed is the truth. speak to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD entitled Intelligence on Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction, the Jull report. As members may be aware, on MondayI introduced into the parliament a bill for a royal commission to follow up on the work of the committee as outlined in this report, and to follow on from its various recommendations, conclusions and findings. The serious findings of this report warrant an independent royal commission-and the previous speaker, the member for Swan, has suggested that as well-rather than the half-baked emasculated inquiry recently announced by the Prime Minister. WhilstI congratulate the members of the committee on their work in compiling this report, I nevertheless have grave concerns about the process involved in the final product. The committee registered concerns about the limited access it had to documents and information in order to make definitive conclusions. I will refer to some of those issues in more detail in a moment. Of more concern is the fact that the committee’s report was managed and vetted in some unknown way by the offices of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General prior to its final release. I would hazard a guess that some of the final recommendations are the result of the vetting process, for, based on my reading, they seem to appear out of nowhere yet tie in nicely with the government’s announcement last week that former diplomat and intelligence boss Philip Flood would head an inquiry into Australia’s intelligence agencies. This will not get to the bottom of the government’s deception. The circumstances of the deception which led Australia into war are clearly revealed in the Jull report handed down just last week. For example, the committee came to the conclusion, in paragraph 5.32, that the presentations by the government seemed to suggest that Iraq possessed large stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons. The report states: In addition, there appears to be a gap on the matter of immediacy of threat. MAIN COMMITTEE",181,Committees
294,Mr Organ (Cunningham) (11.42 A.m.),"I welcome the opportunity to rise today toAnd that goes to the heart of the matter. The Australian people were lied to. There was no immediate threat. There were no large stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons or nuclear weapons of mass destruction. It was a beat-up. There was no need for the coalition of the willing. At paragraph 4.79, the committee concluded: The Committee does not have a complete set of the AICAustralian Intelligence Communityassessments. The Australian agencies told the Committee they were in possession of the whole picture insofar as they received all there was to receive from partner agencies. Our judgements are based on an analysis of what we were given. The AIC assessments are more moderate and cautious than those of their partner agencies, particularly those in the United States. Howeverand this is the clinchereven within their caution, it is arguable that they overstated the degree to which WMD existed. There are serious unanswered questions here, and the committee realised this. The committee chair, in his introduction to the report, stated: The Committee’s conclusions, therefore, must be qualified. The Committee recommends that a more comprehensive inquiry should be conducted by ... experts into Australia’s intelligence sharing and intelligence liaison arrangements. Note that the chair had pointed to the need for an inquiry to be conducted by experts. The Australian community deserves to know the precise extent to which it was misled over the invasion of Iraq. The Jull report, at paragraph 4.80, clearly states that various Australian intelligence organisations held intelligence at the beginning of 2003 that Iraq had: ... no known CWchemical weaponsproduction ... no specific evidence of resumed BWbiological weaponsproduction ... Iraq does not have nuclear weapons. So that is what the intelligence community knew at the beginning of 2003, whereas, on 4 February 2003, the Prime Minister told the House of Representatives: The Australian government knows that Iraq still has chemical and biological weapons ... He said: ... Iraq must not be allowed to possess weapons of mass destruction ... it must be disarmed. The question is begging: what weapons? There was no smoking gun, no nuclear reactor and no mass of chemical or biological weapons pointed at us, the United States or the United Kingdom. Even the government’s staunchest advocates would be sure to concede the point: the reasons for going to war were deficient, wobbly and flawed. The government’s answer to its credibility problem is to provide another report and, to make absolutely sure that this report does not go anywhere, make sure the report is presented to cabinet-a secret report which the public will not see for 30 years. The Prime Minister proposes to have another inquiry. A report will be prepared but it will only be a cabinet-inconfidence report. Basically, it will again be a cover-up and we will not know what is going on or what really happened. How utterly convenient and utterly disgraceful. MAIN COMMITTEE As I have mentioned, I was very concerned that the recommendations of this report did not reflect its substance. The implications of that must not be underestimated. Indeed, the implications of the actions of the coalition of the willing will resound for many years to come. To think that three nations, claiming to be acting in their own interests and in the interests of the globe, led their nations into war on the basis of a lie is abhorrent and devastating. The implications of this, as I said, cannot be understated. And to think that intelligence services and government representatives knew of this deceit is an abomination. This nation declared war on a sovereign state, the most serious of government decisions, and it made this decision under false pretences. It is clear that the government led this nation into war with a lie. Not only did this government risk the lives of thousands of Australians who served their nation in good faith but we were part of the coalition of the willing, responsible for the deaths of thousands of Iraqisonce again, an act committed under false pretences. And here we are considering this fact in the Main Committee. This decision to go to war must be placed under the brightest spotlight, but it appears that even this report that we are considering here today has been vetted and doctored by the government. The decision to go to war on a sovereign state under false pretences deserves the most intense scrutiny, but it has received nothing like that. The conclusions of the report are nothing less than damning, even though I suspect they were subject to doctoring and vetting by the government. The best that can be said of the government, and it is what the report says, is that they did not dramatise the threat of war quite as badly as the Americans. The report says: The Australian Prime Minister and other ministers did not use highly emotive expressions such as those used in the United States. How comforting that is! The President of the United States and his National Security Adviser made comments such as: ‘We don’t want the smoking gun to become a mushroom cloud.’ ‘The Iraqi dictator must not beep be permitted to threaten America and the world with horrible poisons and diseases and gases and atomic weapons.’ The final paragraph of the conclusions of this report proves that this government chose to mislead the Australian people about the threat of war in Iraq. It says that the government were advised that the threat was not as imminent and as serious as they were suggesting. But the government chose to mislead the Australian people anyway. The final paragraph clearly states: The government’s emphatic claim about the existence of Iraqi WMD reflected the views of the Office of National Assessments after 13 September 2002. ONA said it was ‘highly likely’ that Iraq had WMD. However, the Australian agencies did not think the amounts of WMD to be large-they were described as ‘small stocks’-and the Defence Intelligence Organisation always expressed doubts about any production of biological or chemical weapons beyond 1991. The presentations by the government seemed to suggest large arsenals and stockpiles, endorsing the idea that Iraq was producing more weapons and that the programs were larger and more active than before the Gulf War in 1991. In addition, there appears to be a gap on the matter of immediacy of threat. Assessments by Australian agencies about possible degradation of agents and restricted delivery capability cast doubt on the suggestion that the Iraqi ‘arsenal’ represented a ‘grave and immediate’ and a ‘real and unacceptable’ threat. Out of that comes the following recommendation, which does not in any way address the fact that the report found that the government ignored the intelligence provided by their own MAIN COMMITTEE agencies. This is the crux of the matter. The final recommendation of this report completely ignores those previous facts and reads as follows: The Committee recommends that there should be an independent assessment of the performance of the intelligence agencies, conducted by an experienced former intelligence expert with full access to all the material, which will report to the National Security Committee of Cabinet and which, in the light of the matters raised by the consideration of the pre-war intelligence on Iraq, will recommend any changes that need to take place for the better functioning of the agencies. What a joke. This does not address the issue. The problem is not with the intelligence; the problem is that the government chose to ignore the intelligence. Earlier this week in the chamber, I proposed a royal commission into the question of Australians going to war under false pretences. I once again point out the need for a royal commission to highlight the seriousness of the worse deception of the Australian people, possibly ever in our history. The objects of my bill were, firstly, to establish a royal commission to investigate the intelligence advice that was provided to the Australian government that related to the decision that was made to invade Iraq in 2003 and to continue the occupation of Iraq in 2004. Secondly, it was also to expose any misrepresentation, neglect or omission of advice provided to the Commonwealth government by the Australian Public Service or other sources that related to this invasion. Thirdly, it was to expose any representation, neglect or omission in the Commonwealth government’s public communication of this intelligence. We know that royal commissions have a long history in Australia with regard to espionage, spying and broader intelligence, such as the Petrov royal commission back in 1954, which inquired into Soviet espionage in Australia. The previous speaker, the member for Swan, and I have raised the issue of the need for a royal commission. We feel that it should be composed of three persons appointed by the Governor General, each of whom shall be a former judge of the High Court or of a Supreme Court of a state or territory one of whom shall be appointed to be the chair of the royal commission. The present proposal by the government does not go to these lengths. The terms of reference which flow on from this report should include: determining the nature and extent of the intelligence provided to the Commonwealth government relating to its decision to commit Australian military forces to the invasion in 2003 and to continue to occupy Iraq in 2004; the accuracy and independence of this intelligence; how the Commonwealth government verified this intelligence; and the accuracy with which the Commonwealth governmentham. You would be aware that there is a bill on the Notice Paper; you need to be careful not to anticipate that bill too much. that we are currently dealing with. I call on the government to go further and take on board the information that has been provided in this report and to act on the report-to allow a fuller investigation into the intelligence that was received by the government and how the government dealt with that intelligence, and really get to the bottom of the matter. We cannot, out of this report, have an investigation set up which will, as I said, result in a report that goes to cabinet and then disappears into the archives for another 30 years. The Australian people want to know what was going on with regard to our reasons for going to war. It is only when the full picture is revealed that the concerns of the people of Australia about going to war under MAIN COMMITTEE",185,Committees

296,Mr Organ,"conveyed this intelligence to the public. In closing, I welcome this reportfalse pretences will be adequately addressed and we will know exactly where the government was coming from, how we were deceived and how that came about, so that it will not happen in the future. bate and want to acknowledge the contributions made by the member for Griffith, the member for Swan and the member for Cunningham. I must say I thought the member for Cunningham’s speech was quite erudite and was a very good examination of this report and its implications. The flaws that he has seen in the recommendations, as opposed to the body of the report, bear some consideration. In early February, Archbishop Desmond Tutu gave a speech to the British Prison Reform Trust. In his speech regarding the current situation in Iraq he said: We see here on a global scale the same illusion that force and brutality can produce security as we note at national and communal levels that harsh sentences and being tough on crime necessarily make our neighbourhoods safer. How wonderful if politicians could bring themselves to admit that they are only fallible human creatures and not God and thus by definition can make mistakes. Unfortunately they seem to think that such an admission is a sign of weakness. Weak and insecure people hardly ever say “sorry”. It is large hearted and courageous people who are not diminished by saying “I made a mistake”. President Bush and Prime Minister Blair would recover considerable credibility and respect if they were able to say “Yes, we made a mistake”. I would argue that the same could be said of our Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and his government. I am sure you recall vividly, Madam Deputy Speaker, the debate in this parliament over committing our troops to war. I am sure you also recall the way in which individuals and groups who took umbrage at the decisions taken by the Australian government at that time were vilified and attacked as undermining Australia’s national interests, as supporting Saddam Hussein and as being anti-American. I vividly remember them. We still have the Minister for Foreign Affairs perpetuating the view that those of us who took a contrary position to the government are supporters of Saddam Hussein. That is an absolute insult. It is even more of an insult-apart from the rhetorical flourish that it obviously is in the first instance-when you analyse the reasons why Australia went to war and read this very informed document, the report under consideration, because you are left undoubtedly to conclude that we have been led up the garden path. Far from being vilified, the people who asked questions at the time Australia went to war should be applauded. We should be seen as people who took the interests of the Australian community to heart, espoused what we thought were the positive values of being Australian and questioned the authority of the Prime Minister to take us to war. It is worth remembering that on 20 March 2003 the Prime Minister, in taking us to war, declared-and he made it very clear-that the war was all about weapons of mass destruction. He said: We are determined to join other countries to deprive Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction, its chemical and biological weapons, which even in minute quantities are capable of causing death and destruction on a mammoth scale. … … … And the more countries that have these weapons-countries run by despotic regimes-the greater becomes the likelihood that these weapons will fall into the hands of terrorists. MAIN COMMITTEE",188,Committees
297,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari) (11.56 A.m.),"I am pleased to be able to participate in this de… … … That is the reason above all others why I passionately believe that action must be taken to disarm Iraq. But was the Prime Minister sure about this? Surely he had other reasons for the war: for example, to replace the regime of Saddam Hussein. This question had been put to the Prime Minister a week earlier in the National Press Club on 13 March 2003. He was asked whether he would invade Iraq regardless of whether it had WMD in order to remove Saddam. The Prime Minister, as we know, makes unequivocal statements. He said: ... I would have to accept that if Iraq had genuinely disarmed, I couldn’t justify on its own a military invasion of Iraq to change the regime. I’ve never advocated that. Much in all as I despise the regime. These were the words of the Prime Minister repudiating the Bush doctrine of regime change, as well he should have. The more we learn about the intelligence services of Australia, Britain and the United States and what they knew and the more we learn also about what the Prime Minister and his government knew, the more it becomes apparent that this war was founded on a deliberate lie. The advice our intelligence services actually gave the government regarding Iraq’s stockpile of weapons of mass destruction has been discussed widely and made very clear in this report. It is certainly my view that the advice that was given by the respective intelligence agencies was not taken or, at the very minimum, was dealt with selectively. It was put through a filter so that when we received advice from the government it was very partisan. We need to comprehend, understand, appreciate and remember that the rationale put by the government for this war was based on three simple points: Iraq had access to nuclear materials and technology and was close to developing nuclear weaponry, Iraq had chemical and biological weapons ready for deployment, and Australia must support the United States because they are our primary military ally. It is not my business here to go through and rebut all of those points. Suffice it to say that it is now a matter of public record that each of themcertainly the ones about the weaponry-has been repudiated. We now know that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq at the time. None have been found since and it is unlikely that there will ever be any found. We can remember in relation to nuclear materials the Minister for Foreign Affairs telling us this in July 2002: And there is deep concern about hiswith ‘his’ referring to Saddam Husseinhaving access to fissile material and having the capacity to build a nuclear weapon-albeit of a very crude kind. The Prime Minister said on Radio 5DN on 7 August 2002: It is believed they have the capacity to develop a nuclear strike capacity within the not too distant future. Senator Hill reinforced it on 15 August 2002: We’re talking about biological, chemical and ultimately nuclear weapons ... Then on 10 September 2002 the Minister for Foreign Affairs told Triple M: I know that the Americans have talked a bit about the Iraqis purchasing equipment that could be used for the enrichment of uranium, and of course you need enriched uranium to build a nuclear weapon ... There is this information about purchasing equipment that could be used for the enrichment of uranium. On 11 September 2002 our Prime Minister told the Sunrise program: MAIN COMMITTEE ... the unanimous view of intelligence agencies that we deal with is that Iraq does have a desire for nuclear weapons and the capacity that I’ve described to actually develop them … On 17 September 2002 the Minister for Foreign Affairs told the House: Australian intelligence agencies believe there is evidence of a pattern of acquisition of equipment that could be used in a uranium enrichment program. We know that the former US Ambassador Joseph Wilson travelled to Niger to investigate the uranium claim. He later told the New York Times that it was ‘highly doubtful that any such transaction ever took place’. People will recall that Mr Wilson was punished for his revelation by having his wife’s identity leaked to the media. His wife’s career as a covert CIA field operative was destroyed. We also know that the Office of National Assessments had been told the Niger claim was nonsense by early 2002, yet the claim was repeated by the government over 2002. Greg Thielmann, the former director of the strategic proliferation and military affairs office at the US Department of State’s intelligence bureau, made this clear to Four Courners on 27 October 2003. He said that the ONA: ... would have known in the ... spring of 2002 ... that we were dubious about the information ... we had pretty good contacts and sharing with representatives of ONA. The government knew. The same is true of the aluminium tubes. Mr Thielmann said Australia knew the tubes were unlikely to be associated with a nuclear program by 2002. He told Four Corners: ...at that time, we had a very strong feeling … there was a growing consensus within not only the US intelligence community, but also … our close allies with whom we shared a lot of the results. And the consensus was that this was not bound for the nuclear weapons program ... … … … I do know that the Australians knew about the dissenting position … of the Intelligence Bureau, the State Department and the Department of Energy… In relation to chemical weapons, in July 2002 the Minister for Foreign Affairs told Lateline: … I don’t think there’s any doubt about Saddam Hussein having stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons. On the 7.30 Report three weeks later he repeated this claim, when he said: ... the intelligence tells us, without going into too much detail ... he has chemical and biological weapons capabilities and stockpiles … On7 August 2002 the Prime Minister said: Iraq does have weapons of mass destruction. On 27 January 2003, UNMOVIC, the body most expert in the question of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, explicitly warned the UN Security Council that the weapons may no longer exist. We know from a report in the Age that Australian intelligence agencies warned the government of the same eventuality. And we know that this advice was ignored. The whole thing has now shifted because the government have been exposed by the failure to find any weapons of mass destruction, by the outcome of this inquiry, by their own acceptance that the intelligence they received required further examination and by the recommendation in the report for the establishment of a further inquiry. I have a great deal of sympathy with the view expressed by the member for Cunningham about the nature of that inquiry and the need to perhaps have a royal commission. The government would have been aware of the pieces of advice that are clearly contained in this report. They made judgments about what MAIN COMMITTEE information they gave the community. They also made judgments about how they would use that advice. And, despite that advice, they decided that the reason we should go to war in Iraq was, primarily, weapons of mass destruction. Since then we have heard the revisionist view consistently coming out of the government that in fact the reason they went to war was regime change. This view was rejected at the time but now, because of the intelligence reports and information and the transparency and exposure that have now taken place, the government have been forced into a position where they have to repudiate their position in a post facto sense by saying to us that, despite the assertions they were making in 2002 and 2003 being the basis on which we went to war, the real reason we went to war was to get rid of Saddam Hussein. There is no-one in this parliament and no-one I have come across in the Australian community who does not believe the world is a better place without Saddam Hussein running Iraq. But that is not the reason that we went to war. As I said at the outset, the whole reason we went to war was a lie. Those of us who stood our ground in the community and took a principled position in opposition to the war-even though we were forced to accept their advice on issues to do with weapons of mass destruction-were pilloried by this government. As I said at the outset, I have read the words of Desmond Tutu about the need for people to accept their mistakes and the need for people to be large enough to come to the community and say, ‘We made a mistake and we are sorry.’ We have not seen that from this Prime Minister, from the foreign minister or from any government representative. We hear a lot about truth and honesty in politics. Truth and honesty in politics, I would have thought, means saying to the Australian community, when it is required, that you have made a mistake. This government made a mistake. Whether they deliberately made that mistake is of course a matter of conjecture. In my view, they did. In my view, they constructed a case for war based on lies which they knew about. volvement in the war in Iraq. I did so at that point in time because there was a mechanism that had been commenced by the United Nations that was being continued and which, if given time, would have succeeded in the intent of that action. Why do I say that? I say that because we now have the value of hindsight into the situation that abounded in Iraq with regard to weapons of mass destruction. The organisation that had been put together by the United Nations, UNMOVIC, had been carrying out its inspections and had reported on a number of occasions to the UN. It had indicated that it had made progress and that it felt that, given time, it would succeed, and this was ignored by a number of members of the United Nations community, including Australia. When, as has been his wont over the last couple of months, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has latched onto UN resolution 1441 as giving justification for the action that was carried out, he glosses over the debate that was going on in the UN Security Council at that time, when a number of countries disagreed that that was a reading of where we were as a result of that motion. The parliamentary report on intelligence on Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction does not go into a number of those matters, but it is a very important work of this parliament. I believe it is an illustration of the way in which the parliamentary committee system can work to its best. It is an illustration of the way in which the parliamentary committee system can review the MAIN COMMITTEE",189,Committees
298,Mr Jenkins (Scullin) (12.11 P.m.),"It is well known that I opposed Australia’s inactions of a government and its bureaucracy and come to conclusions from the perspective of the parliament and make recommendations and give commentary as to what should happen in the future. My interests in the outcomes of this report go to the way in which a future government might analyse the information that is before it and make a commitment on behalf of the Australian public to a decision to commit troops to armed conflict. This is what we have to return to in the Australian public debate-a confidence that a government will act properly and that that action will be as a result of proper analysis of good information. I am pleased that as an outcome of this inquiry the government has adopted the need to investigate our intelligence gathering capacity. I share the concerns of a number of my colleagues on this side of the chamber about the breadth of that inquiry, but I think that what we see in this case is an attempt to make sure that we equip our intelligence community to be able to give Australia the best advice. As the report outlines, we were greatly dependent on the intelligence that was shared with us by other powers. There was a limited capacity for Australia on its own behalf to make independent analyses of that intelligence. But that does not excuse the way the conclusions by those intelligence organisations were used by government and the political spin that that material was given. It does not excuse the fact that that political spin continues even in the reaction to this report. The selective quoting completely out of context by both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to try to suggest that this committee report exonerates the government from any ill-doing in the run-up to the Iraqi conflict is completely erroneous. There can be no conclusions that people can come to that do not indicate that this government has a number of lessons to learn from this saga. Most commentary in the media has suggested that and has indicated that the government is absolutely out of touch if it thinks that in some way this report exonerates its actions. I want to concentrate on the UN processes that abounded at the time of the decision by the Australian government to commit troops, because I think that is an important aspect of this debate that in the aftermath was glossed over. Certainly there has been a great deal of rewriting of history about the intent of Australia’s involvement. But all of us remember that the main intent surrounded Iraq’s possession of weapons of mass destruction and the possible use that Iraq, under Saddam Hussein, would make of those WMDs-nothing more, nothing less. If in fact, as now the government are wont to explain to the Australian community, the reason for our involvement was regime change, the government were pretty reluctant at the time to indicate that. In fact, the real problem was that they went out of their way to indicate that that was not their intent. We have the Prime Minister at the National Press Club on 13 March saying: ... I couldn’t justify on its own a military invasion of Iraq to change the regime. So let us not be too high and mighty, as the government have been, in saying that now that Iraq is rid of Saddam Hussein anybody who was against the war in some way was acting in support of Saddam Hussein. There is a great deal of agreement that Iraq will be potentially much better off now that it is rid of Saddam Hussein; my proviso is that we have to see the type of regime that replaces the deposed regime. Hopefully, with the progress that might be made once the international community can play its part in getting the affairs of Iraq under MAIN COMMITTEE control, that will be the case. But certainly the continuing hostilities and the continuing loss of life amongst the civilian population and military personnel from the United States indicate that we still have a way to go. Having said that, as I have said before in this place, the fact that Saddam Hussein has gone-as an unintended consequence, if you read the black and white of what the government was saying at the time of the action-is a good thing. But is it now a doctrine that this government will wish to go forward with in other international disputes? Will we see it being used against other leaders with as dastardly records on human rights as Saddam Hussein’s? That is the point that this debate has got to if the opposition is to be harangued and if it is to be somehow suggested that our actions and our criticism were or are in support of Saddam Hussein. That is a nonsense. It was not the point at the time in the UN processes when the decision was made for a commitment of troops. Under United Nations Security Council resolution 1441, as I said earlier, the inspection team had been put in place. That inspection team had reported back. But let us look at the way in which the conclusions of that inspection team were distorted by the government to try to justify its actions at the time. We see in UNMOVIC’s report that, when Dr Blix said that he believed that Iraq was cooperative on process but not on substance, he expanded on that view and said that UNMOVIC also noted increasing cooperation and numerous initiatives from the Iraqi side. UNMOVIC reported that the results of inspections were consistent with Iraqi declarations and that no weapons of mass destruction had been found. They were fairly important statements because what UNMOVIC were saying was that they were making progress and believed that in time they would get a result. But, as this report outlines, when we compare the resources that were available to nary that any progress had been made. As the report says, in comparison to UNMOVIC’s size and resources, the Iraq Survey Group has impressive capacity. In February 2003 UNMOVIC had a staff of 250 people from 60 countries. When we compare that to what the Iraq Survey Group started off with when it commenced its operations in mid-June 2003, the number of personnel was in the order of 1,200 to 1,600. This included 100 WMD experts, 50 human intelligence case officers, 33 interrogators, 130 personnel for mobile site exploration and over 200 Arab linguists. Let us compare the resources post the start of the conflict when the ISG went into bat with what UNMOVIC were struggling with over the months in the run-up to the conflict. That is glossed over; the government ignores that. There was a process in place. That process had the support of the opposition and was fundamental to our case and our position at the time of the commitment by the government of troops to involvement in the Iraqi war. This is where the Australian public wish the debate to go back to: matters that were germane at the time the decision was made. They do not want history to be rewritten in a political sense on the basis of events that have followed. To do that would mean that we would still have this concern about the way in which a future Australian government might make decisions of similar ilk. That is why the outcomes of these inquiries, if we are to really see a proper investigation of the capacity of Australia’s sovereign intelligence gathering organisations, are of the utmost importance. This report of the parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD is a very important aspect of that work. Australians should be confident that Australia itself has MAIN COMMITTEE the capacity to know what actions it should take in its own national interest and not do things on the basis that we believe there is some advantage for Australia by just following the whims of a president in Washington or a prime minister in London. If they have come to the conclusion that that was one of the main reasons that Australia was involved, the public understands that the question needs to be asked: was that necessarily in Australia’s national interest? Of course, it is likely that from time to time there will be similar situations that Australia has to confront. I believe we need to learn the lesson that the military solution should not be the only way that we can resolve these matters. There needs to be continuing use of international forums such as the UN and other wider international collectives that search for solutions to these problems in a peaceful manner. Now that we have this hindsight, it is clear that the work of UNSCOM was indeed successful in weakening the ability of the Saddam Hussein regime to do what it had been doing. I believe this parliament should look at this report and the government should take notice of the reaction to it. (Time expired) discussion of the report of the parliamentary inquiry into the handling of pre-war intelligence on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. However, I wish that it was not necessary. There has been enormous concern in my electorate, which reflects the concern throughout the international community, that the decision to go to war in Iraq was based upon false assessments and a political position which was simply not justified. One of the statements used by some members of the government is that it is fine to discuss these issues in retrospect-that they thought in good faith that there were weapons of mass destruction there and that no-one was saying anything different. What this report systematically outlines is, indeed, that the government did have access to quite a great deal of alternative assessments. It should be noted that this inquiry was very limited. It did not have access to all of the ONA and DIO assessments. Only 26 ONA assessments and just 14 of 189 DIO assessments for the period were provided to the committee. The report examines four issues regarding intelligence and whether Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction which it could use. The four intelligence issues were uranium from Africa, the importation of aluminium tubes, mobile biological laboratories and UAVs for a biological weapons program. The first three of those issues were used by the government to justify its case that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. The report says that all these were either wrong or disputed at the time, or both. As to the issue of UAVs for biological weapons, it certainly is unproven. The report essentially outlines a contrast between what the assessments were that the government was receiving and what actually was occurring. It is interesting to compare the intelligence assessments with the rhetoric of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and to note how different the pitches were. The government would like to suggest that it did not doctor or sex up any of these reports. However, it is pretty clear that the government was very selective in the use of the intelligence that it was receiving. Furthermore, it did not convey to the Australian people any of the qualifications or the doubts in the intelligence material that it received. If you go back and look at the comments of the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence you will see that they were all very deliberate and all very clear. Statements such as ‘we know that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction’-not ‘we think’ but ‘we know’-were made over and over again in order to establish the case for war. MAIN COMMITTEE",192,Committees
299,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (12.26 P.m.),"I am pleased to make a contribution to thisThe government says that it is okay to be right in retrospect, but it argues that it could not have known about WMD. That is an interesting position because it suggests that it was prepared to go to war on the basis of not knowing what the facts were with regard to Iraqi WMD. But, at that time, contrary views were being put by the intelligence community, by the political community and indeed in this parliament by members of the Australian Labor Party. I went back and had a look at some of the statements that had been made and how they stacked up to the reality. On 18 September 2002, in this House, in response to the ministerial statement on Iraq by the foreign minister, I said: The case has not been made for a link between Al-Qaeda, the Iraqi regime and the events of September 11. What is more, the case has not been made that there has been an escalation in the development of weapons of mass destruction which provide a clear and present danger, which is the appropriate term under the United Nations operations. My colleagues were saying the same thing at that time. We spoke of the importance of UN processes. It is very clear indeed that the UN weapons inspectors did a good job-Iraq had been effectively disarmed. Of course, one of the attractions of the US military machine in going to war was the knowledge that the greatest superpower the world has ever seen was engaged in a war against a military that had effectively been disarmed. It was not just in the parliament that those warnings against going to war were occurring. I was very proud to join perhaps half a million of my fellow Sydneysiders in the Walk Against the War on Sunday, 16 February. I wrote to my constituents, every single one of them, and encouraged them to participate in that walk. I received responses from people such as Alexandra Martyn, Jamie Shaw, Jane Bradfield, Julie Nyland, Paul Wilson, Ann Leahy, Sue Leahy, Kerry Murphy, Merilyn Fairskys and literally hundreds of other constituents of my electorate of Grayndler, all saying that they would be there with me on that day. I want to read just one email, because I think it is indicative of the sorts of responses I got. It is from Simon Abbott, whom I have never met. Simon lives in Marrickville, and back on 3 February 2003 he wrote: Dear AnthonyI just received your letter today titled “Iraq-time for peace”. I strongly agree with your stance and you have the support of both myself and my family on this issue. War is not the solution to the issue of Iraq. It does seem to be the solution for the United States (despite the protest of other countries) as it benefits their political and economic interests. It shouldn’t be our solution either and this needs to be said loud and clear. At the very least, John Howard in his eagerness to be led by GeorgeW Bush, is portraying Australia as just a lap dog of the US. At worse, he is involving Australia in the deaths of many innocent people and endangering the life’s of our military personnel. I’m often struck by the fact that despite the millions of life’s lost last century through war and conflict, that we (the human race) continue to utilise military action as a solution to the worlds problems. I have never written to a politician before, but the absolute stupidity of John Howard’s decision has compelled me to do so. I have never before took part in a demonstration but I will be there on February 16 at the Walk Against the War. All the best Anthony. Regards That was typical of the response of ordinary Australians, but the government could not see it. The government was determined to rush into this military action. MAIN COMMITTEE Another excuse that has been made retrospectively is: it does not matter about the WMD because we have had regime change. This is the ultimate retrospective analysis. It was never said-indeed, the opposite was said-prior to going to war. All of us in this parliament, every single man and woman in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, and indeed, I would hope, every Australian regarded Saddam Hussein as an evil tyrant and is glad to see him gone. But he is not the only evil tyrant in the world, and you do have to have orderly international relations and a process other than one country simply deciding unilaterally to remove another country’s leader. Throughout the world there are dictators who have been and who continue to be brutal butchers, yet the argument is not put that military action needs to be taken. The hypocrisy, given the arming of the Saddam Hussein regime by the United States in Iraq’s war against Iran, is quite breathtaking. The third defence that comes up is that of pre-emption-that if we did not take action then somehow there would be action against us or against some other nation which represented a threat to Iraq. It is quite clear that that is a nonsense argument. Indeed, the world is a less safe place because of the action in Iraq, and the intelligence assessments make it very clear that there is a greater possibility of terrorist action against Australia as a result of our participation in that war. I conclude my comments but I argue that the committee’s report is important. It is not just about analysing the past as an academic exercise. There is no more important decision than the decision to go to war, and it is important that we understand that the basis for going to war in Iraq was wrong. Grayndler, who has a deep commitment to the antiwar movement. I value the remarks that he has made. I welcome this opportunity to speak on and to take note of the report of the Joint Standing Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD on the inquiry into intelligence on Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction. As one of the limited number of members of the House who publicly opposed at every turn our involvement in the war at Iraq, it is very interesting to see what is being said now here in Australia, in the UK and in the USA, to read newspaper articles and journal articles and to see what I think is a remanufacturing of the truth. During the lead-up to the war, during our engagement and the subsequent pacification of Iraq by the coalition forces, I was inundated by emails, letters and phone calls. At the beginning, colleagues on both sides of the House told me that this correspondence was emanating only from the ‘crazies’, the left-wingers or the loonies and to disregard them all. How wrong they were! Despite the hysterical rush by many in this country to join the coalition of the willing and to join in the war against Iraq, there were many sane, normal, quietly spoken and thoughtful people who questioned our obscene haste. They and I were not blinded by the mirror that was shone in our faces-the mirror that spoke of the imminent and frightening unleashing of WMDs by Saddam Hussein. Despite the dossier that was delivered by Tony Blair to both the USA and Australia-a dossier that I might say was taken as almost an announcement from God on high-we who opposed the war were not seduced by the alleged facts contained within it. Then the three leaders started beating the drum of patriotism to try to ensure that the stragglers joined the Pied Piper’s line of complete compliance. To my mind, once you start to beat the drum of patriotism you start to lose. Those who refused to blindly acquiesce were laMAIN COMMITTEE",195,Unmovic To Those That Were Available To The Present Iraq Survey Group It Was Extraordi
300,Mr Quick (Franklin) (12.40 P.m.),"I am proud to follow the honourable member forbelled-and to my mind harshly so-‘un-Australian’; ‘unpatriotic’; ‘anti-American’; and, the worse slur of all, ‘tacit supporters of Saddam Hussein and all that he stood for’. My pacifism derives from the experiences of my father, who, as a young 18-year-old, had his birthday on the way to Gallipoli and then had the fortune, or misfortune, of being involved in the battle of Fromelle on the Western Front with 5,335 of his colleagues in the 58th, 59th and 60th battalions. It is interesting to see the member for Ballarat here; many of those young boys were from the Ballarat region. My father lay in no-man’s-land for a couple of days and a couple of nights and was invalided home at the ripe old age of 19. Because of that, his subsequent treatment and lots of other issues that I will not raise here, he became a pacifist, and I have followed his views. My white-armband protest saw me receive through the mail the ultimate emblem of cowardice-a white feather-which rather threw me. I remember my father telling me a wonderful story of one of his colleagues who received the VC at Lone Pine: Keith Dunstan’s father. Keith was a contributor to the Melbourne Sun-Herald for many years and his father got the VC at Lone Pine along with two or three others. He was invalided home and one day was riding on a tram in Melbourne in a suit-it must have been in about 1916 or 1917-when a young lady quietly walked up to him and, without saying a word, handed him a white feather. It was an assertion that, because he was an outwardly appearing healthy young Australian male, he should be ‘over there’ doing his bit. Little did she realise that he had almost given his life for his country and had received the greatest honour our country could bestow on a serviceman. In hindsight, the report entitled Intelligence on Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction gives us an inkling into the thoughts of those who are employed in our intelligence agencies. I might have been a bit harsh in the antiwar speeches I made in Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney and Hobart when declaring that ‘American intelligence’ was an oxymoron. I was rather harsh and cruel in my views of President George W. Bush. Upon his visit here I sought in some small way to alert him and the American administration to the fact that there were people who thought they had been fed lies in an effort to convince them to become involved in what they should not be involved in. It is interesting to see what has been written since. I am grateful to Anthony Lee from Queensland, who today emailed me regarding a couple of articles that have appeared. Being a busy MP, I do not necessarily get to read all articles that are published. He reminded me of another aspect of ‘if you’re not with us, you’re against us’. William Rivers Pitt, in his book entitled Selling Death for Fun and Profit, states: Theythe American administrationlied to the American people day after day after day about the nature of this non-existent threat, painting pictures of a rain of poison gas from Iraq pelting down on the innocent so as to scare people into line, and have suffered no consequences. Then probably one of the cruellest things that the Bush administration did was to destroy: ... the career of a deep-cover CIA agent in retaliation for the exposure of their lies, an agent running a network to keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of terrorists ... Once again, this administration has suffered no consequences. Finally, he states: MAIN COMMITTEE It is, as ever, the dead and maimed soldiers, along with their families, who have taken on the burden of suffering those consequences. The President of the United States is in campaign mode. It is interesting to see the new advertisements that he is putting on air to try and convince people that he should get a second term and Senator Kerry should not be given the chance to be President. Like many others in this world, I was horrified to see these as. The book Selling Death for Fun and Profit states: The new as are wretched enough. These are the as of George Bush: ground zero, the coffin, the firefighters-and the hand over the heart. It then states: Imagine Franklin Delano Roosevelt using images of the Pearl Habor attacks to frighten people into supporting him, and you will apprehend the gall of these new commercials. A recent editorial cartoon captured the essence of the matter nicely. It showed a grave and headstone reading ‘9/11 Victims’. Pounded into the soil of that grave is a sign reading ‘Vote Bush 2004’. To the side is George himself, hands folded, saying, ‘What? I thought the sign was tasteful.’ What has been the response in America to these disgusting and tasteless as? Harold Schaitberger, General President of the International Association of Fire Fighters, has said: I’m disappointed but not surprised that the President would try to trade on the heroism of those fire fighters in the September 11 attacks. … … … The use of 9/11 images are hypocrisy at its worse. Here’s a President that initially opposed the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, and now uses its first anniversary as cause to promote his re-election. What has happened here in Australia? I do not mind being vilified, but Air Marshal Ray Funnell, Chief of Air Staff from 1987 until 1992, told the Melbourne Age: “As someone who opposed the war ... I find it deeply offensive that I’m categorised as someone who wished Saddam to remain in power …” If you listen to the speeches of the honourable member for Mayo, our foreign minister, you will find such assertions and allegations. They suggest that there was no alternative other than going to war. There were alternatives, but they were not tried. Some of those alternatives may well have led to regime change. How would we ever know? General Peter Gration, Chief of the Australian Defence Force from 1987 to 1993, was similarly tarred with this unpatriotic, pro-Saddam Hussein brush. The Age reported: General Peter Gration ... said it was absurd and silly to argue that those who opposed the war wanted Saddam to remain in power. “I opposed the war because the Government’s case for going to war, which was based principally on the weapons of mass destruction, was unconvincing and weak. Our Government didn’t argue its case for war on the basis of regime change but, if they had, it would have been vigorously opposed ... it’s simply not acceptable international behaviour to take the extreme step of going to war without UN backing because you don’t like a particular regime, however bad it may be. I think the Government realised this and that’s why they didn’t use it as a principal argument.” We have had three inquiries, in the US, the UK and Australia. To my mind, even as a pacifist, the arguments to support our involvement have not been proven, but now the idea of preemption is out there. It was interesting to listen to the talk this morning at the parliamentary Christian breakfast by the chaplain of the armed services, Bishop Frame. He highlighted the fact that he has just written a book which will be launched on ANZAC Day, called-off the top MAIN COMMITTEE of my head-‘The Ethics of Pre-emption’, or something along those lines. We have now moved, and to my mind it is horrible, to this acceptance of pre-emption. As the honourable member for Grayndler said in his speech, all of us can think of two or three other leaders-even some who used to be in the Commonwealth of Nations-who are just as destructive, homicidal and anti their national interests, and who are still in our region. Are we going to get stuck into them, or are we just going to blindly follow our other two partners in the coalition of the willing? I urge not only the people in this place but the general Australian populace to read the excellent report released by the joint committee. There are some salutary lessons contained therein. Rather than following the Pied Piper, let us have a serious, long hard look before we involve ourselves in any other wars either in our region or in the far-flung regions of the world. I would like to think that we will seriously look at the truth before we commit our young people to another war. Debate interrupted. Main Committee adjourned at 12.56 p.m. MAIN COMMITTEE The following answers to questions were circulated: Government Departments: Legal Services (Question No. 2465) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 18 September 2003: Further to the answers to questions Nos 1620 to 1635 and 1637 (Hansard, 12 August 2003, page 18168) what are the Chief Executive Officers of the Minister’s departments and agencies doing to ensure that they do not retain the services of any barrister or solicitor who has previously been made bankrupt. Department of Treasury In accordance with Government policy, Treasury seeks not to engage legal counsel who have used insolvency as a means of avoiding tax. The Department can engage legal counsel both through the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS), which provides general legal services to the Department, and through private legal firms which are periodically engaged to provide legal services for specific tasks. When engaging counsel, AGS takes into account any available information suggesting that the counsel is insolvent and informs the Department accordingly. In such cases the Department would instruct AGS to check the National Personal Insolvency Index to confirm such information. Where this information was confirmed, the Department would then instruct AGS to seek to establish whether the insolvency was attributable to an intention to avoid taxes. In cases where private legal firms engage counsel on behalf of the Department, staff oversighting these contracts are required to notify the legal firm in question of the Government’s policy not to engage legal counsel who have used insolvency as a means of avoiding tax and to instruct the firm to pursue appropriate enquiries. Australian Accounting Standards Board The Australian Accounting Standards Board has primarily used the services of the Australian Government Solicitor to address legal issues since the AASB was established on 1 January 2000. It is presumed that the AGS staff comply with any requirements of the government in relation to their suitability and compliance with professional requirements so no specific action has been taken to review the background of the solicitor(s) involved. The AASB has on occasion retained the services of Mallesons Stephen Jaques for legal advice. Given the large size of the firm and their professional reputation and length of time in operation, no specific action was taken to review the background of the solicitor(s) involved. Australian Bureau of Statistics The Australian Bureau of Statistics has engaged a panel of nationally based legal firms through a public tender process. These legal firms were subjected to independent financial viability checks prior to their appointment to the ABS panel of legal advisers. Australian Competition and Consumer Commission The ACCC acquires its legal services from a panel of six national law firms. They are selected by means of a formal tendering process which, among other things, is designed to ensure the probity of successful tenderers. Following receipt of a copy of the Attorney-General’s letter of 6 March 2001 to all Ministers, each firm was formally instructed that the ACCC would not brief counsel who had been made bankrupt and that it was their obligation to ensure that any counsel who was being considered for briefing was not in fact a",197,Unmovic To Those That Were Available To The Present Iraq Survey Group It Was Extraordi
301,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:bankrupt. The ACCC regularly liaises with the firms and monitors this requirement as part of liaison discussions. Australian Prudential Regulation Authority In retaining barristers, APRA acts in accordance with AppendixD of the Attorney-General’s Legal Service Directions (‘Directions on Engagement of Counsel’). We also seek advice from the Office of Legal Services Coordination (OLSC) in the Attorney-General’s Department as to whether counsel under consideration have been briefed before by Commonwealth agencies and to obtain fee details. In almost all cases, APRA has briefed counsel on a list which OLSC maintains. Consistent with the Commonwealth policy, APRA is not aware of ever having briefed counsel who have used insolvency as a means of avoiding tax. In cases where APRA is instructing the Australian Government Solicitor to act on its behalf and counsel is retained, APRA takes advice from AGS as to counsel’s suitability for a particular matter. In such cases, where a particular counsel is seen as potentially suitable, AGS take into account any information which APRA provides to them or that is otherwise available to AGS suggesting that the counsel was insolvent. Australian Securities and Investments Commission ASIC is aware of Government policy that legal counsel who have used insolvency as a means of avoiding tax should not be retained on behalf of Commonwealth agencies such as ASIC. Such policy was expressed in a letter from the Attorney-General to the Treasurer dated 21 March 2001, a copy of which was forwarded to ASIC. In accordance with Government policy ASIC will not retain a barrister or solicitor if it is aware that the barrister or solicitor has used insolvency as a means of avoiding tax. Prior to retaining counsel ASIC, as a standard procedure, contacts the Office of Legal Services Coordination (OLSC) in the Attorney General’s Department. That contact is necessary to ensure that ASIC is complying with Government policy on counsel fees. The OLSC provides ASIC with details taken from OLSC’s database about the appropriate level of fees to be paid to the particular counsel proposed to be retained. ASIC understands that counsel who are known to have used insolvency as a means of avoiding tax are removed from the OLSC database. If ASIC otherwise had reason to be concerned about the insolvency history of particular counsel it can also conduct a search by requesting the Insolvency and Trustee Service (ITSA), which is part of the Attorney-General’s Department, to examine the history of particular counsel. ASIC will then take that history into account in its decision of whether or not to retain counsel. ASIC also notes that entry to the legal profession is a matter regulated by the States and Territories and each of the States and Territories has laws and regulations dealing with legal practitioners who have committed acts of bankruptcy. Australian Taxation Office In the majority of cases, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) retains its barristers through the office of the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS). In such instances, the ATO is reliant on the checking processes utilised by AGS. AGS engages Counsel consistently with the requirements set out in the Legal Services Directions issued by the Attorney General’s Department pursuant to section 55ZF of the Judiciary Act. The directions do not identify steps which a Commonwealth agency or its lawyers can take to enquire that barristers have not used bankruptcy as a means of avoiding taxation obligations. Wherever possible, AGS relies on existing knowledge of a barrister’s reputation and, in particular, that the barrister has not used bankruptcy as a means of avoiding taxation obligations. Similarly, in those instances where the ATO directly briefs a barrister, the ATO relies on prior knowledge of the barrister’s reputation that they have not used bankruptcy as a means of avoiding taxation obligations. The Commissioner is currently seeking advice from the Attorney-General’s Department about the circumstances in which it would be appropriate not to engage a barrister or solicitor who has previously been made bankrupt, and also about the means by which the Commissioner can obtain reliable information about whether a barrister or solicitor has previously been made bankrupt. Corporations & Markets Advisory Committee The Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee does not retain the services of any barrister or solicitor. National Competition Commission The National Competition Council engages barristers and solicitors on the basis of their qualifications and experience, and suitability to represent the Council in the matter concerned. The Council has no specific prohibition against retaining Counsel who have been previously made bankrupt, but it is unlikely that such a person would be considered suitable to represent the Council. Superannuation Complaints Tribunal All Solicitors/Barristers briefed are checked before we engage them. Productivity Commission Since 1999 the Productivity Commission has sought legal advice exclusively from the Australian Government Solicitor whose employees are taken as meeting the necessary standards of professionalism. If the Commission has cause to seek advice beyond the Australian Government Solicitor, it would take the necessary steps to satisfy itself as to the professionalism of the legal service provider. Finance and Administration and Special Minister of State: Conclusive Certificates (Question No. 2922 and 2935) Mr Danby asked the Minister representing the Minister for Finance and Administration and the Minister representing the Special Minister of State, upon notice, on 10 February 2004: (1) How many conclusive certificates has the Minister issued under each of sections 33, 33A, and 36 of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 in each of the last six financial years. (2) In each of the last six financial years, how many appeals against those certificates were (a) lodged with the AAT, (b) successful, and (c) unsuccessful. (3) What are the case names of all the appeals lodged with the AAT in each of the last six financial years. swer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Neither the Special Minister of State nor I have issued any conclusive certificates under sections 33, 33A or 36 of the Freedom of Information Act 1982.

(3) Can he explain why he took this attitude to negotiations over the Greater Sunrise gas field. (4) Would he deprive East Timor of this source of revenue for 20, 40, or 50 years so the East Timorese would agree.

(2)-(3) It would be inappropriate to comment on the details of confidential bilateral discussions. (4) With the entry into force of the Timor Sea Treaty and the conclusion of an International Unitisation Agreement for Greater Sunrise, there is already in existence a legal framework for developing the petroleum resources of the Timor Sea for the mutual benefit of both East Timor and Australia. The Treaty gives East Timor 90 per cent of production from the Joint Petroleum Development Area (JPDA). Revenues as a result of this distribution will be a major contribution to creating a sound economic base and long-term stability in East Timor. (5) Following scoping talks on the maritime boundary delimitation process, formal negotiations are due to commence in April this year. Defence: Military Awards (Question No. 3005) Mr Brendan O’Connor asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 11 February 2004: (1) Is the Government committed to monitoring the issue of military awards and ensuring that any genuine anomalies brought to its attention are rectified as soon as possible. (2) Were any anomalies with medal entitlements brought to the Minister’s attention in 2003; if so, what were these anomalies and what was the Government’s response. (1) Yes. (2) No. However, there have been a number of perceived anomalies presented, but none have been yet assessed as genuine anomalies in accordance with existing policy. Veterans: Vietnam (Question No. 3006) Mr Brendan O’Connor asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 11 February 2004: (1) Is the Minister aware that the Nominal Roll of Vietnam Veterans has been extended to be in line with the definition of Warlike Service to include Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel who served in Vietnam after the signing of the Paris Agreement on 27 January 1973 until the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975.

304,Mr Brough,"The answer to the member’s question is as follows:in Vietnam under Australian Operational Command; if not, why not; if so, when does the Minister intend to inform eligible Vietnam Veterans of their entitlements. (1) Yes. (2) No. The Australian campaign medals awarded for service in South Vietnam between 1962 and 1973 are the Imperial General Service Medal with Clasp ‘South Vietnam’ (1962-64), the Vietnam Medal (1964-73) and the Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal (1964-73). These medals recognise Australia’s effort during the campaign of the Free World Military Forces (FWMF) to repel communist forces in their attempt to conquer South Vietnam. This campaign, which involved active combat duties and postings to Vietnam of 12 months, concluded with the signing of the Agreement to End the War and Restoring Peace in Vietnam (The Paris Agreement) on 27 January 1973. On 28 March 1975, the Australian Government made available Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) personnel and aircraft for use in a humanitarian role in Vietnam and other parts of South-East Asia with the United Nations. The task, which lasted only a matter of weeks, was to ferry supplies and materials intended to meet immediate critical human needs. They were also used in the transport of orphans from Vietnam to Australia and finally in the evacuation of the Australian Embassy in April 1975 during the fall of Saigon. These short activities were not a campaign, nor did they involve active combat duties like the earlier period of Australian involvement during period 1962 to 1973 with the FWMF. For this service, former RAAF personnel are awarded the Australian Active Service Medal (AASM) with Clasp ‘Vietnam 1975’, which is equal in status to the AASM 1945-75 with Clasp ‘Vietnam’ for the earlier period. The Vietnam Medal was not established to recognise RAAF service in 1975 and, therefore, is not warranted given the distinctly different nature of that service. Recognition for service in Vietnam is well established and documented, and therefore does not need to be separately advised to Vietnam veterans.",204,Questions On Notice
