Whether he does not think that allowing drawbacks on the undermentioned imported materials, upon their being exported in a manufactured state, is calculated to operate against the use of similar materials which are or may be produced within the Commonwealth, viz :(a) Cloth used in the manufacture of clothing i (i) Rough timber imported and dressed within the Commonwealth; (c) Rough timber used in the manufacture of Venetian blind laths; (d) Shooks and ends imported and manufactured into casks, provided that such casks are used in the export trade; (e) Peas (whole) split within the Commonwealth? 2. When considering the allowing of drawbacks on the above, or at any other time, was the matter of allowing drawbacks on meat wraps used in the export trade considered? able member's questionsr. The general principle acted upon is, as far as practicable, to secure the use of Australian produce in the manufacture of goods for export. On the other hand, it is considered desirable to retain (and increase if possible) the export trade of the Commonwealth. In regard to (a), it has always been the practice to allow drawback on the cloth used in manufactures. As to (b) and (c), it is understood that the Australian timber is not suitable for the particular manufactures for which the imported timber is As to (d), a large export trade is done in articles for which casks have to be used. The object of the drawback is to allow of the return of such As to (e), the object was to encourage the exIt must be remembered that under the Customs free.

Whether he will take steps to subdivide New South Wales into six districts, and direct each inspector to reside in the district over which he has control? able member, I have to state : 1. Six inspectors are provided -for; there are at present five actually employed, and there is a vacancy to be filled. 2. All the inspectors reside in or near Sydney. 3. Steps are now being taken to subdivide New South Wales into districts, and to direct each inspector to reside in the district under his control. BILL.

At the same time, I have, from the outset, taken up a very definite attitude with regard to the Bill, and I have acted consistently throughout. Honourable members opposite cannot expect to have all their own way in carrying out their preconceived ideas. If their object were achieved, and the Bill were passed in its original form, the control of the organizations formed for the purposes of the Bill, would f a l l into the hands of the trades unionists. A number of instances have been given of the tyranny and exclusiveness of the unions, and these may well make any reasonable man pause before giving them the sole control of the organizations required under the Bill. We have been told by Ministers themselves, that a few years ago. the Wharf Labourers' Union in Sydney closed its books, and fixed its entrance fee at £ 5 , and that the coal lumpers did the same thing. South Wales Arbitration Act came into 1 force. formed that a few months ago, three men were told that under an award given by the Arbitration Court in New South Wales, they could not retain their employment, unless they became members of the Wharf Labourers' Union. sion to that body, and tendered their, subscription, but were kept for months dancing attendance on the union officials, and in the meantime had to subsist on 15s. a week instead of 35s. a week which they had previously been able to earn. This unjust treatment was meted out to the men by the union of which the Minister of External Affairs is President, and although that honourable and learned member said that he did not approve of what had been done, he failed to show us that he had attempted to apply a corrective. effect. Minister that he did not approve of what has been done, but it would have been much more to his credit if he had endeavoured to induce the union to take the proper course. bers his Word; he could produce no further evidence. 5K the Arbitration Court compelled the union to admit the applicants. But why should we have to wait for the Court to take action in such acase. We should make distinct provision in the Bill itself which would* guard against anything of that kind happening in the future. We must remember that all such legislation is largely experi-. mental, and that opinions differ .with regard to the success of similar measures passed by the States Legislatures. The experience gained under those Acts should make us extremely careful in framing this measure. It may be said that it will be easy for us, if we find that the Bill works well, to pass another measure which would have the effect of extending its operation; but I think that for the present caution should be our watchword. Honourable members on this side have been told that their object is to destroy trades unions, and-that the amendments now before us form part of an insidious attempt to bring about that result. I think that such charges are utterly unworthy of the Prime Minister and the other honourable members who have made them. No such' idea actuates honourable members on this side of the Chamber. have already made that admission, notably the honourable member for New England. honourable members are entirely opposed to They sought admisthe measure, the fact that the great majority of honourable members are in favour of the Bill was clearly demonstrated when the motion for the second reading was passed without a division. We know that the trades unions have had the effect of uplifting the workmen, and that their operations have culminated in the passing of such measures as that now before us. If such legislation is properly framed and administered, the necessity for unionism, as we have understood it in the past, should cease, and the organizations formed for the special purposes of the Bill should suffice. The organizations should be under the absolute control of the Court. Any endeavour to graft the existing trades unions on to the organizations required for the purposes of the Bill would be like putting new wine into old bottles. We should start afresh, and provide for organizations formed on such lines that no friction can occur.

I claim that power of exclusion referred to by the honorhonorable members upon this side of the able member. anything of the proposal. posed by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat would meet the case. that the door is left open for all those who desire admission to the organizations under the Bill, and that absolute fair play is extended in the future. sary provision should be made in the Bill. anything in the nature of legislative boycotting. The organization should be solely under the control of the Court, which should keep a complete industrial roll, and should be in a position to offer every man a chance to add his name to the list. The events of the past may well make honourable members somewhat apprehensive of the future unless proper safeguards are provided. We have heard something of the exclusiveness of trades unions, and of the misery and poverty which have been occasioned by it. We desire to remedy that state of affairs if we can. Why do Ministers object to the amendments which are now under consideration? Personally, I think that by acting thus they believe that (their dignity will be wounded. They have beld up this Bill to the trades unions as one which will confer enormous benefits upon them by giving them a controlling influence over industrial organizations, and they do not wish to return to the unions and admit that Parliament has foiled them in that attempt. They do not display as much interest in the Bill nowas they did formerly, because we hear threats that, in the event of their defeat upon these amendments, it will be laid aside. At present they are more concerned in retaining the favour of the trades unions which have supported them in the past. The Prime Minister has told us that, the organizations contangible. Why should they be more intangible than are the existing organizations? In my judgment they ought to be much more real and tangible, because, if formed upon proper lines, they will embrace the whole of the workers of the Commonwealth, and not one-sixth or oneseventh of them, as do the present trades unions. The honourable gentleman declares that we have lost sight of the basis upon chamber are adhering to that basis. It is the Ministry and their supporters who have lost sight of it, and who are acting according to their own preconceived ideas. We are told that, for executing the decrees of the Court, we must depend upon existing organizations. Why should that be so? The present trades unions have simply to effect a few alterations in their rules, and apply to be registered under the Bill. There is no question as to their destruction involved in the amendments. They are at liberty to retain their integrity and solidity for all purposes other than the purposes of this Bill, should they desire to do so. member think that they are the best judges of what they want? ascertain what the great body of the workers want, and not merely what the trades unions want. The honourable member is the mouth-piece of those organizations, but honourable members upon this side of the chamber are the mouth-piece of the country at large. In my judgment, the Prime Minister made one remark last evening which has an absolutely sinister meaning. He said that the tiades unions were required for the "" policing"" of the Act. That is rather a peculiar phrase to employ. It seems to me to imply that the members of the various trades unions will require to exercise a close vigilance, to the extent almost of espionage, upon their fellow-workers, if the Act is to be administered in its intergrity. It constitutes a reflection upon the Court.",15,Conciliation And Arbitration

We merely wish to restrict them to their legitimate functions. I would remind the Committee that at the present time only a tithe of the workers are members of trades unions.

No one wishes to rob them of the right to take part in politics. Whether as individuals or as unions they have the same right to engage in politics for their own advancement as has any other class, and no sane man would attempt to deprive them of it. The honourable and learned member, however, wishes to place their political rules, as well as the political, and the other resolutions, the existence of which'is admitted by the Prime Minister, under the .segis of the Court, in order to strengthen them under it. before the Chair are fundamentally the same. The honourable and learned member for Angas, the honourable and learned member for Corinella, and the honourable member for Darling Downs have really combined and advocate the same principle. Their proposals are in principle the same. The honourable and learned member for Angas says that unions should be required to eliminate from their rules the objectionable features which characterize them before being permitted to register under the measure; the honourable and learned member for Corinella says, in effect, to the organizations, "" We shall allow you to register, leaving your rules intact; but you shall not be permitted to bring a case before the Courtunless you eliminate any political provisions from your rules."" The Prime Minister and his new colleagues say to the unions, "" You must eliminate from your rules the provisions to which objection is taken before you. obtain a preference."" Which of these does the Prime Minister most desire? Does he wish unionists to have a preference or to be kept out of the Court altogether? The difference between the several amendments is the difference between tweedledum and tweedledee. jury to any one until a union asked for a preference ? jured if we provided that these provisions should be excised from the rules of the unions before they sought an award? is evading my question. a Scotchman usually replies to a question It seems to me * that the difference between the several amendments before us is not worth fighting over. If the Government are prepared to give up the demand for preference for the sake of bringing the unions under the Court, they might very well go a little further and accept the amendment proposed by the honourable and learned member for Corinella.

All that is necessary in order to bring it into line with the proposal made by the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs is to omit the words "" submit any industrial dispute to the Court,"" and to insert in lieu thereof the words "" any preference."" If the Government are sincere in their desire to pass this Bill, and to give the workers the benefit of such a measure, they will not stumble over so small a difference, but accept the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella, and thus secure, not a divided, but a united Committee on the question. already become historical, and I am of opinion that it will play a still more important part in the history of Commonwealth politics. It was launched in the last Parliament, and I know of no other measure-no t even the Tariff Bill-that has met with so stormy a passage. every possible stage it has been contested, and in some cases opposition has been offered by honourable members who vigorously protest that their only desire is to assist the class that it is intended to benefit. The history of the measure is remarkable. The right honourable member for Adelaide, arobust and ah earnest democrat, retired from the Ministry of which he was a member, rather than submit to the introduction of the Bill in what he considered to be a mutilated form, and even his political opponents must admire him for his candour and his earnest belief in the principles to which he desires to give legislative effect. There are other honourable . members who are equally strong in their support of the B ill, and I can conceive of their fighting for it, not only in this House, but on the hustings. I cannot for one moment believe that the Minister who has charge of the B ill could do otherwise than fight even more strenuously than he has done, not only in this Chamber, but on the public platforms of Australia, in support of a principle which he has so often advocated. We are now told that the stumbling-block to the passage of the Bill is the proposal to give a preference to unionists. Some weeks ago, the honourable member for Lang moved a direct amendment against the giving of a preference to unionists. On that amendment, the Government won by a majority of eleven votes, but since then we have had various other proposals in a similar direction. The amendment moved two weeks ago by the honourable and learned member for Corinella, as well as that which he has now brought forward, -and the one moved by the honourable and learned member for Angas, embody the same idea, and although, as compared with the original amendment, they are well-watered proposals, they are really designed to restrict the provision as to preference to unionists. The battle has been raging round the question of preference and the political character of trades unions. I propose to deal with the question of preference. The right honourable member for East Sydney asked last night why should the proposal to give a preference to trades unionists be considered a vital portion of the Bill, when unionists represent only one-sixth of the community? And he argued very skilfully from that stand-point against the principle. The granting of a preference to unionists is not a new proposal. The principle has already been embodied in the Arbitration Acts of At New South Wales, New Zealand, and Western Australia, and is provided for in all measures of this character. What is the position to-day? Do we hear any outcry on the part of the people of New South Wales against the preference provisions of the State Arbitration Act? New South Wales is now on the eve of a general election, and if there were any serious dissatisfaction with the State Act we should surely have some evidence of it. As a matter of fact, however, there is not one party or even a candidate standing as an opponent of the measure, or urging its amendment or repeal. I do not mean to say that murmurs of dissatisfaction with the Arbitration Court of New South Wales have not been heard. I have heard many expressions of dissatisfaction, and neither unionists nor non-unionists agree with the way in which various cases have been dealt with by the Court. But no attempt has been made by any party to secure the repeal or even the amendment of the Act. It cannot, therefore, be said that the danger of giving a preference to unionists has been evidenced in the administration of the New South Wales Act, to such an extent as would warrant us in opposing this proposal. The honourable and learned member for Corinella has referred to the position of a powerful union. I take the liberty to say that if we omitted the",18,Conciliation And Arbitration
52,Mr Wilks (Dalley),"This B ill haspreference provision of this Bill, not one powerful union would register under it. The more powerful they are, both numerically and financially, the greater is the difficulty am not a member of the Labour Party. I in inducing them to subscribe to a Conciliation and Arbitration Act. to the State. with that phase of the question. One would think from the arguments of some honourable member's that the one aim of trades unionists was to be brought under such a measure as this. As a matter of fact, trades unions in New South Wales were strongly opposed to the arbitration process at the outset. Powerful unions, like the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, the Iron Trades Union, and the Shipwrights' Society, in particularwhich are numerically strong, including practically all the skilled workmen in their trades-di d not voluntarily submit to the Court. . If the principle of preference to unionists were destroyed, I feel certain that they would refuse to register under the Act.' the Bill stands they would not be prevented from getting preference. unions of which I am speaking would not have registered under the New South Wales Acti f there had been no preference. Indeed, it was with the greatest difficulty that their leaders induced them to register in any case. They knew that they were surrendering the right to strike, and also their right to refuse to work with non-unionists. Those were two important principles which they surrendered in the interest of public peace and the. general welfare. Of course, the weaker unions gain, but the stronger unions are like the stronger masters, absolutely in favour of the right of their associations to take. their own course. They would have preferred to retain the right to strike, and to refuse to work, with men who did not belong to their societies. have surrendered those two principles, preference is not given to them, their inducement to register will be gone. It has been said that the peace and welfare of the community are conserved by an Arbitration Bill. That is so. But, if this Bill is amended as proposed, and the Government accept it in that form, and if in consequence the powerful unions refuse to register, the class hatred which it is desired to destroy will be stimulated to a much greater extent than we have ever heard of in Australia. I support the measure, although I am in full sympathy with the Government in reference to it, although I refuse to be drawn at the heels of the Labour Party, or even of my own party. But I have some knowledge of trades unions such as those to which I have referred. I have been acquainted with them for many years. I think that if some of the legal members of this Chamber had a greater practical acquaintance with the working of unions, many of the remarks which have been made concerning them would not have been made. We have been led to believe that the sole object of men banded together in trades unions is to overreach their fellow men, and to make their corporations monopolies. That is not so. I admit that the unions with which I am acquainted havetheir weaknesses and their abuses. No one who knows anything about them can contend that their methods cannot be improved upon. But no man who has any knowledge can say of them that their sole object is to promote their own advantage at the-public expense. The, political flavour which the unions are supposed to have has been much dis cussed. Many honourable members oppose the principle of preference, except the political powers of the unions are'clipped.' Others say that they will not vote for any provision that is' not applied to non-unionists and unionists alike. It seems to me that many honourable members are hot so much concerned with regard to the political leanings or prejudices of the trades unions as they are influenced by the fear that the political power of the unions may be used against their party at election time. But that idea will not stand the test of investigation. Take the electorate which I have had the privilege to represent, not only in the Commonwealth Parliament, but for many years previously in the State Parliament. I suppose there is no constituency in the Commonwealth Buti f , when they where the branches of the unions which I ' have mentioned are stronger than in the electorate of Dalley. I may, therefore, be looked upon as a shocking example of the test which I am going to apply. Buti f the unions have any political flavour or colouring, certainly a great number of their members voted for me as against the labour candidate. The truth is that the members of trades unions do not sell their political views as readily as some honourable mem-",19,Conciliation And Arbitration

56,Mr Wilks,"I know that the tradesbers believe; and the machine politics which they are afraid of do not exist amongst the unions of Australia,so far as I know them. Take the Society of Engineers. A large proportion of the members of that society are as cool, levelheaded Scotchmen as is the honourable member for Echuca. They do not part with their political beliefs at the dictation of their union leaders. They record their votes as freely as does the honourable member. In the ranks of that union there are protectionists who will fight for protection to the bitter end; there are also free traders who will fight for free-trade; and there are Socialists. They do not march to the polls to vote for this candidate or that at the instance' of any labour leader. It simply is not a fact that the members of the unions are prepared to sell their political birth right for a mess of pottage. No man who belongs to a union surrenders his political rights in any way. Nor would they do so under this Bill. A similar clause to that which the Committee has been debating for some days exists in the New South Wales Act. But there the members of the unions individually and collectively vote according to their political principles, as opposed to what may be regarded as trades union policy. Sir come from the section in New South Wales or in New Zealand. we should find the leader of the State Opposition, Mr Carruthers, at the time of a general election, advocating the repeal or the amendment of the measure. views, Mr Carruthers supports the measure, and says it is working well. says is that he is going to give the Act a fair trial, and allow it to work out its own destiny. Mr Carruthers is the leader of a party, and is asking the electors to return him as State Premier; but he makes no appeal on the question' of preference to unionists. And that is in a country where the people are not all unionists, but where, according to the right honourable member for,East Sydney, the unionists number only one-sixth of the workers. If non-unionists were so badly treated under the New South Wales Act, I am sure that at tfie present time there would be no lack of appeals to the electors on their behalf. Every honourable member who has addressed the Committee has expressed his belief in unionism as an uplifting and grand institution. But when they are asked to do something for unionism, they refuse, asserting that they do so in the interests of non-unionists. Honourable members,, while describing unionism as a beautiful idea, and declaring that if they were workmen, they would themselves belong to unions, refuse to do anything for the institution of which they express such high approval. Even the members of the late Deakin Government disown their own child. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat fathered a Bill which included this very clause; the proposal before us is not the handicraft of the present Government, but is a remnant from the last Ministry. This is not a WatsonB ill it is not a Bill of Watson, the Labour man and trades unionist; but is a B ill introduced by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat in the interests of the general community, after Cabinet deliberation and reconstruction.

102,Mr Wilks,"Every trades unionistThere are hundreds of freelabourers who, as the Prime Minister said not long ago, refuse to join trades unions, not because they are men of a strongly, individualistic type of character who believe in absolute freedom of action, but for quite other reasons ; men who are content to enjoy the higher wages and the better conditions of living which have been gained by the influence of trades unions, without being ready to pay for them. That has been termed a harsh statement, but it is a truthful one. -Hundreds of men are non-unionists because they are unwilling to pay the necessary fees, although they accept the benefits whicb trades unionism has conferred upon them. I am not trying to compel men to join unions. My allegiance to my party is as strong as that of any honourable member; but there are times when I must take a separate stand, and if I do not allow myself to be compelled by party considerations, I shall not seek to compel others. Trades unionists have made their blunders; but my knowledge of trades unionism in New South Wales makes me know that they have served a useful purpose in the industrial life of Australia. I have heard it said that the leaders of trades unions often stir up strife; but I have known many instances in which they have been opposed to "" projected strikes, which have been brought about by the rank and file of the unions. It is not the middle aged, level-headed unionists who are always ready to strike, but the more buoyant and youthful spirits in the unions. The unions are gradually remedying and improving their conditions; but, if the Government accept an amendment which will prevent them from interfering in politics, no union will register under the Bill. ' If the New -South Wales Act were amended in that direction, the unions now registered would refuse to re-register, and Australia ' would be plunged again into the cauldron of strife and trouble. New South Wales, within the last nine months, a good object lesson has been taught to non-unionists in an industry which employs between 2,500 and 2,800 persons. The employers, who pay,' perhaps, the best wages, and give, perhaps, the best conditions obtaining in the industry in Australia, have had only two struggles with their men in the past twenty-two years; but when they tried to reduce the wages of unionists, these men have been able to successfully resist the attempt, whereas the non-unionist workmen have been compelled to accept a reduction. In New South Wales the masters, particularly in the iron trades, are combining, and are seeking to bring .about a 10 per cent, reduction in wages, although if the Tariff benefited the manufacturers they should certainly have received an advantage from it. The unionists, however, by their inherent force, and because of their ultimate right of appeal to the Arbitration Court, have successfully resisted this reduction. Would any man who knows of these things cast a vote against the principle of preference to unionists, upon the excuse that every man in the community should be allowed to work? When unionists have been compared with non-unionists in this debate, anumber of persons who are masters, or public servants, or wives and daughters of men who are not forced to call upon their families to maintain themselves, are classed with the latter ; but, if, on the one side, we put the unionists and those who sympathize with unionism, with their wives and daughters, and on the other side the non-unionists proper, the difference would be nothing like what' it has been represented to be. That statement is best proved by the result of the recent elections, especially of the Senate elections. But were all the votes which were cast for the members of the Government and,their -supporters the votes of trades unionists? Were they not rather the votes of trades unionists and of those who sympathized with trades unionism; the votes of men who would join trades unions if they could do so? Every year new societies are coming within the domain of trades unionism. The members of one Ministry have already resigned over this Bill, and the present Ministry, if they value the opinions of the workers and of the masses of the community, will adhere firmly to its provisions, and even resign rather than accept undue interference. I am pleased that the Prime Minister has intimated that he will do that. If he resigns, he will have to stand before those to whom alone he can look for support. I care not for the mouthings we have heard about the beauties of trades unionism and its elevating influence. Now is the occasion to test belief in trades unionism. Those who believe in it will vote to give preference to unionists, while those who fear that this new force will put down the class t<^ which they belong, and destroy their political power, will vote",24,William Lyne N O Injury Has Pressing Sympathy

104,Mr Wilks,"I know that it is so. Inagainst it. I am prepared to take my stand with the unionists, though it would be easier and simpler for me to fight with my party against them, because I expect no advantage from supporting the Labour Party. I have fought that party for years, and will continue to do so, because I am a strong individualist, and they have in their platform planks to which I cannot subscribe. worker, and could demand entrance to a trades union, I would join one to-morrow.

The honourable and learned members for Indi, Darling Downs, and others are no more ast sociated with their class and calling than I am with mine. right honourable member for East Sydney to the proposal in the Bill is not a new thing. He has been opposed to such provisions for many years past, and has a right to his own views. But I also have the right to take what I think to be the proper stand in this matter. able members say that they have no desire to injure trades unions, and are fighting the battles of trades unions; but it will be found that if the Bill is passed as it stands the workers will flock into trades unions instead of leaving them. hand, if this Bill and the States Acts are destroyed, we shall have a repetition of the industrial anarchy which prevailed ten or twenty years ago. Any one who has seen the action of a strike, with its aftermath of suffering on the part of women and children, will know how undesirable that is. The power to strike is, as the right honourable member for East Sydney has said, a terrible weapon; but if the unionists cannot go to the Arbitration Courts they will use it, and probably in a barbarous manner. I believe in this measure, because it encourages unions to register and take advantage of the Court, and thus tends to avert a serious struggle. I do not wish to speak as an alarmist, but I ask Ministers and the supporters of the Bill if they do not know that if provision is not made for preference to unionists, and arbitration is destroyed, we may have the biggest industrial struggle Australia has yet known. Today in New South Wales the unions are hanging to the Arbitration Court by a small thread. If honourable members think that trades unionists desire to have the Bill passed, they are making the biggest mistake of their lives. A poll of the trades unionMr Wilks. ists of New South Wales would show that they would be strongly inclined to get away from the State Arbitration Court, and if .no preference is given to them under this Bill, I am satisfied that they will not register under it. The Prime Minister has done all he can in the interests of peace, and in the interests of the very class whom honourable members on this side largely reBut if I were an ordinary present. of the whole community, to avert the has spoken. public have, from"" time to time, recommended trades unionists to adopt constitutional methods of attaining their ends. First, it The opposition of the was suggested that they should send representatives 'ijito Parliament, and then that they .should try to secure the establishment of an Arbitration Court, so that industrial disputes might be settled peacefully, rather than by the barbaric methods of the strike. Now that the trades unions Honorhave adopted constitutional means they are to be denied the preference to members of their organizations-to which they are fully entitled by virtue of the consideration they have shown for the well-being of the community as a whole. The honourable memOn the other ber for Gippsland referred to the conditions which exist in the rural industries. He told us that no strikes had ever occurred in these industries. How could there be a strike among the agricultural labourers unless they were organized ? How could Bill Brown, working in a dairy, strike on his own account, and extend the industrial dispute to New South Wales; or how could Bill Smith, working on a farm in Queensland, enter upon a dispute with his employer, and extend its scope to South Aus* tralia? There are no trades unions in rural industries, and therefore there is no danger of a strike occurring; but if the agricultural labourers were organized and could exercise the power of striking, the honourable member for Gippsland and others who are interested in rural industries would be anxious' to bring them within the scope of the Bill. We have heard a great deal about the boycotting for which the trades unions have been responsible, but I would point out that the proprietors of very influential newspapers in Sydney recently entered upon a boycott upon their own account. These newspapers have granted that trades unionism is all right up to a certain point;",25,William Lyne N O Injury Has Pressing Sympathy

The Government certainly have no intention to shirk a division on the subject. Thev desire to know exactly the feeling of the Committee. Prime Minister last night appears to me to go as f a r as any Ministry could go and still retain its self-respect. The Prime Minister expressed his willingness to insert a provision in the clause with regard to preference to the effect that no organization shall apply for preference if it has anything of -a political character in its constitution. That proposal is placed before honourable members to accept or reject, and it is for them to say whether or not the Prime Minister has reasonably met the objections to this clause. It will be observedI do not say it unkindly-that those who have honestly and avowedly declared themselves as havingno faith in legislation of this kind have expressed their intention to vote for the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella. To our minds this fact affords conclusive proof that the amendment would have the effect of injuring the Bill. We have come here for the purpose of cutting the claws of the oppressor, but now an attempt is being made to sharpen the claws of the oppressor by inserting the amendment of the honourable' and learned member for Corinella. oppression comes. We want to do away with oppression from either side. There is no doubt, however, that the oppression comes from the stronger, and not from the weaker, and that all the talk we hear about freedom of contract simply means that we should leave to the stronger the power to oppress the weaker. to me that a great deal of ignorance has been shown in some quarters as to the history and trend of the trades union movement. know what trades unions have been, what they are, and what their tendency is _ in England, America, and Australia, struggling to prevent trades unions from taking an interest in politics. Even in England, where politicians have a number of matters other than social affairs to attend to, the trades unions have to keep their eyes open to the movements in Parliament. How much I want honourable members to greater must be the necessity for watchfulness on the part of the trades unions here, where all our politics are industrial, where not a single movement in politics that interests the people as a whole, does not directly bear upon the industries and the livelihood of the workers. In Webb's Industrial Democracy, volume II . , page 839, the The offer made by the writer refers to this aspect of trades unionism. He saysIn the democratic State of the future, the trades unionists may be expected to be conscious of their own special function in the political world, and to busy themselves primarily with its fulfilment. First in importance to every section, we put the establishment of a national minimum of education, sanitation, leisure, and wages. With us, all these matters are political, sanitation, education, leisure, which means holidays, and wages. How could we expect a union, formed for the purpose of bettering the conditions of its members in the trade in which they are engaged, to close its eyes to the political movements in our Parliaments? Our legislation is industrial or nothing. Mr Webb goes on to sayBut the systematic re-handling of the Factories and Workshops, Mines, Railways, Shops, and Merchant Shipping Acts, which is involved in this conception of a national minimum, will , as we have explained, only secure the base of the pyramid. Then on page 840, he saysThe Federal Executive of the trade union world would find itself defending complete freedom of association, and carefully watching every development of legislation or judicial interpretation to see that nothing was made criminal or actionable when done by a trade union 01 its officials, which would not be criminal or actionable if done by a partnership of traders in pursuit of their own gain.

It is perfectly trueas has been stated-that in this country particularly) politics are very largely industrial matters. It does not follow, however, that unless trades organizations under this Bill are authorized to play a partin election campaigns their members lose a single civil right which they now possess. As a matter of fact, they do not. The proposal under consideration provides that it is only tiacles unions as such, whose intrusion into the political sphere is to be limited..

It may be that, standing at the table in the heat of discussion, I have failed to grasp their real import, but, as far as I do understand them they are irrelevant. to remark that last evening the Prime Minister opened up a more serious question. In one or two of his observations I do not think that he did justice to himself,. and. certainly he failed to do justice to me. I do not propose to repeat the history of this Bill. We all know the troubled circum-. stances under which it first came into my hands. After having had an opportunity of further considering it, I have expressed my doubts and reservations regarding it. I do not desire to reiterate them. If I had political, constitutional, or continued in charge of the Bill, sitting upon the other side of the table instead of upon this, I should have been obliged to receive and meet amendments from all quarters. I should have done so to the best of my ability. I should have carried the Bill with as little alteration as possible. I should have accepted amendments which I thought better expressed I think that they meet the objects of. the Bill, and should have resisted any proposal which was aimed at any.of the important purposes it was destined to achieve. I shall All the unions do do so still. Last evening, the Prime Minister, speaking to me directly, in accents of some bitterness, referred to the manner But there is no reason in which I have dealt with this measure.

138,Mr Deakin,"Precisely . When honmeasure finished by so high an authority, I feel constrained to ask the Prime Minister why he considered it necessary to introduce four pages of amendments in such a perfect work? would become the Minister's Bill. It has already been made a Ministerial measure by the omission of some six or eight of the clauses that it contained when it left the hands of the right honourable member for Adelaide, by the omission of the provision for two permanent members of the Court, to whose appointment he attached great importance, by the proposal that disputes shall be dealt with when they are only likely to extend to another State, and by striking out the provision for the maximum penaltyhe intended. All these are important and vital alterations, and the Government are entitled to make them. tions in our Bill. a Bill that we are told is the masterpiece of a draftsman who understands this subject better than any one else, and yet in the next moment we are invited to modify and amend it wholesale. The two views are inconsistent. I do not say that the Government are not justified in making these amendments, but in adopting that course of action they deprive themselves of the argument they are fond of using. I have not acted unjustly to the Government. There have been eleven divisions on the Bill since they took office, and I have voted with them on seven. They will not be surprised that I did not vote with them on the remaining divisions, when they are reminded of the subjects to which they related. The first of these was on the inclusion of the railway servants; the next was the amendment to extend the Bill to all States and Commonwealth servants; and the third was the proposal to include domestic servants, who were excluded by the Bill as brought in by me; all these were amendments of the Bill. of the eleven divisions. Consequently, I have never voted against the Bill, and have only on one occasion voted against the Government. divisions on the Bill. clude one that took place before the late Government left office.

That being so, I not unnaturally assumed that his remarks were addressed to myself. member inteijecled. deal with the proposal before us. So far I have forsaken neither the Bill nor the Government. In entering upon a consideration of arbitration possibilities, I may. certainly, without making any professions, assert emphatically, that I am not anti-unionist. WhetherI can claim to be a non-unionist is doubtful. According to the criticism of honourable members opposite, I am a unionist in my profession, but at all events I am not in this connection or in any other an antiunionist. What is more, so far as I had any voice in the framing of this measure, it went, and will continue to go, in support of what I believe to be its fundamental principle. The tribunal to be created under the Bill is intended to be based not simply on the ordinary foundation of a Couit of Justice, but to be built on and of organizations. That appears on the veryface of the measure. It is plain both from the interpretation clause and other provisions that it is intended that trades unions shall be free to become organizations, to form part of those organizations, 01 to refrain from connection with them, as they may think best. My hope is that unions will take full advantage of the Bill, and that they will become either organizations or parts of organizations. As the Attorney-General practically admitted to-day, That accounts for ten the amendment moved by the honourable and learned member) Ifor Angas! is in order, if introduced at the point proposed, and is not out of harmony with the rest of the Bill. He proposes that the organizations to be created under this measure shall be new bodies-as new, he put it, as is the Commonwealth Parliament when compared with the States Parliaments from which it sprang-and that those who desire to set the machinery of this Bill in motion to obtain its advantages, shall, whether unionists or non-unionists, form organizations, 01 become",30,William Lyne N O Injury Has Pressing Sympathy

Let me nowmembers of organizations when they are formed. unions shall remain as they are, created by or working under State laws, pursuing their own purposes in their own way; but that for the purposes of this measure entirely new.trades organizations-organizations of employers on the one hand and of employees on the othershall be established. That is a perfectly legitimate proposal, and the Bill would work under it. The suggestion has been made, however, that if the amendment were carried, there would not be sufficient motive to induce employees to form themselves into new organizations, and that, consequently, the Bill might remain to a large extent a dead letter. For my own part, I think the prospects of advantage, and the pressure upon the employees, would bring them into new organizations, with perhaps some little delay. the amendment, no one can say that it is aimed at the life of the Bill. admitted before, however, and am free to admit again, that I listen in this connection with great consideration to the opinions of men more experienced in trades unionism than I am. When the Prime Minister put it, as the result of his experithemselves an ""organization,"" are not mateence, that the unions had a claim for first consideration, because of the sacrifices their members had made in the past, that they possessed a special competency, by reason of their acquaintance with joint industrial action; that they had gathered to themselves many of the most enthusiastic and able employees, and that, lacking them, the organizations under this Bill would lack a great force and a great mass of educated opinion, I felt that he had made out a good case. It seems to me, therefore, that, although the proposition made by the honourable and learned member for Angas is permissible, it is highly desirable-hav-. ing in view the advantages to be gained by associating trades unions with this measure -not to exclude them, as would be the effect of his amendment, but to afford them every opportunity,, if they think fit, to come in and enjoy the benefits that this measure would confer, bringing with them the 'men trained in industrial matters, who have been gathered in their ranks. In these circumstances, it is reasonable to request the honmatters in order to establish industrial orable and learned member for Angas to reconsider his position in the light of these facts, and to ask himself whether it is not possible to accomplish the ends at which he aims-or the practical portion of themMr Deakin. without placing unions at the disadvantage It is his desire that of undertaking the formation of entirely new bodies. Speaking generally, but frankly, the whole of this Bill is based upon organizations-organi zations of employers on the one side, and of employees on the other-for what honourable members prefer to refer to occasionally as collective bargaining. There is no doubt that the measure will depend largely for the extent of its operation and efficiency upon the character of the organizations on both sides that are established under it. member is not overlooking the fact that single employers are recognised to the same extent as is a whole organization of employees. than one hundred persons they are.

Such apparent difficulties are inevitable in a measure of this kind, and, indeed, in most measures designed to deal with large bodies of men. .1 was pointing out, when the honourable and learned member interrupted me, that the whole Bill is based upon organizations, and that the object of those organizations is industrial. During the greater part of this debate one would have imagined that the industrial portion of the Bill was subordinate. We have heard a great deal as to how the unions are to be affected in one direction or another; but very little as to how they are to be affected industrially. This Bill does not relate to political disputes, much less to political party disputes. The word ""matters,"" which is perhaps .'he widest in the legal vocabulary, is employed, but it is to "" industrial matters"" alone that the Bill relates. It is an industrial Bill, to deal with industrial disputes and industrial peace. It seeks only to achieve that end. Well might it stop short of seeking to accomplish other objects, in view of the almost, inconceivably vast area covered by it.

There was no thought in my mind at that time, nor for long after, that it was possible for those bodies at the same time to be party-political agencies. Such a suspicion never crossed my mind. I looked at them purely as industrial bodies. ' I was charged with the introduction of a Bill for the settlement of industrial disputes, and political disputes were then farthest from my consideration. The only reference to the point which I can find in a hurried examination of my speech when I again introduced the measure in March this year-as reported on page 772 of Hansard -is as follows :When we have made all these provisions of machinery, we have not, by any means, concluded our task, because, under this B ill , as was explained last year, the organizations themselves, the unions of employers on one side, and the unions of employees on the other, for both are included, are sought to be made extensions of the machinery of this Court. The object is, by the organization of employers on the one side and of employees on the other, to enable findings to be binding; to allow the decisions to cover a large area; to prevent isolated disputes, and to enable broad principles and practices to be definitely adopted in particular trades. is done by organizations created under clause 62, and capable of being registered under that clause. They are the bodies which have the power of referring cases to the Court under clauses 31 and 72. They are entitled to be represented before .the Court, at the argument, under clause 35; they are incorporated under clause 65; their rules require to be such as the registrar approves, according to the -schedule of this Bill-se e also clause 63-and they may have their registration refused or cancelled, as I have already pointed out. By all these ways and means they are, so to speak, constituted a part of the machinery of justice. They are required to administer it with their members, and are enabled to do so. They are required to assist the Court in carrying out its findings, and in working this measure. Because this Bill seeks, as its ultimate goal, the organization of industry on both sides. There, again, without having the least idea that the question now under discussion would ever be raised, how did I speak of these bodies ? How were they in my mind ? As part of the machinery of justice created to assist the Court. thing inconsistent with that in the idea which we have in this respect showed frankly, the only conception I had formed of these bodies; and my silence in regard to any further operation of theirs was the silence of innocence. But my honourable friend, the Prime Minister, and those who speak with him, discussed these propo-„ sals at length, and discussed them in detail. I have not been able to search their speeches. But certainly nothing which they said at any time suggested the idea that these organizations were ever to be capable of being political bodies; still more of being party-political bodies. gether apart from the object of this clause; there was no necessity for that consideration to come up, in my view. the second reading debate by the honourable member for Wentworth. for Wentworth may have given expression to some apprehensions to that effect, but I am not aware that the idea was ever expressed to us explicitly. I took his reference to be part of his opposition to the Bill, and not by any means as being his view of the explicit purpose of the Bill. That, at any rate, certainly was not my view. and learned gentleman contemplate the existing organizations being utilized? This any sense contemplated their being party political bodies. I am told now that, as far as New South Wales is concerned, probably 90 per cent, of the unions have no political objects. So far as I knew, 100 per cent, of the unions in this State did not possess any political relation. the honourable and learned member must have been aware that the unions have been charged with being political bodies. denied the charge. They have never admitted it to be true. I do not know that they have connected themselves with political or party political questions as unions. . tion; there are some political questions that they must deal with as industrial unions. the definition of the word ""political."" As far as I am aware, whenever their members have dealt with party politics, they have done what every citizen has a right to do, and what no one is entitled to blame them for doing.

167,Mr Deakin,"That depends uponcommon end. But I have never viewed trades unions as political bodies. I have always regarded any political colouring imparted to them as diverting them from their right purpose, and as weakening their influence in the direction in which it could be best employed. connected with the profession to which I belong, and which has been termed a union, had ever even attempted to use political coercion on its members, I should have been one of the first to protest. I have now come to the crux of the argument, which I have been endeavouring tolead up to-the view which I take of this B ill as one who, not only by his statements, but by the whole course and current of his political convictions and opinions, is entirely adherent to the principle of conciliation and arbitration. But I say emphatically that the bodies which we create by this Bill-thes e creatures of the law-whic h have been made part of the machinery of the Court, ought, like every Court, to be put far above partypolitics and their influence. I maintain most strongly that what I am expressing is a view, not only not antagonistic to the Bill -certainl y sense to trades unions-bu t is in every essential in favour of the new organizations, whether formed of, from, with, or without trades unions. This is properly described as a question of principle, because a principle is involved. But it is not an industrial principle that is at stake; it is whether industrial agencies are to be made political. It is not a question relating to industrial matters or disputes, or necessary in, any way to the attainment of industrial peace. Those are considerations outside, and belonging to another arena. Considerations of the convenience of the usefulness of political activity by the unions have been brought forward by honourable members, and many of them have a great deal of force. When you have a body of men collected together into a trades union .by the fact of their pursuing kindred industrial pursuits, forming a compact body in association with other similar bodies, standing shoulder to shoulder for their own to do, what is more natural than for the politician to say"" If I can obtain that united phalanx behind me; if I can secure command of a portion of its funds; if I can get control of its paper, and if I can induce these unions to attack my adversaries, I shall obtain the command of one of the greatest potencies which I can enlist on my side."" There is nothing more natural than that politicians, under those circumstances, should set out to capture the unions. But that ought not to be our object. It is a purely industrial If the association measure which we have before us, the object of which is to obtain industrial peace. so far as I am concerned. My political < ideas are quite radical enough to secure me the support of .the members of these organizations. But what I say is that to give the organizations a political character would be subversive of the very purpose of their creation, and of their character and independence. This Bill is to settle industrial disputes, and bring about an era of industrial peace. applies to the employers on the other side. placed under the same limitations, so far as they are represented under this B ill. They will consist of much smaller numbers, and, therefore, can be much more easily not antagonistic in any brought into other communication with each other. Of course, the union of a few hundreds imposes nothing like the burden that is imposed in the uniting of thousands. in purse. The difficulty arising out of the great disparity in numbers is obvious. It is not to be denied, but has to be confronted. But I do' say-and I say it to the credit and praise of unionists-that , in my belief, there has been more publicspirit and genuine self-sacrifice exhibited among them than has been exhibited by their opponents. By that means the unions have made themselves more than the equals-the y have made themselves the superiors-of the men against whom they have been, ranged. Small numbers and length of purse have not helped the employers when fighting against the self-sacrifice and loyalty of great bodies of men. But I hope honadvantage, as they are entitled orable members will not lead me into an interesting but irrelevant discussion; I have no desire to detain the Committee. If I see this matter as clearly as to myself I appear to see it, no friend of the B ill , or of industrial peace, will allow the means of obtaining industrial peace-the machinery of an Arbitration Court-to be used for",34,William Lyne N O Injury Has Pressing Sympathy

Those two ends seem to me to be absolutely and inherently in contradiction. a provision similar to that which appears in every other Arbitration Bill. learned member must have known that. working of Arbitration Courts has been derived from reading the New Zealand and New South Wales reports; and^ while I find the common rule and preference to unionists often granted or refused, I have not noted, except in the one case, that of the Australian Workers' Union, any instance in which the political nature of an union arose. the New South Wales Act because of that instance. my reading, that is the only case in which political questions came up.

That view, which may be analyzed, is one which ought to have great weight with us in the consideration of this question. tions of organizations is not only encouraged what advantage would it be to them? under this Bill, but, in addition, an organization is given power to enter the Court and be represented there; to obtain awards which shall be binding, not only on that organization, but, naturally, on the corresponding organization of employers, or, if the Court think fit, on employers not organized. There is not only this authority to claim awards, but the Court has power to extend an award, under a common rule, to those who have never been summoned before the Court, or who may never have been engaged in an industrial dispute. In addition, there is the right to ask and the right to obtain, if the Court is satisfied, preference to unionists-whic h we are still discussing-o r rather, to be correct, preference to members of organizations, whether they be unionists' or non-unionists. The unions, by becoming organizations, are thus placed in a position of higher standing. They are enabled to control and recover fees and dues from their members. In every way the unions will be strengthened for the great duties they are called on to perform. The unions become, therefore, creatures of the law, endowed by law. They are endowed with those exceptional authorities and powers; and for what purpose? Eor the purpose of securing industrial peace, and for no other purpose whatever. Consequently, it appears to me that, in the very nature of things, if these bodies are to work free from friction, from suspicion of bias in the exercise of their great powers, they must be kept free from party politics. I say frankly that I do not share the opinions of-many honourable members in this House on this matter. I look forward, under this Bill, to a steady and extensive growth of these, organizations. I believe that the impetus be such that wherever industrial grievances exist organizations will arise; and that those organizations, with the powers intrusted to them, will be enabled to solve industrial It was those rules which were disputes.

But if honourable members have followed the line It may be at any of argument I have been pursuing, I think it will show how, from my point of view, an award, and a common rule, no less than a grant of preference to members of an organization, call as loudly for the removal of party political colouring. those stages? tions themselves are injured. jured in their power, influence, and independence as industrial organizations, and as agents of the Court. the enjoyment of their ignorance. unions who are at present free from party colouring will not suffer. They can come in at once without the slightest difficulty, and none of them will lose a single political power or privilege. None of their members will be called upon to pay towards any purpose of which they do not approve a single farthing of their contributions. They will be left just as free as ever they were to adopt any political platform they please outside, to advocate it how and where they choose, to form associations to formulate their ideas in any manner they please, and to capture as large a proportion of Parliament as they can. No one will take the slightest exception to their action in this respect; no one can; but ' when we bring our unions into relation with this Court and make them practically a part of the Court-the y are called "" inwhen we attach them to an industrial Court for industrial purposes we are not asking from them any sacrifice of any real power or any political privilege, when we ask that in the interests of labour, in the interests of industrial peace, these bodies, as a part of the machinery of the Court, should be kept entirely free from partu politics.

259,Mr Deakin,"The great bulk of thea matter which is .not industrial at all. Honourable members opposite will admit, because they must, that everything that an organization is required to do under this Bill can be done-and I say can be very much better done-as thoroughly and as well without any reference to politics at all. has conferred upon it, either in the way of obtaining awards and giving them effect, securing in their interests common rules or securing preference for their members, can be gained without any infusion of politics into them as organizations. This being an industrial measure for the promotion of industrial peace, and it being granted by' every member of the House that we can accomplish everything we have in view under this measure, and secure everything within the immense scope of this Bill, while leaving organizations free from party politics, why should we, because some few of the unions happen to be associated with political proposals, from which it would be inconvenient for them to dissociate themselves, imperil the whole of this measure for this small gain ? Why should we inject into this measure or its organizations a political colouring? It is a movement which is in this respect parallel with the religious movement, because it ought to be kept absolutely free from all taint of party politics? Our great social and religious organizations, if they are to be allowed free and full development, can only attain it in a community in which men shall be free to think and act as they believe right, entirely irrespective of party politics. It is just as wise, and just as sincere an aim to keep the industrial sphere free from their intrusion, as it is to keep the religious sphere free from it. If honourable members will look at the matter in this light, they will agree that this amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella does not affect anything in the Bill, or relating to the Bill, or affect the"" efficient working of the measure. Ministers who resist it are seeking to retain some political power for a few unions, because in the past they have retained it. Even they have not found it useful as unions. The unions are never any stronger as such on account of this colouring, and are rather imperilled by it. The only possible gain from allowing organizations to continue political is a gain to the politician, and to no one else. The unions as unions in fulfilling their union work, or as organizations under this Bill in fulfilling 1 their part, will not be helped by political colouring being imparted to them. judges of that the unions themselves? and I are not the best judges, because we appeal to these organizations for their supEvery power which an organization port, and get the advantage of their support if they share our viewsunions are not the best judges' of what is union work. not union work. cide that for themselves. quire the assistance of the unions. Without their assistance this Bill will be inoperative. operative. I need not repeat my point, I think I have made it as plain as it is possible for me to do. If I have not succeeded, honourable members will at least understand that there is a great deal of substance from my point of view in the argument I have raised, which goes down to the very foundations of the measure. It is because I have great expectations of the Bill, because I have great hopes of the organizations which will be registered under it, and of the work in which they will engage, that I am anxious to keep them free from all political objects and duties. Members of unions, like other individuals, will be at all times free, as they are now, to take any .political action they choose, but not through the union organizations. The unions must devote themselves to union work, arid the political labour leagues to political work. This separation of the various branches of industry has been the very basis of the whole development of modern industrial enterprise. Honourable members should be prepared to follow the natural line of evolution, and accept the division of duties, whereby politicians act together for political ends only, unions for industrial ends only, and religious bodies for religious ends only. In this way we shall have the freedom of all maintained, and the interdependence of each preserved. By confusing the altogether separate sphere of technical industrial development or the relation of employers and employed with the burning issues of party politics we may benefit individual politicians, but we shall injure, possibly vitally, the operation of this Bill,",40,William Lyne N O Injury Has Pressing Sympathy

266,Mr Deakin,"No; I think it will beso far as it appeals to public confidence. We foster the belief that men are not approaching the Court with real industrial grievances for which they seek industrial remedies, but are putting them forward for party political purposes. Nothing could damage its cause mote than the suspicion that an organization, instead of seeking to secure justice for its members, was only trying to compass political ends. night I asked the Prime Ministeri f at a later stage he would accept an amendment which I then outlined, but seeing that we are to have a vote to night in regard to the position of unions having political rules, I desire to move my amendment now. desire that my proposal should be dealt with now. cepted it? Prime Minister last night said that he was prepared to accept an amendment on the lines indicated, but would not bind himself to the wording I employed. I wish to move That the amendment of the amendment be amended by the insertion after the words "" entitled to,"" line 4, of the words, "" any declaration consistency. of preference by."" At a later stage, if my amendment be carried, I shall move the omission of the woris ""submit any industrial dispute to."" Honourable members have stated that they object to any compulsion whatever being put upon persons to join a union having political objects. I agree with them. The amendment of the honourable member for .Corinella provides in effect that no organization shall be allowed to submit a dispute to the Courti f any of its rules have to do with a political object or purpose. My desire is not to refuse to any organization which has political objects the right to submit a dispute to the Court, but to prevent such an organization from obtaining a preference which will compel persons to join it. The difference between the amendments is one of substance. the honourable and learned member for Corinella, the members of a political union could register under the Bill as -a separate organization. union could not submit a dispute to the Courti f the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella were carried. Under that amendment no trades union whose rules permit the application of its funds to political purposes, or require its members to take ..any action of a political character, could submit a case to the Court. political objects altogether. My point is that the industrial matters over which the Court has jurisdiction are clearly denned by the Bill, and the Court will not be able to give decisions having a political character. It can deal only with matters of an industrial nature, and every organization should have a right to submit such matters to it. The honourable and learned member foi Ballarat referred to the fact that trades unions which are not registered can be brought before the Court on the . certificate of the Registiar, and the decisions given for or against them will be binding upon them. If the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella were passed, unions haying political objects could not ask anything at the hands of the Court, but if there were a dispute, and the Registrar was satisfied that some such union should be brought before the Court, he could compel it to appear. That is a manifest inThe honoiable and learned member for Ballarat said that the unionswould be the creatures of the Court, and that having been endowed with greatpowers and privileges, they should not use these advantages to gain political ends. But while, under the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella, a union having a political object could not bring matters before the Court, it could, on the certificate of the Registrar , be brought before the Court. 1 present unions could come before the Court. honourable and learned member excludes unions with political objects from bringing' matters before the Court. of the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs a union having political purposes could not be brought before the Court. my amendment no union having political objects could ask the Court for a preference.

The honourable and learned member for Ballarat says, "" Keep all your unions in existence,"" and the honourable and learned member for Angas says the same. "" Let them fight as much as they like for political objects, but do not let them be registered under the B ill , and obtain the advantages conferred by the measure while they are fighting for political objects."" TheB ill already provides, however, that the Registrar may bring any body, whether registered or not, before the Court. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat laid great stress upon the fact that the object of the Bill is to create organizations which are to be the machinery of the Court, and upon which the Court is to rely in enforcing its awards. At the same time he said that he hoped that the existing unions will be the unions which will register. learned member thinks that unions which have political objects should not come under the Bill. litical objects. that have not. litical objects. twelve years has been that the unions always use their influence for party purposes. They have constantly taken part in agitations to secure measures which they members As was pointed out by the honourable and learned member for Indi, if honourable members trace the history of unionism in other parts of the world, they will find that there has been continual fighting on the part of the unions to obtain statutory recognition of their rights. However, the point I wish to emphasize is that the effect of the amendment proposed by the honourable and learned member for Corinella would be that, whilst a union with political objects could not go into the Court as a plaintiff, any one could move the Registrar, and have it brought under the operation of the Act. brought before the Court, the decision given in regard to the dispute in question would be binding upon the union, and, according to the honourable and learned memAny ber for Ballarat, the Court would have to look to the leaders of the union to enforce the award. I submit that such a position would be intolerable. It does not matterwhat are the political objects of a union, so long as it does not ask for preference for its members. All the Court can do, in the event of a dispute in which a union with political objects is involved, is to decide the matter in dispute. Its award will then become binding upon unionists and non-unionists alike. Such a dispute could only involve industrial matters, because the Court could take cognisance only of matters relating to work, pay, wages, reward, hours, privileges, rights or duties, preferential employment, and so on. All these matters are industrial, and the Court could not go beyond its powers to the extent of conferring any political favour upon one side or the other. It would have to give its decisions fairly and impartially upon the industrial matters submitted to it. I still hope so. If an organization, which had political objects, asked the Court to give preference to-its members to the exclusion of others, and the Court granted such preference; it would practically put compulsion upon all non-unionists to join the union. The Prime Minister, however, promises to make a concession to the extent of excluding from preference all members of organizations having political objects. I submit my amendment with a view to affording the Committee an opportunity to deal with the matter on its merits. Chairman, I desire to say that when the honourable and learned member for Coribelieved would advantage the nella moved his amendment, I took the obof their particular class. jection that it was not relevant to the object of the clause'or to my amendment. I now take similar exception to the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs, namely, because it confuses the issue raised by my amendment. If it is not relevant to the clause, it cannot be relevant to the amendment. I would again refer to May as to the relevancy of amendments. A t page 278 it is laid down that I t is an imperative rule that every amendment must be relevant to the question on which the amendment is proposed.

What does the right honourable member for East Sydney propose? He proposes to assist the honourable and learned member for Angas to extract the oyster, and to fling the shell to the trades unions. Then, when these organizations exclaim, "" Our hunger is not appeased,"" he will doubtless turn round and say, "" There is the industrial measure which the Labour Party gave you."" Rather than accept any of the amendments which have been outlined, I trust that the Government will abandon the Bill. During this debate a good deal has been heard about the political actions of trades unions. It is admitted that these organizations are legal, and that their work is legal. Indeed, we had a splendid eulogy of their work from the honourable member for Gippsland. If their work is good, would it not be well if all men belonged to them? As an employer, I may be permitted ' to instance a case in point. A non-unionist approached me some time ago, and offered to work for 30s. a week, although the standard wage was £ 2 15s. HadI been able to employ him, under the proposal of the honourable and learned member for Angas, I should have been obliged to dismiss from employment a man with a family, who was in receipt of £ 2 15s. That is the kind of preference for which honourable members are arguing. stanced the non-unionist was the man with the family, and the unionist was a single man. members to look not only at Australia, but at the whole of the civilized world.

What has been the ' experience of the past ? In South Australia the trades unions are affiliated with a distinct organization, which is called the United Labour Party, and they contribute is. per member per annum for political purposes. The whole of the political work, however, is done outside their union rooms. All that they are called upon to contribute is is. per annum. Outside of the Australian Workers' Union, no 5*. : Arbitration Bill. 2 993 unionist has ever been compelled to vote for a parliamentary labour candidate in preference to another candidate holding different views. No pressure is brought to bear upon their members. Wentworth received thousands of unionist votes at the last election. the trades organizations in South Australia do not choose to work for the labour candidates they are at perfect liberty to assist any other candidate. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat affirms that this measure is intended to deal with industrial disputes. I am quite certain that only industrial disputes will be submitted to the proposed Court. That tribunal will take no cognisance of the political work of the unions. Nobody has yet contended that the political work of these organizations is opposed to the best interests of the community. Indeed, my own experience is that the most intelligent workmen in the community belong to the trades unions. Both as a workman and an employer I have found it beneficial to belong to a union. It is very singular that, whilst similar legislationto that which is now proposed was being discussed in New Zealand, New South Wales, and Western Australia, not a single word was uttered in regard to the political work of these unions. It was never suggested that they should be prohibited from engaging in such work. I invite honourable members to closely examine the proposal of the honourable and learned member for Angas, and to see how it will operate. Let us assume that it is carried, and that organizations are established simply for the purpose of dealing with industrial disputes. What will be the position? Honourable members opposite affirm that certain non-unionists cannot belong to the present unions on account of their political aims, but that they will be able to associate themselves with industrial organizations. How many unijns Now, as to the are men to be asked to join? We are all aware that no individual employee in a factory dares to complain to his employer of the insanitary arrangements of the establishment in which he works. In South Australia there is a statute in operation known as the Workmen's Compensation Act, which is being evaded by one of the largest employers in that StateI tefer to the Moonta and Wallaroo Mining Company.

If an organization of the kind suggested were to demand that compensation due to an injured workman be paid, the union would be immediately struck off the register. amine the amendment the more clearly we must recognise that it is simply an attempt to destroy unions as they at present exist.

Take the position occupied by the honourable and learned member for Angas. Every one knows that he has never been the friend of But the fact remains industrial legislation. Every one who has sat with him in the State Parliament of South Australia knows that he has done all in his power to mutilate industrial measures. He has always evinced a peculiar genius for securing the insertion of abstract terms, requiring the interpretation of the Court, in industrial measures. I have the highest opinion of his ability; but it is that very ability that has enabled him to introduce provisions that have destroyed some of the most useful pieces of legislation in South Australia.

I know many who are prepared to take all the advantages of trades unionism-to participate in benefits which but for trades unions they would not have secured-althoug h they are not prepared to join them. These are the men for whom the honourable and learned member is fighting in the name of freedom. He would give them freedom to take advantage of all that other men have gained, very often as the result of enormous sacrifices. is the freedom he commends. Would honourable members prevent a private individual who secured heavy damages in an ordinary law suit from devoting the monev so obtained to political purposes, if he desired to do so ? A proposal to do so would be scouted as absurd, and surely what the individual may do, individuals should be able to do collectively? There is nothing in the argument that moneys obtained under an order of the Court might be devoted by a union to political purposes. How many verdicts are the unions likely to secure? Is it not reasonable to assume that in no case will the damages or penalty awarded recoup the union the expenses incurred by it in securing the decision of the Court? Eveni f unions secured verdicts ranging from £ 1 5 0 to £ 5 0 0 every day of the year, how far would that money go .when applied to the whole Commonwealth'? The truth is that honourable members who oppose this provision are afraid of the unions, and they ought to admit it. They should honestly say, ""We wish to make unions illegal, because they say that their whole salvation lies not only in unionism, but in political action."" Can'it be said that a union has ever done anything inimical to the interests of the country? Can it be said that unionists have returned men to Parliament to represent so narrow a class as that which some honourable members in this House represent ? Every honourable member who has been elected to this House by the votes of unionists and non-unionists has been returned not for the benefit of any narrow class, but in the interests of the* whole Commonwealth.

Some honourable members have stated that they will vote under duress to some extent. We have heard the crack of the whip, and we have been told that certain honourable members feel compelled, not to vote [REPRESENTATIVES.] Arbitration Bill. as they would vote if they had a free hand, but that in the peculiar circumstances with which they are confronted, they feel compelled to take another course.

That is a mere assertion, without any proof whatever in support of it . The position of trades unions is not challenged in the slightest degree.

360,The Mr Kennedy,"W as there not alsonight-is that unions, when they are organizations under this Bill, must not include in their code of rules anything compelling an industrial worker who joins a union to subscribe to any. particular political cieed. We were told by the leader of the Government last night that the Trades Hall Council of Victoria has completely severed its association with politics. Then where is the danger to trades unionism from' the acceptance of the amendment ? Of the three amendments which have been proposed, that of the honourable and learned member for Angas, to my mind, goes too far, because it stipulates that no organization or union in existence to-day shall be registered as an organization under this Bill. is altogether too far-reaching in its effects. The proposal of the honourable and learned member for Corinella stipulates that any labour organization in existence in Australia to-day can register under the Bill, but bodied in its rules any provision compelling its members to subscribe to any fund for political purposes. That is fair and reasonable. But what do we find underlying the whole proposal of the Government ? Under cover of conciliation and arbitration they desire to create a political machine for their own purposes. member know, as a matter of fact, that this machine was created by the previous Government ? attention has been called to that fact. We have been reminded by the leader of the Government -who was the author of this Bill. It is to be regretted that the right honourable member for Adelaide is not present to give us his assistance in dealing with it. The question under discussion was first alluded to in our debates by the honourable member for Wentworth in his speech on the second reading. I will show what was the attitude of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, who was then Prime Minister, when the Bill was introduced. been asserted that he has shown a change of front. It has also been asserted that practically only one member of the late Government has consistently voted with the -present Government in favour of the Bill. I would remind the Committee that the honourable member for Hume has shown in some of his canters a more complete reversal of form than any other member of the late Government. When the proposal was made for the exclusion of agricultural and horticultural labourers under the Bill, he was one of the most enthusiastic supporters of it. Honourable members opposite appear to have forgotten that. On the 13th April this year the honourable member for Wentworth, as reported in Hansard, on page 917, said, in speaking on the motion for the second reading of this Bill: An industrial union, on the other hand, is one which the State compels individuals to join at the peril of their livelihood; consequently, an industrial union should be kept absolutely free from anything in the nature of political propaganda work, whether it be by way of levying subscriptions for a political fund or of running newspapers. If we are to have industrial unions, not only ought we to schedule the rules which That they shall have, but also the rules which they shall not have. If we are to compel persons to join industrial unions, let us make perfectly sure that we do not sacrifice their political liberty, as well as their individual industrial freedom. That is a sentiment that seemed to be apthat it must not have empreciated all round the House. The honourable member for Wentworth said in conclusionI sincerely hope that some attention will be given to my suggestion regaraing the constitution of industrial unions, and if I have directed the notice of abler men than myself to this very crucial point, I feel that I shall not have spoken in vain at such very short notice. Then the honourable and learned member for Ballarat interjectedI think I shall be able to satisfy the honourable member that the provisions which he desires are contained in the Bill. That was a clear and distinct statement from the head of the late Government, who was in charge of the Bill. As to the evidence that the Government and their supporters want to create simply a machine for party political purposes, I refer the Committee to the statement of the honourable member for Barrier, who, in the course of his remarks, said that, representing an industrial district, and a large section of the industrial workers of Australia, who were banded together in unions for their own mutual advantage, he would It has throw this Bill to the winds as far as he was concerned, and as far as the workers were concerned, if trades unionists were denied their right to band together for political purposes. act words. the honourable member wereI would rather have unions taking part in politics than have an Arbitration Act which prevented them from doing so.",50,William Lyne N O Injury Has Pressing Sympathy

364,Mr Kennedy,"The exact words ofSo far as I am aware, there is no honourable member who wishes to interfere with trades unionists as trades unionists. But when they come into the Court seeking the protection and assistance of the Court under the provisions of this B ill , their rules should not contain anything that would debar any man from becoming a member. Why have epithets been hurled at a large number of Australian workers? Why have epithets been hurled against workers who are not members of the union presided over by the honourable member for Darling? In my time, in New South Wales, I was one of those who battled for their rights as members of a union. I was amongst those who were subscribers to and members of the union to which I have referred, when it 'was first originated. What was the cause of the secession from its ranks? Was it not on account of the very rules which the Court in New South Wales has refused to sanction? Was it not because the union wanted to deprive men of their political rights and privileges? Hundreds of men would be willing to join that union to-day except for those objectionable rules. moved.

If I am correctly informed, by their decision the Court refused to cancel the registration of another union. of the Court, so far aware, to dealing with any industrial dispute submitted by the Australian Workers' Union, but simply a refusal to cancel' the registration of another union. That is sufficient to cause the Committee to be most careful not to preclude unions from seeking the protection of this Court, but to deprive them of the right to pass rules which would be repugnant to every fair-minded individual. Last night the Prime Minister, when he took the Committee into his confidence, told us that he was prepared to accept the principle of the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Darling Downs, but that he would not commit himself to the exact verbiage. What do we find to-day behind the Prime Minister? Where is the distinction between the two amendments? The verbiage is exactly the same, except that in the case of the amendment of the honourable member for Darling Downs, it is only when a union makes an application to have the preference extended to its members that the provision is to be of anv avail. But the principle of the amendment is accepted by the Prime Minister. amendment only shifts the stage at which the provision shall, apply. . members on this side of the House regarded as outlaws, who aie desirous of ruining trades unions?

Prime Minister has accepted a proposal containing the same verbiage as applied to unions seeking for preference. Notwithstanding the threats that have been hurled at us, 1 am going to support the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella, believing that it will make for the weli-being of the industrial classes and the efficient working of this measure. expect, at this stage, to be able to add anything very new or interesting to the discussion. I should like, however, 'to correct a few errors which have arisen during the debate, and to endeavour to give a little information which up to the present has not been forthcoming. The honourable member for Herbert, last night, expressed the opinion that the discussion had been unduly prolonged. Buti f honourable members will look at the daily newspapers) they will see that, as .the discussion has propersistent interjectors in the Chamber. We ceeded, especially in the committee stage, thepublichave been considerably enlightened, and opinion, has changed in many respects. One of the leading newspapers of Melbourne was heart and soul for the whole of the measure, from title to schedule, when it was first submitted; but in the course of the debate that newspaper has very wisely come to the conclusion that a certain amount of modification of the provisions is necessary. The Bill, as first introduced, was prepared by the right honourable member for Adelaide, whose absence we deeply regret; and the honourable and learned member for Ballarat has pointed out, from time to time, that his Government were not altogether responsible for the drafting. When the Bill got to a certain stage, and the late Government saw fit to hand, over the Treasury benches to the present Government, a great many members on this side of the House complained that the Bill, as then placed before us, contained a considerable number of amendments, and that no Opportunity had been afforded to us to see those amendments side by side with the clauses, so that the purport of the measure might be understood. which are causing the trouble in the same is doubtless possessed of more information form as that in which they appeared when on the subject than am I , but I should like the present Government came into office? important question to some other honourable member to answer. It is too deep for me. Perhaps the honourable memThe object of the amendment moved by the honourable and learned member for Corinella is to prevent the application of the funds of trades unions to political purposes, and to prevent the members of trades unions being compelled to do anything of a political character. I admit that there is some difficulty in discovering where we are with respect to the amendments, seeing that the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs has proposed an amendment on that submitted by the honourable and learned member for Corinella, who intends to piopose another on top of it. The amendment to which I desire to speak, and which I intend tosupport, is the original amendment moved by the honourable and learned member for Corinella During the debate, the honourable member for Grey has made several references to the British Medical Association. The honourable member is one of the most continually hear his raven's croak, but never from the front, where we'might deal with the honourable member. Personally, I think all interjections are properly ruled to be disorderly; but one thing which one does like is that an interjector should sit opposite to him, so that he might be fairly dealt with if he has anything to say worth replying to. The honourable member for Grey has on more than one occasion, by way of a sneer, referred to the union or association which exists in the honourable profession to which I have the honour to belong.

I propose to deal with the balance sheets issued by the committee for the years igoo, rgor, and 1902. member think that his remarks will come within the scope of the amendment? how the TradesH a l l Council, which is constituted of various unions, deals with the funds which are collected. ter at any length, because, after all, the main point at issue relates to the political question. lected by this committee totalled over ^5,000, and the balance to its credit in the bank, after paying all expenses, was ^ 5 . The donations amounted to £63%Jt that vear the members of the committee decorated themselves with medals, which cost £42 2s. 6d. In 1901, the money collected aggregated ^6,200, and the donations dwindled from ,£638 to £1*2, the balance in the bank being ^954. That balance, I may remark, has never been publicly accounted for. It is not mentioned in the balance-sheet of the succeeding year. The cost of the medals with which the committee provided themselves in 1901 increased I suppose that the honfrom ^42 to £121. In 1902 the amount collected was £6,800, and the donations dropped to £27. manner in which these funds have been disbursed requires investigation. In 1902 the balance in the bank, after all expenses had been paid, was £ 9 1 9 . Of that sum, noI t is very often a godthing further has been heard. What has become of it ? From information received I believe that a large proportion of it has been absorbed in rent, which is charged by the Trades Hal l Council. Consequently But I am digressing. I claim that money is being applied to political We purposes. A t one time it was customary for the committee to allocate a portion of its surplus to the Trades Hal l building fund. That practice, however, was stopped by. the Victorian Government. Now the same thing is being done, presumably by mutual arrangement by way of rent. Last year, instead of the ' charities I receiving any of the money collected from the public, £ 1 8 0 was expended for the purchase of gold decorations, which were distributed amongst the members of the committee. One of these decorations can be seen on the Ministerial benches. In contradistinction to this condition of affairs, I should like to point to another association which is not connected with the TradesH a l l Council, and which is not in any sense a trades union. The Druids' Association last . year collected .£2,352, of which amount £ 1 , 0 1 7 was I do. I intend to show handed over to the charities. When I was asked for this information, I received a polite invitation to call and inspect the balance sheet of the association.

That being so, I have a right to put before the Committee certain facts connected with the organization in question which were not presented by the honourable member. He stated that that union did not undertake any political work. In doing so, surely he was not ignorant of the fact that it has what is called its "" Standing Parliamentary Committee."" I intend to show the Committee how the Brisbane branch of that association treated one of its members who did not agree with its actions. come within the scope of this amendment. members of the Brisbane branch of the British Medical Association were so' aggressively respectable that, when I talked with them in reference to my candidature, they said"" We don't know whether we ought to shake hands with you, doctor, seeing that you have announced yourself as a labour candidate."" However, I fought on, and I am bound to say that the Labour Party did their best to secure my return. At' this stage I may be pardoned, perhaps, if I read the libel which was published concerning me by the Brisbane Dailv Telegraph. It has reference to certain action which was taken by the Brisbane branch of the British Medical Association, but does not relate to my connection with that organization. I understand, however, that the members of that association were actually guilty of the conduct which was falsely imputed to me. This is the statement which appears in the Brisbane Daily TelegraphWorkers of Brisbane who are being canvassed to cast their vote for the labour candidate, should put at least one very pertinent question to that candidate. of years ago, an agitation was started amongst medical men respecting feej3 paid by friendly societies. Those societies, which embrace practically the whole of the labouring classes, represented that they could not afford to pay more than t5s. per head of their membership. Some of the doctors demanded 25s. per head. One doctormade the charitable proposal that, unless the societies paid 25s. per head, all doctors could boycott the societies. Electors, will you find out who was the proposer? Now, this is a very important question just at this particular juncture of affairs. If electors will busy themselves to find out, perhaps they may find that their panting patriot, whose heart now is said to be bleeding for the poor worker, was with those who proposed that they and their wives and bairns should be cut off from all medical attendance. This is typical of men of the class. How suddenly their hearts begin to bleed (to order, of course), When political fleshpots are abroad. But time carries a wallet on his back; and these little pussies have a habit of sneaking out at the proper moment. . . . The working masses will full y appreciate the worth of any individual who, only a couple of years back, could make the hideous suggestion that they should be left to die by the roadside, because their societies could not afford to pay more than a certain sum per head of the membership. At the time, a cry of shame went up, that so brutal a thing could even be conceived, much less suggested. Of all the splendid institutions in our midst, friendly societies stand foremost. The suggestion made to boycott them was as a deadly blow at their continuance as the helper of the poor working man. These were the comments which were made upon the action taken by certain members association will of that association which was falsely attributed to me. It was palpably an attempt I trust that it will. The to damn my chances of election. What followed ? The next day the following letter was forwarded to Mr James.

It should be clearly made known that this association has a"" political committee, and is, therefore, just as much a political society as is any other similar body.

I was one of the founders of the Australian Natives' Association in New South Wales, and held office as its first president. When the association was established there, it made no attempt to sweat the members of the medical profession. . It offered them the highest rates paid by any friendly society in the State, but the edict went forth from the local branch of the British Medical Association that no member of it should take Office in any branch of the Australian Natives' Association unless he was prepared to run the risk of being ostracised. With a desire for peace, I , with other members of the committee of the Australian Natives' Association, had two or three conferences with representatives of this so called branch of the British Medical Association. We asked them whether they proposed to treat our society differently from other similar bodies, and without hesitation they replied that they intended to break up these benefit societies, which do so much good for the poorer classes. They recognised that they had the power in their own hands, and were going to exercise it. I inquired whether they would put it in operation against the M.U.I.O.O.F., the I.O.O.F., and other societies, and they replied. "" Yes, later on; but we intend first of all to deal with your society.""

It is all very well for the honourable member for Corangamite to rail at the lodges; but would any fair minded medical man deny that they offer a doctor fresh from the university his first opportunity to secure a practice? Lodges give doctors opportunities to gain prominence in their profession, and they have no right when they have achieved success to cast aside the ladder on which they have risen.

When those who decline to join that association' succeed in building up practices the association uses every means in its power-and done so, not only in Sydney, but in Wagga, and in other districts-to the eyes of the public. I do not know that this is altogether pertinent to the issue before the Chair, but I felt constrained, in the interests of the Australian Natives' Association to make some reply to the remarks of the honourable member for Corangamite. Coming down to the matter before the Chair, there are three amendments under consideration-onemo'ved and learned member for Angas, a second by the honourable and learned member for Corinella', and a third by the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs. As I understand these proposals, the first would have this effect-that in existence could register under this Bill, because it would not exist solely for the purposes put on one side existing designed to bring into harmony with the employers. trials and troubles that have happened in Australia in the past, with reference to trades unions, that the Bill was introduced. But the amendment of the honourable andlearned member for Angas boycotts every one of the unions. They are to have no position before the Court. ment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella is certainly an improvement upon that. But it says practically that if the unions now in existence come before the Court, they can get no justice and no remedy if they have any funds which are What be a union of employers or of employees, has not some fund which it uses for political purposes? to the debate, but I have heard no instance given of a union on one side or another that has not employed its funds, to some extent, Mr Chanter. The honourable Every union, of which I am aware, is in that position. If that be soand I believe it to be so, from my own personal knowledge-the amendment of the Men are not compelled to honourable and learned member for Corinella would put on one side the in New South whole of the existing unions. It would put them all under a ban. The amendment which has been proposed by the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs practically says to all the existing unions, and to others that may be formed, "" Go on in your own path; do has what you like with your funds, so far as industrial purposes are concerned; utilize damage them in them as you think proper; but if you are brought to the Court, and ask for preference for your members, or for other persons, you must dissociate yourself from party politics."" Mr G. B. EDWARDS -It is only a question of degree, after all is said and done. of principle, not of degree. The principle by the honourable of this Bill is to insure peace where previously there was strife. That peace is to be secured by means of the unions now in existence. The policy of the B ill is not to disband them or to put them on one side. Is there any old parliamentarian, present no union now who does not understand the object of some of those honourable members who are supporting the first two amendments with which of the Bill.

When the late Government was in existence; and this Bill was before the House, thirteen members of the Opposition The amendsupported an amendment, not because they believed in the principles of the Labour Party, but for the purpose of removing the Deakin Government. They succeeded in their object. Now history is repeating itself. Where was the conscientious adherence to principle of those thirteen members applied to political purposes. when they were called upon to stand by the union in existence, whether it Government whom they helped to place in office ? not stand by them? of the thirteen did not.

They were not to be found standing by their principles; and to stand by principle ought to be the first consideration of any member of Parliament. Far better would it be for the enemies of the Government to come fairly and squarely into the open, and attack them. Let them be attacked as a Labour Government. That would be far better than by means of little side winds to harass and irritate the Government. The people outside believed that honourable members generally were in favour of a Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and were going to do their best to pass it into law. But is that so? Does the debate which has taken place show that an attempt is being honestly made to pass a workable Bill? Almost every honourable member pledged himself on the hustings to support this measure. Now a number are doing their best to destroy it, and to. crush out the unions. I take all the responsibility in connection with my vote, I intend to .be true to my principles. I supported this Bill when it was introduced by. the previous Government, and I intend to give to -it an honest and conscientious support now. The people outside are not only thinking, but talking. They begin to see the meaning of the action of the Opposition. The people want this Bill. It is not a question of whether the Government want it or not. The people have had a bitter experience on many occasions of the ruinous .effect of strikes and lock-outs. They want to have passed a reasonable measure that will give them a guarantee of safety in the future. That remark is cheered, but the quarter from which the cheers come indicates that an attempt is being made to use the amendments under consideration as instruments for shifting the Government in order to put in another Administration. honourable member is doing that, but I do say, from my knowledge of some honourable members, that the amendments are being used for that purpose. cepted the principle of the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella. the issue is clear and distinct. ference. cussing ' the question of preference.

Will any one say that the intention was not honestly to introduce a measure which would deal with the unions as they exist, whether of employers or employees, and which would secure to them the rights and privileges to which they could show they were entitled? Of the amendments which have been submitted, the one which appeals most to me, and which is most in keeping with the convictions I have always held upon this matter, and with thehonesty of principle I desire always to maintain, is that proposed by the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs.

541,Mr Webster (Gwydir),"My onlyspectacle to witness the various members of the legal profession in this Committee trying to amend a clause in a Bill which is not the Bill of the present Government, but of the Government whom they displaced, and of the Government who preceded them. It seems to me that, from the party of the late Government, we have had quite a number of amiably disposed legal gentlemen endeavouring to so amend the clause as lo make it provide for one or other of the difficulties which, in their opinion, will arise when the Bill is being administered. When legal gentlemen get a clause of any Bill into the legal sausage-mill, no one can tell how it will come out. We are floundering among various amendments which have been submitted. One legal member of the Committee has moved an amendment, and before it has been printed and circulated, another has been moved upon it, and a further amendment has been moved upon that again. orable and learned gentleman is generally present only when things are not very clear. My exposition is, I think, at least as clear as the explanation which some honourable and learned members have given in proposing their amendments. I have listened attentively to the debate, and we have now three amendments before us. One is that we shall practically take away from unions the right of combination for industrial purposes if there is anything of a political character associated with their constitution or rules. In dealing with the subject honourable members opposite have confined themselves to a discussion of the monstrous injuries which the unions of employees will inflict upon society generally if they are given.the privileges provided for in the clause. frained from discussing what employers' unions are going to do, though it is admitted that they are political organizations. alike. alike, because the men forming the employees' unions have only their manhood and combination to dependi upon. They must combine. That is where their strength lies, and as unions registered under the Bill, we can draw the line in their case; but in the case of employers, whilst they may be members of an employers' oiganization, they may still, as private individuals, expend money in the promotion of a OI political campaign, to the detriment of the party to which they are opposed. The right honourable member for East SydneyI do not know if I should be light in describing him as the leader of the Opposition-tol d us last night that he had suddenly learned something new in connection with conciliation and arbitration legislation. Notwithstanding that he was for so long a member of the New South Wales Parliament, and heard the subject discussed there so often, and that he is supposed to possess almost all knowledge, political and legal, he has admitted that he did not understand the effect of the clause upon the political rights and liberties of those who have bound themselves tpgether in unions to bring about the proper administration of the law. The whole Bill rests upon unionism. Without unionism its provisions could not be administered effectively. Consequently those who would strike at the existing unions, as the honourable and learned member for Angas is endeavouring to do, by reforming them out of existence, wish to defeat the Bill. thing of the soit. -the amendment. The right honourable member for East Sydney has posed as the champion of unionists, and has denounced those who joined with the employers in a conspiracy to form the bogus Machine Shearers' and Shed Employes' Union. It is to men such as he condemns that he is' going to give the opportunities which they obtained through the indiscretion of the Australian Workers' Union. What will be the effect of the Billi f the amendments of the honourable and learned members for They have carefully reAngas and Corinella are carried? Existing trades unions will not be able to register under it. Then what will happen ? Just what has happened with the Australian Workers' Union. The Machine Shearers' and Shed Employes' Union took advantage of certain rules in the constitution of the Australian Workers' Union to obtain registration, and when the latter sought to have that legistration cancelled, it found itself prevented from doing so by reason of the existence of those rules. The same thing will happen under the clause. Employers will combine with undesirable persons, such as those for. whom the right honourable member for East Sydney has professed contempt, and will register themselves as unions for the purpose of",66,Edwards Di D The Honourable And Learned Member For Werriwa I Always

547,Mr Webster,"That is the effect ofdefeating legitimate unions. Where is the consistency of the right honourable member in condemning the members of the Machine Shearers' Union, because he thinks it a popular thing to do at this juncture, and supporting amendments which will enable employers and non-unionists to register under the Bill, thus cutting out the tiue trades unions whose members have borne the heat and burden of the day? It is the unionists who have been lighting all along for the rights of the toilers, but the amendsome honourable members seem to feel with ments will rob them of the fruits of their efforts, and will take away all incentives to join unions, by preventing preference from being given to unionists. The honourable and learned member for Indi wished to be extremely cautious in this matter, and proposed ' that preference shall not be given to unions which use their funds for political purposes, or lean towards any political party. But I do not know that that is a just proposal. It is the unionists who have made a Bill of this kind possible. They have nurtured the idea of arbitration, and by their agitation brought it into practical politics. They have forced upon the attention of Parliament the desirability of substituting legal tribunals for strikes in the settlement of disputes between masters and men. But the fact that the non-unionists have enjoyed the advantages gained by the' unionists seems to be lost sight of. These benefits have been won at the cost of thousands of pounds, and at sacthe purpose of benefiting trades unionists. rifices which cannot be appraised in money. If the unionists are labouring under disadvantages which only an alteration of the law can remove, they will be prevented from taking united action to effect reform. They cannot exert a united influence in political matters unless they are prepared to sacrifice that preference of employment to which they are absolutely entitled. Under such circumstances the trades unions will not register as organizations under the Bill, and they cannot be blamed for taking up that attitude. If the amendments now before us were embodied in the Bill, not only would the unions be discouraged from registering, but they would, in effect, be told that if they did not hurry up other unions of a bogus character would be recognised in their stead. Why should not the unions exercise political power? Why should not the members of the trades unions be free to exercise their political rights? Why should we engage in a retrograde movement, which would deprive the manhood of Australia of a large measure of the Mr Webster. liberty which has been achieved only after centuries of Struggle? The honourable member for Corangamite told us a good deal with regard to the political aims of the Melbourne Trades and Labour Council, but I would inform him that in New South Wales we have never been able to induce the unions to contribute to any appreciable extent towards the funds of the Political Labour League. I do not think there is any reason for the apprehension which regard to the extent to which the union funds may be applied to political purposes. With honourable members opposite the question is not so much that of according preference to unionists or of preserving to the members of the unions their full political rights, as that of setting the Bill on one side altogether, and of gaining place and power by illegitimate means. The more closely we regard the attitude of the members of the Opposition the more clearly it becomes evident that they are not acting according to their conscientious convictions, but are being guided by considerations having relation to the personal advantages which may result from the accession of their party to power. We find honourable members who profess to be in favour of this class of legislation voting solidly against the Government. We are seeking to pass legislation in the interests of the community as a whole, and not for We have been told that if we give preference to unionists we shall be placing upon our statute-book class legislation, which will have the most baneful effect upon the men outside the unions. I do not understand why the honourable and learned member for Ballarat should entertain such fears as he has expressed with regard to the probable effects of this measure, but I recognise that his attitude offers a very favorable contrast to that taken up by the honourable and learned member for East Sydney, who has endeavoured, whilst placating non-unionists, to pose as the greatest friend of the unionists. I warn honourable members of the Opposition I do not wish to use 1 any threats-that their action in connection with this Bill is being very closely watched. Many of them assisted in placing the present Ministry in power, ostensibly in order that this Bill might be placed on the statute-book in a satisfactory shape But they are now adopting an attitude entirely inconsistent with that previously assumed by them. Many honourable members voted in favour of bringing the railway servants of the States within the scope of the Bill, and yet they are now prepared to support an amendment which would deprive these men of all the advantages of the unions which have been their -mainstay in the past. It is now proposed to take away all the rights which unionists have previously enjoyed, without giving them any adequate recompense Honourable members may rest assured that their constituents will very closely watch them, and that every precaution will be taken against thedescent of our politics to the low levels which have been reached in some of the State Legislatures. I desire to remove some of the misap-. prehension which appears to exist among honourable members opposite with regard to the position of non-unionists. The term "" non-unionist "" is a misnomer as applied to all the workmen of Australia who are outside the unions. In m y constituency there are 22,000 electors and only one registered union, Workers' Union, comprising about 150 men. I am a member of that union, and, as I know that it has considerable funds. They did not, however, contribute a shilling towards my election expenses. That fact, I take it, sufficiently disproves the statement, which has been repeatedly made during this debate, that trades unions are political organizations which contribute towards the election expenses of parliamentary labour candidates. I venture to say that any honourable member upon the opposite side of the chamber who dared to visit Queensland, and to apply the term "" non-unionist "" to any worker there, would require to be very bulky to avoid rough treatment. The term ""non-unionist,"" as it is understood different meaning is attached to a "" non-member"" of a union. For example, there are 2,000 or 3,000 miners employed at Mount Morgan, who are, perhaps, the finest body of workmen engaged in any enterprise in Australia. They do not belong to any organization, but they sympathize with the trades unions all over Australia. If they laboured under any grievances which required redress, they would immediately form themselves into a union. The same remark is applicable to' every other mining centre. In that labour citadel, Claremont, it is impossible to find a man who would permit himself to be called a "" non-unionist,"" although there is no union in existence there. If any honourable members opposite dared to visit Mount Morgan, and to brand men who do not belong to any trades organizations there as "" non-unionists,"" they would either be in the hospital or missing next morning. .upon this side of the chamber have said nothing derogatory to men who are not members of trades union. that they have. Some-most mendacious assertions have been made concerning the remarks of the honourable member for Kennedy. I am positive that there are thousands of men in the electorate of Kennedy who, according to honourable members of the Opposition, are "" non-unionists,"" and'who support their present representative in this House. Yet the contention of the other side is that non-unionists are not in sympathy with unionists. do not join the unions. namely, the Waterside strike takes place the employer who is particularly interested usually instructs his agents to engage men to take the places of am also one of its trustees, 1 the strikers. As a result, he secures the "" scum of the earth."" These men are guaranteed a good wage, a good living, and the protection of the police. It is these individuals whom the ' honourable member for Kennedy designates ""blacklegs"" and "" scabs."" They seek to deprive the strikers and their dependents of food. I claim that the Government should stake their position upon these amendments. Ever since this Bil l has been under discussion some honourable members, whilst posing as friends of the Bill, have been continually attempting to harass the Government. I say that they are traitors to the measure, and I instance the action of the honourable and learned member for Corinella in this conin that State, has a verynexion. He has endeavoured to emascufromthat which late the Bill so as to render it useless to the very men to whom it is intended to apply. apply to their organizations as political machines. tended to be a political machine.

Sir JOHN QUICK zation is to be permitted to submit a dispute to the Courti f its rules authorize the employment of its funds for political purposes, or coerce its members to take political action. I assert without the slightest fear of contradiction from the greatest trades union authority in this Committee that the main object of trades unionism is not necessarily of a party political character. Its chief object is to bind its members together for their mutual protection, and thereby avoid the old penalties in respect of combination and conspiracy in restraint of trade. For this purpose they are protected by the law. by the honourable and learned member for Corinella would deprive miners of the power to agitate for the proper ventilation of mines. agitation in that direction could not be said to be devoted to a political purpose. would be a merely social agitation, in which any one might engage. A t all events, it would not be a party political purpose. The object of those who wish these bodies to have political authority is, practically, to enable them to work in support of a certain political body. Let not that fact be disguised. If it is' not so, why the tenacity of the cry in favour of giving trades unions, formed for the protection of their members in matters of labour, the right to apply their funds to party political purposes for the promotion in all probability of the interests of the Labour Party? As the honourable member for Moira has said, the gist of the honourable and learned member for Corinella's amendment is that trades unions that are right of going into Court and representing their members before it, shall not be tinged with political bias, or devoted to political purposes. into Court as trades unions pure and simple, and without any party or political bias.

WhatI do object to is a trades union that may be a trades union merely in name, and in reality a huge political organization. That such unions exist may probably account for the tenacity and the earnestness with which the amendment moved by the honourable and learned member for Corinella is resisted, and with which the argument is advanced that these trades unions ought to be allowed to flourish as political organizations. If it be true-and I believe it is-that the Bil l could be made -a practicable working measure, fulfilling the desires and aspirations of the original as well as of its present sponsors, without the intervention of political purposes, why make this a vital question ? to be conceded the important Why do the Ministry threaten to throw this Bil l under the table merely because it is proposed to impose a legal disability upon those trades unions which add political obThey should go jects to their organization ?

It will be deplorable and deeply to be regretted if , through any caprice on the part of this Ministry-throug h pique at the carriage of a mere amendment of detail-the y throw up the measure and bring about a crisis. Considering the large amount of time that has been spent upon it the House ought to insist that the measure shall be passed and disposed of now and for all time, as far as that is possible. The Ministry are betraying their trust by threatening to abandon the Billi f a provision is inserted disabling certain semi-political trades unions. There has been no cry on the part of the unions to be allowed to cany on political campaigns. There is no attempt on the part of honourable members to cripple or disable political bodies pure and simple. Let them work together and meet together, as much as they like under their proper banners. There is plenty of scope for the political energies of the Labour Party in the organization known as the Political Labour League. do the Government want these trades unions, which are to be equipped with very important powers and privileges under this measure, to be not only trades unions, but political organizations ? It is a mere piece of bunkum to say that the carriage of this amendment would cripple or inflict a blow upon trades unionism. merely keep organizations formed for the protection of trades interests within the sphere of their legitimate legislative functions as recognised by law. the law if they go in for politics, so long as they carry out the obligations imposed upon them under this Bill? bodies that attain a status under this Bill should go into the Court free from political bias, and as pure labour bodies, not as political bodies. Under the status created by this Bill ""they will be able to collect large sums of money from their members. 'It is also proposed to force non-unionists into the ranks of the unions. For the purpose of securing the benefit of preference, non-unionists will be forced into these bodies; and it is nothing short of a political crime to force any workers into unions in which they find that they have to range themselves under a political banner, and to vote for men of a certain political type. them to vote in a.certain direction? when men join a union they begin to act togetherI do not say like a flock of sheep, but they act together.

If I thought that the amendment immediately under discussion did not go further than has been pointed out by the last speaker, I should see no real harm in it. As one who represents, I suppose, one of the strongest, if But whynot the strongest, trades union in Australia, which is not in any sense a political body, and which has not used any portion of its funds for political purposes, I think I can speak from a disinterested point of view.

But any one who reads the amendment must admit that if it were carried trades unions would be debarred from getting any of the privileges that this Bill is intended to confer upon them. It clearly indicates that they can do nothing of a political character. It does not only mean that they must not spend their money to support any political candidate for Parliament, or any political party, but they cannot use their funds to secure any amelioration of the laws of the country affecting their own interests. Take the coal-mining legislation in New South Wales. For twenty years the coal miners asked for legislation with regard to the ventilation of mines and the improvement of their working conditions. To secure reforms in that direction, though they did not spend their money upon elections, they did spend hundreds of pounds in other directions by way of helping forward this movement.

How would it be possible to run a newspaper to secure just rights for any particular body of men without some time or other inserting a paragraph or a leading article connected with the Parliament of the country ? Even the publication of an advertisement affecting some politician or political situation would constitute an interference in politics. The whole position is boiled down in the fact that there are certain honourable members who are prepared to support a Conciliation and Arbitration Bill of a certain character, but who are trying to insert amendments in this B ill that would prevent it from having any good results. I do not propose to prolong the debate by going into the merits or demerits of unionists as against non-unionists. The rates of wages paid in Australia and in other parts of the world to-day are to a very large extent regulated by the standards fixed by trades unions, and whether men be members of trades unions or not they receive those rates of wages, owing to the efforts of the trades unions. . I venture to say that where trades unions have been strongest the level of wages has always been highest. terms which have been used in this debate and with which I have no sympathy in general, though one of a body of men who have, perhaps, suffered more through the insidious attacks of employers in bringing men into the industiy in which they have been engaged to take their places in times of trouble, I say unhesitatingly that every man who works at a trade, and does not pay some contribution to a trade'union, reaps a reward for which he' contributes nothing. In my experience in times of trouble employers have been prepared to pay such men jected, to pay men who have gone on strike, if they them while the trouble continued, and thus assist them to break up the organization of the other men. the New South Wales Arbitration Act coming into force, an industrial trouble arose. and an effort was made to supplant unionist by non-union labour. It was, to a certain extent, successful, but the Arbitration Court having been established, the union men succeeded in getting their case heard before it, and one result was that the non-unionists had to go, and the unionists went back to the work at which they No t necessarily. had been previously employed. All this B ill provides for is that in a case like that men who take a stand in a dispute and appeal to the Court are given their just rights, after the settlement of the dispute, to the extent to which they existed before. The Bill is not intended to debar any man who may not belong to a union from obtaining employment, but it is intended to provide that men shall not be sacrificed because of their adherence to some principle for which they have fought in connection with a trade dispute. So far as its utility to the general body of workers throughout Australia, whether they be unionists or non-unionists, is concerned, this Bill must be dropped by the Government if the amendment is carried. Honourable members must be aware that where no trades union exists no trouble of the kind this B ill is intended to deal with can arise. There may be a body of men consisting of 100, 1,000, or 3,000, working for employers,'but if they are working without organization they are dealt with individually, and not as a body, and no trouble is likely to arise. The whole of this legislation is based on the industrial organization of employees and employers as well. Without applying effective without it. fective without it, and honourable members should therefore base it upon that principle, and consider that the prganizations on both sides must be given a preference.

They are men who have been born Is not that plain enough? and reared in trades unionism, who have never been afraid to strike if they thought a strike necessary; but before taking that extreme step they have done all that was possible to obtain a peacef ul' solution of their difficulties. There is nothing in the rules of the union in that district which is not of a voluntary nature; but while everything is upon the voluntary basis, one of the objects of the union is, I think, that which obtains in the Miners' Association of Australasia-the securing of reform by political enactment. Are we going to insert in the Bill a provision which would rob unionists of a right which they now possess ? To do so would be to pass a Bill which would be a shell without a kernel.

608,Mr Watkins,"The honourable memthe Committee came to a division on the amendment before it. But before it does so, I wish to say a few words, not in regard to the motive of my amendment, but in explanation of its effect upon the Bill. My motive is purely to alter the machinery of' the Bill, not to affect the interests of Ministers. My object is to work the' Bill with organizations whose rules will be simple, and whose subscriptions will be small, so as to afford inducements to join to the greatest number of persons; organizations into which every employee in an industry in a district can come without losing his position in respect to his friendly society. A man joining an organization provided for in the Bill as it stands must either drop out of his friendly society or pay two subscriptions. friendly society associated with a particular church or district, and under the B ill as it stands would either have to pay two subscriptions, or upon becoming a member of a registered organization, discontinue his membership of the friendly society.

But I do not think we can make use of State organizations under the Bill as it stands. We can use only Inter-State or Federal organizations, and I believe that, as a matter of fact, some of the trades are at the present time federating with a view to coming under the provisions of the Bill. I heard in Adelaide last week that even the railway men are organizing on a Federal basis, so as to have a constitutional status when the B ill passes. It is not at all clear that, as a matter of constitutional law, we can make use, for the purposes of the Bill, of existing trades unions which are purelyState unions. two would meet the difficulty. the change of a rule or two, but the federation of two or more unions in different States. federated. to do, to register under my amendment, would be to drop from the rules of their organization such as appertain purely to friendly societies or political objects.

They retained their distinct legislative capacities, financial, and general, and can, if they choose, change their constitutions without affecting the Constitution of the ""Commonwealth. Similarly the existing trades unions .of the States could, by federation, form a new body, with one object slightest objection to and one set of rules, framed purely for the In the two purpose of the Bill, continuing under their existing organizations their educational, social, friendly society, and political objects.

The subscriptions to the organizations formed under the B ill should be small, the rules should be simple; and they should be absolutely under the control of the Federal Act. So long as the associations were trades unions, that had been converted into organizations under the Bill, their rules would be governed by State laws, and it would therefore be within the power of the State Parliament to absolutely neutralize the effect of any rules we might prescribe.

At that time there was a very strong feeling in opposition to the trades unions; but, in the face of that, I took the platform at the Town Hall, with the object of assisting those who had been reduced to distress through the strike. Therefore no honourable member should impute to me any sinister motive. My sole object is to see that the organizations created for the purposes of the Bill are effective. I desire that their rules shall be simple, and that they shall embrace the whole of the employees in an industry, and thus attain to the highest degree of strength, and provide effective machinery for the working of the Act. I rose principally because, owing to the allegations which have been made that this amendment is really directed against .trades unionism, and that, if carried, it would deal a deathblow at the unions, I thought a few words from me were due to the Committee. lay the Committee to any great extent, but I desire to refer to two matters to which I think it is only proper to advert. In the first place, a statement has been circulated throughout the Commonwealth that only one of six or seven of the adult workers in New South Wales is a trades unionist. right honourable member for East Sydney fathered that statement, but I forget who first put it forward. hear that the statement originated with the honourable and learned member, because it is just what we might have expected from him. lutely incorrect, in the sense in which it has been used. unionists in New South Wales. That embraces only the numbers furnished to the Registrar of the Arbitration Court of New South Wales, as representing the membership of the unions which had registered and sent in returns. A number of unions are not registered under the Arbitration Court, and some of the registered unions had not, sent in returns up to the date at which those figures were compiled. The other day I gave, from the Statistical Register, a rough idea of the number of workers in New South Wales, and of the number which should be subtracted as belonging to trades, professions, and callings in which no unions are in existence. The people engaged in these occupations are not eligible to join the existing unions, and the granting of any preference to the members of existing unions would not affect them one way or the other. The honourable and learned member for Werriwa was guilty of promulgating one of those halftruths which it is so difficult to pursue when it is desired to arrive at the actual condition of affairs. cludes a number of occupations from the calculation. those persons who are engaged in occupations in which no unions exist, and who 'could not therefore be detrimentally affected by any proposal to grant a preference to unionists. knows that the typewriters and shorthandwriters have lately formed a union. I do not intend to denot materially affect the calculation. agents are also forming a union. so small that they do not materiallyaffect the issue. Moreover, the instances which have been cited would correspondingly inThe crease the number of persons who are members of trades unions. Upon 5th April, Mr A. B. Spence, secretary to the Breadcarters' Union, in Sydney, wrote to the Daily Telegraph, amplifying the figures which I used here the other night. He states that at the end of December, 1903, there were 754,623 males in New South Wales.) Of that', number 310.321 were under the age of 1 7 years, and therefore 1 cannot be classed as adult workers. He adds that there are 20,719 persons between the ages of 65 and 113 years, or over 65 years of age. Consequently, the. actual number of bond fide adults in the State is 423,592. Of that number 10.809 a i e e n gaged in government, defence, law, and protection, not otherwise classed; 16,044 a r e persons ministering to religions, charity, health, education, science, and art; 20,128 are engaged in the supply of board and lodgings and the rendering of personal service; 8,985 find occupation in the exchange, valuation, insurance, lease, loan, or custody of money, house, land or property rights; 4,144 are engaged dealing in art and mjechanical productions; 16,689 are employed as general dealers, or in mercantile pursuits, not otherwise classed; and 424 are described as "" speculators on chance events.""

If we subtract that number from 423,592, we find that there are 121,932 males engaged in callings or occupations in which unions exist. Of that number, 66,000 are accounted for in the returns furnished by societies which are registered under arbitration laws. cluded in those returns? made for them. It is unfair, therefore, to argue that, because there are 400,000 odd workers in New South Wales, of whom only 70,000 are registered under the Arbitration Act, a proposal to grant a preference to unions in any way implies the possibility of those organizations prejudicially operating against non-unionists. ber, roughly, about one-half the adult workers ? half. by omitting all the able-bodied men. those individuals who are engaged in callings in which no unions exist. Honourable members opposite have made much of the possibility of men being called upon to subscribe to political doctrines and to benefit societies in order to secure the advantage of the preference which it is proposed to extend to unionists. I suppose that the Amalgamated Engineers' Society is one of the most, conservative of existing trades unions. upon its members, and it has established a parliamentary propaganda fund; which for years has been used in England for political purposes. Then 4,961 persons are enganization adopted special rules, which are applicable to any persons who care to join the organization under the arbitration laws operating elsewhere. These rules were adopted in Manchester in 1901, and are intended for iise in Australia and other parts of the world where arbitration laws are in force. Amongst other things it is laid down thatMembers admitted under these rules shall be known as "" members under the Arbitration Act."" They shall pay an entrance fee of 5s.

They shall not be entitled to any^of the pecuniary benefits of the Act aforesaid. These make a grand In other words,, they are not entitled to benefits in the shape of funeral allowances, or old-age pensions, or anything of that description. If they desire to participate in those privileges they can do so by paying an increased fee. The rules continueThey shall, however, be entitled to participate in benevolent, contingent, and legal assistance funds, to which they shall pay levies the same as ordinary f u l l members. They shall be admitted to all meetings, and be entitled to speak and vote upon all questions affecting themselves in any proceedings under the said Arbitration Act, and also to vote upon levies for the funds beforementioned, and at all elections for branch or general officers. They are, however, specially exempted from any levy for political purposes. That, it seems to me, is the happy medium upon, which-if a preference be granted to any particular union-the Court should insist in the interests of the non-unionists. It is that those individuals who join an organization under the preference clause, shall be exempted from any condition which may be sought to be imposed upon them in reference to politics or benefits. At the same time, the Court should not preclude the members of the organization from continuing in force their own regular rules for the purposes for which they were originally framed.

I believe, however, that I shall be pardoned if I follow the example of the Prime Minister, and take the liberty of saying a few words before we arrive at a decision. I have no personal quarrel with the Government in respect of the extraordinary surrender they have made of principles for which they have fought for years past in their trades unions and their party. If any one had said a few weeks ago that the Labour Party, sitting in the Opposition corner, as the guardian of this measure, and not entangled by views of Ministerial self-interest tion to make? reasons for making it. They sat in the Opposition corner, as we all admit, for a long time, as pure-minded patriots, fulfillin g the loftiest ideals of public life, and it is, therefore, remarkable that when, as a Ministry, they arrive at a position which they themselves consider one of crisis, as affecting their Ministerial offices, they surrender principle in a way that, I believeI may be wrong--wil l excite the astonishment-of the trades unionist's of Austialia. When I interjected across the table that the Government, in accepting the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs, would surrender the right of trades unionists to haVe a political soul within their organizations, the honourable member for Hindmarsh said he would take a certain course.

The honourable member for Hindmarsh publicly stated that he would never vote for any amendment which would do that which the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs proposes. What is the history of this matter? For years past preference to unionists, whether in Arbitration Courts or out of them, has been the heart and soul of Labour agitations in connection with industrial matters. The complaint of trades unions has always been that no honest worker who wishes to stand side by side with his fellow workers has any just reason for remaining outside a trades union.

679,Mr Reid,"I recognise good qualitiesfunds subscribed by the trades unions of Victoria? He is a man of ability, a man who has been doing a great work for the trades unions and for democracy in this country, that is, according to the opinion of his friends. But the moment this amendment is carried, if a trades union in Victoria came before the Australian Arbitration Court, and it was shown that it had given a single sixpence out of its funds to help Mr Tom Mann in his crusade, the bulwark of unionism would go. Unionists will be refused a preference, if sixpence has been subscribed from the union funds to Mr Tom Mann's political mission. That is a subject which will engage the attention of the trades unions of Australia. When they see the narrowness of the division list-whe n they see it eame to a question of one vote-on e vote either way one vote! got a labour caucus by one vote myself ! In the hidden recesses of a caucus meeting, in the vaults, it does not matter how you come out, even if it is by one vote. But when you are standing before the people of Australia, and dealing with great laws, and with great bodies of menof whose interests you are supposed to be the guardians, there is no .secret vault open to you. lation, if it ever occurs, is in the open light of day. find that this one thing which was the demand of trades unionism-the right to be political; the right to agitate as men within their own organizations-ha s become such an illegal thing that if there is the slightest pretence of it, the whole bulwark of unionism goes, and there is no distinction between a trades unionist and a man who is not. Well, these are matters for which my honourable, friends have not to answer to me. I admit that. But it is my duty from my point of view to let the public outside know what this amendment means. It is not a question of preference It is not a question of unionism. which is being done to-night. vernment have purchased their existence, for a week or two perhaps-in order to surrender the basic principle of the unions which have made them what they are. being exceedingly pathetic that the right honourable member, who was convinced until a few moments ago that the numbers were on his own side 5112 placid and agreeable all the time, has suddenly wakened to the fact that the numbers are not that way at all. found that out? before the right honourable member did. And having awakened to that position, the right honourable member betrays a sudden anxiety for our welfare, but no anxiety whatever as to the public interest. What a contrast after the pleading of the right honourable member last week, when he asked the Government to accept some reasonable amendment amendment of the honourable and learned member for Angas. honorable and learned member for CorinI often ella was then before the Chair. to accept that. able member did not ask the Government to accept any amendment in particular, but he did ask that some concession should be made in favour of the non-unionists-thos e men who comprised five-sixths of the workThis sort of manipumen of New South Wales. He asked that something should be done for these And what do we find ? We poor non-unionists. He said, "" Let the Government consider them."" How much is the right honourable gentleman considering them now ? man admit that, he has done it ? never betrayed the slightest intention to do other than provide for the. non-unionist equally with the unionist. I say distinctly that this attempt on the part of the Opposition to pose as the special friends of the non-unionists is like a pricked bladder as soon as people understand the question. It is, as I said last night, a spurious effort There is a plain thing to divert the attention of the people from The Gothe true issue before them. Non-unionists are protected under the measure, as to the conditions under which they are asked to join a union.

East Sydney is aware that I spoke to that amendment immediately after it was moved by the honourable and learned member, and without knowing that the Prime Minister or the Government intended to accept it.

I have, I think, made my attitude perfectly clear. I do not surrender the position I have taken that the unions are doing nothing illegal. The honourable member for Lang, who appears to take so great an interest in my remarks, has been urging for freedom to workers to do what they think is best.
