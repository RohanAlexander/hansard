Once again, the The other major similarity with the ABRD is Opposition does not oppose that. To a degree, the requirement that arterial road projects must there is a precedent for this with the unveiling of have prior project approval rather than postplaques at aged persons homes. There may also be construction reporting. This, together with the other precedents. The Opposition believes that statement by the Minister in his second reading taxpayers should know how thei:r taxes are being speech that he wants fewer but larger arterial spent.

GenerI have already noted several differences from ally speaking, the State Ministers and local the previous legislation but there are three others governments are opposed to tendering because of to which I will refer. The first, is the railway the possible effect it could have on continuity of option. I understand that State railways and, employment for their road gangs, particularly in urban transport authorities pay about $60m regional areas. The States also say that this rethrough the 2c per litre ABRD diesel excise.

The onarterial road grant to interstate main line upgradsite and geographic advantages of regionally based ing, which includes the acquisition of, rollingState or local, authority gangs should provide stock. The Minister has also given himself the disenough edge to win any tender, particularly in cretion to transfer funds immediately from the conjunction with exemptions to the tender renational roads category to interstate main line quirements. The Opposition has decided not to upgrading. The Minister has stated that he will move an amendment to require tendering at this agree to it only when it can be shown that such stage.
