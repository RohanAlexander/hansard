The amendment made by the Senate is to add the following sub-clause to clause 7:"" (C.) Notwithstanding anything contained in the last preceding sub-section, the Minister may, after advice from the State Minister, approve of the whole or any part of any amount paid to a State under sub-section (2.) of this section being applied in the provision of relief to distressed wheat-growers in that State in accordance with such method of distribution as is decided by the Minister after I ask honourable memadvice from the State Minister."".

I should like at this stage to amplify the iemarks which I made in a general way a few moments ago when explaining the necessity for this appropriation. It will be remembered that in the ""Wheat Industry Assistance Bill two methods were provided to deal with the amount set aside for the assistance of distressed farmers. In the first year at the unanimous wish of the States the sum of £500,000 is to be set aside and divided among the States in the proportion of £200.000 to Victoria and £100,000 to each of the States of Western Australia, South Australia and New South Wales. That money is partly to be used and is to be supplemented by the State governments; to assist farmers in marginal and distressed areas. notably Queensland, make definite contributions as they have had the good fortune this year to enjoy a good season. Although Queensland is only a relatively small wheat-producing State, the Queensland Government indicated it3 wish to provide some assistance for Victoria on condition that during the next period there would be established a similar fund from which, if Queensland growers found themselves in difficulty, they could be assisted, and on the further condition that the money should be used to endeavour to bring into being a long range policy for transferring farmers from marginal areas to areas capable of profitable production. In Queensland practically all wheat-growing is done on first-class land. Drought and adverse climatic conditions are the only factors likely to cause difficulties in that State during the next five years. If this amendment were not inserted in the bill the Queensland farmers would be automatically cut out of any assistance in drought years. When the Premier of Queensland read the bill he indicated his wishes to the Commonwealth Government and the amendment made by the Senate has been the result. of the Queensland growers be met under the provisions of clause 6, sub-clause' 3 ? tion is dealt with under clause 7, subclause 5. That is the clause which deals with the distribution of the second kind of payments provided for. in paragraph b of clause 6. It was found, however, to be drawn in such a way as to exclude Queensland from participating in the benefits of any distribution of this special allocation. Government had put up this proposal at the Premiers Conference, the Commonwealth would have agreed to it. land said that the bill as drawn did not comply with the terms of the agreement reached at the conference, and that, when he discovered what had been done, ho telegraphed to a. senator with a view to having the position remedied.",16,Wheat Industr Y Assistance

56,Mr Curtin,"The Premier of QueensQueensland telephoned to the Prime Minister regarding the matter, and as soon as the position was realized, the Government agreed to accept the amendment. SirHENRY GULLETT (Henty) [11.2] I am opposed to the amendment. I have already expressed the opinion that it is monstrous that the consumers of bread should be burdened with a special and excessive tax in order to raise the world parity price of wheat to a level deemed by the Government to be payable. That is bad in itself, but I think it is a still greater iniquity that £500,000 of the would have had no alternative but to money so raised should be distributed among farmers whose crops have absolutely failed, and who have no wheat on which to base a claim. Now, this further extension of the principle makes the position still worse. Bread consumers are to be taxed to compensate farmers for crops that have been destroyed by bushfires, or by rust or smut or rabbits, or by any agency whatsoever. This had nothing to do with the original intention of tbe bill, which was to provide for a subsidy on wheat produced. If this amendment is agreed to, the Commonwealth Minister may, upon the advice of a State Minister, make a grant to a wheat-grower who is merely in distress, and they can charge it up to the poorer sections of the community, who must pay. I think that the Government has lost its senses over this measure. It is totally lacking in any sort of sympathy with the more humble people. It is blind to social justice of any kind, and to bring this amendment forward now is to rub salt into the wounds already inflicted. This matter has been discussed in principle before. I think it must be acknowledged that the payment of £500,000 a year to compensate farmers for seasonal adversity, or to transfer farmers from uneconomic areas, is not a proper use for money raised .by an excise duty on flour. I said as much in my second-reading speech. We are faced with the fact that this Parliament does not possess complete legislative powers to deal with problems associated with the wheat industry. lowed by the Minister for Commerce( Sir Earle Page) on this occasion, instead of formulating his own plan and making it a matter of acceptance by the States, the Minister, knowing the odium attaching to the financial features of the scheme, wishes to make the States partners in this method of raising money to assist the growers. otherwise, in view of the decision of the people at the referendum? have drawn up this proposal as he thought it should operate, and he could then have put it before the States who accept it. done anything at all. wealth could still have paid a bounty upon wheat as in previous years, but the States wanted something moTe. The home-consumption . price for wheat, which the consumers are asked to pay, is something wholly apart from the rendering of assistance to the farmers because of seasonal adversity and the transference of farmers from uneconomic areas. As a matter of fact, provision against seasonal adversity should, in large part, be regarded as a cost of production covered by insurance. However, as the bill left this chamber, it provided that for the current year £500,000 should be used, either for transferring farmers from marginal lands, or as compensation for losses suffered through seasonal adversity. In Queensland, there is no problem of marginal lands, and this year there is no seasonal problem, though the consumers in Queensland will contribute towards the relief of farmers suffering from seasonal adversity in Victoria and three other States. It may be that, in three years' time, the farmers of Queensland will have a _ seasonal problem of their own, but under this legislation as it stands, unless the amendment be agreed to, they, who will have contributed towards the assistance of farmers in other States, will be. denied the right to receive assistance in their turn if they should need it. I agree that, if we allow any of this money In regard to the course folto be used to assist the farmers in any State because of seasonal adversity, then the farmers of Queensland are entitled",17,Henby Gullett Th E Message To That £500 000 The Other States

62,Mr Curtin,"Then the Commonto tlieir share when occasion arises. is proposed to provide £100,000 this year for the assistance of distressed farmers in New South ""Wales. Queensland will contribute its share of this money, but, unless the amendment be agreed to, New South Wales will make no contribution towards the relief of distressed farmei'3 in Queensland should such relief become necessary in the future. Therefore, while I disapprove of the principle embodied in this proposal, I think that, in common fairness, Queensland has a right to expect us to accept the amendment of the Senate. I was glad to hear the concise expression of opinion by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) regarding the relationship between the various States in this matter, and the duty which one State owes to another. been a beneficiary in one year should assist another State in a subsequent year if it is in difficulty. The honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett) followed up his somewhat splenetic attack of a few days ago on this measure with another this morning on this amendment, and the second attack is, to my mind, equally unreasonable. He apparently takes the view that this amendment, if agreed to, will place an additional impost on the people. He fails to realize that the Parliament has already agreed that a certain home-consumption payable to the wheat-growers for that part of their wheat which is consumed within Australia. It must be remembered that the money used to assist growers in distressed areas is"" to be taken out of the fund created for the purpose of ensuring to the growers a home-consumption price. Therefore, it will actually be provided by the wheat growers, who have a crop, for the benefit of those who have no crop, or who are, in distress because of seasonal conditions.

What will he the obvious development if this amendment is carried? We know the political pressure that can be applied on State Ministers by organized bodies such as the wheat-growers have formed. It will be very much easier to hand out year after year money from this fund to farmers on marginal areas by describing them as distressed wheat-growers than it will be to proceed with the transfer of those farmers to other more productive pursuits. Once this proposed new subsection is passed, year in and year out tbe very people whom we are proposing to transfer to other areas will be the people who will be the distressed wheat farmers who will be brought under its provisions. The Minister for Commerce( Sir Earle Page) has justified the acceptance of this amendment by pointing to the special circumstances of Queensland. My opposition would not be so strong if I felt that the operation of the clause were to be restricted to that State, but that would not be constitutionally practicable. Consequently, all State Ministers will be able to take advantage of this proposed new sub-section. I say, without tlie least doubt or hesitation, that, if this amendment is agreed to, we shall find, instead of a serious attempt being made to transfer wheat-farmers on marginal land to other areas, that they will be given assistance from this fund by reason of the fact that they are in distressed circumstances. son, I oppose the amendment. honourable member for Eawkner( Mr Holt) suggested that this money would be paid year in and year out, but I remind him that in the House we carried an amendment limiting the operation of the whole clause to a maximum period of five years. clause in the bill was objected to by many farmers and the Country party, but when it was a matter of compromise, because of the insistence of the States, it was necessary to concede the point to secure the scheme. This year £500,000 and for four more years an amount up to £500,000 will be allocated for specific purposes. I realize the position of Queensland, and, as the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) has pointed out, there may be justification for consideration of. its special circumstances. The honourable gentleman said that the position which might arise should be insured against by the farmers'. One may insure against fire and hail, but one cannot insure against drought or red rust. It is possible that from time to time, drought and red rust may wreck and ruin the Queensland crops, as drought his ruined them in other States this year, and they are the two most serious troubles which Queensland farmers contend against. Neither can be controlled or insured against. This amendment will not alter the aggregate amount which will be made available from the fund, but possibly may alter the direction of part of the allocation, and although, as I said, right from the start we disapproved of the principle because the fight was for a home-consumption price, we are satisfied that, after five years the clause automatically disappears, and there will be a home-consumption price on exactly the same basis as a compulsory pool, the butter scheme, or the rice pool. Therefore, I am supporting the amendment. oppose the amendment, which simply means that, by arrangement between the Commonwealth Minister and a State Minister, funds can be found from this tax to assist any distressed wheat-farmer, no matter what the cause of his distress Eor that reamay be. It emphasizes the inadvisability of collecting the tax in this way.

It wa3 intended to be protective of the wheat industry. I believe in protecting industry, whether primary or secondary. I believe in a home-consumption price for wheat. It is only the method of collecting the money to provide bhat home consumption price to which I object. It is wrong and improper that distressed farmers should have any call upon this fund, which is to be established to give that home-consumption price. the application of the bill. When this clause was formerly before the committee, I moved for the deletion of the provision under which moneys are to be made available for the transfer of wheat-farmers from the marginal areas, because I think that it is wrong in principle that such provision should be contained in a measure designed to give wheat-farmers a home-consumption price, and because it defeats the objective of giving monetary assistance to distressed farmers. At present there are no marginal areas in Queensland, but the day will come when there will be, because wheat-growing is expanding in that State. Queensland has land exactlv similar to land in the other States which is described as marginal land, and, eventually, wheat will be grown on it. It may not be next year or the year after, but it will eventually come. The transfer of farmers from marginal areas is a definite obligation on. the lands departments of the States. Tbe CHAIRMAN -Order! The matter which the honourable gentleman is discussing has already been debated and agreed to. The question is whether Queensland should participate. mention of Queensland. of what I said, the Minister's statement pointed out that the amendment had been made by the Senate in order to enable Queensland, and other States to benefit. Mr Chairman, it is a wrong interpretation of the amendment made by the Senate, to .say that it specifically provides special consideration to Queensland. In the first place, It would be unconstitutional to do so, and, secondly, it is not even proposed. I suggest that you are misdirecting the committee. the amendment is to give special consideration to Queensland, but in order to make it constitutional to do so, it has to be general to the States. before. opposed to a special allocation to Queensland or to any other State. Far from it. This is a Commonwealth Parliament, and Ave should ensure that, as far as possible, equal justice is meted out to all of the States. I object to the principle of in-, eluding such a provision as this in home consumption price legislation. It should never have been in the bill, but since it is, and since it will give universal benefit to those in distress, I cannot see that I can oppose it. It is wrong in principle, however, to include provision for the transfer of farmers from marginal lands in the bill because it defeats its very object. rather late to raise any question of principle against the use of any of this money for the purpose of relieving distress. This committee has already agreed to the bill which includes clause 7 specifically allocating £500,000 for the purpose of relieving distress. honourable gentlemen who have supported that allocation are now baulking at a proposal that in the future some part of the £500,000 should be set apart for the",20,Henby Gullett Th E Message To That £500 000 The Other States

89,Mr Nairn,"Yes. Some of the samerelief of tlie distress. I do not see any good ground for saying that we should not use any of this money for the relief of distress in the future. Every grant that this Parliament has made in past years has been for the purpose of relieving distress. The relief of distress is the only ground on which Parliament has ever been asked to grant money. Either because of drought or because of the condition of the world markets, the farmers are not able to carry on with wheat at its present price, and the object of this bill is to give relief. take from the already heavily distressed, in order to give to others who are distressed. That is our argument. the honourable gentleman refers when he speaks of the already heavily distressed. He is getting back to tbe maudlin sentiment expressed by the honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett) with regard to taxing the needy. Whatever principle may be involved in that, it has already been accepted by the House. The Senate's amendment does not affect it ; it does not propose to place any further burden upon consumers. cation of the fund slightly. prejudicing the consumers in any way. Tbe point is that it may be desirable in future to use some of this money for the purpose of relieving an area which has lost crops from storms, fire, or drought, and I see no danger in leaving the provision of such relief to the discretion, first, of the State governments, which must make the necessary application, and, secondly, of the Commonwealth Government, which must give its approval. The approval of two governments will be required before this special relief can be granted. It seems to me that the objections to this amendmentare merely advanced in the way of tactics, and not on the grounds of principle. Queensland has insisted upon this amendment, because it is part of tbe terms upon which that State agreed to support the proposals embodied in this bill; and if the amendment is not agreed to the Commonwealth will be placed in a difficult position in relation to Queensland. I repeat that opposition to the amendment is a tactical move, really intended to strike at the general principle of the bill, and not at the amendment itself. When tliis bill was before the House the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) clearly set out the Opposition's attitude with regard to the means proposed by this measure to raise the necessary money. That honourable gentleman moved an amendment strongly opposing the imposition of what has been justly referred to as a bread tax. The House, however, defeated the amendment and agreed to the principle of the bill. gentleman must not discuss the principles of the bill. down the premises, as I must do, in order to set out my attitude towards the amendment. Rightly or wrongly, the House has determined in favour of a certain principle. I say that the principle is wrong, for reasons which I need not repeat. The Premier of Queensland has now pointed out to the Commonwealth Government that as there is no drought in his State this season, Queensland will make no claim upon the amount of £500,000 which is to be set aside this year for the relief of distressed farmers -Had that £500,000 not been taken out of the total fund, Queensland wheat-growers, like those of other States, would have shared in it on a production basis; but Queensland has agreed to the £500,000 being taken out of the total fund, thus reducing the amount which would be shared by the Queensland wheat-growers. The bill, as it stands, provides that after the first year the £500,000 is to be used for the purpose of transferring wheat farmers from marginal lauds. As the Premier of Queensland has pointed out, there are no marginal lands in that State, and that it is not equitable that that State should be denied the' right of deriving benefit from the fund should adverse seasonal conditions cause distress among its wheat-farmers in subsequent years. If , out of this "" loot,"" as some speakers have called it, a fund is to be created, then distribution from that fund should be equable between the States. This £500,000 should not in future be allocated entirely for the purpose of transferring farmers from marginal lands.",21,Henby Gullett Th E Message To That £500 000 The Other States

98,Mr Blackburn (Bourke) [11.43].,"the purpose of withdrawing unprofitable marginal land from wlieat production. I suppose what is envisaged by the Commonwealth is the adoption of a scheme, such as that in operation in Victoria, for the purpose of removing people from unprofitable wheat growing lands. The Senate has inserted an alternate scheme, and I think it is desirable that there should be an alternate scheme, covering not only Queensland but every other State as well. for that. Every State should have an opportunity to induce the Commonwealth to allow it to apply part of this £500,000 to the relief of distressed farmers. I am not enamoured by the proposal that this money should be used exclusively for the purpose of. retiring land irom wheat production. Under the legislation provided for this purpose in Victoria, people who have spent all their lives on the land have been paid a sum of money and removed from their farms. I would much sooner see this money applied for the relief of distressed farmers. Commonwealth should be able to approve of a scheme for apj>lying part of the proceeds of this taxation to the relief of individual distressed wheat-growers. If the Senate's amendment is agreed to any State will be able to apply to the Commonwealth for money either entirely for retiring land from wheat production, or partly for retiring land and partly for giving relief to wheat-growers, or entirely for giving relief to distressed wheat growers. The proposals advanced by any State would have to be approved by the Commonwealth. I do not know why the provision should not be made more flexible. The amendment of the Senate certainly makes the scheme more flexible and elastic, and that, to my mind, is desirable. It is regrettable that it should have been pation of unsuitable marginal lands suggested to us that the amendment has application only to Queensland. As a matter of fact it has general application to all the States. The honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Eadden) has made it clear that acceptance of the amendment will not add one penny to the amount of tax that bread consumers will be required to pay. [91] bill is to stabilize the wheat industry, and one part of the scheme in the bill which the House passed, provided for the use of a certain sum of money to enable farmers on marginal land of unsuitable kind to be placed in other avenues of industry. The Senate now proposes that portion of the amount earmarked for that purpose may be used to relieve distressed farmers in other ways. I shall support the amendment. [11.47-] I am profoundly disappointed at the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) to this amendment. It seems that it has been accepted by him in consequence of certain representations by the Premier of Queensland. The honourable gentleman's action in this connection reveals the sharpest inconsistency when considered in relation to his earlier attitude towards the bill. If he persists in his approval of this amendment, he will no longer be able to protest throughout the country against the action of the Government in imposing a bread taxthat is, if he desires to be consistent. Acceptance of this amendment will unThe questionably extend the scope of the liability of the Government, in that it will justify claims for assistance in respect of all kinds of disabilities from which farmers may suffer. The fimdamental object of the whole scheme was to provide the farmers with a parity price for that proportion of their wheat crop which is consumed in Australia. Unhappily, another element was introduced when it was decided that £500,000 of the proceeds of the tax should be earmarked for the purpose of assisting farmers on unsuitable marginal lands to be placed in other avenues of industry. That was bad enough in a scheme like this, but it would be deplorable to declare now that distress arising from any other cause than that associated with the occushall be included as a reason for granting assistance from this fund. This would open the door to all sorts of claims. The Leader of the Country party ( Sir Earle Page) may say next year "" The amount of £4,000,000 is not sufficient; £6,000,000 must be provided.""

Mr Anon us CAAIEKON I suggest, Mr Chairman, on the point, raised by the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), that tbe amendment of the Senate deals definitely with the manner in which the amount of £500,000 is to be distributed'among the States. All of tbe Stares may be involved in this matter; it is definitelv not confined to anv one State. about the manner in which the amount at issue is to be distributed, and the circumstances of the farmers which may be taken, into consideration in determining the distribution. that adverse seasonal conditions experienced over a large portion of the Commonwealth may make it impossible for the question of the repatriation of growers from marginal areas to be dealt with. In my opinion we are not getting down to the root cause of the great problem which confronts fhe wheat industry. This is perhaps a fitting time to consider what is being done in other countries for the assistance of the industry. In yesterday morning's newspapers, the following appeared:The. Premier of Manitoba.' Mr John Bracken, giving evidence before tlie royal commission, which is inquiring into relation? bovinces, demanded a national policy regarding what IK described as tbe increasingly grave world wheat situation. He asked how Canada could continue to find market* for two-thirds of her wheat in face of steadily shrinking world markets. If Canada had known of this situation .'40 years ago. he said, she would not have developed hah? her present wheat acreage. If the present situation was not remedied 250,000 farmers might cease to grow wheat and seek the dole. If the world would not. take the wheat being grown, be added, Canada should seek a planned arrangement with Australia, the Argentine, and the United States of America for limited production. That statement, which comes at a very appropriate time, causes me to think very seriousl3 over this question of marT ginal areas and the difficulties of the wheat production generally. I -am stressing this point not because I wish to indiulge in any form of propagandaI beg of honourable members to think otherwise-bu t because I believe that we should do everything possible to get down to the root causes that have brought, about such an unsatisfactory state of affairs in the wheat industry. Unfortunately, in this country we have distress in more than one section of the community. As a matter of fact, very few of our people at the moment are not suffering distress in some way or .another, though its degree varies according to the circumstances. Any interference w i th the price of staple products is capable of in tensifying distress more perhaps than anything else, and, therefore, it seems I am concerned that by this proposal we are merely to ask the people already suffering from distress to help others whose position in some instances is no better than theirs. Nobody denies that there It is possible is grave distress among the wheat-growers, hut there are other sections of the community suffering equally as much.. I should like a candid statement from the Government as to what is the difference between distress caused by seasonal conditions and distress caused by attempting t.o produce wheat in nr.rrginal areas, it seems to me that of the two the question of marginal areas is of major im portance. I say that for this reason: We may patch up the situation this year, but with the trend of world events, with all the changes that are, taking place in the internal . economy of various countries through their increasing desire to become self-sufficient, the time must eventually arrive when the position of the wheat-growers will become considerably worse .than it is to-day. Therefore, our whole efforts should be directed towards transferring farmers from marginal areas to others more suitable for. the production of wheat.

Why should the rise to the fear that in the future the difficulties of the wheat Industry may become even greater than they are to-day. What does the Government propose to do in regard to this matter ? Every year since I have been a member of this Parliament tbe plight of the wheat-growers has been made the subject of long discussions. I realize that the growers have a just claim on the sympathy of this Parliament; I know that bad conditions prevail in the industry; but I am not at all satisfied that the proposal now before us is a real attempt to solve the problem. It seems to be merely a temporary expedient. Therefore, I should like to have from the 'Government some statement of what is in its mind regarding the difference between the problem presented by distress occasioned by seasonal conditions and the problem of production iu marginal areas. [12.7] I have tried hard to keep out of the ring in regard to wheat. I rise to Mr Chairman, I take exception to the oppose this amendment as I think any one inaccuracy of the statement attributed to who claims to have even a superficial me. knowledge of planned reconstruction must oppose it, although I clo not member wishes to make a personal oppose assistance to farmers. Now explanation he may do so. I remind him, is 'the time when this Parliament however, that he will have an opportunity should be "" put on the spot"" in to reply when the honourable member for regard to the settlement of uneconomic the Northern Territory ( Mr Blain) conlands.

I can only assume that the reason larger than was ever contemplated by the it has neglected to do so is because it framers of the Constitution. As the result continues to filch from the States money of .this invasion of the taxing field, the which rightfully belongs to them. This States have no option but to approach matter should no longer be dealt with on the 'Commonwealth for relief. This is the chopping-block of politics. I wish to a matter, however, that cannot be divorced buttress my arguments by citing what from politics. Government may now spend its money America. under the ruling of the majority, yet it afternoon of the 6th January, 1936, may not supervise the processes by which when the 'Constitution of the United wheat-growers will be removed from central government be expected to hand money over to the States without having a very definite say as to how that money should be expended and an assurance given that more suitable areas will be developed? This question should be settled now once and for all. That becomes all the more necessary because we have large areas of land suitable for the cultivation of a diversification of crops, not a great deal of which is being fully developed. It has been stated recently in a report presented to the Meat Board by Mr Coleman that one-fifth of the lamb-producing land in Australia is situated in Western Australia, most of it being as yet undeveloped.

That makes it quite clear that the Commonwealth Minister will, at all times, retain control of the situation. Unless he agrees that the proposition submitted by a State is satisfactory, the State is not likely to get away with it. I presume that, while 1 remain in the position of Assistant Minister for Commerce, I . shall have something to do with the various proposals put forward by the States. I should regard it, as niy duty to scrutinize very closely any proposal put up by a State government for the relief of distressed farmers. If I were not satisfied, I. should refer the matter to the Minister for Commerce, who would probably refer it to Cabinet. Therefore, there does not seem to be the slightest danger that the fears expressed by honourable members in this debate will be realiKed. The honourable member for West: Sydney wanted to know how we were going io separate the marginal farmers from the distressed wheat-growers. I cannot answer that, and I do not suppose that there is anybody here who can. It, is essentially a matter for the States. This Parliament has no power to formulate a scheme for removing farmers on marginal wheat, hind any more, than it has a right to determine which distressed fanners -diall receive help from the State govern merit. All we can do is to make our views known to the States, and to a«k them to translate those views into action. As it is the will of this that the problem of marginal farmers should be dealt with, it should be taken a= a direction from this Parlia.!/;-. Thompson. meut, irrespective of the amendment, that the administration of the aet shall be directed towards impressing orr the States the importance of dealing with the problem. 1. do uot say that it will be easy. The problem does not exist in all the States. It does not exist to any degree in Western Australia, and not at-all in Queensland at the present time. In New South Walesi t exists only in the chronic .drought areas. 1 do not know to what, degree it is present in Victoria, but I do not think it is regarded there as serious. the Mallee is one of the best wheatgrowiug areas in Victoria. It is only at the present time, when' Victoria is suffering one of the worse droughts in its history, that rhe problem has come to the fore. Hadi t not been for the attitude of Ihe Victorian representatives at the recent. Premiers Conference, I doubt, whether this matter would have come before Parliament, at all. It was mainly at the instance of the Victorian representatives that the other States agreed to a modification of the home-consumption price plan in order to permit the payment of the £500,000 to distressed farmers. Now we find that Queensland has, logically enough, raised the point that it has no problem of marginal lands, and this year, at any rate, it is not concerned with distressed farmers. It is only fair, therefore, that it should have the right, to divert some of the money to the relief of distressed farmers, if the need should arise in tbe future. Queensland will provide about £500,000 a year for the fund, and this year it, will get. practically nothing back. .1 cannot see why honourable members should wish to wreck the bill because the Goverument wants to meet the wishes of Queensland in this respect. I do not, think that it is our duty to show the States how to deal with the problem of marginal area.s. No plan has yet. been evolved for completely solving this problem, or, if there has, I have not heard of it. Certainly, none was produced at the recent conference of wheat-growers.

Money expended in that direction would do permanent good, but, if this amendment be incorporated in the bill, I can fprsee the Government allowing this money to be dissipated in a direction other than that originally intended, the marginal farmer being allowed to remain on his land year after year, and being assisted year after year to stay on his farm.

Party loyalty often forces us to do things which we otherwise would not do, but I tell the Assistant Minister that I shall vote against this amendment, just as I voted against the bread tax originally. intention of sub-clause 5 of clause 7 was the transfer of wheat-farmers from marginal lands. It has been pointed out in support of the amendment that Queensland has no marginal lands and that, unless the amendment be made, it will not derive any benefit from the allocation of £500,000 a year. If Queensland has no marginal areas it is not entitled to. participate. ginal lands. docs, there is nothing in the bill to preof this money should be devoted to assistvent it from participating in the scheme. While Queensland has no marginal land, it should not participate. I consider that the amendment is a hastily conceived attempt to correct what is undoubtedly an anomaly in the bill. Although in the first place I was opposed to the allocation of £500,000, the com1 mittee has agreed to it, and having allocated it, we should see that it is expended legal advisers of the Government could in the best way to aid the industry. As the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Sitting suspended from 1.1/5 to 2.15 p.m. Rosevear) pointed out, the amendment is a departure from the intention of honourable members that the money should be directed toward the solution of one of the most pressing problems of the wheat industry, namely, marginal wheat growers. The amendment would allow this £500,000 to be expended, not on the removal of farmers from marginal areas, but on the provision of relief for those farmers who might also be engaged in uneconomic wheat-growing. A special fund is to be provided for five years. As the bill stands, the fund will be used in the first year for the relief of distress, and in the four subsequent years for the removal of farmers from marginal areas. It is well known that the purpose of this amendment is to correct an anomaly in respect of Queensland, which has no marginal land on which wheat is grown. The amendment was devised to make available to that State something in return for what it has done this year for the other States, notably Victoria. The Victorian wheat industry is in a bad way, and Queensland has generously forgone its share of this year's allocation. I can see the anomalous position in which Queensland is placed, and I want to do The something to help it. I want also to do something for those States which have marginal areas. I find myself therefore in a dilemma. Paramount in my mind, however, is the need to remove farmers from the marginal lands, and, if this amendment is gone on with, I shall have to vote against it. from marginal areas is a matter for tbe States. the intention of the committee that some ance to the States for that purpose.

137,Mr Scholfield,"I am not comthe Minister should withdraw this amendment in favour of one more acceptable to the committee. I realize the importance of inserting a provision in the legislation to safeguard those States which have relinquished their claim to a certain amount of assistance this year, in favour of other States, more especially Victoria. That is the dilemma in which I now find myself. I do not wish to see the principle of this measure altered. It was passed in its original form by this chamber and now it has been returned from the Senate with a request that a certain provision be made. I feel very keenly about that provision which it is proposed should be inserted. I sincerely desire that distribution among all States should be equable. I appreciate the generous action of one State in particular, namely, Queensland, which has allowed money it could normally claim this year to go to other States, particularly Victoria, which have been suffering adverse seasonal conditions. Therefore, I do not wish to see Queensland or, indeed, any other State, prevented from participating in future benefits which may be derived from the allocation of this £500,000, but I urge that the principle of removing people from unprofitable marginal lands should not be departed from. It is said that the Commonwealth Minister for Commerce has the right to veto any suggestion made by a State Minister, but I ask how many Commonwealth Ministers would stand up to the States and argue as to what should be done in those States? That has not been done in the past and will not be done in the future. I suggest that the Minister should investigate the possibility of adopting the Senate's amendment in another form. matter for very great regret that this factor was not considered when the bill was being discussed by this chamber originally. Naturally, as a representative other States, and the idea of assisting of Queensland I am sympathetic with the proposal contained, in this amendment and I think my sympathy is shared by almost every other member-bu t I agree that the acceptance of the amendmember believe that assistance should be ment in its present form would endanger given to farmers suffering as the result to a certain degree the principle laid of floods? down in clause 7 of the bill. I propose that the amendment should be redrafted so that a limitation of the amount to be used for the purpose of granting relief to distressed wheat-farmers in any one year may be fixed. If , for instance, it were stipulated that not more than £100,000 could be paid out of this fund in any one year for the relief of distress caused by adverse seasonal conditions, that would ensure that £400,000 would be left to carry out the principle set out in the bill. I should be glad to know if the Minister would accept an amendment of that kind. Some such provision would meet the wishes of the Queensland growers, who, as' every fair-minded person will agree, are entitled to some consideration. Queensland, as has been pointed out, has practically no marginal wheat lands. I should like to make my position quite clear and I shall attempt to do so very briefly. This £500,000 is actually being subscribed by the wheat-growers themselves by forgoing portion of the home consumption price which is proposed to be established by this bill. The intention of the bill is that this money should be allocated for the purpose of finding new occupations or new holdings for wheat-growers on unprofitable marginal areas. The effect of the amendment is that the money may be wholly or partly set aside for the pirrpose of relieving distress due to adverse seasonal conditions. I am in agreement with that proposal to a certain degree because I realize that in legitimate wheat-growing areas, acute distress may be caused by drought or other seasonal causes. For instance, tliere has been a severe drought in a legitimate wheat-growing area of Victoria during the last two years. In on© year the crop was very small and this year in some cases there will be no crop at all. Similar conditions may apply in legitimate wheat growing areas of New South Wales and farmers during such periods of adversity is a good one.",31,Iwcpu The Dominion Government And The Pro

The early years of a new settler's most difficult. be assisted, and this amendment leaves it open for assistance to be paid to any farmer in a legitimate area during periods of difficulty. As the amendment stands, however, I am afraid that there w ill be great difficulty in administration which is an all important matter. the honourable member for Fawkner( MrH o l t ) is most important-ther e is a grave possibility that in the majority of cases the assisted person may be tbe one who is occupying marginal lands and the one, therefore, whom it is desired should be removed from his holding and placed in some other vocation or avenue of primary production. then the whole underlying principle of this allocation would be lost. I point out ter for Commerce may not. always be some one who is au f a it with country conditions and may not therefore be in a position to determine for himself what areas are really marginal areas. Again, owing to the importance of other duties the Minister for ""Commerce may not be in a position to give to that allocation of this money the attention which is distinctly necessary, or pressure may be exerted by the States for the allocation of a greater proportion of the money for relief than for marginal area treatment. I am afraid that a good deal of the money paid for relief of distress in Victoria this year will go to farmers in these marginal areas. that the same thing may occur in oilier years from the money provided under this legislation. Farmers in the northern Mallee may receive assistance whereas actually they should IKS removed from their holdings and given employment in some other vocation or provided with holdings in more suitable areas. I propose to vote against, the amendment, but I suggest, that the compromise put. forward by the honourable member for I -tliink that Lilley( Mr Jolly) is a sound one which I hope w ill be accepted by the Minister. In my opinion, the amount to be paid to farmers in respect, of relief should be limited to 20 per cent, of the total allocation. I mention that figure specifically. It would mean the payment of £100,000 for relief of distress and £400,000 for the life are always the removal of farmers from marginal areas. Such settlers should We should then be secure in the knowledge that the degree to which the administration of this legislation could go wrong would be small. We should also be assured that relief could be given to a limited degree, at any rate, to those legitimate wheat areas . in which distress exists. At the same The point mentioned by time money could be provided for States which have not. the marginal area problem. The compromise suggested is a fair one and if it is .accepted I think it w ill meet the wishes of the majority of those who are opposed to the present -amendment. If n compromise is notaccepted, I shall oppose the amendment because I believe that the best way to If that is the case, help the wheat industry in all parts of the world is to retire marginal lands from production. Australia should do whatthat tbe Commonwealth Minisever it can to assist in this direction. There has been considerable confusion in connection with this small proposal which has been placed before us by the-Senate. The original legislation provided for a fund of £500,000 which was to 'be made available during the next five years for the purpose of assisting in flip, removal of distressed farmers from unprofitable marginal are..s, and placing them on holdings in better country or utilizing their original holdings for some other purpose. The legislation represents a sound endeavour t,r> relieve Parliament nnd the country It is quite possible generally of the necessity for voting huge sums of money ypar after year for the relief of wheat producers who arc trying to eke out an e.visienee on land which is not entirely suitable for production. That was the. bill as it passed through this chamber in its original form.

Queensland will receive nothing out of this scheme, as the bill now stands, and I must admit that State have been extraordinarily helpful matter. of Queensland is such as has enabled it to maintain a home-consumption price of its own for wheat for a number of years. this principle, it has intimated that it is prepared to do everything possible to help the other States"" to fix a home-consumption price. ' The value of the principle of a home-consumption price has also been demonstrated in Queensland in respect of both butter and sugar. The honourable member for Lilley( Mr Jolly) who, I take it, would support the Senate's amendment as it stands, has suggested an addition to it which may meet the views of certain honourable members who genuinely support the main principles of the bill, but feel that they cannot, accept this amendment. He has suggested that an amount not exceeding £100,000 of the £500,000 at issue may be allocated each year for drought relief. Personally, I am prepared to agree to an amendment, if the amendment made by the Senate is defeated, which would allow one-third of the total amount, which would be about £166,000, to be used for this purpose. This would meet the needs of, say, two States which might experience a drought in the same season. I agree with honourable members who contend that a limit should be placed upon the proportion of the £500,000 which may be used for purposes other than dealing with farmers on marginal areas, as that was in the minds of the State governments when they agreed to the original clause; and if it needs to be stated, the suggestion of the Sir Earle Page. honourable member for Lilley offers a reasonable compromise along these lines. The Minister for Commerce( Sir Earle Pago) has just given us a demonstration An amount not exceeding of flexibility of mind which I can only regard as indicative of utter recklessness in dealing with this subject. We were informed that the original proposals of this bill were in strict accordance with an agreement made by Commonwealth ancl State Ministers. The Labour party favoured certain clauses of the bill but that the representatives of resisted the provision that the money required for the fixing of a home-consumpin regard to the whole tion price for wheat should be raised by The geographical position a flour tax. Wc did not contest the principle that the wheat-farmers were entitled to a reasonable price for their wheat, and we accepted the figure that was suggested. Realizing tbe value of We said, however, that the debt structure of the farming community, and also the problems associated with uneconomic areas and seasonal adversity, should be detached from the proposal to fix a home consumption price for wheat. The bill originally provided that for the next four years after the first year an amount of £500,000 should be withdrawn from the proceeds of the flour tax and used to transfer certain farmers from uneconomic areas. It seems to me, as I said in the course of the general debate on the measure, that the decisions of the final conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers to bring in seasonal adversity were the result of afterthoughts. Apparently, the amendment which was inserted in the bill last night in the Senate, with the co-operation of the Government, was also an afterthought. Consequently a duty rests upon this committee to do its utmost to ensure that the amount of £500,000 to be withdrawn from the proceeds of the ' tax shall be justly used as between the several States. If the amendment of the Senate is accepted the settlement of the problem will rest with the Commonwealth and State Ministers who administer the scheme during the next four years. Personally I shall be staggered if this legislation is not amended before the expiry of the four-year period. I sincerely hope that it will be amended. The Senate proposal means that this year some States will contribute more to one State in",34,Iwcpu The Dominion Government And The Pro
147,Mr Curtin (Eremantle) [2.42],"respect of seasonal relief than they will themselves receive, ancl one State will make a contribution to this object knowing full well that it is never likely to receive anything itself in respect of the transference of farmers from uneconomic areas, and probably very little in respect of seasonal adversity. I think that in the earlier discussion this morning we said it would be unfair if, in two years' time, a State which now has no seasonal adversities should experience seasonal adversity and be unable to get relief out of the £500,000, which is the limit set out in the bill at present, even though it had contributed to an allocation whicli provided £200,000 for one State and £100,000 for each of three other States. I feel that, having regard to the inevitable seasonal character of this industry, if the provision is applicable this year, it should be repeated for each of the five years contemplated by the bill in regard to this £500,000. I am convinced that in each of the wheat-growing States that have not suffered seasonal adversity this year, there will be areas which will suffer adversity in each of the next four years. I know Western Australia fairly wellI do not think anybody can speak of Australia in terms of complete confidence-and so large is the area-cultivated for wheat in that State that it is almost inevitable that some patches of it will experience seasonal adversity each year. The same, I think, is true in respect of South Australia and some danger spots in Victoria, particularly in the Mallee and portions of the Western Riverina, which cannot be described as uneconomic areas, but which, because of periodical unreliability of rainfall in the growing period, having regard to the wide stretch of land cultivated for wheat, are certain to experience seasons of adversity. advocates a perpetual handout in each State? perpetual handout seems to be a jibe to cover up the failure to display a rational and fair contemplation of the needs of the industry. The wholo thing could be described as the honourable member describes it, but I refuse to do so. I think that seasonal adversity is an inherent probability for the wheat industry in Australia. droughts are experienced. always in the same area. If droughts occurred always in the same area, it would come within the category of an uneconomic area. I do not like the use of this £500,000 for either seasonal adversity or treatment of uneconomic areas, but the Hou^e has accepted the principle. As I have said, it is far fairer to leave the allocation of the whole of the £500,000 to agreement between the State and Federal Ministers, having regard to the circumstances of the year, as is contemplated in the Senate's amendment, than to restrict their discussion to one-third of that limit. I feel that, even during the next five years at any rate, the restriction to one-third would leave a sum inadequate to deal with seasonal adversity, ancl would mean that we were doing a stupid thing. We would be using the money to deal with uneconomic areas which can never be properly dealt with, while we should be at the same time jeopardizing the capacity of the good farmer to continue the farming of good areas. relief a State problem? removal from uneconomic areas. problem. ber now asks me to go back to my original objection to the whole provision of this £500,000. I hope I am not so narrow-minded as to fight vainly for things which have already been determined. The House has agreed that £500,000 shall be used this year for seasonal adversity and in the four following years for the treatment of farmers on uneconomical areas. The Senate, however, has said that that decision may be unfair, in that a State with no seasonal adversity this year may experience seasonal adversity two years from now, and that having contributed to the alleviation of seasonal adversity in another State this year, it should not be debarred from receiving assistance if it so happens",35,Iwcpu The Dominion Government And The Pro

159,Mr Fadden (Darling Downs) [2.»7j.,"that position will not always be accepted by Queensland. As a matter of fact, during the last three or four years, there has been a continuous drought in the wheat growing aieas of Queensland and, although the present season has been a good one, those bad conditions will return. Consequently some provision should be made for the ""participation by Queensland in a fund which is being specifically established to alleviate distress caused by adverse seasonal conditions. The proposition of the Senate leaye the matter on a proper and equitable basis as between the governments concerned, having regard to the conditions that exist at the time consideration has t.o he given to them. What more reasonable attitude could be adopted than to leave the matter to be considered by the Ministers of the State governments^' and by the Commonwealth Minister? I emphasize the fact that £500,000 is the maximum amount, and the provision is t.o be for only five years. The degree to which that fund will be drawn upon will depimd upon the conditions prevailing at the time. Too much consideration has been given by opponents of the amendment to the problem of marginal lands. That is a problem which, I admit, must be faced, but, why should Queensland have to contribute'towards the cost of solving that problem when it has no marginal lands itself? Queensland has its own problems, such as drought, pests, &c. For my part, I do not. believe that this arrangement for the relief of necessitous farmers should have been associated with the stabilization scheme at all. It should have been separate aud distinct, but the governments concerned have agreed to include it. The State governments shonld have accepted responsibility for the relief of distress, but circumstances over which they have no control have made that impossible, and they havethrown the responsibility on to the growers themselves. £500.00n is provided by the wheat growers out of their own fund, and there will be nn increase of the tax in order t.o obtain it. must admire the enthusiasm and energy with which the honourable member for .Darling Downs( Mr Fadden) has worked the parish pump. He treats thin matter merely from the point of view of how it will affect his own State, but surely it, is one of national concern. He started off by saying that the total proceeds of the tax should be devoted to providing a home-consumption price, bnr he admitted that the Grovernment was determined that part of it should be; devoted towards the rehabilitation of farmers on uneconomic areas Now he goes further than even the Government open for consideration, was at first prepared t.o go, and proposes that part of the money should actually be devoted, to the relief of fanners suffering because of seasonal adversity, and he lakes up"" this attitude because, otherwise, his State would not share in the distribution, having no uneconomic areas at. present. problem of marginal lands is one to which tinexpensive Royal Comniission on the AVhcat. Industry drew particular attention. It pointed out that a great number of farmers were occupying unsuitable land, so that it. was impossible for them to produce wheat nt a payable price, tn this bill it is proposed to set aside £500,000 each year for five years to'deal with the problem, irrespective of where it occurs. It may not, occur in Queensland, but it certainly exists in almost every other State. Within the next five year's, £2,000.000 was to have been devoted to the removal of farmers from the marginal areas. If we accept the Senate's amendment, the effect will be that part of this amount of £500.000, which is t.o be set aside each: year, will be devoted, not to solving the problem of uneconomic areas, but to assisting; in rlie relief of distressed wheat-growers at the request, of needy State Premiers or Treasurers. The request may be made, not, necessarily because the State concerned ha.s no uneconomic areas, nis s This amount of at. present, the case in Queensland, but because the Treasurer wants the money to deal with some other problem arising out of the industry. Drought has lieen ment'oned, but that is something from which ;iny State might suffer at any t me.

162,Mr Rosevear,"Probably. Thisof pests as a reason why the fund should be raided. If we allow needy Treasurers to nibble at the fund in the way suggested, it will be dissipated in directions never intended, and the amount available for the permanent solution of the problem of uneconomic lands will be correspondingly reduced. At the end of five years, the problem will be still almost as far from solution as ever. Like the poor, it will always be with us, because, men will still be trying to grow wheat on marginal lands when they should be eliminated from the industry altogether. The method by Avhich this money is to be raised has beeu severely criticized, but, once it is raised, let us at least see that it is expended in a way that will make a permanent contribution to the solution, of the problems associated with the wheat industry. Even if it were found that all the uneconomic areas were in one State, I still say that all the money available should be devoted to the solution of the problem in that State. This is a national matter, and I cannot understand members of this national Parliament arguing that, just because their State does not happen to be affected, it should make no contribution towards the solution of the problem in other States. I intend to vote against the amendment because it would, if agreed to, defeat one of the main purposes of the bill. The only difference between the Senate's amendment and the latest suggestion by the Minister for Commerce( Sir Earle Page) is that in the Senate's amendment no limit is placed on the amount of money which may be devoted to the relief of distress,, while if the latest suggestion of the Minister were adopted the amount wo.uld .be limited to £166,000. I hope that the committee will accept neither the amendment made by the Senate nor the suggested modification of it, and that it will insist that the whole of the amount of £500,000 will be expended each year on providing a permanent solution of the problem of marginal lands. committee must decide whether all the money available is to be devoted towards finding a permanent solution of the problem of marginal lands, or whether some of it is to be devoted towards furnishing temporary relief. If it decides upon the former alternative, an amount of £2,000,000 will be expended during the next four years on the rehabilitation of farmers at present occupying marginal areas, and in this way something will be accomplished that will give permanent relief, not only to the States in which the marginal areas are situated, but also to the other States. The marginal areas, though unsuitable for wheat-growing in general, do in fact, because of their extent, produce a considerable quantity of wheat. If those areas were allowed to go out of production the growers in the other and better areas would benefit. What the committee has to decide is whether it will give permanent relief to the wheat industry or temporary relief to meet seasonal distress. In parts of Queensland and northern New South Wales there are areas under wheat cultivation which have such abnormal seasonal changes that sometimes they could be described as marginal areas, whereas in other times, such as this season, they produce prolific crops. Even those areas from which we should like to evacuate the farmers have occasional good seasons. error to suppose that the wheat problem is going to be settled once and for all by expending £500,000 a year to remove farmers from doubtful areas. Somewhere or other in Australia, there is a drought or some other disability every year. If the Darling Downs should ever experience a drought application would be made for relief and, if this bill was so drafted as to preclude that relief from being granted from the revenue which is to be derived from this tax, there would have to be a further call on public funds. Those who consider that the wheat industry has enough or too much now should welcome any plan whicli would avoid that happening. That disposes of the arguments against the Senate's amendment. The Minister for Commerce( Sir Earle Page) has suggested that one-third of the £500,000 could be devoted to alleviation of distress and two-thirds to the evacuation of doubtful areas. There may be some years in which the seasonal conditions will keep so good that there will be no distress of the kind contemplated in the Senate's amendment, whereas the disstress may be so widespread in another",38,Iwcpu The Dominion Government And The Pro

166,Mr Archie Cameron (Barker,"the Government feels that the law relating to estates should not be permitted to operate in favour of some one more closely related who is of substantial means, but who, by reason of distance of residence or complete indifference, has never interested himself in the pensioner's welfare during bis lifetime, to the disadvantage of a deserving and perhaps indigent relative, who has for many years taken an active interest in the welfare of the pensioner. If the law as at present enacted-and of this, as I liave said, there is some doubt-prevent s the commission from continuing an allowance to an indigent deserving relative after the death of the pensioner, the Government, feels that the position should be clarified. Shortly put, the bill gives to the Repatriation Commission power to retain, expend and invest the pensions payable to all such unmarried pensioners, and to such married pensioners, in those cases in which the pension payable to the wife has been cancelled under section 37 of the act. It gives t.o the commission power t.o expend such moneys towards providing clothing and comforts for the pensioner, towards the payment of allowances to any member of the pensioner's family in necessitous, circumstances, and towards the cost of maintenance of the member whilst, an inmate of an institution. This is in accordance with the present practice, and it will be seen that the amount to be applied to cost, of maintenance cannot, exceed one-half of the total pension. PerhapsI should refer very shortly to this aspect. All that the bill proposes in this respect is tbe making of a book entry, which w ill have no effect on the war pension vote, but will relieve temporarily the vote of maintenance of de pn r tn len ta 1 insti tn tions. Upon the recovery of the pensioner, the comniission will bo required to render to him an account and to refund to him all moneys retained by it, less the amount expended on comforts or other benefits for the pensioner or by way of allowances to his parents or other relatives. refund will include the amount applied to cost of maintenance. the death of the pensioner, the whole amount, retained, including the amount applied to the cost, of his maii'ire-nance \l r.

170,Mr Frost ( F R A N K L I N) [3.38],"It«koD to Tasmania an'l .set. up in the Hiion Valley. .Experts were brought io Tasmania, and considerable experimenting in the manufacture of paper from local hardwoods was carried out. Until that time, experts throughout the world had held that good newsprint could not be made from hardwoods. The company which conducted its experiments in the lluou Valley has proved otherwise. It has demonstrated that paper superior to that made from softwoods can be manufactured from Australian hardwoods. All difficulties with regard to such matters as texture and colouring having been overcome, the company sought sufficient capital to commence operations on a commercial scale. About that, time, unfortunately, Australia was entering the depression years, and the necessary finance was not available. Some .wars later the company which is now ?ceking a bounty, forwarded more than -2,000 tons of hardwood logs t.o Canada where experiments in the manufacture of newsprint were conducted. was found to be quite suitable, and the company approached the State Government with u view to securing a large area nf forest land. This company has never Imforc asked for assistance from any government. If has been conducting all its experiments at its own expense. The situation is ideal, there being ample supplies of timber and water power available. As tbe natural timber is cut out, the ro-growth will be sufficient to meet the requirements of the industry. ?o that Australia will he independent of outside suppliers of newsprint. The company is asking that bounty be-paid during the first, few years of its operations in order that it may establish production on a stable basis, and in order that its existence may not be endangered by powerful overseas companies which could flood the Australian market, and so make local manufacture unprofitable. The -itc which the company has. secured in the TVrwrnt Valley on the Derwent. Rivr-r i< one of thii best natural industrial sites in Australia. The hardwood forests are within 40 miles, and the State railways will derive considerable benefit from the establishment of the. industry by way of freights. Electricity will be supplied at cheap rates by the State Government. When the. first unit is installed, the company expects to produce. 27,000 tons oi paper yearly, rising to .100,000 tons ti year, when more units have been installed. The amount which will be expended on the establishment, of this industry will be between £3,000,000 and £4,000,000, most of which will be expended on machinery and labour. In other parts of the world it is practically impossible at the present time to make firm contracts for the supply of newsprint, or any paper over an extended period. Last year the cost of applewrapping paper-a n item of some importance to apple-growers in Tasmania-wa s increased by more than '100 per cent.., the reason given being a world scarcity of papci. It was intimated that there would probably be a further increase later. I understand that the situation is a little bit easier this year, hut there is no guarantee that, the price for this class of paper as well as others will not be increased considerably in the future. The wood The same position exists with regard to newsprint. This new industry is being started because those who are sponsoring it, believe that in a few years it, will be practically impossible to obtain from overseas adequate supplies at reasonable prices to meet the requirements of Australia. We import about 150,000 tons of newsprint yearly. As the company will produce only 27,000 tons per annum for the first year or two. there will be an opportunity for other companies to enter the field of production and cater for Australia's requirements. I understand that a Victoman company has made, or is making, preliminary arrangements to this end. There is plenty of scope for two companies to operate. I am glad to say that at Burnie a company recently began to manufacture paper of finer quality. A t "" one time, it was said that our hardwoods were useless for the manufacture of the finer classes of paper, but the experiments at Ivermandie, supervised by Mr. Avery, have entirely disproved that contention. As a matter of fact, it has been shown that because of the fibres of our hardwoods, it is possible to make stronger and better paper from them than front softwoods. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) said last night that it was not yet certain that the newsprint manufacturing industry would be successfully established, but 1 have been informed that it is now beyond the experimental stage. 1 am sure the honourable member hopes that it will be successful. This industry will be of great benefit to Tasmania. The new company expects at the commencement of its operations to use electricity equivalent to 12,000 horsepower per annum. When the works are in full production, the volume of current consumed will he the equivalenf of 45,000 horse-power per annum. It is anticipated that between 10,000,000 and 12,000,000 gallons of water a day will he required. The company intends employing 260 men in the factory and in the bush at the commencement of its operations. This is irrespective of roadmakers, bush track-cutters, and men engaged in other work of a more or less temporary character. A good deal of employment will also be given to men engaged in the building industry. The forest which will be drawn upon is from 30 to 40 miles from the factory site. It is proyided, in the agreement, that the company will maintain the forests in good order. The timber will be cut out in 40 years, but by that time the first replantings will again be available for cutting and so there will be a perpetual use of country which, under other circumstances, might become useless. It is well-known that when saw-mills are put into a forest, only about 45 per cent, of the timber cut is put on to the market. The remaining 55 per cent, is wasted. All timber of marketable quality cut by this company will be sold as timber. Only what would otherwise be rubbish will be pulped. Seeing that in the past many forest areas in Tasmania and elsewhere have been utterly destroyed or mutilated beyond redemption, it will be a great thing for this company to operate along the lines I have suggested. The activities of the company will be well controlled in accordance with the Forestry Act of Tasmania. The denuding of our forest areas, which has occurred in the past, will not be permitted in connection with this industry. Australia has hitherto relied to a very so much upon British ships as formerly large degree on supplies of both timber to bring newsprint to this country, Mr Front. and paper from overseas. Last year, the supply of timber was sometimes greater than the demand. This was due to the war in the East and the consequent diverting of timber boats to Australia. I have no doubt that after the war is ended, tbe price of timber in Australia will rise, and we shall once again experience the shortages that have been known from time to time in the past. Every country of the. world is to-day drawing too heavily on its forests. While I was abroad, I visited many forest areas. I was informed that the forests of Russia were inexhaustible, but I ascertained that the Government of that country had to withdraw many workers from forest areas because of the fear of depleting supplies. So even the forests of Russia are not inexhaustible. The forest lands of America are also being denuded. In the areas that have been replanted, pests have been experienced which have rendered useless a good deal of the timber that has been grown. There is every reason, therefore, why we should do our utmost to conserve our all-too-limited supplies of timber. The right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) has, on frequent occasions, directed attention in this House to the serious effects of soil erosion. If Ave can conserve ourforests and replant areas as the timber is taken from them, we shall counteract, to some degree at least, the occurrence of soil erosion. We ought to do our best to keep some forest areas in reserve. Fifty years ago in Tasmania there were very few saw-mills. Most of the timber was won by pit-saw methods, which had tbe effect of mutilating many thousands of acres of otherwise good forest country. The company that has been formed to establish the newsprint industry will avoid errors of that description. I commend the bill to the House, and trust that it will be accorded unanimous support. It is pleasing to me that the Government has seen fit to introduce this measure. The policy that is being adopted will undoubtedly be beneficial, not only to Australia, but also to Great Britain. When the industry is well established, we shall not need to rely for, in a degree at any rate, we shail become self-supporting. I am sure honourable members will desire to contribute to this desirable end. I congratulate the Government upon the introduction of this bill, which is .calculated to assist in the establishment of a new industry in Australia, and to encourage the expansion of certain enterprises already operating here. Any measure which has the result of rendering Australia more self-contained, and thereto the users of newsprinting paper, such fore less dependent on overseas countries* as surface finish, packing, diameter of is worthy of support. The. report of the Tariff Board on this industry deserves the careful consideration of every honourable member. In it will be found substantial reasons for supporting this bill. I am glad that the industry is to be established in Tasmania, which has great natural resources for tbe purpose. particular, it bas an abundance of hydroelectric power and large supplies of suitis a. very bad state of affairs can scarcely able raw material. I wish to refer to one or two safeguards scheme for the control of this important that may be necessary in the interests of those who will be associated with this industry. The Tariff Board has made some remarks on certain aspects of this subject on which I shall, touch. It should be borne in mind that we shall probably never be able to provide more than about half of our total requirements of newsprint, and so will always have to draw upon outside sources of supply. The Tariff Board in framing its schedule based the landed price on charges of cost insurance, freight, exchange, and } primage, but omitted wharfage, harbour dues, stacking charges and cartage. The omission of these costs makes a very important difference. Had they been included there would be less objection to the scheme, but if they are to be ignored the figure of £15 should be reduced to £14 at least. On page 12 of the Tariff Board's report reference is made to the refusal of the. opponents to the manufacturing project to enter into a newsprint buying pool with the promoters of the Tasmanian scheme. There were several reasons for this refusal. First, it was known that the newsprint buying pool was organized primarily to assist the Tasmanian scheme, the original idea being to levy a charge of 10s. a ton on all paper obtained in this way, thu amount so levied to go in aid of the Tasmanian scheme. This would have imposed a great tax on the independent newspapers, particularly the country newspapers of Queensland. Secondly, its opponents declined to enter into the scheme because they would have lost all control over the selection of the paper and over export arrangements. There aiv numerous matters in connection with export control that are vitally important reels, &c. It was, therefore, felt that the newsprint buying pool would place far too much power in the hands of the big newspaper group in Australia. Thirdly, the contract referred to would strengthen the hands of the paper cartel and make it impossible for newsprinting paper to In be obtained in Australia on an annual basis at current market price. That thi* be denied. It indicates the strong bid made by the promoters of the Tasmanian raw material of the newspaper industry. I am reliably informed that the landed cost of newsprint paper in 1939 will undoubtedly be higher than it is to-day, simply because of the existence of this gigantic contract with the Canadian paper cartel. Paper costs in Australia will be increased. Australia is now a closed market for paper. To-day newspaper proprietors cannot make contracts for a single year ahead; they must either contract for a period of seven years or pay through the nose. Nowhere else in the world do such stranglehold buying conditions obtain. This bad state of affairs is due entirely to the remarkable contract made between the Australian group and the Canadian combine. Unfortunately the British mills have adopted the same bad practice. The Tariff Board in its report referred to the general tariff rate on newsprinting paper from countries other than Great Britain and Canada, and recommended that the duty be reduced from £4 to £2 a ton. I submit that the interests of the independent newspapers and the struggling country newspapers not in this scheme should be safeguarded by this Government. I particularly request the Minister",41,Perkins

173,Motion (By Mr Perkin S) Proposed,"rarely speak on the motion for the ador journment of the House, but on this question is concerned, it seems to me that there occasion I direct the attention of the Government to a matter of considerable imthem into the torture chamber and the man portance. To-day 1 received a letter from although a constituent, in which he statesI. am writing in tlie hope Unit you may be able to do something to relieve the ever-growing shortages of domestic help and agricultural labour, (specially in connection with dairying. It is now practically impossible to get people to undertake dairying ajid many are being forced out of it . Somerset recently interviewed six boys who were looking for a job, and not one would take on milking, with every convenience, good wages and quarters. It is not now a question of wages or conditions, but simply that the Australian will not take on this work. Somerset, who handles about 100 cows, will probably have to go out of it . milking machines? milking almost 100 cows with machines, but. 1 experienced the same difficulty as this dairyman, although my employees bad food similar to my own, and lived and slept under my own roof. My correspondent goes on to sayThe same thing applies to other forms of farm work, ami especially to domestic labour, e\en where the conditions are ideal. I believe that they are paying /Jos. a week in T'erth now for girls that arc not worth 15s. Tn town this is ttu inconvenience, but in the country a real disa-ster, since you cannot go out for a meal, and have fewer conveniences and cannot get any one in to do scrubbing and washing. When we are without a mnid it costs I os. a week to send washing down to Bunbury for three people. If this state of affairs is allowed to continue it will seriously affect the productive capacity of the Commonwealth. The immediate result is that all the young people are going olf'the land. In this district the average age of the farmers is nearly 50 and there are practically no young ones coming on. A t tbe moment, it would be possible to get an unlimited number of refugees who would do farm and domestic work. They would not be displacing any labour, but would increase employment for everybody by enabling properties to be worked and developed properly. If Australians have decided that they will only take the white collar jobs, wo must get others who will do the work. There can be no doubt that the best form of defence is increased population. I do not think that there is much risk of the development of minorities. We have thousands of Italians in this part of the State. All seem to hate Mussolini and you will not liud a single child that can speak Italian. Iu one school here whore there are only two children who are not understand Italian. They all want to be thought Australians. As far as the refugee no distinction between tlie man who pushes who says, as we do, "" Now that you are in. we have plenty of room and unlimited jobs for you, will not let you out."" . . . I enclose a cutting from the Went Australian dealing with the domestic labour position. ' f t reads equally true if you substitute 'farm labour"". If you are able to do anything to assist the country in this direction, you will earn the gratitude of everybody. I shall (piote a few paragraphs from an article published in the West Australian of the 26th November last. It begins as follows:A SEIiroUS IfHOWJffM. Many .Jobs: .Vo Applicants. he not. use A grave shortage of domestic help is re|>orted in tlie metropolitan area. Bad as Uie position has been in the past employment brokers declare that it has never been as bad as at present. Girls will not take domestic work in private homes and they are literally profited into this service only as a bwt resort. Employment brokers state that tbey have numbers of girls available for work, but they want specific' jobs with domestic service definitely excluded. The proprietor of one employment agency said that 50 girls could be placed a* maids and cooks-general in private homes if they were available. There were about sixteen agencies in Perth and it was not an exaggeration to say that if 500 trained girls could be secured for domestic work they could all be placed in employment almost immediately. Another employment broker said that a serious position had arisen. Prospective employers were desperate. Their appeals for h'.'lp were an embarrassment to registry office proprietors who could do little or nothing for them. Girls applying for posts after making the request for a job, said: "" But don't give me housework. I won't take it on any more.""

The article concludesIt was learned that a shortage of domestic workers is not peculiar to Perth. Similar shortages are apparent in Melbourne and Sydney. Fifty girls recently taken to Sydney by .the Salvation Army were engaged by employers as soon as the ship berthed at the wharf. The officer in charge declared that he could have placed 200 girls in employment immediately if ho had had them available. One of the most important problems that this country has to face is that of increasing its population. As the writer points out, the local labour market would be improved rather than injured, by the entry of the right kind of immigrant. I know the writer of this letter, and the circumstances under which he works. He is an orchardist and a dairyman. myself ran a dairy of over 100 cows until two years ago, and I know the. drudgery that is associated with the work. I had milking machines and concrete yards, &c, but I could not prevent wet weather, slush, cold mornings, and early rising. The3e things are inherent in dairy farming, but the industry itself is very necessary. says, if our own people will not do the work, we must get some one else to do it. The country is not yet sufficiently populated, and refugees and white aliens would think it heavenly to be allowed to 'do the work offering in Australia. If our own girls are doing the work that was formerly done by men, and have no taste for domestic work, so that householders cannot get help, is it unreasonable to admit immigrants? There is another phase to this problem. People will not go in for large families if they are unable to obtain maids to assist them in their housework. We know that house owners are in the habit of asking prospective tenants if they have any children, and maids are no less particular. They also want to know if there are any babies to look after. people are being forced into flats where tbey can more conveniently do the little work that has to be done, but this is detrimental to the country's welfare. Alter all, home life is the best for our people. One doctor remarked recently that he did not know what would happen to the stomachs of the people, who were going in more and more for scrap meals, because no one was being trained to prepare food properly. Housework is an honourable occupation, but our people seem reluctant to undertake it. It is not often that I take the risk of incurring unpopularity by speaking on the motion for the adjournment, but I consider this matter to be one of major importance, and I hope that the Minister for the Interior( Mr McEwen) will give to it his close attention. I do not oppose the suggestion that 15,000 Jewish refugees should be admitted to this country during the next three years, but we should be able to obtain as well British migrants, and migrants from other white countries. I ber does not want them to come here to milk cows, does he? necessary. The wives of our own farmers are doing it now, and .they are not inferior to Jewesses. Interior) [4.25] I listened with interest to the remarks of the honourable member As this writer for Forrest( Mr Prowse). This is a subject that bas given me some concern in dealing with immigration. I know from my own experience, and from reports that have come before me, of the shortage of both domestic workers for household duties, and of agricultural workers. Particular regard is paid to this state of affairs in the Government's migration polisy, in respect of both assisted British migration and alien migration. I assure the honourable member that the Government's migration policy will tend towards the correction of the state of affairs of which he has complained. For instance, of 4,500 nominations received since the re-introduction of assisted British migration last February, by far the greatest proportion are of young men and women who will engage Thus, in agricultural occupations or domestic service, or of boys and girls who will be trained for those occupations.

183,Mr Barnard (Bass) [4.30],"Lastconclude that the Government is satisfied that these slums, or almost slums, are to he allowed to remain. Yesterday a report of the Intel-national Committee on German and Austrian refugees, and a report of the Australian delegation to that gathering were tabled in the House. suite ment was made by the Minister for ject, of migration. Opposition ( Mr Curtin) spoke, and although I rose to speak, I was not afforded an opportunity to clo so. As one who is very interested in this problem, 1 now ask the indulgence of the House while I make n few observations on it . Tho statement of policy by the Minister for the Interior on the. matter of German and Austrian refugees is welcome, and is in line with recommendations I have made to the Government. As Australian delegate, to tbe International Conference at Evian in July last, called at the invitation, of President. Roosevelt, I was impressed by the desire for cooperation in an endeavour to solve this tragic problem. was not then so acute, there was a general desire for co-opera-rsion among tbe representatives of ihe 32 nations present, and the conference unanimously resolved to continue and develop the work of the Inter-Governmentiil Committee. As a result a Bureau of the Committee was formed, which met later in London, and thereby the machinery was set up to transform a haphazard flight of destitute refugees into a more orderly exodus. This body has since asked the participating countries to indicate the numbers they are prepared to receive. The ministerial announcement that 15,000 will be admitted to Australia over a period of three years is Australia's reply, which is a slight increase on previous admissions, the Commonwealth having pursued a policy as liberal as that of any other country. If honourable members will road the proceedings of the Inter-Governmental Committee, and the report of the Australian delegation, they will see that representatives offered opportunity for experienced agriculturalists, while limited scope for professional men and trained workers was proffered in others. There was, however, general disapproval of any large-scale scheme of migration as being calculated to arouse racial feeling. A process of infiltration was considered more likely to enable the refugees to be easily assimilated into the national l if e of the couutry Shortly afterwards, a to which they migrated; this is the policy that the Government is continuing. As chairman of the committee set up The. Lender of the at. Evian to hear the case from the various Aryan, non-Aryan and Jewish organizations-representative s of about 40 of them attended at Evian, where they told the story of their persecutionI was struck by the necessity for action, and concluded my report to the main conference, as follows :The moving stories told disclose » great human tragedy which calls for early amelioration and challenges the conference to co-operative action to that end. The Minister said that preference would be given in the selection of refugees to artisans and industrialists who could give some help to Australia. That is in line with what I said Though' persecution at Evian. That policy was adopted long ago by Great Britain, and I am glad that it is to be the policy of Australia. Centuries ago England gave sanctuary to persecuted Flemish and French refugees, and thereby gained many new industries, including weaving. So to-day, by wise selection, particularly among Austrians, can Australia gain too. A t the Evian conference not all the representatives were Jewish. There were representatives of the Quakers and other peace-loving organizations, and many non-Aryan Christians, the part-Jewish types, aud others. I know from the evidence given there-lionorabl e gentlemen can read it in the supplements to the concise report of the Inter-Governmental Committeethat there is a great scope for establishing new industries in Australia by the immigration of skilled artisans, of types that we have never had before. They would do a great good to the Commonwealth. Every one welcomes the unhesitating acceptance by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin), for the Labour of certain countries party, of the principle of the help that Australia is giving to these refugees iu their time of trouble. 1 hope that the",48,Domestic Sjvuvice

185,The Interior ( Mr Mcewen) On The Sub,"Opposition will also adopt a liberal outlook in respect of the admission to Australia of people of our own race. Ours is 11 predominantly British community, and the Government must view with nlarm the excess of departures over arrivals of persons of British stock. Having in some measure overhauled the migralion organization at Australia House the Government has sent n new officer there-it should make a determined effort to clear up the misunderstandings that prevail in England regarding Australia's migration policy, so that, not only shall we receive those refugees to whom we extend sympathy in their trouble, but also our own kith and k in , in order to supply the rnu in man power needed by the nation. I counsel this advisedly, because I know from conversations that I had in various parts of England and Europe recently, that there is a definite misunderstanding of the Australian policy. I received a deputation from twenty British organizations, arranged by the Royal Empire Society. There was scarcely a person ut that deputation who did not believe that Australia did not want British .migrants. The misunderstanding arose from the fact that in the depression assisted migration was discontinued. 1 do not hlaone any one for that, because 1 think that any government would have taken similar action. But the belief persists in many quarters that Australia does not want British stock, and i lie Government should dispel it by proper publicity. better than that. a. splendid ambassador for Australia. So are all others who have been here. Whenever Empire Parliamentary Association delegates visit Australia, the representatives go back to GreH't Britain as champions of this country. The trades unions could help in dispelling the illusion that Britishers are not wanted here. T have been told by men in England that there is unwillingness among British people to come to Australia, because those who do come here have the greatest difficulty in obtaining admission to trade unions;-in fact, that some unions have prohibited their admission. One man who spent some time in Australia told me that ho returned to England because he could not join the union. The trade unions should throw their doors open to British workmen, i know, from my administration of the Department of Trade and Customs, that in many skilled trades there is a scarcity of artisans iu Australia. There is definitely a shortage of skilled men in the engineering, pattern making, and like trades. The British people should be told that there is room in Australia for them and their families. We must encourage them to come hero so that we shall maintain the predominance of Britons in our population and have the right kind of man-power to ensure our safety and progress. | 4.46]. I should like the Minister for Defence( Mr Street) to place before the a matter affecting clerical employment in the Australian Capital Territory. Temporary assistants and clerks employed in various Commonwealth departments in Canberra work under the Commonwealth Public Service award, which .prescribes payment much less than the basic wage, unless tbey have qualified to receive more, because although that award providos for eighteen days' annual leave, these men never qualify for annual leave owing to the fact that they are put off after three months' service. Some of them will be dismissed before Christmas. I ask that, when their employment is terminated, they shall receive pay in lieu of holidays on a basis of one ancl a half Mr Crutchley knew days' pay for each month of service. Another matter which I bring forward Yes , Mr Crutchley is would come under the control of Mr. Speaker, and I ask the Deputy Speaker( Mr Prowse) to place it before him. It concerns the treatment of temporary employees at Parliament House. The employment of many of them terminates when Parliament rises. I suggest that tbey be given the same consideration as I have suggested should be, given to temporary assistants and clerks in the Public Service. They should be compensated for the loss of holidays. T am sorry that the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) has left the chamber, because I desire to reply to some aspects of his speech. The honourable member deplored the excess of",49,Domestic Sjvuvice

188,Mr Drakeford (Maribyrnong),,50,Domestic Sjvuvice
189,Minister For The Interior ( Mr Mcewen),"departures over arrivals of British stock. 1 am sure that that is due, in the majority of cases, to the fact that conditions are more attractive in Great Britain than in Australia. The honourable gentleman also appealed to the trade unions to open their doors to British migrants. I do not know of any trade union which has closed its membership books, except for the reason that it has dozens of men on its books who cannot find employment in the calling in which the union operates. When we consider the fact that there are 160,000 unemployed in this country, it is not surprising that British people should return to Great Britain. If engineers, carpenters and trade unionists of various kinds, have left Australia to go back to England, it is because the conditions there attract them. According to a newspaper account, 247 men of those classifications, most of them competent to do the work required in this country, left Australia early this year. I agree with the honourable member that it is necessary to increase the man-power of this country, but I must tell him that he is entirely misinformed when he suggests that one reason for the departure of British people is because they cannot become members of the union. Of course there are some unions which have members enormously in excess of the demand for their services. I instance the Waterside Workers Federation. I am informed that it has between 3,000 and 4,000 men on-its books in one city, but rarely are more than 2,000 men employed on the waterfront. Work cannot be found for more. In my opinion the excess of departures over arrivals of British stock is due to the fact that this Government and governments of a similar political hue have brought about a set of affairs in this country which makes it no longer attractive to skilled workers. I hope that what has been said will influence the demands justice? Government in the direction of malting conditions here more attractive than they are. I trust that the representations that I honourable member's questions are have made on behalf of the temporary assistants in the Public Service and Parliament House will have the sympathetic attention of the Minister for the Interior in June and August of this year. Mr Drakeford. and Mr Speaker respectively and that the complaint will not have to be repeated next year. for Defence) [4.50] I shall bring before the appropriate Ministers the matters raised by those honourable members who have spoken, and replies will be furnished to them in due course.

A few days prior to the hearing of the cfiargcs referred to in 2. MrH . Hickey discussed with the Inspector of Police at Darwin the question of a valueless cheque lie had received from Cox for £7 for goods supplied. On being informed that Cox was facing two charges for similar offences, and that the sentences of any further charge could not be made cumulative, Mr Hickey stated that lie did not wish to proceed with the complaint of passing a valueless cheque, but would recover Oho goods. On the l f it h March, 1938, Mr Hickey again saw the police, and suggested that action .be taken against Cox through the police court. As the time limit of six months lixed by section 52 of the Justices Ordinance 1928 of the Northern Territory had then expired, Mr Hickey was advised that the only course open to him was to take civil action for the value of the goods supplied. 4.

The BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited states that it has not on any occasion AND FORMATION OF DEPARTMENT . declined to supply pig iron to British interests. 3. Tho exportation of iron ore from Australia to all countries is already prohibited. The Government has decided that the exportation of pig iron w i ll be permitted to be continued for the time being. The volume of exports is comparatively small viewed in relation to .the quantity of iron ore which would have been exported had not restrictive action been taken. Moreover, the Government 1ms been advised that the present exports of pig iron are not prejudicially affecting the ability of industry to meet Australia's requirements nf iron and steel products. The whole position is, however, being kept constantly under Teview, and, if it appears at any time that the exportation of pig iron is likely to increase to such an extent as detrimentally to affect Australian industry and development, the question of the restriction of exports w ill receive immediate consideration.",53,Assistance For Products
