In view of the fact that the majority of officers benefit materially by the classification, and that increased salaries to tlie extent of £20,000 per annum w ill accrue to officer's, there should be no cause for dissatisfaction. 2.

Any sensible business man would conduct his business in that way. A f t e r the money borrowed for the purposes of the bank was repaid, half of the profits could go towards reducing the national debt. But no one w ill contend that we are contributing towards the success of the bank by hampering it in this way. I should be sorry for the men who had to administer the bank in such circumstances. If we desire to develop the Commonwealth Bank on purely national lines, and to make it a successful institution, we must proceed on sound principles, and give it an opportunity to make good. clause does not provide that opportunity. I am only asking that the committee should consider the position carefully. I , therefore, move the following amendment :That beforo the word "" One-half,"" paragraph (6), line 6, the following words be inserted "" after the amount lent by the Commonwealth has been refunded."" The proposed new section would then read30. (1) The net profits of the bank in each half-year shall he dealt with as follows:[a) One-half shall be placed to the credit of a fund to he called the Bank Beserve Fund; and \b) After the amount lent by the Commonwealth has been refunded, one-half sliall be paid into the National Debt Sinking Fund as soon as practicable after the preparation of each balance-sheet. (2) The Bank Reserve Fund shall be available for the payment of any liabilities of the bank. That is a f a i r and reasonable amendment, which the Treasurer should accept. I bring it forward w i th no other purpose than to improve the bill. I desire that the Commonwealth Bank shall be the first discharge its liabilities financial bulwark of Australia; but this Any clause places a great handicap on the bank a handicap which I think should be removed. We have already decided in favour Provision was made in the of the appointment of eight directors. Let us give them a f a i r chance to make a success of their undertaking. That canAt not be done if provisions such as those contained in this clause are permitted to remain. It is idle for honourable members to say that this capital may not be required. If it is not required, so much the better; but I am of the opinion that it w ill be necessary. If the bank applies to the Treasurer for £10,000,000, that sum w ill be advanced, and the bank will have to pay 5 per cent., or more, interest on it . If it subsequently makes £500,000 in profits, £250,000 should go to the reserve fund , and the remaining £250,000 should be applied to a reduction cf the debt to the Treasurer. If that course were adopted, the bank, in course of time, would clear off the debt. In its present for m , the b ill requires the bank to carry the "" poultice "" for all time. No doubt, the board of directors w ill be guided largely in their administration by the debate in this chamber. All I ask is This that any money borrowed to provide the bank with capital shall be repaid before any payment into the national debt sinking fund is made. I hope that the Treasurer w ill accept my, amendment, and that honourable members generally w ill at least give it due consideration. If they do so, they must realize that it is necessary. surer) [11.30] -Before I deal with the arguments advanced by the Leader of the Opposition in support of his amendment, I wish to indicate why the Government have had the bill amended in order to increase the capital of the bank from £10,000,000 to £20,000,000. The provision of £10,000,000 was obviously a clerical error, as could be seen by any one who had read my speech, in which I",15,Commonwealth Ba Nk Bill

The CHAIEMAN "" (Hon. F. W .

Leader of the Opposition has submitted his amendment because a certain confusion of thought exists in regard to the position of the Commonwealth Bank. I h the ultimate analysis the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth Bank are practically one and the same. The original capital of the bank was the credit of the Commonwealth, upon which the bank was built up. On that basis it has made profits which, it is using as capital. proposal is to increase thei beneficent work of the bank by increasing thatcapital. to be raised by the Commonwealth and lent to the bank, will be practically in the same position as the preference capital raised by a private institution, and the bank will pay upon this preferenoe capital, just as a private institution would, the effective rate of interest at which the money is borrowed. No one would suggest that as soon as profits are earned tbey should be employed to return preference capital to those who have provided it . Commonwealth Bank to extend its activities, and spread its influence. In the case of a private institution individual members of the public are asked to take up preference shares, but in the case of the Commonwealth Bank the same peoplewill be asked to subscribe to a loan raisedby the Commonwealth, and the money soraised will form capital for the Commonwealth Bank. sition the Government are doing wrong when they seek to carry into effect what I rise to a point of the Labour party has previously provided The amendment increasing the for. party made urovision in the original act for the raising of additional capital by the issue of debentures by the bank. We propose to provide a definite preference capital for the bank, thus enabling it , w it h its reserve, and without resort to the issue of debentures to have a capital of £10,000,000, which w ill be more than that of any other Australian bank. It w ill thus be put in a dominant position, and be given considerable prestige. The money borrowed by the Commonwealtli and lent to the bank w ill u l t i mately be repaid by means of a sinking f u n d in the same way as other Commonwealth loans. The bank w ill get its preference capital on the best possible The terms on which the Commonwealth can borrow the money, aud the amount will ultimately be repaid through the sinking f u n d . The Leader of the Opposition is endeavouring to dissociate the Commonwealth and the bank, but they are part and parcel of the same big national entity, and cannot be dissociated. In the last analysis, the credit of the Commonwealth stands behind the bank, and,, in addition, the Government are suggestThe Government's ing a method by which the bank can bematerially assisted. I cannot understand the suggestion to pay back the capital of The £6,000,000 , which is the bank, seeing that it w ill be needed iir. its operations. The bank will probably need more money. The honourable member has suggested that if the bank borrows £16,000,000 it w ill have to pay £800,000 in interest each year; but if it needs the money for the expansion of its business, that money w ill earn more than it will cost the bank in interest.

It is wrong to say that it is not good business for any concern to liquidate a debt borrowed at a high rate of interest, or that a national bank which borrows money at a high rate of interest should extort an undue rate of interest from its customers in order that it may earn 2 per cent, over and above the amount at which it has borrowed. To say that it is not good business for the bank to liquidate its own debt before applying its profits to the reduction of the national debt is to talk nonsense. Whoever makes such a statement does not know what good business is. The Treasurer says that it does not matter whether the bank liquidates its own debt or not, so long as it makes 1 per cent, or 2 per cent, profit on its borrowed money. bank in the position of having to demand an extortionate rate of interest from those who borrow from it , in order to ensure that it w ill be able to meet its own liabilities on its borrowed capital. An other aspect of the subject demands earnest attention.

I do not blame the Chairmanf o r submitting the matter as he did, for he acted in accordance with the Standing Orders; but One can see in this I say that honourable members have good reason to be suspicious of the motives which prompted the Treasurer to submit it as he did.

In 1910, a substantial majority of the electors endorsed the Labour party's policy, and every alteration of the original act involving a serious change in the functions of the bank means a breach of f a i th with the people. -The amendment before the committee is not unexpected, since the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) forecast it in his second-reading speech. listened with interest to the debate, and particularly to the remarks of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West). One aspect of the discussion is rather amusing to those who realize to what au absolute farce the proceedings of this Chamber can, without committing a breach of the Standing Orders, be brought. In speaking to people who have not the privilege of knowing how debates can be carried on in parliament, I have said that if all honourable members f u l l y exercised their privileges under the Standing Orders, no business whatever would be transacted. Honourable members are now considering the third amendment that has been moved. The Leader of the Opposition, and those of his supporters who followed h i m, contended that the Government have not allowed sufficient time to discuss the measure, although when the Leader of the Opposition first spoke, he said that the bill could, without fail, be put through before the closing time this afternoon without the necessity for the application of the closure. The guillotine has been applied strictly in accordance with the Standing Orders, and yet the Opposition has discussed the bill in such a way as to deprive the debate of interest to honourable members. there was an amendment proposed in the definition clause, and the first two hours were occupied in discussing^that clause. MrA . GREEN -The honourable member himself is now wasting time. Hansard should show how members of the Opposition have deliberately blocked progress. I , for one, strongly protest against the way in which honourable members opposite, although strictly in accordance with the Standing Orders, are blocking discussion on a very important measure. As the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West) said a few moments ago, when the bill reaches another place proper consideration w ill no doubt be given to the amendments-a n ample justification of the bi-cameral System of government.

If honourable members opposite were seized of their responsibilities, they would give every assistance to the Government to have the measure f u l l y discussed with a view to improving it . The first two amendments submitted, however, were identical. When the Leader of the Opposition 'moved on the definition clause an amendment that the directorate be altered, and when he failed, as he was obviously destined to do, instead of accepting his defeat, he went on to the next clause, which dealt with the same subject, and moved a. similar amendment. The result was that the time of the committee was occupied in debating over again the question which had already been decided by a considerable majority. The Leader of the Opposition remarked that he did not wish to go over the same ground again, yet he deliberately did so. One member after another made what were, in effect, second-reading speeches. is doing that now.

I regret that, as the result of action taken by honourable members opposite, the time available for the discussion of the various clauses in this bill is so limited.

Possiblyi t was U n l i k e some honan unfortunate remark for the Leader of the Opposition to make, but the statement nevertheless is on record that he admitted that the time which the Government proposed to allow for the debate on tliis bill was ample. And then he deliberately set out to prevent discussion. The guillotine is nothing new. It has been in oj>eration in the British Parliament for a great many years, and experience has shown that if the time allowed be used properly ample opportunity is given to members on both sides to discuss measures in a reasonable way. But when the occasion is abused, as it has been in connection with this measure, the guillotine becomes the best instrument I know of to enable there is anything that this the Government to get its bills through without amendment.

The amendment provides complete machinery for dealing with such eases. I have been informed that strong prejudice has in the past been exhibited by the management of the bank against officers who have identified themselves with any association or union. The best interests of the institution are not thereby promoted, nor are the staff made satisfied and contented. As the right of appeal is allowed to officers in the various divisions in the Publio Service, it is only fair to give the officers of the bank the same right, so that they may feel that a f u l l measure of redress is secured to them by a tribunal free from prejudice and bias, which will give judgment upon the merits of their cases. surer) [2.37.] -The Government appreciates the position in which the bank's officers are placed, and recognizes that there is a necessity to provide some means for insuring that the men shall have an absolutely fair run. But I venture to suggest that the machinery proposed by the honourable member is so cumbersome that it would practically hamstring the board in its management of the bank's affairs. The Government offers an alternative amendment. A t present, I understand, the difficulty is that officers of the bank are very often unable to reach the governor of the bank. The amendment which fche Government proposes provides that where an officer of the bank, ia of any authority of the bank other than the board, he may, within the prescribed time, submit in writing an appeal to the board, stating f u l l y the action appealed against, and the grounds of the appeal. It is provided, further, that the board A t present there is no shall consider and determine any such appeal, and notify the appellant of its determination, which shall be final and conclusive. That will provide an easy passage between the employees and the board Commonwealth public servants of directors. MrE . RILEY -Hav e the employees the right under this bill to approach the There are many Arbitration Court? not denied them in any wav. which I have proposed would deal with transfers and classification. which the Government is putting forward makes provision for an appeal by any employee who considers himself aggrieved in any respect whatever. To appoint a board to deal wifch the rights of officers fco particular positions, or promotions, or their claims for transfer to any post, would practically render the board of directors helpless. Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) apparently overlooked the fact that he was addressing a body of men who know something about the Public Service and the manner in which it is controlled. No branch of the Public Service would tolerate for five minutes an appeal board consisting only of the employers. An appeal should be heard by an independent bodv. The proposal of the Treasurer would mean an appeal from Ca?sar to Cajsar. The matter can be simply handled by bringing the officers of the bank under the ""ontrol of the Public Service Board, giving them the same status as public servants, tbe same rights and privileges, and the same tenure of office. The position of tbe officers of the bank to-day is intolerable. They can be dismissed at a moment's notice.",28,Pairs

97,Mr Scullin (Yarra) [2.40],"Th eThe only change proposed is that from one-man control to control by a board. There is not the slightest change in principle. The principle underlying the constitution of a board of appeal is that it shall be independent and impartial and have represented on it the employees concerned. It is astonishing that the Go^ vernment should insult the intelligence of honourable members by circulating the amendment referred to by the Treasurer. Werei t not for the operation of the guillotine, and the fact that there are other amendments to be considered, we would be justified in holding up the clause until the Government changed its mind. These officers in the past have been tyrannically treated. because men have dared to join a union, can be placed before Parliament if the Government w ill give us an opportunity to do so. The right of access to the A r b i for preventing the expression of public tration Courts is not a protection to these men, even though they are registered in the court, because the management of the bank has been so subtle in its methods that it has taken fine care not to openly dismiss men because they have taken an active part in the affairs of the union. Men have been dismissed for fictitous reasons and have not been able to bring their cases personally the notice of the governor of the bank. A tyrant visiting Melbourne has been able to impose his sweet will upon the men, and whenever one has come between the wind and him out he has gone, although he may have rendered good service for many years. Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) wants the bank to be a success-whic h I seriously doubt, in view of the actions of the Government-the only way to achieve that object is to have a contented staff which w ill work in unison with the management and take a personal interest in the advancement of the bank. That is not the case at present. cannot help thinking that the Treasurer was ironical in the suggestion he made regarding the vexed question of control and the relationship of employer fand employee. The Public Service Arbitration Act provides a tribunal for dealing w i th public servants, and that tribunal was created as the result of longsustained agitation by the Labour party. It does not operate with entire satisfaction to the persons most concerned, but on the whole it represents a step in the right direction. The employees of the Commonwealth Bank are excluded from the operations of that tribunal, and whilst technically they are not excluded from the benefits of the general policy of conciliation and arbitration, they are really excluded by the attitude of host i l it y , at one time veiled, and more recently open, on the part of the management of the bank. Having regard to the favorable attitude of Parliament towards arbitration, this bill represents a deplorably retrogressive step, for it gives no protection whatever to tlie employees Proved cases of victimization, of the bank as regards recourse to the Arbitration Court or an independent board of appeal. The Government have made use of means ready to their hands indignation in this regard, but they have not ready means of preventing the growth of serious discontent in the service of the bank; and that feeling is finding expression. The present acting governor of the bank at one time gave a sort of halfhearted permission to the employees to for m an organization for registration to under the Arbitration Act, in order to get the benefit of an award; but when members of the staff went so f a r as to assure the staff generally that the acting governor was sympathetic w i th such organization, that gentleman issued a manifesto in which he declared liis hostility to If the arbitration in terms that were scarcely veiled, and hinted that he would prefer an organization of the employees on the old familiar linesa boss's organization. We have progressed much beyond that,, and if the Government desires to have a contented staff in the bank, it w ill have to give the oflicers the arbitration facilities that are available to members of the Public Service generally, and to I workers in every avocation. The Commonwealth Bank service must not continue to be the "" Cinderella "" of the industrial world. The amendment of which the Treasurer has given notice gives point to much of the criticism that has been uttered in regard to the management of the bank.

I point out to the honourable member, however, that if he studies that platform a little more closely he will notice that it suggests that the rural credit system shall be established as an integral part of the savings bank department of the bank to carry out the various functions which his motion suggests. with the definite object of making the Commonwealth Bank a central bank; all other issues have been carefully excluded. Possibly the Commonwealth Bank Act could, with advantage, be amended in other directions, but the Government has tried to keep the issue clear and free from confusion. The powers which the bill will vest in the board of control are wide enough to accomplish what the honourable member desires. therefore, unnecessary. It would be unwise at this juncture to inaugurate a system of this kind without at the same time providing the requisite machinery to carry it into effect. In connection with a system of rura l credits, we must not lose sight of the essential fact that advances in these cases are required for fairly long terms. Australia requires a system whereby the producer can receive payW ill the honourable ment for his produce as soon as it is delivered at the store, even though it is not sold for eight or ten months afterwards. A central bank needs resources Yes . That would of a very liquid nature, able to be mobilized quickly. The Government in this bill has endeavoured to provide resources for the central bank which will be essentially liquidresources capable of being availed of in the shortest time possible. That is the reason for the capital of the bank being increased from a reserve of about £4,500,000 to £20,000,000 in a l l ; firstly, by means of a loan to the bank; secondly, by retaining unimpaired its debenture power, and thirdly, additional liquid sources are provided by giving the board the power to control the note issue.

To him, apparently, a matter of such urgent importance to the whole community, as is this bill, the object of which is to provide efficient machinery to handle exchange problems, is a tremendous jest, or something that can be bandied about. The honourable member has received the assurance of the Government that the establishment of a rural credits bank is receiving consideration. He has been told that it is in the platfor m of the Country party. In the speeches he has quoted I be the savings bank, and not the general business of the Commonwealth Bank, and the reasons for not providing for it in this bill were f u l l y explained to him. In his second-reading speech he dismissed, with au airy wave of the hand, the whole question of overseas exchange, notwithstanding that I considered it sufficiently important to devote a considerable part of my speech to it . The exchange question is of vital interest to the producing interests of Australia, and the Government believes that the establishment of a central bank will help to relieve the difficulties which now exist. It is-specially important that an immediate attempt should be made to improve the position, for our producers w ill soon be attempting to dispose of their wool clip and wheat harvest. The sale of these products must be financed. That is one of the main reasons why the Government wishes the bill to be passed quickly.

It is rather surprising to find that although a Labour Government has been in power for nine years in Queensland, it has made no effort to introduce legislation of the kind desired by the honourable member for Bourke, Por seven years, that Government gave no consideration whatever to the men on the land, but when it found that its hold on the country was slipping, it introduced some specious legislation to try to regain its lost ground. I do not think that the motives of the Opposition in supporting this amendment of the honourable member for Bourke w ill be any more misunderstood by the general public than were their motives in failing to support the Government's recent effort to obtain Imperial preference.

In 1917 he brought forward a rura l credits system and received very little support from his colleagues.

TheI have been listenhonorable member's amendment may have a result quite unexpected by him, since it may hasten the day when we shall be able to bring down to this House a is talking now concrete proposal for a system of r u r a l credits. There is an essential difference between a central banking system and a He is not talking at system providing for loans to farmers, rural credits, &c. In the case of the cent r al banking system, the assets and the resources .of the bank must be available at short notice. A t a time of temporary MrK in g stringency we must be able to mobilize those resources in the quickest possible time, and wherever there is a weak spot in the system, to concentrate our efforts on it to t r y to prevent a disaster. On the other hand, the outstanding feature of the rural credits system is that the terms of credit must be long. Farm mortgages should operate for ten years, or even longer, to enable a farmer to have a reasonable prospect of considerably reducing his mortgage by the time it falls due. A reasonable rate of interest should be charged, and provision made to enable the produce of the farmers and pastoralists to be marketed in such a way as to prevent these people from being forced to sell immediately, at a sacrifice, owing to shortage of money. They should be able to obtain a fair price for their produce at the time it is fit for market. At present our producers have frequently to sell at a sacrifice because they are in need of ready cash.

I am pleased to inform honourable members that the regulations relating to broadcasting will probably be issued in the course of the next few days, and that I am now able to outline their provisions. Honourable members know that in an attempt to define the basis upon which broadcasting should be permitted, a conference of all interests concerned was held in Sydney. It was decided that operations should be conducted by means of sealed sets, and that individual wave lengths should be apportioned. That system was tried, but, unfortunately, experience proved beyond question that the basis recommended by the conference, and adopted by the Government, would not lead to a rapid expansion of broadcasting. Consequently, further conferences were held, and the recommendations made by them have been under the consideration of the Government for some time. Very great difficulty has been experienced in evolving a system that, while it would promote broadcasting to the fullest possible extent, would be equitable to all the interests concerned. The regulations shortly to be issued w ill provide for the continuing of existing licences to broadcasters, but sealed sets will be entirely abolished, and open sets substituted. Every one w ill be able to receive broadcasted programmes provided he or she has a receiving set and has paid the required licence-fee for the service. There w ill be two typesof broadcasting licences. One w ill be for class "" A "" stations, which w ill obtain revenue from licence-fees, and the other for class "" B "" stations, which w ill not receive any revenue from that source. Both types of stations w ill be allowed to broadcast advertisements, but class "" A "" stations w ill be permitted to broadcast advertisements only for limited periods. The stipulation w ill be that advertising matter must not exceed five minutes at a time, and must not aggregate more than 30 minutes in a regular programme, or 60 AUSAdvertisements must be preceded by a suitable announcement, so that any one NETTING : DUMPING listening-in w ill be'warned that for the next five minutes at the most advertisements w ill be broadcasted. Those who do not wish to listen to the advertisements w ill thus uot be compelled to do so. The minimum powers on which the stations shall operate are stipulated. Existing licensees will be permitted to operate "" A "" class stations, and in Queensland and Tasmania, where no licences have yet been issued for broadcasting, one . "" A "" class station w ill be .authorized in each case. The two existing licensees in each of the state3 of New South Wales and Victoria w ill receive 70 per cent, and 30 per cent, respectively of the fees available for distribution in those states. One of the stations w ill operate on a power of not less than 5,000 watts, and the other on not less than 1,500 watts. The higher percentage of fees w i ll be allotted to the station operating on the higher power. If the apportionment of the fees in the ratio of 70 to 30 per cent, is objected to by the broadcasters, they can go to arbitration to determine what the proportions should be. The total amount to be apportioned between the two w ill , of course, be the amount provided out of the licensing fees for distribution to the broadcasters. In other states, where there is not more thari one licensee of the "" A "" class, the allotted revenue collected w it l i in the state w ill be paid to that licensee. The licence-fees w ill be collected by the Postmaster-General's Department. There is also provision that where a reasonable public demand exists",37,Pairs
146,Mr Bruce (Flinders,"Prime Minislicensees w ill be expected to establish, additional broadcasting stations, including relay stations. Subject to a satisfactory service being rendered, the regulations, so f a r as tbey relate to class "" A "" licensees, and the amount in respect of each class of receiving-licence fee apportioned to the broadcasting licensees, will uot be altered w it h in a period of two years from the date of issue. end of that period rights are reserved to review the position and make such alterations as may be deemed necessary. It is impossible to estimate the extent to which broadcasting w ill develop in Australia in the next few years. If the system proposed is successful, and if first class programmes are broadcasted, it is possible that there w ill be tremendous expansion, but, on the other 'hand, there is no certainty that that w ill be so. The Government feels that it is essential to place broadcasting on a definite basis, and at the same time to retain power to alter the basis upon which broadcasters are remunerated for their programmes. The liable estimate to be made of the probable expansion In default of satisfactory service reservations are provided to cancel a licence, or any portion of the rights secured thereunder. tion in Western Australia? licence has been issued in that state, and there will be only one. The licence-fees are on such a low basis that the revenue to be derived cannot possibly be sufficient to support more than one broadcasting station at the present time in each of the States of Western Australia, Tasmania, and Queensland. The point I have just made is that the licences can be revoked if a satisfactory broadcasting programme is not given. realize that such a provision is essential, because the success of broadcasting depends to a great extent on the public being impressed by the programme rendered. Mr R,. GHEEN -Who is judge of these programmes? ral. ing licence-fees . the territory will be divided into three zones, giving roughly a 250-mile radius in the first zone, a radius of 150 miles extending beyond the first in the second zone, and the rest of the territory of the state constituting the third zone. The basis on which fees are to be charged is different in each of the zones. The fees are to be based upon the principle that the licensee who is in the 250-miles zone w ill probably receive A t the a better service than thc licensee who is situated further away, and, consequently, licensees in the inside zone w ill pay a larger amount, though only a fraction more, than those in the outside zones. The proposed fees per annum are:Ordinary licence, 1924-25, Zone 1, 35s.; Zone 2, 30s.; Zone 3, 25s. Ordinary licence, 1925-26, Zone 1, 30s.; Zone 2, 25s.; Zone 3, 20s. Special licence for hotels, entertainments, tc., where profit is to result, Zone 1, £10; Zone 2, £ 9 ; Zone 3, £7 10s. Broadcasting, so f a r , has been confined to sealed sets. Any broadcaster could have a wave length granted to h i m , supply a broadcasting service, and collect his own date fixed w ill enable a reclientele, charging whatever price people were prepared to pay, but that is now of broadcasting. to be a thing of the past. The receivinglicence-fee on one of the sealed sets in Sydney was £4 or £5 per year. Honourable members w ill notice that under the present proposal there is to be a reduction in the licence-fee for the second year. The Government feels that it must do this, notwithstanding tlie fact that it is in a position to alter the whole basis of the arrangement with the broadcasting companies after two years. There may be a tremendous expansion in the number of receiving licences issued, and, as the broadcasting companies are to receive part of the licence-fees paid for the service rendered, the position at the end of the first year may be such that the broadcasting companies w ill be receiving an Honourable members w ill amount f a r in excess of what the service being rendered merits. Therefore, for the first year, we have fixed a figure which we think w ill give a reasonable return to the broadcasters. We have reduced the fee for the second year, and at the end to be the of the second year it w ill be open to the Government to review the whole basis of the remuneration to the broadcasting Por the purpose of fixing receivcompanies. It must be recognized, on the other hand, that there may not be such an expansion as is anticipated, and",38,Regulations Rinder Minutes I N Twelve Consecutive Hours

149,Mr Brtjce,"The Postmaster-Genethe amount derived by the companies under the present proposals may not give them sirfficient remuneration to ensure the giving of a first-class programme. The Government is, therefore, prepared to consider taking some action so that there will not be a reduction of revenue to the broadcasters in the second year. That, however, -will not affect the reduction in the licence-fee. Some such action may be particularly necessary in tliose states where there are comparatively small populations, and where there may not be an expansion of broadcasting sufficient to create a revenue large enough to ensure a first-clas3 service. Dealers will be licensed and will be charged per annum as follows:-Zone 1, £5; zone 2, £3; and zone 3, £2. There will be no restrictions on the design of equipment or the sale of apparatus by registered dealers. Experimental licences will be issued in cases where the. department is satisfied that the applicant possesses suffiby me:cient knowledge to undertake scientific research and investigations. per annum will be:-Zone 1, £1; zone 2, 17s. 6d.; zone 3, 15s.

Penalties are provided for breaches of the regulations. One must lay considerable stress upon this point, for, under the original proposal, with sealed sets, only a person who had made a payment to the broadcasting company could receive the service which that company was giving; but under the new regulations there will be open sets in use, and anybody who has one can pick up any programme. necessary to police these regulations, and be very strict in regard to them, for a person receiving a broadcasted programme without having paid his licence fee, will be almost in the position of a man receiving goods without having paid anything for them. The complete regulations are almost ready, and the Postmaster-General's Department hopes to issue them within a few days. Mr Bruce. I should not have delayed the House at this stage were it not for the fact that I have an urgent matter to bring under the notice of the Government. The sparse attendance at the moment of honourable members on the Opposition side is due, I might mention, to a presentation being made to the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), prior to his departure for Europe. I desire to refer to the subject of the rinderpest outbreak in Western Australia. The honourable member for Fremantle ""( Mr Watson) has been particularly busy in trying to get compensation for the economic losses sustained by those who were affected by the outbreak. Honourable members from the western state have waited patiently, and to-day, in answer to a deputation that waited on the Prime Minister on the 12th June, the' following reply was received In connection with the representations that The charges were made by the deputation of senators and members of the House of Bepresentatives on the 12th June in regard to the question of payment of the economic compensation in respect of the rinderpest outbreak in Western Australia, I desire to inform you that the Government gave full consideration to this matter. The It has been decided however that, apart from the creation of an undesirable precedent, there is no basis for such claim against the Commonwealth. In the circumstances the claim for economic compensation cannot be recognized. . Yours faithfully, ti.

It is a refusal of the request. If the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) intends to be silent under this outrage, I do not. Mr Robertson was sent by the Commonwealth Government to Western Australia at the time of the outbreak, in order to inquire into the matter and deal with it, because it was of Australian-wide importance. Mr Robertson acted with a ruthless hand, and justly so in his efforts to stamps out the pest.",39,Regulations Rinder Minutes I N Twelve Consecutive Hours

It is said that £21,000 was paid by the Commonwealth, and that a similar sum was granted by the Government of Western Australia, which I claim should not have been required by the Commonwealth to pay anything towards making good the loss of the cattle and pigs and the loss due to the burning of barns. Nothing, however, has been done to repair the economic loss sustained. were so infuriated at the time that the honourable member for Fremantle had to go with Mr Robertson, and try to explain to the justly-indignant settlers the object of the action of the Commonwealth authorities. A meeting was convened, and Mr Robertson assured the farmers that, so far as he was concerned, he could say that the Commonwealth would see that f u ll compensation was paid. With that understanding the settlers submitted to the destruction of their property, so that Australia should be saved from the menace of a dreaded cattle disease. Claims for loss of business have been put in to the extent of over £50,000. I have no doubt that in this case, as in others, some people submitted larger claims than they should have presented, but the loss can be readily assessed, nnd there is no reason why the Government should not pay just compensation. This is not a state matter. The Federal Government was responsible for the destruction of the cattle, and it should make good the loss. The action taken was for the protection of Australia generally. Why should a few struggling settlers in one part of the continent be made to suffer? The Government has been openhanded enough with regard to other claims. Recently, it paid to the Central Wool Committee £275,000 in respect of a claim which we on this side of the House contended had no foundation whatever. ment agreed to remit £1,300,000 in taxation to certain large land-owners. In this [83] matter, practically the whole of the people of Western Australia are up in arms, and no wonder, because the action of the Government in destroying stock took away the means of livelihood from I quite a number of persons. Compensation for the loss of cattle is not sufficient. I want to know what compensation this Government intends to give the people who have lost their means of livelihood. Why should a small body of people in my state be penalized? Their claim is a just one, and I trust that the final word has not been said on this matter by the Government. I was surprised to receive this letter. I had not expected that the question would be so definitely closed. I do not intend to let the matter rest withTho people concerned out my protest, and an effort to see that justice is done. I hope that the efforts made by the honourable member for Fremantle will yet be successful and compensation for the economic loss will be paid to the people concerned. It is a reflection upon our system of party government that honourable members representing the people most concerned are content, except in the case of the honourable member for Fremantle, to sit in this House with folded arms, and allow this claim for economic loss to be disposed of without a protest. Practically, in this matter, the honourable member for Fremantle stands alone so far as those on the Government side of the House are concerned. Up to the present there has not been a public protest in this chamber, but I am prepared, anyhow, to speak. I hope that the Government will yet do justice to these people. merely want to draw attention to the fact that the matter about which we have heard so much just now from the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr A. Green), has been in the hands of the honourable member for Fremautle ( Mr Watson) for some considerable time, and that he has been conferring with the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) and myself, who represent the people interested. T may add that we proposed, if necessary, to bring the question before the House, and that as far as we are concerned the claim has not been disposed of.

In this matter the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has not shown that courtesy usually extended by one member to another, and, I fear, has in troduced a party element to the question which may be detrimental to those who have suffered by the action taken to stainp out the epidemic. I shall leave it at that. In order that a wrong impression may not be created, I want now to draw attention to an answer which I received to-day from the Ministerf or Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) in connection w i th the dumping duty on wire netting. The answer suggests that the Brisbane importer whose advertisement was referred to, was importing wire netting. Tbe advertisement in question referred to barbed wire, and had no reference whatever to wire netting manufactured in Australia. In thc circumstances, I hope that the M in ister w ill reconsider the question, and see the Commonwealth Government quite whether thc dumping duty should be imposed. honourable member who has just resumed Having done that, it ""was clearly the duty his seat ( Mr Gregory) has seen £ t to deof the Government to pay, not only for liver a lecture on etiquette to the honthc value of stock destroyed, but for the orable member for Kalgoorlie ( MrA . whole of the loss incurred by the people Green).

I wish to goodness this member for Kalgoorlie is the only one government would take notice of some of with sufficient -courage to speak in this the precedents established by it during matter. the last two years. It has paid away large sums of money for which there was neither moral nor legal claim, and whilst in this case there may not be a legal claim for compensation for economic loss, tliere is certainly a strong moral claim. The Government, in order to combat the rinderpest outbreak, sent officers to Western Australia and ordered the people in the affected area to destroy their stock. I have no quarrel with that. The Goverumeut, in my opinion, took the right course. The expenditure of scores of thousands of pounds would not bo too much to prevent the spread of an awfu l disease like rinderpest in Australia, because, unchecked, it might involve tha Commonwealth in the loss of many millions of pounds. If , as is suggested,, this question of economic loss is a state matter, why did not the Commonwealth Government leave it to the state? As a matter of fact, the prevention of the spread of any disease in Australia is essentially a Commonwealth matter, and properly took steps to see that stock that were diseased, or stock likely to spread We have of justice.

Since he has become Whip of this Government he has not dared to open his momth in criticism of its actions. Prior to his appointment as Whip, and when he was sitting in the corner as an alleged critic of the Government, his voice was often heard, but since his fortunes have beeu linked up with those of this composite government . he says nothing.

That honourable member has left no stone unturned in urging their claims, both as to the amount of compensation for the loss of stock, and compensation for the economic loss. The honourable inember for Kalgoorlie ( MrA . Green) was one of a deputation, attended by nil the members from Western Australia, which placed the claim before the Ministry. tion to join us. who were present on that occasion w ill admit thut the honourable member for li'remantle was the moving spirit, and that, at the time of the outbreak, he rendered the greatest possible assistance to the Government in dealing with a very difficult situation. I entirely agree with the ( Mr Gregory) that the ordinary courtesies usually observed by one member to another should have been shown by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, to the honourable member for Eremantle, who should have been advised of the aetion which the honourable member for K a l goorlie proposed to take to-day. The matter could very well have been left with the honourable member for Eremantle. It is lamentable that the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), having no knowledge of the subject at all, should simply peruse the letter quoted by the honourable inember for KalgoorUe, and then proceed to deal with it f r om a strictly party stand-point. I very much regret the way in which this matter has been treated, because it is a very serious question. To many of the people concerned it is a l i fe and death matter. No one who has had I to consider it , could have any feelings other than those of the deepest sympathy for the owners whose stock had to be destroyed. But in this question there is involved probably one of the largest issues which the government of any country could be called upon to face. I refer to the claim for compensation for economic loss susEvery honourable member who tained as the result of action taken by the Government. There have been outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in Great Britain and in America, and outbreaks, of other diseases in other countries. On every occasion this question of economic loss has been discussed and disallowed. Obviously, if it were admitted it would be impossible for any one to say where the principle might lead a government in the future. It was on these grounds, and on these grounds only, that the Government felt obliged to refuse tb admit the principle of responsibility for economic loss in connection with the rinderpest outbreak in Western Australia. As regards the other side of the question, compensation for the destruction of stock, the Government has paid its f u l l share. It is not on that point, however, that the greatest stress is laid by the honourable member for Eremantle. He has been urging the payment of compensation for economic loss sustained by the people concerned. As I have already said, this principle, if admitted, might have very far-reaching honourable member for Swan effects in the future..

162,Mr Betjce,"I think that all thoseparty stand-point; there should not be any attempt to make political capital out of it. I regret the stand which the Government has had to take on the claim for economic loss; but after the fullest investigation, we came to the conclusion that it was impossible to admit the principle. No one can say what outbreaks may take placo in the future. They may not be confined to our flocks or herds. There may be outbreaks of epidemic diseases amongst the people. If we admitted thc principle, and paid compensation for economic loss to people against whom action had to be taken in the interests of thc nation, it would be impossible to say where it might load us in the future. For this reason the Government had to refuse thc claim. Question resolved in the affirmative. Ho""se adjourned nt 4.45 p.m.",43,Regulations Rinder Minutes I N Twelve Consecutive Hours
