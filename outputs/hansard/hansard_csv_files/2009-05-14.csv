Thursday, 14 May 2009 ----Greenway Electorate: Eric Hausoul Sarcoma Foundation launching the Eric Hausoul Sarcoma Foundation. Eric tragically lost his life in November 2008 after bravely fighting sarcoma disease. Sarcoma disease is a tumour-or tumours-that can target the bone, cartilage or muscle and affects predominantly adolescents and young adults aged between 12 years and 25 years. Sarcomas occur 50 per cent more frequently in males than females and are often dismissed as ‘growing pains’. The most common three types of sarcoma are osteosarcoma, which commonly affects teenagers during growth spurts and often affects long bones and those located close to the knee-it is also the most common type of bone cancer; Ewing’s sarcoma, which relates to the nerve cells and makes up between 10 to 15 per cent of all bone sarcomas; and chondroblastic sarcoma, which arises from a person’s cartilage. Misdiagnosis is commonly the cause of death and, unfortunately for Eric, this was the case for him. Currently, there is no effective way to identify or prevent sarcoma. Further research is what is required. Eric was a true champion. He fought to the end and never gave up. Eric dreamed big, with plans to be a pilot with the Royal Australian Air Force. Eric was part of the Squadron 336 RAAF Cadets Richmond, with plans post high school to attend the Australian Defence Force Academy. Eric would have been extremely proud on the day of the launch. His family, friends, school colleagues, teachers and the community united to support this. I particularly acknowledge his parents and his sister for the work that they have done, and have been doing, in raising the awareness of sarcoma and for their commitment to raising funds for the future research aimed at finding solutions and answers that will prevent deaths like Eric’s. There are too many young people in Australia and the world that, through no fault of their own, do battle with this unforgiving disease and, like Eric, lose the fight. It was an honour to be asked to launch this foundation. It is vital that money is raised so a cure can be found for this terrible disease. I encourage anyone who has the opportunity to support this foundation to do so. No donation is too small and every bit will contribute to a future for our young people. Dr Jamal Rifi raising five children into fine young Australians; a doctor who has served my community for decades; a community leader esteemed in Bankstown, Belmore and beyond; a man whose work deserves a place in the public record of the Australian parliament. This man is Dr Jamal Rifi. Dr Rifi migrated to Australia in 1984, learnt English, and completed his studies in medicine. He became a GP, set up his own practice and threw himself into the service of our community. He became a founding member of Australian Muslim Doctors against Violence and the Australian Christian-Muslim Friendship Society. He has been awarded a Human Rights Medal and has become the President of the Lakemba Sports and Recreation Club. In the wake of the Cronulla riots, he was the driving force behind the On the Same Wave program-a MAIN COMMITTEE",141,Budget And Other Measures

Last week, the member for Cook and I traversed the Kokoda Trail with Dr Rifi, bringing together young people from the beaches of Cronulla and the suburbs of Bankstown. I think it without his self-deprecating sense of humour, without his compassionate professionalism and without his leadership and encouragement. We affectionately called him the ‘Panther’. He would appear at camp every night in a new costume, a product of bush ingenuity and his razor sharp wit. One morning, Dr Rifi walked up to an older group of trekkers, resting at the top of a gruelling climb, and he asked them if it was seniors day and invited them to pull out their Medicare cards. But he is not just a funny man; he is also a fine doctor. Our trek leader, Charlie Lynn, a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council, said that Dr Rifi was the best doctor he had seen in his 20 years on the trail. In difficult conditions he took his Hippocratic oath to new lengths. Physically exhausted himself, he not only looked after our team but also treated local guides and villagers. He told me that the highlight of the trek was the opportunity to treat a real hero, Faole Bokoi, one of the few surviving fuzzy wuzzy angels. After eight days walking along the trail with Dr RifiI now understand why he is held in such high esteem by so many. He is a trailblazer-a man committed to breaking down the barriers of ignorance and intolerance, a doctor helping to heal the body and the soul of our community and a community leader worth following. In January this year, Dr Rifi was named the New South Wales Local Hero of the Year as part of the Australia Day awards. It is a fitting tribute to a man who is a real hero to many people in our community, including me. La Trobe Electorate: Berwick Lodge Primary School Lodge Primary School, which is doing a fantastic job out there under the guidance of principal Henryk Grossek. I would like to thank all the school committees for all the great work they are doing in helping the students, and the teachers for providing the students at Berwick Lodge Primary School the best education possible. In my various and numerous visits to the school, I am always welcomed by the kids, who are doing a fantastic job out there. You would think the school would be happy to receive $3 million under the government’s education revolution program. However, Berwick Lodge Primary School has little to smile about because, instead of having the opportunity of using this $3 million for the construction of a new library and six classrooms, as planned, we have the crazy situation where the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development has told the school that it needs to use this funding to build a gymnasium. You may think that is fair enough, but the school already has a gymnasium and it does not want another one. It actually wants-and this is from the school council, the parents and the students-to have a library and it wants six additional classrooms. Berwick Lodge Primary School opened in 1994-this is its 15th year-and it has 750 students. It already has a library, but over time it has become too small. I believe all colleagues would agree that a library is the basis for any good education at a school and it just seems absolutely bizarre and crazy that a school cannot get a library and, instead, is being told by the MAIN COMMITTEE",150,Constituency Statements

258,Mr Wood (La Trobe) (9.36 Am),"I wish to talk about a school in my electorate, Berwickeducation department that it must have another gymnasium. I can see the conversation now when the application was being looked at by the education department: ‘Here is an application from Berwick Lodge Primary School: it actually wants a library and six classrooms,’ and someone has the brainwave, ‘No, why don’t we just give them a gymnasium?’ The school has said on numerous occasions that it does not want a gymnasium and it has been told, ‘Well, why don’t you just have a second one?’ It is absolutely stupid and ridiculous. The previous government allocated Berwick Lodge Primary School $143,000 for a multimedia centre. The school got to say where this money was spent and it is a fantastic facility. I know it is being well used because during the last election campaign I was grilled by the students in that facility about some of my election promises. But, in all seriousness, this needs to change now. The school needs to get the funding it requires for a library. That is what the school wants. This government needs to get stuck into the state education department in Victoria to make sure the federal funding is used for what Berwick Lodge Primary School wants it to be used for. (Time expired) Hindmarsh Electorate: Westlake Shopping Centre Westfield to introduce boom gates and parking fees at their Westlake shopping centre in the electorate of Hindmarsh. The Charles Sturt Development Assessment Panel recently made the decision not to approve Westfield’s proposal for the car park alterations. Despite this, Westfield has now appealed to the Environment, Resources and Development Court against last month’s decision by the council and against the will of the people in the area. The appeal against the council’s decision has sparked protests from residents, retailers, staff and shoppers. Many constituents have contacted my office because they are extremely concerned about the proposed introduction of boom gates and parking fees at the West Lakes shopping centre. A group of about 30 people, including me, a number of Charles Sturt City councillors and the local member for the seat of Lee, Michael Wright, held a three-hour protest outside the shopping centre on 18 April and collected signatures. Julie Macdonald, from the group No Parking Fees for Westlake Shopping Centre, has obtained thousands of signatures on a petition from people who are against the proposal. As well as being a convenient shopping location, the centre is home to the West Lakes Community Centre and a public library. It is a strongly utilised as a community hub. Many of the older residents in the area enjoy just walking through the shopping centre as an outing. Putting boom gates in will prevent them from their normal weekly outing if they cannot afford the parking fees. It is also terrible timing by Westfield in the economic climate we now face. With the current economic situation, we need to encourage people to support local businesses to retain jobs in the community. Westfield also has a job to support the retailers, large and small, that are operating their businesses in the centre in tough economic times. Many of those retailers have contacted me. They are totally against the boom gates going up in the car park because they say customers will go and shop elsewhere. Boom gates and paid parking can only make things worse. Parking fees will encourage customers to shop elsewhere. I have written to Westfield but I am yet to receive a reply. I call on Westfield to reconsider its proposal to reintroduce boom gates and paid parking. Westfield has a duty not only to make money for its shareholders but also to be a good corporate citizen by ensuring that this shopping centre that MAIN COMMITTEE",151,Constituency Statements

So Westfield has a duty to ensure that it is a community centre. (Time expired) Gilmore Electorate: Heritage Estates township of Deniliquin are under threat as a consequence of a decision of this government. I am not referring to the new workplace legislation, although I could because I have certainly fielded many inquiries from concerned employers in my electorate of Gilmore. We are predominantly a tourist zone and have many seasonal workers. A decision to standardise awards means that costs will go up, especially for casuals. And we all know that, when labour costs go up, there are inevitably cost offsets as employers struggle to maintain profit levels. The fact that jobs are created by employers seems to be lost on the other side of the House. It is all very well imposing costs on business but if the consequence is that it drives it offshore or simply strangles it then the motives driving such a decision should be stringently questioned. In fact, one local call centre employer has warned that he will only cope with this latest imposition by going offshore. Gilmore will lose another 30 jobs but still the government does not care. The same sentiment that is jeopardising 1,000 jobs in Deniliquin drives the decision by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts to stop forever the development of a patch of private land in the electorate of Gilmore. The land is the Heritage Estates, known as a ‘linen estate’. People speculatively bought the land 20 or 30 years ago in the hope that approval would eventually be given for its statutory subdivision. That was the setting that brought Minister Garrett to Jervis Bay, where the Heritage Estates are located. Exercising his ministerial prerogative, he declared that no development would be allowed given the enormous environmental significance of the site. There was no discussion or meeting with the ratepayers or local council, yet he met with local environmentalists. So, immediately, his decision has effectively disenfranchised the owners of the land. The commercial value of the land is now zero. Nobody wants to buy it because it is useless for anything. The Heritage Estates are a poisoned chalice. But the minister thinks that this scrubby land is so critically vital that it has to be protected. There has been no thought given to the money that has been lost by the many hundreds of people who have invested in these blocks and for many years paid council rates because they were obliged to do so. Yet the council was prepared to negotiate a lesser approval to come to a compromise. As far as I can tell, these people will probably still be liable for rates each year. Is this a fair outcome? I think not. The shadow minister for the environment, Greg Hunt, visited my electorate shortly afterwards and he at least spoke with the many residents affected-unlike the minister, who seemed to have been entertained by his supporters. I was not even asked to come along despite the fact that I have been representing these people for so many years and possibly would have had something to contribute. MAIN COMMITTEE",152,Constituency Statements
260,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (9.42 Am),"Apparently the jobs of 1,000 people in and around theMr Hunt made the very sensible observation that if the government were so serious about the value of this land, they should simply buy it from the landowners at a fair price. If the government have effectively sterilised the private use of heritage estates then I call on the government to do the proper thing and buy this land. If it is so pristine, gift it to the national parks for people to enjoy; do not just leave it there to be used as a rubbish dump and a place for feral animals to roam. Fremantle Electorate: Fremantle Men’s Community Shed Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (9.45 am)-The Fremantle Men’s Community Shed was the first of its kind in Western Australia and it is an example of how we can find and create new ways of building community spirit. RecentlyI had the pleasure of launching their shed open day and community garage sale. The Fremantle men’s shed does a lot more than simply provide the tools and workshop space for tinkering with and building stuff. It is a place where men can talk and draw strength from one another’s experiences and skills, where young men can learn from older men and older men can receive the great boon that comes from feeling connected, from being heard and respected. The shed’s members have assisted with the community projects, including building the roof for a greenhouse at South Fremantle Senior High School, conducting toy workshops for children and a computer skills course. The shed has recently completed a project in conjunction with the Fremantle Hospital mental health unit aimed at assisting men with clinically diagnosed mental health conditions. The shed is also working with the Hilton PCYC and youth at risk in the Fremantle area, targeting kids who have dropped out of school. Often when these kids make something at the men’s shed, it is the first sense of achievement they have ever felt. It enhances their self-esteem and gives them some hope for the future. It is no wonder that on Australia Day this year, the Freo men’s shed received the Premier’s Active Citizenship Award. As part of its operation, the shed has links with services and support structures that enhance men’s health and well-being, and this is critical as health outcomes for men in Australia are significantly poorer than for women in a number of areas, not least life expectancy. Recent research shows the clear health benefits of providing men with social and support networks. Indeed, Freo men’s shed members have told me of a number of suicides that have been prevented because of the shed. Just as women have benefited enormously from community health and social programs directed at the particular needs of women, it is also the case that men are responding very positively to the men’s shed concept that caters specifically to the needs of men. For all these reasons, I am very pleased that the Fremantle men’s shed received $2,500 in the latest round of the Rudd government’s community volunteer grants. I am hopeful, moreover, that, in view of the very real and practical role that community men’s sheds play in advancing men’s health and well-being, they will formally be incorporated into the government’s health and social inclusion agenda. I acknowledge the fantastic work of the volunteers who run the Freo men’s shed, particularly Bill Johnstone, Alan Gowland, Alex Marshall, Paul Whitfield, Rob Hornbrook, Bob Fleming and Joe Gaffney. I have been happy to provide funds to assist some of the shed members to attend the Australian Men’s Shed Association conference being held in Hobart in August this year. I commend the work of the Australian Men’s Shed Association, which provides advice and assistance to nearly 300 men’s sheds across Australia. A real sense of community is building at the Fremantle men’s shed and I will be working to ensure that not only MAIN COMMITTEE the Fremantle men’s shed but men’s sheds across Australia receive the support they need to continue providing these valuable community and health outcomes, which I have been fortunate enough to see first hand in Fremantle. Gippsland Electorate: Lakes Entrance Surf Life Saving Club our of the Lakes Entrance Surf Life Saving Club, which has been awarded the 2009 Surf Life Saving Australia club of the year. This is an outstanding achievement for a comparatively small regional club and all credit is due to past and present members. The surf life saving movement across Australia is one of our nation’s most important community service organisations, providing a highly valued rescue service to keep our beaches safe throughout the year. In my home town of Lakes Entrance, the surf life saving club plays a critical role in the social and economic life of the region. Ninety Mile Beach is prone to rips and large swells and, like all surf beaches, conditions can change quite quickly. Inexperienced swimmers can be caught unawares and it is essential that a patrolled beach is provided for the safety of local residents and also to attract tourists to our town. Tourism is a major industry in Lakes Entrance and I have no doubt that the existence of the surf life saving club and the countless hours of patrols that have been provided over the past 50 years add an enormous amount to the economic well-being of our community. Perhaps the greatest service provided by the Lakes Entrance club and so many other surf life saving clubs around Australia is the role it plays in helping young people achieve their full potential. I am proud to say that three of my children are enrolled in the Lakes Entrance nippers program. In fact, more than 100 youngsters participated in the Lakes Entrance program over the past summer months. The nippers are trained in first aid and surf safety and also have the benefits of enjoying a healthy and active lifestyle. None of this would be possible without the efforts of outstanding volunteers and parents, such as Rob Brown and David Richardson, who ran the nippers program over the summer months in Lakes Entrance. Similarly, the club’s success as the Australian Club of the Year would not have been possible without dozens of volunteers over many years of service. The dedication and commitment of so many people has contributed to the club enjoying recognition this year. Great Australians like our former club leaders and local citizens of the year, Ian Shepherd, Ron Stott and Doc McKenzie; and the current leadership team of president, Trevor Dix; secretary, Kris Cordery, captain Cameron King; and treasurer Tony Carroll. I mention the treasurer last not just because he barracks for the Richmond Football Club but because Tony has the job of securing funding for the redevelopment of the clubhouse. The community has done a great job in building new facilities in recent times with volunteer fundraising and the assistance of some government funding, but they are still about $400,000 short of their target to complete the next stage of the project. The existing facilities are very well used and supported by the community not only in terms of their primary use as a surf life saving clubhouse but also as a venue for private functions. However, there is a shortage of storage space and there is a need for improved first aid treatment facilities and, most importantly, the existing building does not provide adequately for people with disabilities or reduced mobility. MAIN COMMITTEE",153,Constituency Statements
261,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (9.48 Am),"It gives me great pleasure to speak today in honI will be working with my colleagues at state level to pursue funding opportunities at both the state and the federal level on behalf of Lakes Entrance Surf Life Saving Club because Australia’s best club deserves some of Australia’s best facilities. Without wishing to pre-empt future announcements, the Lakes Entrance club is strongly tipped to host next year’s Victorian junior and state titles. The club did a magnificent job of hosting the 2008 junior titles and is ready, willing and able to do it all again. It would top off the state titles if the new facilities were in place to cater for the thousands of surf lifesavers and their families who will descend on Lakes Entrance for the event. Deakin Electorate: Roads tive contained in the Rudd government’s visionary 2009-10 nation-building budget. The $80 million contribution to the Springvale and Whitehorse roads upgrade project by the federal government is now fully funded in this year’s budget, with the allocation of $76.5 million towards the project. Along with funding of $60 million announced in the recent Victorian state budget this project will commence mid-year and be completed by early 2010. The Belgrave and Lilydale rail lines will be lowered and a new grade-separated road crossing will be built over the top, separating traffic and trains at this location forever. This is a great result for the residents and commuters in the federal electorate of Deakin and for the thousands of residents in the outer east in surrounding suburbs. These people know what it means to tackle that level crossing every day, to get to work or school or even to do the shopping. I know only too well how congested and frustrating it is at both peak and off-peak times. With 50,000 vehicles using the level crossing per day, the Springvale boom gates come down repeatedly to allow the 218 scheduled daily train services to pass. For local residents of Nunawading, these problems are magnified. Traffic jams on Springvale Road are a daily occurrence that, in many ways, has the effect of splitting the suburb in two. There are even traffic jams there on a Sunday. Even pedestrians are delayed by this congestion when waiting to cross the rail lines whilst trains pass through, one after the other, keeping the crossing closed for several minutes at a time, especially in peak periods. The Springvale Road railway crossing in Nunawading has, for two years in a row, been rated by the RACV as Melbourne’s No. 1 congestion red spot. The same crossing also won that rating in 2004. This project will reduce traffic congestion along Springvale Road and through the intersection with Whitehorse Road and will improve safety for road users by removing the level crossing where there have been 50 crashes causing injury and a death over the last five years. Pedestrian safety will also be improved through the provision of an underpass to provide for the safe crossing of Springvale Road. Local business owners will also experience positive outcomes through the improved station facility, pedestrian movements, car parking and especially through a reduction in traffic congestion, which often prevents access to prospective customers. A new railway station for Nunawading is a key part of this project and it will replace the old and outdated buildings that are used by thousands of commuters every day. There is also provision in the plans to allow increased capacity by possibly extending a third rail line. Residents in the outer east have been waiting a very long time for news that something is finally being done to fix Springvale Road.

Barker Electorate: Education year 12 results which were achieved by students in my electorate of Barker. These were students who faced ongoing disadvantages of distance, drought and unreliable internet connections and yet achieved great success in gaining a high TER ranking-a TER ranking that saw these young achievers being offered places at universities in Adelaide and Melbourne, a TER ranking that should have seen this government pave the way for them to continue that academic success at university. Their success would make us all better off as they go on to be the teachers, doctors, lawyers, scientists and other professionals of the future. Not so under the Rudd Labor government budget of this week. When the average Australian wage is $1,148 a week it is unfathomable that parents whose total income is barely $818 per week are considered by the Rudd government to be too well off to be given assistance for their student children. An amount of $818 a week will barely house, clothe and feed a rural or regional family, and it certainly will not enable them to pay board or accommodation and travel costs for their student child to attend tertiary education up to 450 kilometres away. For the students in my electorate, there is no quick 80c bus ride into uni and back home for dinner that night with mum and dad. Our students have to pay for board in the city where the nearest university is located and then pay travel costs to return home periodically. A family on $818 a week does not have spare change to afford this. For some students the only option has been to take a gap year or to work part time, and to work as long and hard as they possibly can, just to get the funds they need to set up accommodation far from home to study. Unbelievably, these students will now be penalised. If they have earned over $19,532 over 18 months-about $6.50 an hour-or if they have worked part time over 18 months, the Rudd government has now decided that they will not qualify for independent youth allowance whereas before they did. The flow-on effect creates more disadvantages. Students who are denied youth allowance will not qualify for relocation scholarships to assist them with the cost of moving for study and, for many, this means an end to their goal of a tertiary education. We know the Rudd government’s fiscal blundering will leave a huge debt to pay-$200 billion in fact-but to claw it back from hard working students striving for a tertiary qualification by denying them income support or relocation assistance is a disgrace. Asylum Seekers lation to unauthorised boat arrivals and immigration detention has been somewhat surprising. Over the past 10 months I have been working closely on these issues with members of the opposition on the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, which I chair.

265,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (9.57 Am),"The rhetoric coming from the opposition in redations on how the migration system can be more effective and just, including explicitly supporting the elimination of detention debt since it costs the Australian taxpayer almost as much to collect it as is collected. That did not take into consideration the inhumane consequences for low-income earners who have been granted Australian citizenship of having to pay back massive debts. The claim that recent changes to the migration policy could increase the number of unauthorised boat arrivals is unfounded. It is external factors such as natural disaster and conflict that are pushing unauthorised boats towards our shores, and people smugglers are exploiting these people in vulnerable situations. There is no evidence to suggest that the previous government’s detention policies were a deterrent to unlawful arrivals. The parliament’s migration committee heard evidence which showed overwhelmingly that refugees fleeing their countries were doing so as a result of extreme situations. Rarely, if ever, did they consider or even know about the detention policy of the host country. Temporary protection visas were introduced in 1999. There were 3,722 unauthorised boat arrivals in that year. During the next two years, there were 8,459 unauthorised boat arrivals, including 5,520 in 2001. These fluctuations were caused by external factors, not by changes in Australian law. As of 1 May 2009, there are 304 unauthorised boat arrivals in immigration detention. This is not a figure that 21 million Australians should think about when altering the balance of our immigration or refugee policy. While there has been a lot of fuss following the arrival of several boats, the numbers involved should be put in a global context. Germany, Britain and France are receiving tens of thousands of these people. Most people who claim asylum in Australia actually come by plane, arriving on another type of visa and then applying for asylum. Australia receives only a small fraction of the asylum claims received globally. Australia’s share of the global proportion of those seeking asylum has averaged about 1.5 per cent over the past two decades. The Rudd government was elected on a platform of maintaining strong border protectionreinforced in the budget-and upholding the integrity of our immigration system and ensuring that everyone who tries to enter Australia is processed quickly and treated fairly. That is what the government is doing, and I am confident the Australian people will continue to support this new and more humane, just, rational and effective policy.

FUEL QUALITY STANDARDS AMENDMENT BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 May, on motion by Mr Garrett: That this bill be now read a second time. Quality Standards Amendment Bill 2009 and to raise several related issues within the bill. In an area like the Mid-North Coast of New South Wales, petrol generally is a contentious issue at the best of times, particularly the pricing of retail fuel. On a more general basis, fuel quality is also a contentious area of public policy in regard to issues such as ethanol blends and various mandates that are or are not being implemented throughout states such as New South Wales. MAIN COMMITTEE",157,Constituency Statements
266,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke),Order! In accordance with standing order,158,Constituency Statements
267,Mr Oakeshott (Lyne) (10.01 Am),"I am pleased this morning to support the FuelThe purpose of the bill is to amend the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000 in order to implement the recommendations of the first statutory review of the act, conducted in 2004-05, and I note that that process was undertaken by the previous government. In particular, the bill will improve the process for granting approvals to vary fuel standards by providing for a wider range of conditions that the minister can apply to approvals, including the power to require that companies take certain action to minimise the effects of supplying substandard fuel, and will simplify the procedures when approval is required urgently to avoid a fuel supply shortage. As well, it provides for more effective and efficient monitoring and enforcement powers-and I will come back to that-including the introduction of a civil penalty regime and the establishment of an infringement notice system. Thirdly, it addresses a number of issues that have arisen from the practical application of the act and its subordinate legislation. Going back to the issue of monitoring, in the short time that I have been in this place, I have had the opportunity to meet with the ACCC Petrol Commissioner, Joe Dimasi. He has confirmed that on the Mid-North Coast there are regional towns that are included in the daily monitoring that is done. There are 110 regional centres throughout Australia which are monitored daily by the ACCC. My response to him-and I hope that the ACCC consider it-is that on their website it is only prices in the capital cities that are posted on a daily basis, so for anyone who wants to follow what is happening in regional Australia the ACCC website at this stage is not relevant, despite the work being done on a daily basis by the ACCC’s monitoring. So there is great contention in our area as to why petrol prices fluctuate so much and why there are large differentials between petrol prices in metropolitan areas and non-metropolitan areas such as the Mid-North Coast, and that debate will continue. I seek from the ACCC that they be incredibly active in monitoring and from government that they resource the ACCC appropriately so that that monitoring can be as vigorous as possible. If discrepancies are picked up through that monitoring process then proper enforcement can be done by the regulatory authorities. There was a good example a couple of months ago. All the retail outlets in the Taree area received a letter from the ACCC. Either by design or by coincidence there was a reduction in the prices within that community at pretty well exactly the same time as those letters hit the letterboxes. If anyone is in any doubt as to whether monitoring and subsequent enforcement by government regulatory authorities-in this case the petrol commissioner-make a difference, there is a living and breathing example from the Taree community and the Manning Valley. The second point I want to make on the bill is on fuel blends. That is an issue of contention. I think it is folly that the government is encouraging various mandates with regard to ethanol blends. I do think the science is not in. I have said previously in this House that for any West Wing fans there is a fantastic episode called ‘The Pledge’. All the various candidates have to stand up and talk about how they love ethanol, when in the back rooms they are sitting with their advisers and their staff talking about why on earth they are being forced in the public arena to stick up for the ethanol industry and ethanol blend in fuel. I would encourage everyone in this place to watch that episode when they are considering this topic. The parliament of New South Wales recently debated the issue and following that will mandate a 10 per cent ethanol blend by 1 July 2011. I think there were four people in the parliament who opposed that, and they were four of my Independent colleagues. I think that says something about the claws of the vested interests digging deeply into the political process. I MAIN COMMITTEE know there are many members of both political parties who question privately the issue of ethanol blends in fuels. Neither the environmental outcomes nor the impacts on farmers are necessarily good. Many farmers argue they are bad. In fact, the Australian Lot Feeders Association is on record saying that it is concerned about feed grain prices. The Australian dairy committee has expressed concerns about impacts on prices and the ultimate impact on consumers when you go down the food-for-fuel path. I hope all of us as members of parliament feel a moral obligation to our neighbouring countries. The general issue of turning food into fuel when we have a world food crisis emerging should prick the consciousness of everyone within the public policy arena in Australia. One aspect of the Fuel Quality Standards Amendment Bill 2009 is proper labelling of various blends, including ethanol blends. I throw it to the minister to put a label on those E10 blended fuels that says, ‘Don’t buy,’ or, ‘It’s furphy fuel.’ It is a questionable product being pushed by public policymakers to the detriment ultimately of consumers. I would ask this government to consider the actions that the various states are taking with regard to this and where within the authority and the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth action can be taken. I would hope that, whether through this or similar legislation, it can be considered. I do not oppose this bill, but I flag that fuel is a continuously contentious issue in my community. It is contentious because of the pricing at the retail bowser, because of the emerging issue of fuel quality and because public policymakers are prioritising vested interests at the expense of consumers. I hope both of those issues are considered by this place in future policy. Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (10.10 am)-I rise today to speak in favour of the measures that ensure fuel standards around the country. The purpose of the Fuel Quality Standards Amendment Bill 2009 is to amend the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000 in order to implement the recommendations of the first statutory review of the act, conducted in 2004-05 and released in 2005. I note that there will be another review, which will be undertaken at the end of this year, and I hope that it will allow for some reflection on the new provisions before us today. The most important new provisions are the improvements to the process of granting approval to vary fuel standards, particularly because the bill simplifies procedures when an approval is required to urgently avoid a possible fuel supply shortage. The bill also provides more effective and efficient monitoring and enforcement powers by introducing a civil penalty regime and an infringement notice system. The act currently allows the minister to approve the variation of fuel standards and impose conditions on the approval. Currently, those conditions must relate directly to the supply of fuel. This bill broadens the scope for imposing conditions. This increased scope means that negative impacts of the supply of substandard fuel can be offset by other actions of the corporation applying for a variation of the standard. Such flexibility allows for a holistic determination of the effects of an approval on human health and the environment. Offsetting projects could include paying for the monitoring project or other investments that ensure that emissions from such fuel are not dangerously harmful. The bill also allows the minister to consider the circumstances in which fuel is supplied as one of the matters that constitute a fuel standard. The provision will assist in addressing issues related to the complexity of defining fuels used for different purposes and the management of blends-for example, diesel blended with biodiesel. Beyond improving the process for apMAIN COMMITTEE provals in regular circumstances, the bill also establishes a streamlined process for an emergency situation and, under these new provisions, an emergency approval to avoid a potential fuel supply shortfall as exceptional circumstances are provided for. In addition, the minister will now be able to grant an emergency approval for a maximum period of 14 days and is required to notify the decision to rather than consult the Fuel Standards Consultative Committee. This measure expedites the process without risking an abuse of power in this area. Finally, as a reform to the approval process under the act, the bill allows for the minister to delegate the power to grant approvals to the secretary or the SES officer, except in relation to emergency approvals, which the minister may delegate only to the secretary. This is an important efficiency measure that will allow the more routine approvals, such as those relating to racing fuels, to be handled by the department. It will also provide some flexibility for the department in those situations where an emergency approval is required to address a potential fuel supply threat and the minister is unable to make an immediate determination for some reason. The bill also provides for important changes to the monitoring and enforcement regime of fuel standards. Under the act currently, inspectors are required to obtain the consent of a fuel retailer before exercising monitoring powers which are quite broad. This limits the efficacy of some monitoring activities, and the changes in the bill address this and will allow inspectors to enter the public area of a business premises to exercise a limited range of monitoring powers without either the consent of the retailer or a warrant. Importantly, the retailer’s right to refuse to allow an inspector to enter or remain on the premises, as is the case with any member of the public, will not be affected. This measure simply makes monitoring more effective and will also mean a better outcome for everyone. The bill also introduces a more comprehensive range of enforcement measures to our national fuel standards regime. To complement the current criminal provisions in the act, this bill, as I have mentioned before, does include a civil penalties regime so that there will be for each offence an equivalent civil penalty provision. Other enforcement measures include the ability to issue an infringement notice and, if appropriate, accept an enforceable undertaking. The regulations may make further provision in relation to infringement notices. We all know that having this civil penalty provision will allow for more expedient penalties to be imposed for those retailers that do the wrong thing. These measures will ensure that appropriate action can be taken in respect of breaches of the act. There is also one new offence introduced in the bill. New section 65D provides that the secretary can require a person, other than the person who is suspected of contravening a civil penalty provision, who may have information relevant to an application for a civil penalty order, to provide all reasonable assistance in connection with the application. An offence applies for failure to give assistance as required. While this offence is a new offence under the act, it is a procedural offence common to other Commonwealth legislation. The bill before the House today reflects a common-sense approach to Australia’s fuel standards regime. The bill introduces several new elements to the act, which has, for the most part, served the nation well. With the bill the government is ensuring that the process of granting approvals to vary fuel standards is simplified and made more effective, particularly for emergency situations. The government is also strengthening and monitoring an enforcement MAIN COMMITTEE provision to consolidate the integrity of the fuel standards regime. Therefore, I commend the bill to the House. Ms MARINO (Forrest) (10.16 am)-The Fuel Quality Standards Amendment Bill 2009 standardises the quality and improvements of fuel being distributed in Australia in order to regulate fuel quality for environmental improvement, the adoption of better engine and emission control technologies and more effective engine operation. The Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000 was introduced by the coalition to provide a national framework for controlling and improving fuel quality. The act established for the first time in Australia a national regulatory regime for fuel quality that was backed up by a comprehensive monitoring and enforcement program. In 2003 the coalition successfully implemented amendments to the act that were necessary to enable the Commonwealth to impose requirements for labelling of fuels at the point of sale and to make a number of existing offences under the act strict liability offences. In 2004-05 an independent statutory review of the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000 was undertaken by the Fuel Quality Standards Act Review Panel with assistance from Economic Associates Australia Pty Ltd and SWB Consulting Ltd. It concluded that the overall policy objectives of the act were being met and should not be altered. Minor recommendations revolving around three areas were made to ensure nationally consistent standards; improvements to monitoring, compliance and enforcement; and improvements to the administration of the act. This bill aims to make administrative amendments and implement the recommendations of an independent statutory review, conducted under the coalition, which found that these objectives are being met. The coalition supports the minor administrative amendments to improve the bill by amending the process for granting approvals to vary fuel standards by wielding the conditions that the minister can apply to approvals, by simplifying the approval procedures when a decision is urgently required to avoid a fuel supply shortfall and by enhancing monitoring and enforcement powers, including the introduction of a civil penalty regime and the establishment of an infringement notice system. Amendments to the bill will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Fuel Quality Standards Act. In particular the amendments will improve the development and enforcement of fuel standards, which will benefit the public and the environment through cleaner fuels and reduced vehicle emissions. Through this bill the government will impose a new petrol tax under the ETS within one year for commercial transport and within an electoral cycle for passenger vehicles. This will be a new tax law and a new tax for motorists and all fuel users. Further concerns I have relate to the Rudd government’s emissions trading scheme. There is no doubt that the government’s proposed legislation is seriously and fundamentally flawed. To use one example, it assumes that Western Australian energy production is connected to the national grid. We all know that Western Australia is basically an energy island. With the planned introduction of the government’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, I am concerned about the impacts a future emissions trading scheme will have on Australian industry across the board. It will impact on the transport sector, the mining sector and the farming, agriculture and forestry industries, and there will be a cost to every Australian community, individual and family. Fuel is and will continue to be a very important component in Australia’s productivity and commercial ventures, as well as an ongoing component of our energy balance. MAIN COMMITTEE I have mentioned many times in this chamber that my electorate of Forrest not only is the south-west food bowl of Western Australia but also contains major mining and resource activities. Transport and fuel are integral components of these industries. The transport industry itself has faced major cost increases recently. Fuel is also a major operating cost for forestry contractors. Most are small businesses and most are concerned that this government will exclude them from compensation arrangements for extra fuel costs under the proposed CPRS. It has been estimated that the result will be a cost of $14,000 a year for additional fuel charges, and most contractors are already on very narrow margins and will not be able to absorb these increases. In my electorate, this is on the back of the impact of the Varanus gas explosion. The log haulers were parked up almost immediately. We have lost contractors, and some of the remaining operators have had to sell assets just to survive. We have seen the failed introduction of Fuelwatch, which was supposed to put competition into fuel prices. But the days of real fuel competition have been compromised by the strong position of supermarket chains in the petrol market. Consumers cannot necessarily plan ahead, as they are expected to with Fuelwatch, as to where the cheapest fuel is supposed to be, particularly in regional areas. Generally all they can do is watch the prices remain high. According to the CSIRO’s June 2008 report entitled Fuel for thought, Australia is more vulnerable to changing market circumstances than other countries due to its relatively high vehicle use, the relatively high fuel consumption by vehicles, the almost 97 per cent reliance on oil based fuels for transport and the declining domestic reserves of conventional oil. About 41 per cent of final energy consumption is used in the transport sector, and demand has grown by 2.4 per cent per year. The vast majority of domestic passenger and freight trips are undertaken in road vehicles, which account for 75 per cent of transport fuel use. Air transport is the second highest user, at 16 per cent, then water, at four per cent, and rail transport, at two per cent. The high level of car ownership in Australia means that transport accounts for 14 per cent of Australian’s total national greenhouse gas emissions, which is roughly equivalent to the emissions from agriculture. There is no doubt that the price of fuel will increase under the emissions trading scheme. Those with low incomes will be most vulnerable to rising fuel costs, as spending on fuel represents a greater proportion of disposable income. In addition, there is a tendency for this group to own less fuel efficient vehicles and have fewer resources to invest in alternative fuel or more efficient vehicles. Regional communities and those located on the urban fringes will also be disproportionately impacted upon, owing to their higher fuel use and fewer options for reduced motor vehicle travel or public transport. The increased cost of oil based fuels will filter through the economy, increasing the costs of all goods and services. The mining and metal-manufacturing sectors are amongst the highest users of transport as an input to production. According to the 2005 ABS report, the transport of food to retail outlets accounts for between one and six per cent of the cost of grocery items. The impact of the ETS on local and regional producers getting their products to markets will result in higher cost increases both to the producer at the farm gate and, through the food supply and value chain, to the consumer. An emissions trading scheme that does not include international emitters will represent a serious threat to food security and to our home-grown regional food producers, food manufacturers and exporters. MAIN COMMITTEE quality. She has strayed quite a lot on the ETS, and I have allowed it, but I think we would like to get back to the actual bill before us. Ms HALL (Shortland) (10.25 am)-It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak on the Fuel Quality Standards Amendment Bill 2009. This legislation implements the recommendations of the first statutory review of the Fuel Standards Act 2000. The bill also addresses a number of administrative issues and provides an independent review of its operation every five years. The next review is due to commence late this year. The amendments to the act will improve development and enforcement of the fuel standards, which in turn benefit the public and the environment through cleaner fuels and reduced emissions. I have noted what a number of members making contributions to this debate have said. The member for Lyne raised a number of valid issues. Members on the other side tended in their contributions to stray-as you pointed out, Madam Deputy Speaker-from the actual ambit of the legislation. I support this legislation. With those few words, I hand over to the Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northern Australia to sum up. Australia) (10.27 am)-I acknowledge the excellent contributions of all speakers in this debate and rise to sum up. The Fuel Quality Standards Amendment Bill 2009 will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000. In particular, these amendments are needed to improve the development and enforcement of fuel standards, which in turn benefit the public and the environment through cleaner fuels and reduced vehicle emissions. The measures contained in this bill will help the government stamp out unscrupulous dealers who illegally supply substandard fuels to Australian motorists, in breach of national fuel quality standards. The act currently allows for approval of the variation of fuel standards and the imposition of conditions on the approval. However, such conditions must relate to the supply of fuel. The bill will broaden the scope of the conditions that can be applied to approvals to vary fuel standards. This will allow for a company that has just been granted an approval to be required to take measures to offset the adverse impacts of any supply of substandard fuel. The approvals process has also been streamlined in relation to variations of a minor nature and for the addition to the approval of other suppliers, who are referred to as ‘regulated persons’ under the act. The bill will allow for these sorts of minor decisions to be made by senior departmental officers. A key feature of the bill is the introduction of the power to grant approvals in emergency situations to avoid a potential fuel supply shortfall without having to consult the Fuel Standards Consultative Committee. In these circumstances, where time is very limited before the threat of the fuel supply shortfall is realised, the committee need only be notified of the decision. An emergency approval can only apply for 14 days, after which the committee must be consulted on any proposed extension of the approval. The bill will also allow the circumstances in which fuel is supplied to be included as part of the fuel standard. This provision will allow the inclusion or exclusion of certain end uses, where appropriate, from the application of fuel standards, and it will assist in addressing issues relating to the complexity of defining fuels used for different purposes and the management of blends. This is particularly important for biofuels, where different blend ratios with petroleum fuels will MAIN COMMITTEE",158,Constituency Statements

This change will allow for fuel standards to be set for fuels blended with biofuels such as biodiesel and ethanol at different percentages and for clarification in the blend standard of the types of vehicles the fuel is suitable for. The bill will introduce a more comprehensive range of enforcement measures, including a civil penalties regime, so that there will be for each criminal offence currently in the act an equivalent civil penalty provision. Other enforcement measures include the ability to issue an infringement notice and, if appropriate, accept an enforceable undertaking. These measures will ensure that appropriate action can be taken in respect of breaches of the act. The bill will allow inspectors to enter the public area of business premises during normal hours of operation and exercise a limited range of monitoring powers without the consent of the retailer or without a warrant. Entry to other areas of a business premises or entry outside normal business hours will, as currently applies, require the consent of the retailer or a warrant. The bill will expand current information-sharing powers to allow the secretary to share information obtained under the act to assist in the administration or enforcement of various laws-for example, the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Act 2004 and the state and territory fair trading laws. This will facilitate communication with other regulators to increase the intelligence base on potential offenders. It will also assist in addressing gaps in the act’s coverage of the industry. There is only one new offence in the bill. As a consequence of the addition of a civil penalties regime in the act, a new section 65D provides that the secretary can require a person, other than the person who is suspected of contravening a civil penalty provision, who may have information relevant to an application for a civil penalty order to provide all reasonable assistance in connection with the application. An offence applies for failure to give assistance as required. The act, as currently written, is difficult to enforce. This bill will make the legislation much more robust to ensure that the quality of fuel supplied in Australia is of the high standard required for new advanced engine technology in vehicles. This will be important to enable us to respond to new fuels and vehicle technologies as they emerge. In closing, let me make clear that this bill will help to stamp out dodgy dealers who supply substandard petrol to consumers and will give Australian motorists confidence that the fuel they are paying for is of the high standard they expect. I commend the bill. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced.

Certainly I am not opposing this legislation. In fact, I think it is timely and well overdue for a number of reaMAIN COMMITTEE",164,Constituency Statements
271,Mr Oakeshott (Lyne) (10.33 Am),"The purpose of the Therapeutic Goods Amendsons. The amendment allows certain goods on the register to be suspended in certain circumstances-and I will come back to that. It amends the manufacturing licences. It amends monitoring powers to allow the taking of samples of therapeutic goods-and I will also come back to that. It amends arrangements for complementary medicines. It enables the making of lists of permitted and prohibited ingredients in listed medicines, clarifies arrangements for conditions of listing goods and makes some technical corrections to references to reflect changes in terminology. I make just three very brief points. The first is that I hope this bill reflects some growing interest from the government in the growing desire of community members to explore a range of options with regard to treatment of their own health and wellness. I am noticing at home that, whilst there is certainly a commitment to traditional Western medicines, there is a growing interest and desire to complement those Western techniques with a whole variety of options for personal treatment regarding wellness. Whether they are Eastern medicines, the various complementary medicines or the homeopathic options, a whole range of desires and considerations are becoming more and more prominent. For the government to respond to thatand I hope this bill is part of a response to that I think is a positive thing in reflecting the needs and wants of the broader community. I hope this bill also starts to capture the hawking of the snake oil-for want of a better term-that we see far too often in communities such as mine. I am sure that every local member has experienced various products coming into their local communities being sold in various pyramid schemes. One person wins substantially out of the marketing and selling of that product, claiming that it is going to improve the health and well-being of everyone in that community, and within a year they are out of town. They might have got a new car, and a lot of people are left with a lot of debt in the community for the longer term. We have experienced that on the mid-North Coast on several occasions. Hopefully, if this bill is reflecting the government wanting to start to capture, monitor and control that process in a better way, and really define the boundaries of what is acceptable and what is not acceptable as a product on the market, then good work has been done by the government in putting this bill forward. Thirdly, and probably at the sexier end of the spectrum, in the hawking of product and snake oil, there has been standout debate about various billboards in various communities as to what products can and cannot deliver. Once again, I hope this bill starts to shape some of those debates in a more controlled, managed and sensible way. It might also help in some community advertising standards being reached which reflect the wants and needs of the community better and reflect the wants and needs of government better. There are some pretty confronting billboards. I am no prude, but I think we can do better than having snake oil promoted on billboards, regardless of the product, challenging community standards in the way things are marketed in the marketplace. I support the bill. I think I am the only speaker on this side, so we can assume the opposition generally supports this bill. I certainly hope this bill, by being put before the House, does the work that is desired and I hope it does what it is trying to achieve. Ms HALL (Shortland) (10.38 am)-In my contribution on the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2009 Measures No. 1) Bill 2009 I would like to start where the previous member, the member for Lyne, finished on the matter of billboards-and I think I know the billboards that he is referring to. They relate to the treatment of impotence. The House of RepreMAIN COMMITTEE sentatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing will actually be looking at the claims surrounding that issue in a short and sharp inquiry that is going to take place in the very near future. I thought the member might be interested to know that, because it has been an issue of great concern to a number of members on that committee. The committee has had a presentation given to it. I have actually written to the New South Wales Minister for Health, who has advised me that the Health Care Complaints Commission conducted an inquiry into the matter in 1998 and it is currently with the Office of Fair Trading in New South Wales. As the member rightly pointed out, we need a whole-of-Australia approach to the issue, not just in New South Wales. I thought I would just put that on the record as a matter of interest. Madam Deputy Speaker, I apologise for straying from the legislation that we are debating today, but I feel that to be vitally important. In effect, it does refer to this legislation because, like the previous speaker, I hope that it is captured by this legislation. The bill amends the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 to provide for medicines to be suspended from the register. It amends manufacturing licence arrangements and enables variation and transfer of licenses. It enhances monitoring powers, establishes a framework for the regulation of homoeopathic medicines and enables the minister to determine lists of permitted and prohibited ingredients. It clarifies that instruments in the act come under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 and it makes other amendments to improve and clarify the operation of the act. Currently medicines are treated differently from therapeutic goods. Therapeutic goods can be suspended from the list, but this legislation enables medicines to be suspended. As I mentioned, medical devices can be suspended already. This bill amends the manufacturing licences, enables variation and transfer of licences and enhances monitoring. The previous speaker mentioned an issue that relates to homeopathic and alternative medicines. Back in 2003 there was a very newsworthy investigation into some of the practices. At that time there was a rethink about the way these goods were handled. This legislation has been prepared in consultation with the industry, but I hope it will pick up on some of those goods being sold with claims that misrepresent what they can and cannot do. I have had quite a bit of contact with people within my community on this. The member for Paterson, who I see has joined me, may have had some contact with people in the Hunter, too, in relation to some of the treatments and remedies that have been promoted within our community. This legislation, I believe, will put in place some control and will enable the suspension of those medications promoted as being able to treat a certain illness or deliver some remedy that they in fact cannot. It is also important to note that at the moment it is very, very difficult to have medicines removed from the list. This legislation will enable that to happen very quickly. It will streamline the process and overall it will ensure that goods-both homeopathic medicines and medicines generally-that are presented for sale within our communities are safe and deliver what it is said they will deliver. As has been noted by all speakers on this legislation, it is non-controversial. There would not be a member in this parliament who would not support it, and I have great pleasure in supporting it. I was pleased to be able to provide that extra information on impotence treatments. Ms McKEW (Bennelong-Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Education and Childcare) (10.45 am)-In summing up, as mentioned in the second reading speech, the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2009 Measures No. 1) Bill 2009 amends the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 in a number of ways. Firstly, it incorporates into the act provisions allowing MAIN COMMITTEE medicines to be suspended from the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods where there are safety concerns but where it is expected that these can be corrected in a short period of time. The suspension provisions are based on similar provisions allowing medical devices to be suspended which were added to the act in 2002. For the duration of the suspension, the medicine cannot be supplied. If the concerns about the medicine’s safety extend to batches that may have already been supplied to the public, these will be able to be recalled under the new provisions. Currently, where there are safety concerns with the medicine, the only option available is to cancel the medicine from the register and then, once the safety concerns have been addressed, the sponsor must apply to have the medicine relisted or to re-register and pay the relevant fees. This clearly is inefficient and costly. The amendments in schedule 1 will address this. The second set of changes relate to manufacturing licences. Presently, a licence can be issued to cover more than one site, and the name of the licence holder, the manufacturing steps approved to be undertaken and the sites covered are not specified on the licence. Further, licences cannot be varied or transferred to another manufacturer. Schedule2 will address these issues by providing that licences can only cover one site except in limited circumstances, which are to be set out in guidelines. Such circumstances would include where two sites are located adjacent to each other and are jointly involved in the manufacture of the same therapeutic good. The amendments in this schedule will also require that manufacturing licences specify the details of the licence holder and what is approved by the licence. This schedule will also enable licence holders to apply to vary their manufacturing licence and will provide for regulations to be made setting out a process for transferring a licence to another manufacturer. The bill also enhances existing monitoring powers in the act for authorised officers to enter and inspect premises and to take samples to assess the safety and quality of therapeutic goods and the processes in manufacturing and dealing with these goods. The powers currently do not enable samples to be taken of related material such as ingredients used in manufacturing medicine, although the quality of these ingredients is directly related to the quality of the final product. The powers are also limited to inspecting those therapeutic goods expected to be on the premises-for example, those that the site is licensed to manufacture-although other potentially unauthorised therapeutic goods may be found on premises. Currently, the act does not enable authorised officers to take samples of these other goods. So the amendments in this schedule address these problems to ensure monitoring for safety and quality can occur in full at all sites handling therapeutic goods. Further to this, the amendments will update the references in the act to replace references to still images or sketches with references to still or moving images or recordings, to allow, for example, video recording of manufacturing equipment in operation. Schedule4 of the bill includes a new framework for the regulation of homoeopathic and anthroposophic medicines. Currently, many of these medicines are exempt from the requirements of the act to be included in the register and meet manufacturing requirements. The bill now provides a framework for the regulation of these medicines and, in doing so, it implements the 2003 recommendations of the Expert Committee on Complementary Medicines in the Health System that these products be regulated. MAIN COMMITTEE The framework in the bill will provide for standards to be set by reference to the relevant pharmacopoeia. The new framework will commence in July 2011 to allow time for this industry sector to prepare to comply with the requirements and to ensure further consultation can occur to inform the necessary changes to the regulations to give effect to the details of the framework. Schedule5 of the bill enables the minister to determine in a legislative instrument the ingredients that are permitted and those that are prohibited from being included in listed medicines. Applications to list a new medicine for supply in Australia must certify that the medicine contains only permitted ingredients and no prohibited ingredients while the secretary, in considering an application to list a medicine for export, must have regard to its compliance with the lists. A person can apply for an ingredient to be included in the permitted ingredients list and the minister must consider the application. All decisions regarding the ingredients to be included on the lists will be made by the minister based upon advice from the TGA, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, and its expert advisory committees. Schedule6 makes amendments to references in the act to orders published in the Gazette and to disallowable instruments to clarify that these are legislative instruments for the purposes of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. Finally, schedule 7 makes a number of miscellaneous amendments to improve and clarify the operation of the act. Most significantly, this schedule provides for new, more transparent arrangements for the setting of conditions on therapeutic goods. The amendments will enable the minister to determine by legislative instrument the standard conditions that are to apply to categories of medicines. Alongside these standard conditions the secretary will continue to be able to set specific conditions on particular medicines included in the register. The amendments also establish in the act two specific conditions that will be applicable to all registered and listed medicines. These are to require that medicines not be exported or supplied after the expiry date for the medicine and that medicines cannot be advertised for any purpose other than that which was accepted for the registration or listing of the medicine. The final schedule also clarifies that decisions of the secretary, such as for applications to list medicines and low-level medical devices, can be made by computer software. The secretary will retain the power to substitute a decision of her own within 60 days of the computer program decision. The bill also strengthens safety and quality scrutiny for listed medicines manufactured overseas. Although the act requires sponsors seeking listing of a medicine that is manufactured overseas to receive confirmation from the secretary that the manufacturing processes are acceptable, similar certification requirements have not been required for medicines whose manufacturer has been moved from a previously approved Australian or overseas manufacturer to an overseas manufacturer. Although sponsors of these medicines must advise the TGA of the manufacturing move once it has occurred, and the TGA then reviews the quality of the overseas manufacturer, prior certification is not currently required under the act. So the amendments in schedule 7 will address this discrepancy and require that, as a condition of listing medicines that are manufactured overseas, the sponsor must receive certification from the secretary that the manufacturMAIN COMMITTEE ing and quality control procedures are acceptable before the medicine’s manufacturer can be moved. This will ensure that the quality and safety of those medicines are maintained. The government intends to make further amendments to the regulatory regime for therapeutic goods later in the year. In particular, the changes will provide for a new framework for the regulation of human cellular and tissue based therapy products, also known as biologicals, which have to be implemented under the joint Australia New Zealand Therapeutic Products Authority. New arrangements for the separate scheduling of medicines and poisons will also be introduced. Finally, Australia has been well served by the TGA, and it is important that the regulatory regime that the TGA implements is kept up to date so that the authority and the industry it regulates can operate as efficiently as possible and so that, most importantly, Australian consumers can continue to have timely access to safe and effective therapeutic goods. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 18 March, on motion by Mr Snowdon: That this bill be now read a second time. Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2009. This bill is in two parts. The first part concentrates on the establishment of a discretionary tactical payment scheme, and it is critically important, as our troops operate in the Middle East environment and indeed in other areas, that we move away from an act of grace payment to empowering people actually at the battle face to be able to make compensatory payments to people where damage has occurred. One of the simple lessons in life, which goes back to time immemorial in engaging with the enemy, is that there will often be collateral damage to assets, to individuals and to livestock. If we are to win this offensive against terrorism in Afghanistan, or indeed in other areas that may or may not eventuate out of our engagement when addressing terrorism, we need to empower people on the ground to take immediate action to address losses. This bill is long overdue. In America they operate under two systems of payments. Firstly, they have a condolence payment, which is an expression of sympathy for death, injury or property damage caused by coalition or US forces generally during combat. In addition, at the commander’s discretion, payments may be made to civilians who are harmed by enemy action when working with the US forces. But, importantly, payment is not an admission of legal liability or fault. Secondly, a solatia payment, which is a token or nominal payment for death, injury or property damage caused by coalition or US forces during combat, is made in accordance with local custom as an expression of remorse or sympathy towards a victim or his or her family. Again, payment is not an admission of legal liability or fault. Perhaps the key and critical argument in establishing this tactical payment system is that we address the issue in rapid time. This means that payment can be authorised by the minister MAIN COMMITTEE",165,Therapeutic Goods Amendment 2009 Measures No 1 Bill 2009
272,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (10.54 Am),"I rise today to speak on the Defence Legislationthrough delegated approval to the Secretary of the Department of Defence, the Chief of Defence Force, a military officer in command of an activity of the Defence Force outside Australia, and that officer in command of a deployed force will vary depending on the size of the operation-that officer may be a lieutenant colonel or equivalent or higher-or an APS employee who holds or performs the duties of an APS6 or higher, and is intended for those who have been deployed on an overseas operation as the policy officer to the officer in command of an activity outside Australia. The reality is that in Afghanistan at the moment, and in some of the offensives we are taking against terrorism in protecting freedoms and democracies and getting rid of this scourge on the earth, collateral damage is occurring. Sometimes that collateral damage is to a building or it could be to animals and livestock. Sadly, and unfortunately, it could also relate to an individual’s life. The ability to immediately make a compensation payment to that person can address a lot of the grieving, particularly when a household farm, equipment or livestock have been damaged. We are not talking about massive amounts of money. This legislation will set in place a payment with a set limit of $250,000. Normally, in areas of operation through the Middle East, I am informed these payments would max out generally around $1,500. We are not talking about large sums of money being carried around by soldiers buying their way out of trouble; we are talking about a genuine attempt to mitigate the damage at a local level, to try to keep a semblance of peace, so we are engaged against the terrorist enemy and not against the people who have suffered collateral damage. I think that is critically important. I know the US military have a very different system from that which we have in Australia, but we can take from their experiences. Their US forces manual, through the United States Government Accountability Office, is quoted in the Bills Digest as follows: The new US. Army Field Manual on Counterinsurgency greatly stresses the importance of winning civilians’ hearts and minds. To win hearts and minds, militaries must take a holistic approach to rebuilding a nation after war by providing infrastructure, governance, safety and well-being. Failure in these components may prevent lasting victory. It goes on to say: … positive treatment of civilians becomes imperative to strategic military interests. While building a school or hospital may help the military “win over” a community, providing individual monetary assistance to a family who lost a breadwinner during a firefight can “win over” a family and a neighborhood. WhatI am saying is that the opposition will support this initiative by the government because we see it as a way of winning the war, particularly in Afghanistan. There have been many, from the Russians through to Alexander the Great, who have tried to establish authority in Afghanistan. Each has had varying degrees of success and some have had massive failure. But it is true that the only way to win this war on terrorism is to win the hearts and minds of the people of Afghanistan. You cannot do that if you take away their breadwinner accidentally; you cannot do that if you destroy their livestock without some form of compensation. This goes a way towards addressing that. What is key but is also missing in this is that, previously, acts of grace payments have been reported as part of the Defence annual report in a quantum. I am foreshadowing that the coalition will be moving an amendment in the Senate that will see a reporting structure to the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security and will require a full list of tactical payMAIN COMMITTEE ments made in the preceding year. We see that as one way of achieving transparency in order to understand the quantum of the payments. The other thing that I note in the explanatory memorandum is that it says there will be no financial impact from this bill. There is not much point in having a tactical payment system whereby you are going to make remediation for damage that has occurred or loss of life if you are not going to pay out money-introducing this scheme and establishing such a structure that is not going to be used. The whole idea of establishing this tactical payment scheme is to take away from the onerous reporting and paperwork in relation to the acts of grace payment scheme and expedite it. So what we see is that there will be a financial impact. If it brings about a closer resolution to the war on terrorism by taking the people of Afghanistan on the journey with us-which is an often used term-then there will be an impact. But that is not the issue. It is just that in the explanatory memorandum there is the claim that there will be no financial impact from this bill, and that is quite misleading. We will be moving that amendment in the Senate. The government now has the opportunity to think through how it will report back and perhaps cooperate with the opposition. The government, as proven by having to have amendment bills, particularly for the home ownership scheme, has shown they are not the oracle of knowledge when it comes to all things good and great. Some of these things are reached by consensus and exploring each other’s ideas on the way to address situations. As I said, we support this tactical payment system because we have our men and women on the ground defending freedoms and democracies. In fact, tomorrow in Townsville, at 3rd Brigade, Lavarack Barracks, the Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force will be deploying to Middle East areas of operations. Our prayers and wishes go with them-first and foremost, to look after their safety, but also to wish them well on their missions in re-establishing the community, working with the community and working with the Afghan nationals in developing their strength so that they can address the issues in relation to terrorism and start to take control of their own destiny. People need to live freely. Freedom and democracy is perhaps one of the most valuable and most cherished things that we have in this world that we live in. I would also say to the House that we need to make sure that in allowing the tactical payment system to go ahead we have checks and balances in place-that it is not carte blanche. I respect our officers on the ground that will actually be making these decisions and I hope that they do not get too caught up in paperwork that it delays the process. As I said right at the very beginning, the key effectiveness of this measure is the immediacy of resolution-that a person in a patrol has the financial ability and the delegated authority to address this issue, make the compensatory repayment and thus take most of the heat out of the problem. Of course, in the case of the loss of a loved one, as we know in our own lives, healing takes a long time. But when it is something like a barn, a tractor, some pigs, sheep, cattle, goats or other livestock, whatever it may be, they can be bought down at the market with the financial compensation package. The second part of this bill addresses issues in relation to the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme. It was last year that this bill was brought to the parliament, and it arose from coalition policy as a means of increasing retention in defence. It came into effect on 1 July 2008, so it has been in operation for not quite a year, and we do not yet know the full effectiveness of the measure as a retention scheme. We do know that listed in the budget papers this week are some facts and figures, and I note that in the net costs of providing the subMAIN COMMITTEE sidy, after expenses and revenues, the amount apportioned for 2009-10 is $28,929,000 and that in the forward estimates for 2010-11 it is expected to be $45,336,000; for 2011-12 it is expected to be $43,972,000; and for 2012-13 it is expected to be $63,123,000. I do foreshadow for the minister that we will be putting questions on notice to determine how many loans have been provided; to look at its effects, whether there is a correlation with the retention benefit; but also, importantly, to find out what the level of interest rate subsidy on an individual basis has been for that year. The key measure in all of this is to provide an effective means of support to the men and women of our defence forces, but there are unintentional anomalies in this scheme, and that is what this amendment seeks to address. I think that ‘unintentional anomalies’ is political code for ‘I didn’t think through the legislation properly in the first place.’ The aim of this amendment is to address the period of break in service and make sure that it is actually utilised as a retention bonus. There is a lock-off period of five years-so, if you leave the Defence Force for more than five years and then come back, your service preceding those five years does not count towards achieving this home loan subsidy. That is important at a time when we need to keep critical skills and trades in the Defence Force. Whilst it is good at times for people to move out into other areas of industry to gain new skills or further enhance their skills and education, people being away for more than five years is actually a massive loss to defence because when they come back they need to get reoriented. As the explanatory memorandum states, the purposes of this bill are to: remove an unintended windfall gain in the eligibility and entitlement of members who rejoined the ADF after a break in service prior to 1 July 2008; provide greater reliability of the subsidy certificate as evidence to a home loan provider that subsidy is payable to a member by making the issue of a subsidy certificate conditional on a member having a service credit in the scheme; ensure that only serving members who are buying a home for the first time have access to the subsidy lump sum payment option; require that for lump sum subsidy to become payable in respect of an interest in land, the property must have been purchased subsequent to the giving of the subsidy certificate that is the basis for the lump sum requested; clarify that subsidy may be payable either as a monthly payment or as a lump sum payment and monthly payment, and ensure that members who access the subsidy lump sum payment option retain sufficient service credit in the scheme to support on-going monthly subsidy payments; ensure that the entitlement of subsidised borrowers who enter into a joint mortgage with a person who is not defined as a partner in the Act, is proportional to the subsidised borrowers’ liability; clarify the entitlements of subsidised borrowers who are partners and who are both parties in respect of the same loan, in order to provide for a consistent framework for shared liability … This scheme was well thought out in the essence of its proposal, and there was an extended period for the establishment of the legislation. There was a period for a tender process where financial institutions put forward their best cases. Thinking back to when this bill was first debated last year, I was reading it and going over some points and I went back to the Hansard of my contribution to the original second reading debate on the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme Bill 2008 and its consequential amendments bill. At the time, I highlighted how the government had sat on the bill for some time and then sought to introduce MAIN COMMITTEE that bill in a great flurry prior to 1 July 2008 so the time for the scrutiny and proper examination of the bill was very much truncated. I had a bit to say on the bill and I would like to go back to what I said in Hansard, which proved that the minister had rushed it. I said: The government have been tardy in their management of this legislation’s process. I note, for example, a letter addressed to me from the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel seeking the coalition’s consent for the signing of contracts to allow the successful tenderers at least eight weeks to transition prior to the 1 July 2008 implementation date. This letter was dated 21 April. The final paragraph of that correspondence says: Should you have any comment on the proposal I would be grateful if you could provide it to me by 17th April 2008 as Defence needs to sign the contracts in the week commencing 21st April 2008. That letter was not even stamped or posted to me until after the contracts had to be signed. So in these great rushes we are seeing unintended consequences, and one of them is being addressed today. I also note that basically three loan providers were successful in providing these loans: the National Australia Bank, the Australian Defence Credit Union and the Defence Force Credit Union. They are doing a good job. They are supporting our service men and women, and that is critical. But, as I said, we need to ascertain the total effectiveness of this package in relation to retention, which is what it was initially all about, because prior to this there was just the defence home loan. It was not competitive in modern times. It did not provide great incentives, but we believe this does. But it also must remain current and it must look to variations in the cost of mortgages, fluctuations in interest rates and how they affect people-whether people are locked in at an interest rate or whether they have a variable rate. It must address all of those concerns. I dare say that in the coming 12 months we will probably see more amendments to this act, but I hope they are amendments based on need and not based on unintended consequences and a lack of forensic examination by the government of its own bills that it puts forward. As I said, we will be supporting this bill, with the exception that in the Senate we will be moving an amendment to make sure in particular that part of the tactical payment system is referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for forensic examination by that committee. I commend this bill to the House. Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2009. This bill has two parts. The first part deals with unfortunate happenings overseas in places like Iraq, Afghanistan and Timor in which our men and women in the military might be involved and other spheres of military activity Australia may engage in in the future. The second aspect deals with defence home ownership and assistance given to men and women who served in the military, in the reserves and in the permanent forces. As someone whose electorate contains the RAAF base at Amberley, I am keenly interested in issues of defence and particularly in how we can help the men and women who serve our country both overseas and domestically and protect our shores-whether in the air, on land or by sea. The RAAF base at Amberley has 9FSB as well, an Army battalion, but also is getting another construction battalion as the base continues to expand. These types of things are very important to my constituents, and that is why I am pleased to speak on them. The first aspect of the bill deals with the Defence Act 1903 and introduces a discretionary tactical payment scheme, TPS, to provide a new mechanism for making timely or expeditious MAIN COMMITTEE",170,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2009
273,Mr Neumann (Blair) (11.14 Am),"I rise to speak in support of the Defence Legislationno-liability payments to persons adversely affected by Australian Defence Force operations outside of Australia. We have, in Australian law systems of no liability, compensation in WorkCover and workers compensation and ex gratia payments in circumstances where people have been victims of crime. So it is common in Australian law for people to receive payments where they suffer injury, illness or damage in circumstances where there is no actual liability admitted or agreed to in the circumstances. The concept of a no-liability payment is not at all foreign to Australian law. As someone who has practised as a litigation lawyer, particularly in areas of personal injuries and crime, I am familiar with these types of compensation. Many times I have stood before medical tribunals on workers compensation matters and argued cases in relation to matters where people were injured at work. I am familiar with that. I am very pleased the government has done this. Our men and women in Afghanistan and other places are fighting to protect our rights and our liberties. The challenges our forces face against Islamic fascism in places like Afghanistan are incalculable; the challenges are dreadful and they put their lives on the line all the time. We saw 20 million Russians killed in World War II. Many were civilians who were innocent of any involvement in communism, fascism or any kind of activity at all. They were killed in those circumstances. In Vietnam many men and women were injured through no fault of their own; they were entirely innocent of the events. There are things that happen which are totally unintended. They are tragic to the families. They might destroy an individual’s livelihood; they might destroy the capacity of an individual to live the kind of functional life that we accept as normal. Particularly in Third World countries, damage to property or injury where there is not a compensation scheme and not the medical treatment and help that we in a First World country think is appropriate is devastating to the lives of families. In a lot of cultures there is an expectation that there be some form of compensation, and I think that is appropriate in the circumstances. If you want to build relationships with local communities, you really need to ensure that there is safety and security for our ADF personnel, and we need to make sure that we build those relationships by acting in an honourable, dignified and fair and just way. Making small, timely and expeditious capped payments is a good way in the circumstances to ensure there is trust and amity between our forces overseas and the residents of those countries. Relying on act of grace payments is not the way to go, and in the past there have been criticisms of Australia’s position on this matter. We have not made the kinds of condolence and other ex gratia payments that the Americans have, and I know comments on this matter have been made by very senior members of the military and other interested parties. We have relied on section 33 of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997, which provides a legislative basis for an act of grace payment where the finance minister considers it appropriate to do so because of special circumstances. In 2007-08, three act of grace payments were made totalling just over $81,000. The amount for the previous year totalled nearly $200,000, when 14 payments were made. It really beggars belief that there were not other circumstances where people should have been compensated. The capacity to determine who should receive payments on the ground and at a lower level would be the way to go, and I am pleased that we are doing this. But we need to have some degree of consistency in the decision making. In the area of compensation, if you injure your arm or your leg or acquire some sort of illness or injury, there is a degree of jurisprudence or commonality in how much is paid, because it is set out in regulations. Every case is different-every case for every indiMAIN COMMITTEE vidual and every circumstance is different; every culture in every country is different. I would like to think that we could have some degree of consistency so that, if it was a particularly poor country, we would provide the people in that country with a fair and equitable payment in the circumstances. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, the Hon. Warren Snowdon, in his second reading speech on 18 March 2009 said: In many areas in which the ADF operates, the expectation of financial compensation for collateral damage to property, injury or loss of life is often a common aspect of local cultures. … … … … experience in East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan has shown that the administrative requirements involved in making an act of grace claim make that system unsuitable for use in operational environments. I say amen to that-he is absolutely correct in the circumstances. Anyone who does not receive payment in a timely way can suffer aggravated injury, illness or loss of property. Someone’s livelihood could depend on a certain tractor, implement or shop or whatever. If that was damaged and the person did not receive a payment, their economic loss might be aggravated. This is good legislation and I think it will help our men and women serving overseas. I think it is the right and honourable thing to do as a country, in the circumstances, to provide for our neighbours. If we are to be good Samaritans, if we are to care for our fellow human beings who inhabit this planet, we have to do the right thing by them as well. I think in the circumstances we need to do this, and I am pleased the government have chosen to do so. The second aspect of this bill deals with the men and women who serve in the military, particularly in the bases across Australia, whether in Townsville, Darwin, Ipswich or wherever. In my electorate, the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme has been warmly welcomed by the men and women who serve at RAAF Base Amberley. I spoke to many of them when I did my parliamentary service last year at Amberley-I spoke to hundreds of them at that time. Many of them shop in places like the Yamanto shopping centre, where I have a mobile office on a regular basis. Many of them live in Flinders View, a suburb of Ipswich, where I live. Providing household assistance is really important. These people live in what I would describe as middle-class suburbs in Ipswich. We have provided better housing for them. It is tragic that in decades past they were provided with what I would describe as appalling kinds of residences. They were not treated with the respect I think they deserved. Some of the women to whom I have spoken who followed their husbands and partners around Australia had to live in appalling accommodation. Governments of both sides have tried to show a degree of concern for the families of defence personnel, and I think that is good. I think it is the right thing to do in all the circumstances. In my electorate, we are providing tremendous housing for our military families. For example, as part of the defence housing initiative in the recent Nation Building and Jobs Plan, 133 new houses have been built in Ipswich at a cost of $36.3 million. That is tremendous for the local people. Many of these houses are not far from where I live. I was talking to the men and women of RAAF Base Amberley, and they commended the government for the home loan subsidy scheme for eligible ADF members. It is a major initiative of the Rudd government to recruit new people and retain our men and women in the military. I had the privilege, on the first day I was doing the parliamentary program last year, to MAIN COMMITTEE meet a fellow who told me, as we were in the back of a C17 plane, that in fact that was the reason he was staying in the military-to get the assistance, because it helped him with the house he owned in Ipswich. I thought it was fantastic that, on the first day I was there, I spoke to someone who said that to me. The assistance is quite considerable. The subsidy at tier 1 is up to $203 a month, going up to a maximum subsidy of $406 a month at tier 3. That is a lot of money in anyone’s language. Certainly that goes a long way to helping the men and women of our military to provide suitable accommodation for themselves and their families, particularly their children. We know that, if our children do not grow up in an environment where they feel that they can honour the property in which they live, they tend to not respect it. We see that commonly in our society. So this is a good way to treat our military families with respect and dignity. But there have been some unintended consequences. The legislation here seeks to remove a windfall gain and assist in the promotion of retention and recruitment. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel said in his speech on 18 March 2009 that the take-up in relation to the defence housing initiative of the Rudd government has been quite extraordinary. As at 28 February 2009, the scheme administrator, the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, had issued 11,255 subsidy certificates to eligible ADF members. Of these ADF members, 5,197 had commenced receipt of the subsidy assistance in taking up a mortgage provided by a member of the home loan provider panel. The ADF member feedback indicates the scheme is having a positive influence on retention. Certainly anecdotally in Ipswich that has been my experience as well. Some changes were needed to improve the eligibility and entitlement of members who rejoined the ADF after a break in service prior to 1 July 2008. The measure will ensure that members who rejoined the ADF prior to 1 July 2008 are provided with the same eligibility and entitlement as those who rejoin after that date. The member for Paterson went through these changes in detail and, in the circumstances, I do not wish to go through them again. He has already adequately outlined them. I do say this: it is important to get this thing right so that only those who are eligible are entitled and so that this measure really acts as a stimulus, a catalyst, for recruitment and retention. I commend the minister for fixing this anomaly. This help for our military people in Blair is a consequence of our commitment to their families as well. Financial assistance is important. The kind of environment they have at home should be replicated in the kind of environment they work in every day. SoI am pleased that the government has taken positive steps to respond to the white paper. We are receiving assistance in terms of new planes at RAAF Base Amberley. The Hornets are coming. We announced that last year. The F111s are retiring, after 40 years of service. They are nicknamed the ‘flying pigs’ and are much loved by the people in my electorate. It is sad they are going, but they have served our country well, and the personnel there have been part of our community for decades. We look forward to the Super Hornets coming to Amberley, of course. Defence was a big winner, and the people in Blair will likely receive considerable assistance. The RAAF base at Amberley, which I have mentioned before, is the workplace for the people who use the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme, and we are seeing a major upgrade as a result of the budget announcements. We saw announced in Queensland $536.7 million in defence infrastructure. We announced $60 million in my electorate for work on the $331.5 million RAAF Base Amberley Redevelopment Stage3 project, and I am very pleased MAIN COMMITTEE about that. It will provide trainee facilities, live-in accommodation, medical and working accommodation, maintenance facilities, a fuel farm and upgraded base security. Key facilities will be completed progressively from 2010 to 2011. That is where the people who enjoy the benefits of this scheme will work. I see the member for Herbert is here. The RAAF base at Amberley will be the biggest base in the country as a result of the redevelopment, but Townsville will also receive money. I am pleased to say the Rudd government has provided assistance to Townsville. I will outline that to him in case he wants to know. There will be $18 million in 2009-10 for the RAAF base at Amberley and RAAF Base Townsville for the $268.2 million Heavy Airlift Capability Permanent Facilities project. We are providing assistance across the whole country, regardless of the electorate in which the military base is located, because we think this is necessary to provide infrastructure to places like Townsville, Edinburgh, Darwin, Pearce and others. In the circumstances, the government is strongly committed to the military. We have guaranteed defence spending in the future. We believe strongly that our defence challenges are significant. We live in an area where there is substantial instability. The defence white paper delivered recently gave us a great challenge and a great reminder of the need to fund the military adequately and appropriately and also the need to look at savings across the decade. It is important that we deliver about $20 billion in savings across that time, and we need to reinvest our thinking and our funding into defence programs and capability acquisitions that will enhance our capacity as an island continent. Certainly the Navy will be the big winner as a result of the white paper and our government’s response, but the aircraft that we are going to deliver to our RAAF bases and personnel will also make a big difference to our defence capability. We spend enormous amounts of money on the military, and so we should in the circumstances. We are a middle power. Our men and women should have the kind of equipment that will enable them to do their tasks well and efficiently wherever they are assigned by the government of the day, and their families at home should be looked after in terms of defence housing, ownership, financial support and medical support. In all those circumstances, I commend these initiatives to the House, and I thank the government for their commitment to the defence of Australia, both nationally and locally in my electorate of Blair in South-East Queensland. put some things on the public record which both he and I will agree on. Both of us are very proud of the men and women of the Australian Defence Force in our electorate. We both have very significant defence installations in our electorates. Both of us have both Army and Air Force elements in our electorate, but the ratio in Townsville is the reverse of Ipswich. In relation to the scale of things, Amberley is quite small compared to Townsville. There may be something in the order of 2½ thousand people at Amberley-perhaps a few more-but there are 6,000 in Townsville. Townsville will remain the pre-eminent military base in the country, and long may that be the case-particularly as we are about to grow even bigger with the arrival of the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, which is being transferred from Holsworthy up to 3rd Brigade in Townsville. They are already commanded by 3rd Brigade, but they will now be co-located with 3rd Brigade headquarters in the city. That will mean even more defence homes, which the Rudd government has funded in Townsville. These would MAIN COMMITTEE",174,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2009
274,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (11.34 Am),"Before the member for Blair leaves, I think I need to have been funded under a coalition government, because all of that was locked in. It will also mean a further upgrade of the RAAF base. Of course, we are also upgrading the port. In the budget this year there is an amount of about $30 million to upgrade the Townsville port so that we can have the new LHD ships dock in Townsville. They are just humongous ships. Of course, their customer is the 3rd Brigade, so when 3rd Brigade deploys in the marine environment it will go on the LHDs when they are built. I should also advise the parliament that tomorrow there will be a major parade in Townsville. Nine hundred and ten soldiers will be on parade. Just being a bit parochial, I do not think RAAF Amberley could put 910 airmen on parade in one go. Certainly in Townsville we can put 910 soldiers on parade. The Minister for Defence and I will be attending that parade tomorrow to honour our soldiers who are being deployed to Afghanistan. Of course, that introduces the connection to the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2009 before the parliament today: the soldiers who go to Afghanistan will face the issue that part of this bill seeks to address, which is the tactical payments scheme. For example, we look at Afghanistan and ask: ‘What is the solution to that ugly war? What is going to solve it?’ The answer in the long term is winning over the hearts and minds of the Afghanis. It is not whether your gun is bigger than somebody else’s gun or whether you can kill more people than somebody else; it is whether you carry the people of the country with you. There are a whole range of mechanisms by which you can address that particular issue. Our Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force is very important in addressing that issue. Our training teams are very important in looking after the Afghanis. Of course, our special forces are very important in making sure that the bad guys are effectively dealt with. But in some of those operations there are unintended consequences. People’s homes and businesses can be affected by the war. It may be accidental. The lives of civilians can be lost; families can lose a loved one. Interestingly, in a place like Afghanistan, losing an animal may, in fact, be more devastating than losing a relative. Camels can have a higher value than a human in some of these places. But the point is that, if the ADF is empowered to immediately be able to redress those kinds of issues, we do not lose the hearts and minds of the local population. Yes, it is traumatic if they lose their home through demolition by a bomb blast, a rocket that does not go in the right direction or for whatever reason. Yes, it is traumatic if they lose a loved one. But in part we can compensate for that, and the quicker we can do it the better. That is why the coalition certainly supports the government’s initiative to empower people of lieutenant colonel rank and above to authorise the payment of compensation in theatre, on the ground and immediately. It is a good outcome. However, something that has concerned us-and I think it has concerned the government because we have been talking about it, and I believe that the government will support the coalition-is the reporting to the parliament on the operation of this amendment. We think it is important that there be a mechanism where you can report to the parliament who was compensated, what the amount was and in what circumstances. We think there should be an accountability mechanism. I think there may well be an amendment moved to this bill in the Senate in due course-and I think it will be moved with the support of the governmentrequiring Defence, perhaps on an annual basis, to report back to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Security and Intelligence in summary form on the number of incidents, who was compensated and why they were compensated. In that way, the parliament can keep a MAIN COMMITTEE supervisory eye on what is happening and pick up if there are any difficulties with, or consequences of, the operation of this legislation. This is a way to keep the respect of the people who are affected by war activities, and I think we will all support it. The amendment to the Defence Homeownership Assistance Scheme Act was originally introduced by the former government and is supported by the Rudd government, because we want to make sure that our people are properly looked after and we want to make sure that this can be used as a retention initiative. The member for Blair was quite correct when he indicated that it is certainly working as a retention initiative. It is very generous. I myself think that the panel of providers should be expanded, but that is a debate for another forum. The coalition, in principle, believes that no member of the Defence Force should be disadvantaged in any area because of their service in the Defence Force. Addressing that is a really big picture item because you can look at employment, you can look at education issues and you can look at homeownership issues. That is why, with the way we post people around the country and the way they continually move, they need to have a home they can call their own. Because of the special circumstances of Defence, they need assistance through the Defence Homeownership Assistance Scheme. That is why it is important, if any inconsistencies are found, or any unintended consequences are found, that they in fact be addressed. That is what this particular amendment does. They are technical amendments, but members of the Defence Force will of course warmly appreciate that this is being done. Tomorrow, I will certainly tell the soldiers what has been discussed here in the parliament today, and they will know, understand and appreciate the effort that both sides of the parliament are putting into supporting the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. I certainly associate myself with this legislation and indicate my strong support. tion. I know that he cares passionately about both his constituents and defence matters. Those two matters often intersect. I also am pleased to speak in support of the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2009. BeforeI do so, I just want to digress and say a special thankyou to the hosts who looked after me out at Amberley Air Base as part of the parliamentary placement program, particularly Air Commodore Sowade and all of his staff who looked after me and took me on a wonderful flight that was especially enjoyable in a C-17 on the last day. They put me through lots of wonderful experiences and I just want to pass on my thanks to them. realise that a plane so big could fly so low to the ground or so spectacularly. But I return to the legislation before us. The purpose of this bill is twofold. Firstly, it is to introduce a tactical payment scheme for people adversely affected by the Australian Defence Force operations overseas and, secondly, it is to improve the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme. I will discuss the new tactical payment scheme first. This new scheme will compensate people who are injured or affected by ADF operations outside Australia. According to international law and for the sake of human decency, Australia observes an absolute prohibition on the intentional targeting of civilians in armed conflict. As a party to the Geneva convention and additional protocol 1, Australia makes every effort to avoid military operations that are likely to result in incidental civilian casualties. However, we know that, while every effort is made to MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2009

277,Mr Perrett,"They certainly took me on an interesting flight-that is for sure. I did notavoid it, tragically civilians do sometimes unfortunately suffer harm and death and damage is done to property in the course of military operations. That is one of the tragic costs of war and armed conflicts. While a number of act of grace payments have been made to civilians following loss and damage, Australia has no formal compensation scheme in place. Instead, payments have been considered more on a case by case basis and require the approval of both the defence and the finance minister. The administrative requirements for these payments are cumbersome and not suitable to the immediate needs on the ground in conflict situations abroad. They are much too laborious. I am advised that $266,000 has been paid to Iraqi civilians in act of grace payments and that last financial year alone Defence paid out $81,000 in act of grace payments. But this process is time consuming, ad hoc and inconsistent. Our defence forces have learned from East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan that civilians generally expect to be compensated for damage to property, injury or loss of life. When this does not happen or when there are significant delays in providing payment, it can have a negative impact on the ADF’s relationship with local communities, which in turn can place their defence personnel at greater risk. When our armed forces are serving overseas, they are there to bring security and stability to a region or community, to help build capacity and to protect the most vulnerable. This bill ensures that when there are adverse outcomes for civilians they will be compensated. The tactical payments scheme will enable Defence to quickly respond to damage or loss by making payments to civilians who have suffered personal or property damage. Payments will be capped at $250,000 and the scheme will not completely replace act of grace payments, which will still be an option. This scheme will help further the reputation of Australian defence personnel working overseas. It already has a wonderful reputation, but this will enhance that reputation. The last thing we want is for civilian losses to be written off as collateral damage and forgotten. While we strive to avoid civilian loss and damage, Australia must do what it can to support and protect the local communities which we have become a part of through military operations. As several of the previous speakers mentioned, it is by winning the hearts and minds of these people that we will actually win these military operations. This bill also amends the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme Bill 2008. The Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme was set up in July last year to help serving ADF members to buy their first home. The scheme is a carrot for young recruits and also a retention tool to encourage members to stay with the ADF, as they receive greater assistance the longer they serve. And it has been successful, with more than 11,000 already approved for subsidies. Successful members are provided with a subsidy certificate as evidence to the bank when applying for a loan. It is very practical assistance. However, the amendments in this bill are about eliminating a number of unintended outcomes. For example, it makes minor amendments to the service eligibility for the loan subsidy. Some members were able to claim more than intended under the scheme if they rejoined the ADF after a break in service prior to 1 July 2008. The amendments ensure that members are subsidised the same whether they rejoined the ADF before or after 1 July 2008. Further, the bill makes certain that a subsidy certificate is conditional on a member having service credit, thereby providing greater proof to a home loan provider that a subsidy is payable. This bill clarifies that only those members who are buying a home for the first time, MAIN COMMITTEE while a member of the ADF, have access to the subsidy lump sum payment option. It also clarifies that the subsidy may be payable monthly or as a lump sum payment. The bill ensures that the entitlement of subsidised borrowers who enter into a joint mortgage with a person who is not defined as a partner in the act is proportional to the subsidised borrower’s liability-common sense. As I mentioned previously, this scheme is a shot in the arm for Defence Force recruitment, with more than 11,000 members signing up for the loan subsidy already. It is not uncommon for schemes like this to require some tweaking around the edges as some of the technicalities are worked out in practice. The amendments before the House are important because they will help ensure this scheme remains a viable and effective recruitment and retention tool for the ADF into the future. I commend the bill to the House. 2009 is important legislation as it adds opportunities and gives encouragement, if you like, to our defence forces in a couple of important areas. In reference to the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme in particular, I did serve a period as shadow minister for defence personnel and the issue arose of persons regularly on transfer and their consequent inability to purchase a home. Let me say that, of all the issues that one must look at in a person’s retirement, the ownership of a home is fundamental. For those who have not acquired a home before they have retired, for whatever reason, we know that their future is much constrained in terms of a fair and reasonable retirement-notwithstanding rental assistance and other matters. Defence Force personnel, by the simple nature of their employment, frequently missed out on a home. Of course, the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme has contributed substantially to their overcoming that particular disadvantage. These good measures, which finetune that process, are to be welcomed. The other matter in which I have a very great interest, as I constantly read in the media of our involvement in these particular nations, is where we are dealing with insurgents, where we are dealing with people who do not wear a uniform. I have read that the job of the lady who was arrested was to have women raped so that they would be so embarrassed and cast aside, as unfortunately they do in the culture of these people-if you get raped it was your fault-that, in their disillusioned sense, they would put on an explosive belt and go and blow people up. For that one woman, who has now been arrested, that was her job. I think they said at the time that 40 or so women had been conscripted and had lost their lives in this fashion. So it is not a war like the ones for which many of our defence forces in the past were trained for. You could easily identify your opponent. I remember well that in the Second World WarI thought the Germans were obliged to wear that funny helmet because that identified them so that we could shoot them. The fact was that it was a much more efficient type of helmet. In fact, as a little kid I thought ‘German’ was a bad word. I thought they actually called themselves ‘Australians’ because that was a good word. Many of you did not experience the publicity and the way it was all fed to us at that time, but the point I make is that we did at least know our enemy. I support this administrative measure that accommodates an aspect of Middle East culture where, if you shoot someone, you pay them for it. That is part of their culture. It is a questionable practice, but if it allows for the eventual democratisation and a better life for the people of Afghanistan and Iraq-and it now appears the people of PakiMAIN COMMITTEE",180,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2009
278,Mr Tuckey (O’connor) (11.50 Am),"The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1)stan-then it is good policy. And the world has apparently learned that you can buy someone’s life. My purpose for speaking in this debate is to express my grave fears about constant press references to pursuing some of our defence force personnel who apparently shoot an ‘innocent’ person. Again, we are going to persecute some of our defence personnel. If a member of a defence force-and examples have been given of others, not our people-enters a premise for the purpose of raping the women in that particular household and then shoots them so they cannot tell the story, that is a crime by any standard and should be punished accordingly. But there appears to be a fine line in this regard with the shooting of a 12-year-old. Why is that, Chair? He was holding a hand grenade and was just about to chuck it at our people. If that had been a false hand grenade, was it the responsibility of our soldiers to find that out first? I do not think so. I think it is a very significant issue of morality that we have to decide those things. I get angry when we persecute people who volunteer and are sent to very hostile and very difficult environments and who have to decide who they shoot a rocket at, which house they have to blow up and who might be inside the house. There is criticism that quite often the party shooting at them is in a house but that women and children are also in the house-they might be there very reluctantly. This is common practice apparently. What are our defence force people to do? Do they say, ‘We’ll just stand up and let them shoot us because we can’t do anything about it.’ I know the rules of engagement are supposed to cover such matters, but the media in particular want to engage in what I call the flagellation of our defence forces. While this bill deals specifically with an aspect of that-insurgents and circumstances where property or lives are lost; apparently in some cultures things can always be settled with money, and there may be sense in that-are we going to continue to persecute our own people in these circumstances? These issues are very hard to define. In a split second they have to decide whether the 12-year-old kid is carrying a real grenade. I always come down on the side of the soldier and with the members of our defence forces. I do not think we should put them in uniform and send them to very difficult areas and then persecute them in these circumstances. This sort of thing started in Vietnam. It is the same thing: know your enemy. Since we have been involved in these sorts of civil wars and in areas of insurgency, it has become extremely difficult for our people. I am sure much of the mental trauma visited upon our defence force personnel in this day and age is relevant to that: knowing your enemy, knowing where you can go, knowing where you can socialise. These are very serious issues. I think we have to be terribly careful that we do not let an excessive moral position override the great difficulty our people face. They cannot say: ‘Sorry we made a mistake. Let’s shake hands.’ They are dealing with matters that involve their own lives. It may be a 12-year-old sitting there with a mobile phone waiting for you to walk past a roadside bomb. It may be a house-and such a case has involved great controversy-next to a roadside bomb, yet the occupants were considered innocent. They might have been frightened but they were not innocent. Someone must have come along with a shovel and been seen by people on the side of the road digging a hole in the ground for what was a substantially sized device. A group of soldiers drove past-I think they were Americans-and some were blown up. They turned to that house as the probable point of detonation and shot some people. Of course they are all to go to jail for that. MAIN COMMITTEE Excuse me! I do not know how you make those judgments, but I do not think members of the Defence Force should be found responsible for mistakes of that nature. I can differentiate between a deliberate attack-shooting people to hide a disgraceful act maybe-and when you are on patrol and you are confronted by a 12-year-old kid with something in his hand which turns out to be a grenade. I think you have got to be excused for the action you take thereafter in that sort of case. I give that one as an example. I do not think that will become an issue because the kid did have a grenade. One might wonder what we would be trying to do to our people at this stage if it had been a toy. If the House has not considered that particular point, I hope it will do so in the future. It is very difficult, but it is totally wrong to send people overseas and say, ‘It’ll be all your fault if you get it wrong, mate.’ I cannot believe that we parliamentarians, as the responsible parties, should ever take that view. We have got to err on the side of our own people because of the circumstances they are in and the pressure they are under. Otherwise, Mr Chairman, I think this is sensible legislation. It is interesting that we have now virtually legitimised money in a brown paper bag, but there is a requirement that we have a more efficient administrative arrangement to do something we are doing already. I guess that to say to the average Afghan, ‘We will get you an act of grace payment and all you have to do is fill in 55 forms,’ would not impress them at the time of their personal loss. This is pragmatic and sensible but, more importantly, the bill also deals with a very positive component. In my state we have got submarines on the beach because it is no longer attractive for people to take that job at that wage. As I mentioned earlier, in my time as the shadow minister women told me that they were virtually forcing their husbands to go into the submariner class because the cheapest place to buy a house in Australia at the time was down near the Stirling base in the southern suburbs of Perth. A brand-new house and land under $200,000 was commonplace. That was partly because of a man called Len Buckeridge, who is hated by the CFMEU and who is the biggest home builder in Australia. He has made home building efficient and has now vertically integrated his construction business-we have just assisted him in getting a brickworks. He now makes just about everything he puts into a house and he has kept the price competitively low in WA, even in the present environment. People were going there for that purpose and there has been some balance in that but, above all, people who are in the permanent defence forces must acquire a home, they must have the right to rent it when they get transferred and they must be assisted in that matter. They have got to be able to retire with a place they can live in, and it should be debt free at that time. This is a good measure as it intends to improve that. had a strict budget, but we are still the Speaker’s panel, not the Chair’s panel.

It is a very interesting book and you may find it informing. (No. 1) 2009, which introduces amendments with two commendable policy objectives. The first is to ensure the safety and security of our Defence Force in the field. The second involves provisions for their access to housing back home in Australia. Both are important administrative amendments which will have a big impact on the lives of our ADF personnel. The first amendment introduced by this bill involves the Tactical Payment Scheme, or TPS. This scheme will provide new, efficient and effective means for making quick, no-liability payments to persons who have suffered damage, injury or loss due to the activities of the ADF abroad. The necessity for such a scheme reflects Australia’s approach to treating all people with common decency as well as respecting the customs of the local communities we are operating within. The TPS acknowledges that, where the ADF causes damage to property or injury to local people, we have a responsibility to offer some form of compensation. Often that compensation will be financial. This is not just the right thing to do; it also benefits the security of our forces. Recognising the unintended damage that ADF actions can sometimes cause will ensure that relationships with local communities remain intact. You cannot fight an insurgency or a guerrilla war or provide security in civil conflicts unless you have the consent of the community you are operating within. That has been proven in many different wars over the last 100 years. Strong relationships with local communities enhance the safety of ADF personnel and provide possible strategic advantages in operating in those conflicts. The current arrangements for offering this type of compensation are covered by the act of grace provisions under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997, and that provides for a payment to be made where the government has no legal liability but accepts responsibility for some damage caused. As the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel explained in his second reading speech, the TPS was developed in response to lessons learned in operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and East Timor. Our recent experiences in these conflict zones showed that the current administrative arrangements for making act of grace payments were inappropriate, given the time pressures that exist in operational environments. We cannot expect people to go through lengthy processes-processes that they would be completely unfamiliar with. Obviously, this is especially true where the payment costs are small-particularly from our perspective-but where the damage is perceived in the local community as being great. Small delays in making such payments have immediate negative impacts on our relationship with the local community. Small delays aid our enemies in these climates, who use such incidents to undermine our consent to operate within the community. They undermine all the previous good work we may have done. So a delay in redress for damage done obviously affects the security of our personnel and undermines our operational objectives. To counter this, the TPS will operate independently from the act of grace payment provisions as a separate discretionary mechanism, managed and operated by the Department of Defence. There will be a cap on payments under this scheme. A range of criteria will be considered, including the prevailing culture and society of the area in which the compensation is required. As payments under this scheme have been capped, the ADF will continue to have recourse to the act of grace provisions if a particularly large or unusual payment is required. MAIN COMMITTEE",184,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2009
285,Mr Tuckey,"I ran a pub for years, and I was in that situation every evening!",185,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2009
286,Mr Champion,"I rise to speak in favour of the Defence Legislation Amendment BillImportantly for the people affected by these actions, their acceptance of TPS or the act of grace compensation will not necessarily preclude future legal action if they have a case to make in that circumstance. The introduction of the TPS is a simple administrative amendment that will improve our relationship with communities in which our forces serve. It will simultaneously improve the safety and security of our Defence men and women. Finally, it will assist our operational objectives in these conflicts. The second important measure in this bill amends the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme Act 2008, which provides a legislative basis for the operation of the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme. This scheme was introduced last year to encourage the retention of ADF personnel. DHOAS provides eligible ADF members with home ownership assistance and is responsive to changes in the housing market. It recognises the difficulties that ADF members may have in purchasing a home due to the nature of their career in the military and it provides increased assistance to those people. The scheme provides flexibility and choice to ADF members through a panel of home loan providers. As of February this year, the scheme has over 5,000 ADF members receiving subsidy assistance. While the scheme has been tremendously successful, and I know many of my constituents have taken advantage of the scheme, I guess there were some unintended outcomes in that original bill. This administrative act removes windfall gains in the eligibility and entitlement for members who rejoined the ADF after a break in service prior to 1 July 2008. This measure will ensure that members who rejoin the ADF, no matter when they rejoin, have the same access and the same rights and benefits. The bill also clarifies that if ADF service personnel take a break in their service that is greater than five years then their previous service is not eligible for consideration as part of that person’s proof of their right of access to DHOAS. The same test will apply to reserve service personnel but with a two-year break constituting the test for consideration of previous service. This reinforces the aim of the program, which is to encourage retention of Defence personnel. It would be unfair to make such arrangements retrospective, and that means that any member who currently receives access to the subsidy based on the previous provision will not have that benefit removed. I think that is a fair and reasonable approach by the government. The bill also makes amendments to focus the benefit to those who need it the most. Access to lump sum payments is an enormous benefit when organising the purchase of a new property, especially for a first-time buyer. That is why under this bill only ADF members who are buying a home for the first time will have access to the subsidy lump sum payment option. And in recognition of the reality that many personnel want to buy a house with their partner, the bill also changes the treatment of the shared liability for a loan. The entitlement of a subsidised borrower who enters into a joint loan with a person who is not defined as a partner in the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme Act 2008 is calculated as proportional to the subsidised borrower’s liability. The amendments will also clarify the entitlements where both partners are Defence Force members and so both are entitled to a subsidised loan. This clarification includes entitlements on the death of one of the partners, allowing partners together to maximise the amount of subsidy payable in respect of a loan to which they are both parties. These changes bring the legislative scheme in line with the original policy intent of MAIN COMMITTEE the DHOAS scheme and establish a consistent framework for the calculation of the subsidy where there is more than one party to the loan. I have come in contact with many defence force families since I was elected. One of the things that becomes really apparent is that many of the families echo the commitment, service and sacrifice of ADF personnel. I think these families give a great deal to the service of the nation. ADF members may be volunteers but the families, in many ways, are conscripted to the cause as well. They support the ADF, the personnel and the ethos of the service. That said, I do not think that that commitment is always matched by the attitude of the defence hierarchy, which is not as family friendly as it could be or should be. I think bills of this nature do help with retention of personnel and help families, but so much of the way families are treated is administrative and decisions are made by particular people. I think the more family friendly the ADF becomes, the more likely it is to retain valuable and long standing personnel. The member for O’Connor talked about submarine staff. I think the greatest pressure for submariners is that they are away for six months and they are uncontactable for that time. In those situations it is a pretty tough thing for the partners, the wives and the families of those ADF personnel. I think the more help we give the family, the more likely we are to retain the personnel in active service. If we care for the family, we are much more likely to retain the soldier, the airman and the sailor in service to this country. This bill contains two very different but two very valuable policy objectives. The first area reaffirms our common decency in responding to the unintended damage caused by our forces in these very complex situations, these very dynamic theatres of war and civil conflict. The second area of the bill focuses on the defence home ownership scheme, which is not only an incredibly important policy in retention terms but also a great benefit to defence force personnel. I think those objectives have really good short-term, medium-term and long-term impacts on the safety, the security and the size of our defence forces, and I commend the bill to the House. the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2009 and will not talk at all about the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme because I think it has general support in this chamber. For anyone who knows parliamentary history, having two so distinct aspects of legislative reform in the one bill is almost borderline tacking. Certainly, as far as the home ownership scheme is concerned, it looks to be a sensible reform. I want to speak on this legislation in relation to the tactical payment scheme. Whilst not opposing it through this chamber, it certainly raises several questions in my mind. The first is these broad and sweeping references to the problems with the act of grace. I would love to hear from the minister, in reply, in detail as to exactly what those problems are and with regard to the slowness of payment and the inappropriateness of that scheme in meeting the needs of operational matters for Defence. To me, it looks odd to be setting up a parallel scheme which is discretionary and which, by the look of it, removes any civilian transparency in this process and treats payments as matters of an operational nature rather than of a management nature. In my view, it should have a civilian element attached to it, and that civilian element is a minister with those discretionary powers. This is the question I would like the minister, or whoever is going to respond on behalf of government, to respond to: exactly what, in detail, are the problems with the act of grace MAIN COMMITTEE",185,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2009
287,Mr Oakeshott (Lyne) (12.17 Pm),"I will be brief in my contribution to the debate onprocess for these issues that have been put in this bill and exactly why, in detail, can’t that act of grace process be tightened up so that it does meet the cultural or community interests of the various Australian operational forces, wherever they are located? For me, that is the first question that jumps out. The second is the reporting and transparency issues. They do reflect on that. I know it is an ongoing debate, and tension goes on between civilian and non-civilian masters within Defence regardless of who is in government, but it has already been picked up by one speaker-I think it was the member for O’Connor-who used the reference about brown paper bags being formalised. There is a danger in not having very strict and clear guidelines and very strict, clear and transparent parameters, because if any of us in this place or any member of the community wanted to know exactly who got which payments, or where and why, then those questions could not be very easily answered by Defence, by the minister and by the parliament. It seems odd that that is not included in this bill and in this legislative process. We are being asked in good faith to rely on guidelines being put in place in the future by the Department of Defence, which look-and I may have missed it-as though they remove the discretionary authority of a minister in the chair. I think that has inherent dangers attached to it that have already been expressed by one speaker with the colloquialism of ‘brown paper bags being formalised’. I hope that will be considered and will be responded to by the minister-or whoever is responding-as to what exactly the guidelines are, what the reporting processes are and how transparent this is going to be. Will we now see these acts of grace being removed from ministerial discretion and shifted from a management role to an operational role? I would be deeply concerned if that is happening, because going along with that will be a lack of transparency and accountability to the community. WhilstI do not oppose this legislation, and certainly I understand the reasons given in the briefs, there are some red flags and red lights going off in regard to the reporting, the management and the accountability trail. I hope I am wrong, and I await a response from government to confirm that I am wrong. If not, this has problems attached to it. I have heard from previous speakers here who are flying the freedom and peace flag. From my point of view, you get freedom and peace by being as transparent and as accountable as possible. That is the safe port for all of us in a western, free democracy. If this is an exercise in denying information to the broader community then it has inherent problems attached to it. us today, the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2009, I want to make a few comments and particularly comment on the tactical payment scheme that forms part of the discussion. What is being introduced here is, I believe, a much more transparent system than the one that has existed up until this point in time whereby any compensation we have been paying is via an act of grace. We have seen many instances of Defence Force personnel and government ministers actually obfuscating about the quantum and to whom these payments have been made, on the grounds that to do so could place people in danger or establish a market for compensation payments. I recall from one newspaper clipping, which I have not brought with me today, that the former government actually declared that these payments were not compensation but that they were payments that it was morally obliged to make. That newspaper article was dealing with the payment made to the family of an individual who had been shot MAIN COMMITTEE",187,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2009
288,Mr Sullivan (Longman) (12.23 Pm),"In rising to support the legislation that is beforedead by Australian troops for not heeding their call to pay attention. I understand the troops feared that the individual was preparing to attack their quarters. Further on in that article is some discussion about payments made to people who had been wounded by actions taken by Australian troops. The reality is that the tactical payment scheme is going to be small payments-I think a cap has been mentioned of a sum that most people would not consider small, but in the circumstances they are small payments-that are able to be made quickly. Members of this place who have lived in countries where there is a culture of compensation for harm that has been done to people will understand that that expeditious nature, that timely nature, of making a compensation payment is particularly vital in retaining the respect and the goodwill of the people who are being compensated. These condolence payments or property payments that we will be making are going to be very important in the context of what we now see as modern warfare. Long gone are the days where there were battlefields. Long gone are the days when the kings would sit on the hill and watch their armies approach each other in the valley. At the end of the day there would be a winner decided and the kings would depart back to their castles to lick their wounds or pat themselves on the back for having a wonderful day. Those days are no longer with us. Today the warlike experiences that our troops are facing are much more akin to guerrilla activityhouse skirmishes. Who knows where the guerrilla activity is going to come from? Our troops cannot select the theatre in which they have to engage with an enemy. We are now in a situation where, unlike in previous eras’ wars, there is not a countryversus-country situation. Not all of the citizens of Iraq, where we have been until recently, or Afghanistan, where we are currently, oppose our presence there. In fact, we are increasingly engaging in what could be termed civil wars. We need the support, our troops need the support, of the civilian population in the areas where they are. And by being able to retain their respect and their goodwill through payments such as we are talking about, we will be able to ensure their safety as best we can. That retention of goodwill is important. I have just a few moments left. I would like to mention the changes that are being made in this legislation to defence housing. There are two aspects to this legislation, as you would understand, Mr Deputy Speaker: the compensation style payments and the defence housing. Having spent my youth as a member of a family of a banker who transferred quite frequently from place to place, I understand the situation for military families who have postings in different areas and the fact that it is very difficult for them to be able to purchase a house anywhere. The provisions of the defence housing subsidy scheme, as we see it now, are excellent. The changes that we are making remove some unintended consequences of the introduction of the scheme last year and clarify some aspects of it. It is my understanding that all of these are beneficial to members of the defence forces and it is worthy and proper that we should reward them in this particular way.

289,Mr Melham (Banks) (12.30 Pm),"I move:Budget budget has let this nation down very badly. The wrecking ball of reckless spending has diverted funds into headline-grabbing multimillion dollar infrastructure projects-described by a spin addicted Labor government as ‘nation-building’-and there is little left for badly needed road upgrades in local electorates. Local people, local needs and local roads have been ignored by Mr Rudd and Mr Swan. Instead of spending money at the local level, this desperate duo try to claw back some credibility from their dismal trifecta-record spending, 29 per cent of GDP; record deficit, five per cent of GDP; and a further severe increase in the jobless rate to 8.5 per cent-by focusing on big projects. A number of these projects were already costed, funded and ready to go. My colleague Warren Truss has caught Labor out. He said the $8.4 billion worth of projects announced on budget night are a mixture of Labor finally catching up with coalition commitments and other projects in urban passenger transport which bail out failed state Labor governments. This is so true of the Pacific Highway project. This project was on a fifty-fifty basis with the New South Wales state government and the announcement has given them a get-outof-jail card, with the Commonwealth now funding it all. But there is nothing for local roads. There is nothing for local roads like Richmond Road and Bells Line of Road; nothing for roads like Scheyville Road, Freemans Reach Road, Comleroy Road, Terrace Road, Grace Vale Road, Sackville Road and East Kurrajong Road-and there are many others. RecentlyI attended an event, with my New South Wales Liberal colleagues and local mayors, to announce funding for a roundabout on Boundary Road at Oakville. This came through, finally, after months of lobbying and public meetings. I want to thank the local people, especially Vicky Vella, a driving force in galvanising local support for my efforts and those of the New South Wales member for Hawkesbury, Ray Williams; the Mayor of Hawkesbury, Bart Bassett; and the Mayor of Hills Shire Council, Larry Bolitho. Together, they have delivered on the needs of local people. The roundabout had claimed the lives of many people, injured many more and, I am sure, left an indelible impression of danger on people involved in near misses. When the coalition were in government, we had successful Roads to Recovery, Black Spot and general road funding programs delivered through local government to address local needs. When Labor came into government, funding for local projects slowed right down. We also had the AusLink program where, traditionally, the state governments would share the cost. In the basket case that is New South Wales, Mr Rudd and Mr Swan have come to the rescue of their Labor mates and let state Labor off the hook of paying their share of funding for the Pacific Highway. While I am not opposed to the bypass project, I raise the issue to make the point that this is just one example of how Labor mismanages the economy. Instead of helping a failed Labor government, that money-and it is a significant amount-should have been spent in local communities to make their roads safer. And there is no end in sight. It took the coalition and the Australian people more than a decade to pay off the previous debt left behind by federal Labor. It will take years for the economy to recover from Labor’s reckless spending. Any expectation that local roads will get the funding they need in the foreseeable future is unlikely to be met. If we look beyond the spin, the truth is that Labor will actually spend less money on road and rail over the next five years than was committed by the previous coalition government.

I have spoken previously in the House about the apology and what it meant to the people in my community, the constituents of Forde. On1 April this year I was invited to a local school in my electorate, the Trinity Catholic College, in the spirit of the reconciliation and to mark the formal apology made in this House on 13 February 2008. The student representative council at that school decided to commemorate this event by building a garden that recognises the Indigenous history of the region. The student representative council launched a competition and invited all students and community members connected to the college to design a garden where students and Indigenous and non-Indigenous people would be able to reflect on the past, present and future. This will be a very special place at Trinity Catholic College where students will be able to learn and further their understanding of their cultural heritage and what the formal apology means to our nation. I was only seven years old when the Indigenous people were finally recognised through the referendum in 1967. This was a time in history when there was an overwhelming agreement that Indigenous people should be considered part of Australian society. From that period of time to where we are today, we have increased our understanding not only of our Indigenous past but also of the multicultural nature of our community. I continue to listen to many discussions and arguments from different groups inside this House and outside this House, and they often talk of what the apology actually signified for us as a nation. I encourage the debate. It assists the community to better understand the background of the apology and to awaken an understanding of our Indigenous history. I want to mention people who assisted with the opening of this Indigenous garden at the Trinity Catholic College. The principal is Mr John Lamb, who certainly understood what the apology meant and what it intended to do as we provided comfort, relief and a recognition of our past. Mr Lamb, who is a very well-known educator in our region, gave some insight into what we can do as a community to come together and in a practical way understand the concerns of our community and commemorate our apology to the Indigenous people. I also especially mention the Indigenous elders within the community, which is covered by an area known as the Yugambeh nation. The people of that particular history and culture include two renowned elders, Aunties Eileen and Robyn Williams, who represent that Indigenous history very well. Their welcome to country is always an inspiring talk about the history and, as they put it, those ‘millions of feet’ that traversed that country before us. Another two people in our community are Lucy and David Banu. Lucy is an Aboriginal woman and David is a Torres Strait Island man, and they work very closely with the Indigenous communities in our community to give an understanding that within our Indigenous culture there are many differences-many languages and many different cultural aspects of these different groups. Both Lucy and David will quite often perform certain events and some of the dances of their particular cultural backgrounds for young people and the wider community. MAIN COMMITTEE",190,Adjournment

I thank people like Janelle McQueen, Lucy and David Banu, Aunty Eileen and Aunty Robyn for their involvement, and I recognise and acknowledge the student representative council of Trinity Catholic College for their insight and for bringing in a practical way an understanding of what that important apology meant for this country. The apology itself was the statement made by this House and our Prime Minister, but in a practical way we in our communities can recognise the significance of that event and the significance and importance of our Indigenous history within this country. Member for Bendigo urer on Tuesday evening made reference to the government seeking to increase the age pension for tens of thousands of our fellow Australians, and I want to put on the record that that is one initiative that I support, and that I believe the coalition supports, very strongly and very genuinely. Many pensioners in my electorate will welcome this initiative, and I want to place on the record and remind the people of Ryan that the inspiration and the driver of this policy was not in fact the Rudd government but was the former Leader of the Opposition Dr Brendan Nelson, a man who enjoys enormous respect in this parliament, a man of great popularity on both sides of the chamber. I want to talk about this in the context of compassion. In the parliament yesterday one of the members of the government, the member for Bendigo, spoke about compassion, and I, as an individual citizen of this country and as a member of this federal parliament since 2001, want to place on the record the deep offence that I took at his remarks which associated me, as a member of the coalition, and my colleagues in this parliament with the Third Reich of Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany. I want to place on the record the words that the member for Bendigo spoke, because I know that the constituents of Ryan will find them absurd, offensive and absolutely inappropriate. He associated the opposition’s compassion and our views on the age pension with the Third Reich. In fact, it was the former Leader of the Opposition Dr Brendan Nelson, and the opposition, that pushed the Rudd Labor government into taking this initiative on board; it was not of their own doing. For him to allege lack of compassion on the coalition side of the chamber and associate the coalition with the Third Reich is terribly offensive. I know that all those of Jewish faith, in particular, and supporters not only of my party but of the government will find this remarkable-and that is being generous-but, more likely, terribly offensive. The state of Israel is the only democratic nation in the Middle East, and its people sometimes still have to persuade others in the world, even some people who hold positions of significant influence, that the Holocaust, one of the darkest chapters in the history of humanity, took place. That millions of Jews were slaughtered and butchered and murdered is something that we all need to remember. We need to stand side by side with the state of Israel, the government of Israel and the people of Israel. During World War II, Adolf Hitler controlled Germany as a plaything of his own megalomania. That is something that today, in 2009, and in the 21st century, we must not forget, because if we as a people forget, and the world forgets, then we are sure to revisit it in the future. MAIN COMMITTEE",191,Adjournment
292,Mr Johnson (Ryan) (12.39 Pm),"The budget that was delivered by the federal TreasI want to place on the record that for a member of the Australian parliament to make remarks in the House of Representatives that associate a political party with the Third Reich of Adolf Hitler is something that is totally offensive to me as an individual and to all of my colleagues in the federal opposition. It is absolutely appropriate for any political party in this parliament to engage in vigorous, robust and indeed passionate debate, but for that debate to be extended to the association of an individual of any political party in the parliament with dictators and governments of evil such as we can only imagine is something that should stand condemned. I will certainly be making it very clear to the people of Ryan that this took place and that it was way out of line. National Volunteer Week Ms NEAL (Robertson) (12.45 pm)-I rise today to inform members of some of the activities and achievements of volunteers in my electorate of Robertson. As members are aware, it is National Volunteer Week. This is the time when we recognise and applaud the work of the volunteers in our community. Volunteer Week was launched by Senator Ursula Stephens, the Parliamentary Secretary for Social Inclusion and for the Voluntary Sector. I want to put on the record her great commitment in this policy area. I get very positive feedback from all sections of the community, particularly from volunteer organisations, about how much she has achieved and what great work she has done. This year’s theme-‘Everyday people, extraordinary contribution’-sums up the invaluable contribution that volunteers make to communities across Australia. One in three Australians is a volunteer. Together the nation’s five million volunteers give more than 700 million hours per year to helping others. The picture on the Central Coast, where the electorate of Robertson is located, is no different and it certainly reflects the national scene. Volunteering has been integral in maintaining the social and community fabric of the Central Coast for generations. Organisations such as the Royal Life Saving Society and the Rural Fire Service form much of the backbone of our coastal communities. TodayI want to make special mention of a number of volunteers in my electorate who will be receiving certificates of appreciation to mark Volunteer Week. These seven people were nominated by community groups across the coast. They are among the unsung heroes of my region. I thank them all personally for their tireless contribution to making the coast a better place to live, work and bring up the next generation of children. Thea Brayshaw from Phegans Bay is the Secretary of The Bays Community Group. She runs the local community breakfasts, the kids discos and the bush dances. I, of course, cannot mention her without mentioning the president of that group, Bob Puffett. He does endless work in the community. He distributes the newsletter, works for the university and even mows the lawns that the council forgets in its rounds. He is certainly an amazing fellow and works closely with Thea. Bruce Bennett of Empire Bay and James Kennedy of Umina Beach are volunteers committed to helping the youth of the peninsula through the highly regarded Web Youth Service at Umina. Bruce and James work together as handymen at the youth centre-putting up shelves, getting rid of graffiti and generally keeping the place functioning. Ann March of Ettalong dedicates three days every week to cooking healthy afternoon teas for the children in Woy Woy beforeand after-school care. Gary Rohr of Saratoga is also recMAIN COMMITTEE ognised for his practical commitment to the Woy Woy beforeand after-school care group. He commits two days each week to help maintain the cottage and the grounds. Peter Little has been well known in commercial radio on the Central Coast for many years. He now uses his expertise to help out at Youth Connections Radio. Joan Victory is also a longtime volunteer with Youth Connections Radio and Radio Five-O-Plus. She works tirelessly as a producer, writer and presenter. The selfless efforts of these people add a tremendous amount to the social good of the Central Coast. They make invaluable contributions to assisting our children, youth and seniors. They give their time and experience to community groups and resident associations. Their efforts are focused not on promoting their own interests but on the interests and well-being of others and on the betterment of the Central Coast. They certainly make our world a better place to live in. Budget focus on some of the infrastructure undertakings and debate that have resulted from this week’s budget. I spoke earlier in the parliament about the funds that were being removed from the education innovation fund and put towards the Clean Energy Initiative. On the surface, the Clean Energy Initiative seems as if it is heading in the right direction, but few details are available. The irony I pointed to earlier in this parliamentary sitting week was that just a year ago we were told the education innovation fund would be the engine room for economic growth and recovery. It highlighted just how much seems to have changed in the rhetoric and the positioning of the Rudd government on just what will be the engine room of economic growth into the future. It clearly points to a lack of coherence, certainty and clarity about a strategy and clearly evidences a lack of strategy by the Rudd government about what their plan is to see a turnaround in our economy and the way forward. Often infrastructure is discussed. In this week’s budget, Treasurer Swan made much effort to talk about infrastructure investments. In fact, he overlooked the point I raised in the parliament earlier in the week-that, in terms of road and rail, the new nation-building program and the rebadging of the former Howard government’s AusLink agenda, there is actually a reduction in infrastructure effort under the name of AusLink, now to be renamed ‘nation building’. We saw $31 billion over five years committed by the former Howard government being replaced with $26 billion over six years by the Rudd government. That reduction in effort is being masked by an effort to rebadge AusLink projects with new Labor branding just to make sure that the Australian public is not aware that this is actually a government that is reducing infrastructure effort in the areas of roads, ports and rail. On those areas there were a number of announcements in the budget. I reflect on the work of Infrastructure Australia. This organisation, with many able people contributing to its work, was going to be the vehicle through which all investment in infrastructure would be evidence based, transparently arrived at and objectively assessed. When you look at the budget allocation against the role of Infrastructure Australia, you wonder whether the actions actually live up to the rhetoric. Infrastructure Australia has made its recommendations to government. What is not clear-and where no explanation, no transparency and no openness have been provided-is why the budget differs from what was recommended by Infrastructure Australia. It was very interesting to see that for some projects, such as rail MAIN COMMITTEE",192,Adjournment
293,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (12.49 Pm),"In the few minutes available to me I would like toprojects in Sydney, Infrastructure Australia, through its work, and the government, to its credit, recognised that a glossy is not enough to secure a multibillion-dollar grant. They have sent a little bit of money back to the New South Wales government to get its act together. In an example in my home state of Victoria, a more developed, highly tuned and comprehensive proposal that received the support of Infrastructure Australia was treated as if it were some second-rate proposition. It was sent back with some further planning money but no commitment to the project itself. In my own area, the peninsula bypass, which was recommended for funding, did not even crack a mention. In today’s paper there are accounts of some of these projects even coming as a surprise to people who were supposed to have been their proponents. In South Australia, the state Treasurer was able to deflect a question on radio about $61 million to extend the O-Bahn guided bus way when it had not even been recommended. It was not even on the list but it got funded. Sadly, though, the transport minister was not as adept as Treasurer Foley in handling this question and could not, when asked by the media, offer any detail about such a plannothing concrete, nothing specific-yet that has been funded. There might be a perfectly good reason for it but let’s hear it. Where is the openness and transparency? We are sensing wafts of political pork-barrelling already. The Rudd government will point to organisations like Infrastructure Australia, the credibility of its work and the competence of its membership, and say, ‘Look, they’ve done the work,’ but, when you actually look at the funding that is allocated, it does not bear a whole lot of resemblance to the work that Labor will use as its cover. We need some openness and transparency about why these decisions end up looking quite different from the analytical, objective, evidence based work of Infrastructure Australia to ensure that these kinds of media commentary, suggesting a whiff of pork-barrelling, do not guide these decisions. On budget night, Treasurer Swan said we need to steel ourselves for the future. I just hope the Rudd government is not stealing our future with these very spurious decisions on resource allocation. (Time expired) Victorian Bushfires Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (12.54 pm)-I rise today to reflect on the devastating loss suffered by the Australian community, and especially the Victorian communities, during the Victorian bushfires this summer. This disaster touched all Australians, no matter where we live, and our hearts went out to the families who were directly affected by it. It was this response, this reaching out, that for me was so quintessentially Australian. The Australian people did not forget about their fellow citizens. Australians both young and old banded together and volunteered their time to raise money to help those who had lost their homes or their loved ones. I believe the sentiment we saw during this time, and continue to see, is a great testament to the Australian spirit and the character of the Australian people. This spirit was vibrant amongst the people I know in my local community in the southern suburbs of Adelaide. They did a lot to raise money through their schools, through individual contributions and through local community groups. I want to put on the record today the names of a number of community groups that deserve a mention for their dedication in helping to raise funds. The Rotary Club of Hallett Cove held a quiz night, which raised $1,550. They do a lot of work in my electorate. They are involved with the local high school. They prepare students MAIN COMMITTEE for interviews and to go out into the world. The club’s president, John Myers, and his team did a great job in raising money for the victims of the Victorian bushfires. The Reynella Business and Tourism Association raised $3,000 by holding a sausage sizzle in front of the Old Reynella Horse Changing Station on Saturday, 14 February. I went down to the event but I left the cooking of the sausages to someone more capable than I am. I collected money instead. The association did a great job. They are normally focused on helping local businesses to sell their products, but on this day they gave something back to the community. The Happy Valley CFS also came to the event. They had been responding to a grassfire the night before, but they came down to the event at nine o’clock in the morning to raise donations. Also helping out at that barbecue were the Old Reynella Town Bakery, Old Town Reynella Quality Meats, Vale Signs and Romeo’s Foodland Old Reynella. They all deserve a big thank you. Also deserving a thank you are Geoff King, who organised the event, and all the other volunteers who came to help out on that day. I would also like to recognise a gentleman by the name of John Bowman. He is not with a particular community group but he believed that he needed to stand up and organise a fundraising concert in the area to raise money. We all know that the hardware stores raised a whole lot of money. I went down to the barbecue at my local Bunnings store in Noarlunga. I want to pay particular tribute to the employees who worked on that barbecue, because they were not being paid. It was not their shift; they spent extra time, outside their shift, to stand there and cook those sausages. In many cases this was after a very long shift. I think the employees of the Bunnings store at Noarlunga who spent their time doing that really need to be recognised. I would also like to recognise the communities of Willunga, McLaren Vale and McLaren Flat and all the residents of the Fleurieu Peninsula in South Australia. Kim Pagon was one of the victims of the Willunga fire in the summer of 2008. Although she did not lose her house in that fire, her house was particularly damaged by it. Kim and her local community of 1,000 residents donated goods and money which were sent to help the communities affected by the Victorian bushfires. So there is a great community spirit there. The Victorian bushfires were a tragedy, but the one positive thing that came out of them was that they allowed the Australian people to display their best side when they contributed to those communities in need. Main Committee adjourned at 1 pm. MAIN COMMITTEE Enroute Charges Rebate Scheme (Question No. 556) Mr Truss asked the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, in writing, on 3 February 2009: In respect of the Enroute Charges Rebate Scheme: (a) has the Government decided to axe the Scheme from June 2012; (b) will the Scheme only apply to existing routes and service frequencies from 1 July 2008; (c) will the Scheme be available to (i) an operator resuming a service suspended for a time due to factors like pilot shortage, (ii) an operator running an existing route but with reduced frequencies, and (iii) a new operator taking up a service withdrawn by another that was previously in receipt of the Scheme; and (d) what studies have been conducted by the Government to assess the impact upon regional air services of the decision to cut the Scheme. (a) The Government decided as part of the 2008-09 Budget, that this transitional scheme which commenced in 2001 will terminate on 30 June 2012 except for aeromedical operators. (b) As part of this decision, assistance for Regular Public Transport (RPT) operators is limited to the existing RPT routes and services frequencies provided by Scheme recipients as at 13 May 2008. (c) Assistance is limited to the existing RPT routes and services frequencies provided by operators and supported under the Scheme as at 13 May 2008. (d) The Government continues to monitor the state of the regional aviation industry and is considering future policy directions as part of the development of the Aviation White Paper. Second Sydney Airport: Kurnell (Question No. 569) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, in writing, on 3 February 2009: Will he rule out the construction of a second Sydney Airport at Kurnell, on the basis that a second airport has been ruled out for Badgerys Creek. A process to identify additional capacity for the Sydney region will be initiated after I have considered Sydney Airport Corporation Limited’s draft Master Plan for Sydney Airport. As I indicated when launching the National Aviation Policy Green Paper on 2 December 2008, I do not intend to speculate on possible sites for a second Sydney airport. Iraq: Wheat (Question No. 636) Mr Forrest asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, in writing, on 10 March 2009: Further to his answer to question No. 377 (Hansard, 3 February 2009, page 74) in respect of an undertaking by Iraq between 2011 and 2028, to repay the remaining 20 per cent of Australian Wheat Board (AWB) debt for Australian wheat exported to Iraq between 1987 and 1990-",194,Adjournment
294,Mr Albanese,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,197,Questions In Writing
295,Mr Albanese,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Does the Government have records of wheat growers who sold wheat to Iraq between 1987 and 1990; if not, does the Government intend to establish such records to ensure growers or their beneficiaries receive the money owed. (2) Does the Government guarantee that wheat growers who lost 20 per cent of the value of their wheat, or their beneficiaries, will receive the balance owed between 2011 and 2028. (3) Will the money owed be paid direct to the growers or their beneficiaries, rather than to AWB Limited. (4) Can growers activate a claim prior to 2011 to recover the money owed to them. (5) Will the amount owed to wheat growers attract compounded interest over the more than 20 years since Iraq’s default. (6) Does he accept that the amount owed is badly needed by Australian wheat growers in their current dire financial circumstances. (1) No. Australian Wheat Board (AWB) was responsible for dealings with individual wheat growers and AWB then entered into insurance contracts with Export Finance Insurance Corporation for the sale of wheat to Iraq. (2) No. The government paid up to 80 per cent (on average) under the insurance contracts, thus discharging its financial obligation. Receipt of the balance owed to growers will be dependent on Iraq meeting its commitments under the terms of the repayment agreement. (3) The money owed will be paid directly to AWB as it was the counterparty on the insurance contracts. (4) No. (5) Yes. (6) The government is committed to helping farmers and rural communities still experiencing one of the worse droughts in Australian history. Since 2001 the government has provided more than $3.4 billion in exceptional circumstances assistance to farmers and small business operators. Farmers have also been offered immediate financial assistance under the government’s $42 billion Nation Building and Job plan. The $950 Farmer’s Hardship Payment will be paid automatically by Centrelink from 24 March 2009 and will benefit around 21 000 farmers who receive exceptional circumstances drought relief or income support payments. Australia: Regent (Question No. 646) Mr Melham asked the Prime Minister, in writing, on 12 March 2009: In the event that a person is appointed as regent in the United Kingdom under the Regency Act 1937, will that person also serve as regent in Australia and the Australian States. It would not be appropriate for the Australian Government to speculate about a hypothetical situation involving the roles of the Queen in Australia and the United Kingdom. .",197,Questions In Writing
