NAV AL COLLEGE . ter for the Navy any statement to make as to the circumstances leading up to the resignation of Captain Grantf r o m the position of Commandant of the Royal Australian Naval College? a statement on this subject. was made, not in the House, but to the press. in stating the facts. The papers, speaking from memory, .show that on Armistice night the students at the Royal Naval College were told that they might go out and make as much noise as they pleased, but that they must return within halfan-hour. When this leave expired all but eight ,of fche students had returned, and a few minutes later only two had failed to return. These two were found standing near the canteen, each drinking a glass of beer, but the papers, distinctly show t h a t .they were not intoxicated. It was open to the Captaini n charge of the College to apply to these two youths any one of three methods of punishment. He chose to adopt the most extreme formthat of dismissal from the College-bu t this could not come into operation without the consent of the Minister. He dismissed the two students, who were in their fourth year, and subsequently representations were made to me by one of the boys, who came all the way from Queensland to do so. Before that, however, when it was first reported to me that there were three methods of punishment toh'at might have been adopted, I had suggested by letter that a severe reprimand would be sufficient, but the head of the College would not budge from his position. It was just about that time that one of the boys-h e ought really to be came may say that neither of the youths in question was a Victorian, nor the son of a member of Parliament, as the newspaper had declared them to be. A f t e r seeing the boy who came . from Queensland, I instructed h i m to go back to College, and at the same time informed the College authorities that both were to be permitted to undergo their fourth-year examination. I may inform honourable members that at the time the examination was in progress; and I also arranged that they should be examined on the same papers as had been used for the other students. As a result of this, the Captaini n charge of I have already made the College resigned. The boys were examined, with the result that one passed I think that statement and was transferred to a ship on the high seas; while the other failed. In any case, both of these lads would have lef t the I have no hesitation College immediately after the examination-in the case of success, to join a ship, or in the case of failure, to abandon a naval career. It w ill be seen that the argument that the dismissal of the boys was necessary because they might contaminate the other students did not apply. I have, I think, stated tbe whole case. year students f a i l at this examination? hand.

The term of Professor Gilruth as Administrator expires in about six months from the 1st June. He is now taking a vacation; and in the meantime there are a great number of orders and other formal documents which have to be signed by some one. We have appointed a director of the A d visory Council who may, from experience, be found sufficient to cope with the business in the Territory without the usual Administrator, and in the meantime I have declared by Ordinance that the Secretary to the Department shall be appointed Deputy Administrator.

The Government are still awaiting the report of meetings which have been held by the Seamen's Unioni n each of the States. No definite information has yet reached the Government. the Housei n a position yet to make a statement relative to -the allocation of money for the relief of distress caused by the strike? Government did make available the sum of £1,000 as a preliminary step in connection with the relief of distress in Melbourne and suburbs. question of relief generally was considered, and a scheme drawn up whereby the Victorian State Government and the Commonwealth Government arranged for the relief of distress where necessary, the cost of same to be borne equally by the two Governments. Under the existing 1 scheme relief depots have been established, wherever necessary, in Victoria, and the arrangements are working satisfactorily under the supervision of Commonwealth and State Governments' representatives. The Governments of the other States were informed of the arrangements made in Victoria, and they were asked whether they would be prepared to enter into similar arrangements in their States. The reply received from New South Wales was that the proposed arrangement was accepted, and that the State Government would be prepared to provide half the sum necessary up to a maximum of £5,000 as its share. Replies received from other States were as f o llows :Queensland -Governmen t already has elaborate machinery for distribution of relief, and prefers that any relief given should be through medium of existing machinery, which has been found sufficient for all State purposes. t P South Australia -Position not acute. Any relief required has been afforded by State authorities. In circumstances, not disposed to H a v in g regard to vote any sum of money for purpose suggested by Commonwealth, but willing to co-operate in distributing any money authorized by Commonwealth -Government. Western Australia -Suggest that existing machinery be used. State is agreeable to pay half. Tasmania -Reply was received on 9th July that no unusual distress existed at .that date. made available for Western Australia yet? money has actually been made available for Western Australia, but if necessary it can be supplied at once. Newcastle has not received more than £250 out of the £1,000 made available^ would it not be better for the Commonwealth to retain a little control over the destination of the money, instead of simply advancing it to the States for distribution ? Government has accepted the proposal of the Commonwealth Government, but I shall have inquiries made into the aspect of the matter raised by the honourable member. The desire, of course, is to have equitable distribution. quently stated that the Wheat Pool account has been overdrawn to the extent of £17,000,000 or £18,000,000, no statement is ever published regarding amounts that are to the credit of the Pool. Sir Joseph Carruthers, of New South Wales, has pointed out that the publication of such information has an effect on the value of wheat scrip, which is often sold below its real value on account of the credits of the Pool not being known.

I would -not again pass through such an experience -as I have 'had for worlds. It was. something dreadful for me to be stranded here, and unable to get to my home in Tasmania when I should have been there.

Preference in securing passages to Tasmania has rightly been given .to returning soldiers, and the civilians who are stranded here have not one woi-d of complaint to make on that account. Still, something should be done to afford assistance to these people. I impress upon Ministers the importance of this question, and I suggest that they should immediately get into communication with the Government of Tasmania, and see whether, in conjunction with them, something cannot be done to enable these people to reach their homes.

Wilson, Gippsland and Northern Co-operative Society and In surance Company Limited, Flinders-lane, Melbourne; MrW . Purcell, of Greenmount, Queensland; and MrM . A .

There is much unrest in the community, we are told, and the people are complaining bitterly of the cost of living. Butter to-day is from 2d. to 3d. per l b . dearer than it was three years ago, notwithstanding that we have this year a better season. The members of the Butter Committee are "" skying "" the price of butter. They send it oversea with the object, if possible, of creating here an artificial shortage, so that prices may be further increased. I hope that Ministerial supporters will join with us in saying that the consumers should be represented on the Committee. If , on the other hand, they insist that the eighteen members of it shall consist solely, as they call attention to the do, of representatives of the one side, \Quorum formed-.'] then they need not tbe surprised if , when -another Government comes into power, the consumers alone are represented upon it .

They may not have the actual fixing of the price, but the quantity available on the local market is what, to a large extent, determines the price; and they can export as much as they choose, maintaining in Australia such a supply as generally w ill suit their particular purposes. If we are to believe honourable members opposite, the law of supply and demand w ill come, into play, and the price w ill be determined by the quantity available. I do not believe that the law of supply and demand w ill operate at all. of the producers in the industry. The Committee have also power to procure supplies of dairy produce, and put them in cold storage; and this is a useful thing for the purpose of steadying the market. One of the most irritatin g experiences in the ordinary affairs of life is the jumping of the market, and the law of supply and demand, if allowed to operate, has the effect of depressing or raising prices. But the introduction of cold storage has revolutionized the whole system. sequence is that the Committee, with the power to purchase and put in cold storage, have unrestricted opportunities to manipulate the business in their own interests. As the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) has said, their interests are all selfish. the only considerations that w ill in fluence them. chase, storage, and export, they w ill manage the business, not -in the interests of the public, but to their own advantage. That they should fix an unpayable price 13 not contended or expected. I would .be the last to ask any producer to accept an unprofitable price for his goods. But the fact I am stressing is that the persons who will control the home supplies, cold storage, and export, have only one point [Quorum formed.'] of view, and that is not the public point of view. The protection of the public interests should be our first consideration. Regulation 20 in. the first schedule provides that the Committee may fix Lhe Those duties, are so rates of commission which agents may charge, in connection with the sale of butter and cheese. The Committee is composed largely, and may. at any time be composed, exclusively, of men who are speculators in the butter and cheese business. men representing the producers and cooperative companies. on the Pool are dependent upon commission as well as profits, and they may fix their commission at any figure they choose. In fact, the commission may be increased to such an extent as-to seriously increase the price of the commodity. Although the Committee w ill have no The convenience authority under this B ill to proclaim the actual price of a commodity to the public, yet by the operation of many varied authorities they can so control supplies and fix the rates that the public will be lef t without any protection. Is the M in ister ( Mr Groom) aware of the recognition of this principle by other countries? In the Mother Country, by specific act of the Government, not only have they placed representatives of consumers upon the Food Commissions, but they have also placed women upon those bodies. No proThe conperly-constituted Committee, charged with the management of food supplies, can be efficient unless it includes at least one woman.

The two interests are not necessarily in opposition, but we should have a means of conserving the interests of the whole of the people in stead of only one section of the people. The amendment is worthy of serious consideration, and particular attention should be paid by the Government to the right of housekeepers to representation on the Committee. I , too, make a plea for the consumer. WereI one of those who represent the producers on the Butter Pool, I should gladly welcome a representative of the consumers. A f t e r all, the representatives of the producers should not be antagonistic to their best customers-the consumers. Under the Wheat Pool wheat required for gristing in Australia is sold at a price lower than is obtained for wheat sold to other parts of the world. Whilst we have provided that butter shall not be sold in Australia at more than the prescribed price, the Butter Pool Committee will be able to control quantities, and in than way practically control prices. There is a great, temptation to export butter in the fact that the price in Great Britain is from 200s. to 250s. per cwt., whereas butter is being sold in Australia at 170s. per cwt. About twelve years ago, if a dairyman obtained on the English market 120s. per cwt. for his butter he regarded himself as a very favoured individual. To-day he receives in some in stances more than twice that amount. A Committee that represents merely the producers, even though its members be of honest intent, may be inclined to allow too much butter to be sent abroad, because of the higher price obtainable in other countries. In ' o r d er that the Committee may be kept in check, and prevented from sending too much butter out of Australia, the consumers ought to be given representation. I have heard producers protest strongly against the various Pools because they fix the prices in the local market, and l i m it the export. They claim that if the commodities had not been controlled by means of Pools, greater quantities would have been exported, and the producers' would have received a bigger return. But that policy would have l e f t the local market short, and prices would have soared to such a height that it would have been impossible for butter to .be used in the average home. I remember that when the American Fleet was visiting Victoria, the price of butter rose to 2s. 6d. per lb. The consumers took a stand against the inflation of prices! They went on strike for one week. The result was that the cold stores were being filled and the agents were in a dilemma. I am not blaming the farmer or the butter factories. The fact is, that the agents thought they had a chance of exacting an exorbitant price from the comniunity, and increasing their commission proportionately. that has not been done, in connection w it h the Butter Pool. stance of what-has been done in the past. I believe that if the consumer were to ref r a in from buying meat and other commodities in regard to which he is being exploited, he might be able to bring about the same happy result as was achieved in connection w it h butter prices on the occasion to which I have referred. But the Government, who profess to have regard for the interests of both consumers and .producers, should not allow such a situation to arise. W h y should there be any objection to allowing the consumers representation on these Committees as has been done in Great Britain? I believe that every regulation included in this B ill for the guidance of the Butter Pool Committee was drawn up by the Committee itself. Regulation 13 of the first schedule readsI t shall be the duty of the Committee(a) to provide, as far as possible, butter and cheese for consumption in the Commonwealth; (b) to make such arrangements as it deems necessary with regard to sales of butter and cheese to the Imperial Government and other sales for export. There are other provisions enabling them to store butter and allow it to go into consumption as they think fit.

That gives the Committee power to grant certain exemptions. I have no complaint to make *as to that. Suppliers of milk to cheese factories and cream to butter factories should not be denied the right of obtaining cheese or butter at wholesale prices from the co-operative concerns in which tliey are shareholders. It has been said that there are no butter speculators on the Committee. I would like to know the names, of the Committee. It is right that the Government should have a representative on it. three representatives-Messrs. Wilson, and Galbraith. The Commonwealth Dairy Expert has a voice, but no vote, on the Committee. General cannot convince, the people that it is right to exclude representatives of the consumers, whose interests are so much concerned. Where would the producers ho but for the consumers? Butter ought to be sold to the people at a price within the reach of the poorest in the community. No honourable member would deny to the primary producers a fair deal. I believe that tliey only desire a fair deal. I remember how disgusted they were on the occasion of the visit of the American Eleet, when the price was raised by the butter agents. The producers simply ask for a fair average price throughout the seasons of the year, which will enable them to put their industry on a better footing, while giving them a fair return. The bulling and bearing of the market price of foodstuffs is one of the most criminal actions of the day, and the general public will be amazed to learn that the reasonable request put forward to-day that the r-onsiimers should have representation on fhe Butter Committee has been refused by the Government. schedule were not framed by the Butter Committee, as the honourable member has trm, the officer in charge of the Department. exceptionally conversant with the operations of the dairy industry to frame them without any help from those concerned in it. It is quite evident that Messsrs. Osborne, Meares, and others have had some say in the framing of these regulations. It is quite right that an officer of the Government should consult those most . vitally interested in framing regulations dealing with their industry. At the same time, the butter producers do not 'form the whole of the community. The consumers form the greater portion of the community, and they are the best customers for the producers. I am sure that if the latter were allowed to express an Meares, opinion they would vote solidly to allow the consumers to be represented on the Butter Committee. These are times of , suspicion, and prices are soaring. We ought to do something to allay that suspicion, and no better method can be adopted than by appointing representatives of the consumers to the Committee controlling the butter industry. If Ministers do not accept the reasonable request put forward"" to-day, they will stand condemned in the eyes of the general public. . Tbe Government could very well concede the request that three representatives of the consumers-should be appointed to the Butter Committee. Surely the general public are concerned? A t any time the Committee might deplete the home market in order to meet a demand for butter in European markets.. of the Butter Committee to make provision against that sort of thing.

Most of these Committees are far too lop-sided, representing simply one aspect of the concern.

The English price is very high, seeing that a few years ago 120s. a cwt. on the English market was regarded as a golden price for butter. The dairymen participate in the enhanced price obtained in England, and there might be a tendency on the part of the Committee, which represents only the producers, to export more butter and make the commodity scarce on' the local market.

224,,"Mr JOWETT -That does not give thecontention of the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) and the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr show, by quoting a division list, how they Jowett), is it not desirable that the public should be represented on a Pool which deals with a commodity in which as consumers they are so much interested ? The Government representative may make suggestions which are the embodiment of wisdom, but if the matter comes to a test he cannot vote, although he is one of the men to whom the public would naturally look for protection. He knows the quality of butter and what its price should be; he is there as a representative of the Government, and supposedly as a representative of the consumers, and it is absurd that he should have no vote. Honourable members on the Government side who profess to represent the producers, and, I hope, the consumers as well, should be the first to agree to our proposal. I give place to none as a friend of the producers. They are entitled to a fair deal and a fair return for their work. Many of us, including the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) know the trials and troubles of tliose who have to work on farms. ber suggest that the Butter Pool gives the producer too much? The honourable member has answered his own question. There is seething discontent throughout the community, which is made more bitter simply because the consumers are given no say on the Boards and Pools which deal with their food supplies. Our request is absolutely just, and is, not put forward from a party standpoint. Why cannot the Government accede to it? I have shown that the producer is well represented on the Pool. I have given the names of its members, and I have said nothing against. their qualifications, but it is an absolutely lop-sided body. Eveni f our proposal is agreed to it will still be lop-sided, because out of eighteen men, sixteen of whom have votes, we are asking only for three representatives of the consumers. still. same extent. The representatives of the consumers may have an opportunity to made a protest against the action of the majority. particular act of the Committee that has been detrimental to the interests of the consumers ? that would be no argument against putting three representatives of the consumers on the Committee. nating fact. no argument against the representation of the consumers on the Pool. Not one of these bodies can be considered complete unless the consumers are represented on it. This Butter Committee will control the destination of the butter produced and the amount to be kept in cold storage for Australian consumers. They will decide, how many tons shall be shipped abroad to the order of the British Government or other persons, and how much butter shall be sent to China, Java, Japan, and other countries. I , therefore, contend that there should be representatives of the consumers upon the Committee. contribution to this debate will be very brief. I have risen chiefly to show that the action taken by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) meets with the approbation of more than one member of the party on this side. These Boards and Committees watch the interests of the primary producers of the country, and they have done it so well that the consumer has been bled to such an extent as to be shocked at the way in which the Government have dealt with him. Not long ago butter was selling at Is. 10^d. per lb. in Sydney, and yet, withini a month, two steamers left that port each with a cargo of 700 tons of butter.. In view of the high price of butter in the city, the people of Sydney could not understand how that could be, ,and no one could make tbem understand",45,Cheap Food

234,Mr West (East Sydney) [5.16],"M yit. have nothing to do with fixing prices, but they are past masters in seeing that there is an insufficient supply of the various products under their control for local conI t is well known, and at meetings and sumption, and when there is a scarcity of any product in the market its price must go up. All through the Government have shown too great a desire for the protection of vested interests whilst allowing the general community to suffer. When people connected with particular industries are placed on Boards controlling the products of those industries, it is only natural to assume that they w ill look after their own interests. Since the 17th May, 1917, the Government have, zealously guarded the interests of those whom they represent. tunity to serve them. This could not be in the interests of the general community. I have always believed that the primary producers should not be expected to endure the life which many of them have to live, and to cope with their misfortunes without reasonable emolument. It should not be forgotten, however,, that people engaged in businesses in the cities also have misfortunes to face. The Government, by their anxiety to consider the interests of those who assisted them at the last elections, have supplied the Opposition with good campaign material which will be available when next go before the country. They have been so persistent in the course they have followed that it is useless to expect them to adopt a different course now, as they probably w ill not consider it expedient at the eleventh hour to take up a different position. I endorse the action of ray Leader on this occasion; it w ill show that, however the Government may disregard the interests of the masses, honourable members on this side have not lost their sense of duty to the people as a whole. I venture to predict that when the next elections take place the Government w ill regret that they did not give consideration to the proposal made by the Leader of the Opposition. I think we should have a quorum. [Quorum formed.'] It seems to me that Ministers tell us that these Boards to-day we have another evidence that this Parliament is in its dotage, and is not carrying on the business of the country as the majority of the people outside desire. elsewhere, vehement expression is given to the belief, that the Government must accept the whole of the blame for appointing in charge of the Butter Pool eighteen men whose natural sympathies are on behalf of the interests they represent and against the interests of the consumer. The policy of Protection that is called for to-day is very different from that which was advocated in the past. The time was when the New Protection was sneered at by honourable members, many They have missed no opporof whom have disappeared, and some of whom are behind the Government to-day. The New Protection policy was that the producer should be adequately protected by the assurance of fair prices; that the seller, the intermediary between the producer and the purchaser, should have a chance of making fair profits, and that the great mass of the people should also be protected by a price list. The adoption of that policy would prevent the profiteering that is rampant to-day. No honourable member on the oftier side can deny that the cost of living is unduly high. we In dealing w i th the question of butter, it should be remembered that the great market of. the dairymen and small farmers is to be found here in Australia. Fourfifths of the butter produced in this country is locally consumed. I remember that on oneoccasion a man of rugged speech and splendid eloquence, when ad« vocating the protection of the interests of the community, was asked where the producers would find their markets. In reply, he placed his hand upon his stomach, and said, "" Here is one market, and I have seven little ones at home who will find seven other markets for the produce of the country."" The Government have nominated eighteen men to control this Pool, and not one of them is a representative of the consumers. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) has suggested that three representatives of the consumers should be appointed to the Board. They would, if appointed, have",46,Cheap Food
235,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [5.23],"only offlie-sevefflith of the voting power, and surely the representatives of the producers and sellers could have no objection to that. I have in my possession a book upon the Trusts of Australia. Some honourable members on the other side liave sneeringly asked, "" W h e r e arethe profiteers?"" They have only to go outside, and they will get their answer from the humblest girl who earns her living in a factory, if they ask her what she pays for her blouses or her stockings.

We know that when wool is sent to Europe, people have to pay for the d i r t that is in it . The wool kings affirm' that they are not responsible for the high prices of woollen goods. They receive a flat rate of Is.. 3£d. per lb. for their wool, which is, I think, a very fair price. But, obviously, such a rate does not explain the excessive cost of every article of woollen material that is in daily use. Manifestly a very considerable leakage must occur between the wool grower and bhe consumer. Why do not the Government fix prices for woollen goods which will be fair to the consumer ? By way of illustration, let me point to the position of those unfortunate returned soldiers who were .inveigled' into weaving what is familiarly known as ANZAC tweed. men of his war services, the amount of that pension was deducted from hi3 earnings at the tweed factory. Such a statement seems almost incredible,but everybody knowsthat it is a fact. Thus, if a man were in receipt of a pension of 15s. per week,, he was allowed to earn only an additional 27s. per'week. Some timej ago the StateW a r Council deemed it advisable toi withdraw from this tweed factory the gentleman who was in charge «of it. Thereupon the Repatriation Department took <»ver the factory, and sue-, ceeded in making a pretty muddle -of the whole business. All that these returned soldiers asked for the splendid handwoven tweed which they produced was 2s. per yard as it l e f t the factory. But W h a t is the quality'! the Repatriation Department stepped in amount only after the cloth has been shrunk. n Now a yard of cloth off the loom will shrink, perhaps, to the extent of a quarter or a third . 1 The Department, therefore, was snipping from these returned soldiers Some one has blamed the -assumin g that the cloth sustained a shrinkage of 25 per cent -n o less than 6d. per yard. That is an instance of the But the great wool contemptible meanness of which the Department is capable. It also permitted the Government Woollen Factory to supply yarn which was viler than shoddy. Chanter) I miust ask the honourable member to connect his remarks with the amendment. that the meat kings are in no way responsible for the high prices of meat, and that those prices'are due to charges in curred between the time when the meat leavesthe hands of the producer and the period when it reaches the consumer.

242,Mr Jowett,"I recommend every honupon page 99 of his book, saysThe following paragraph appeared in the Melbourne Argus, a journal generally opposed tc any interference with private industry. The figures quoted clearly show the abnormal increase in the price of bread in Melbourne during the past six years. It will be seen that the price of flour has actually decreased 5 per cent., whilst bread has increased 50 per cent. Wages have certainly increased, perhaps, 20 per cent., but that probably represents less than an increase of 10 per cent, in the cost of production of bread. What an advance of £d. per 4-lb. loaf of bread actually means to the master bakers is shown in the following figures :"" It is estimated that an ordinary bakery nses about 5 tons of flour each week, a good many using 10 tons, and some of the largest manufacturers as much as 20 tons. From a sack of 150 lbs. about forty-nine large loaves of bread are made, and from a 200-lb. sack about sixty-five loaves. This is a moderate figure which can be taken as an average, though frequently sixty-six loaves are obtained. . . . "" It is a number of years since bread was. retailed at 7d. per 4-lb. loaf in the northern inner suburbs, and at that time flour was from £12 to £13 per ton. A comparison of the Victorian Mill Owners Association's quotation for flour, and the ruling price of bread, at the end of July for seven years past is given below : End of July, 1907 1908 ... £9 10 0 ... 5d. to 6d. 1909 1910 1911 1912 1913 ... £8 15 0 ... 7d."" honourable member that just as-I wish to see the wheat-farmers of Australia obtain 4s. per bushel at the station for their wheat, so I desire to give the dairy farmers of this country an adequate return for their labours. Ib seems to me that occasion the Government are adopting has been suggested to them that out of a list of twenty-one names submitted for their consideration they should select only three representatives of the consumers. Yet they decline to accede to that suggestion. They themselves do not command a seven to one majority in this House, and surely they might exhibit some little generosity in this matter. If the Government agreed to enlarge Mr Wilkinson, the Committee by the appointment of representatives for the consumers, from eighteen to twenty-one, the consumers would then have only one in seven. ' In Victoria more than half the total population is grouped in Melbourne -and suburbs. It cannot be said that they produce the dairy products of -this country, but they are the consumers, and therefore should receive consideration. If we include the.population in the larger provincial towns, f u l l y three-fourths of the population are, strictly speaking, consumers, but under these regulations they w ill be absolutely disfranchised from representation on the D a i r y Produce Pool Committee. I cannot understand this absence of the spirit of f a i r play on the part of honourable members opposite, because I am quite satisfied that in private business arrangements they would be w ill in g to grant f a i r representation to all interests.'

249,Dr. Maloney,"I am appealing f o rsire now to deal with the profits made by butter factories in Victoria, as indicated by evidence given by Mr Williams before the Prices Commissioner not long ago. It was then stated that the prices formerly fixed hy the wholesale merchants covered the cost of delivery to retail shopkeepers, but that the practice had been discontinued, so that the retailers have to make good the difference, and MrW i l liams was complaining about this matter before the Prices Commissioner. pointed out that the butter factories were making enormous profits ranging from 19 per cent, in the case of the Gippsland and Northern Company to 32 per cent, in the case of the Western District Company, and 91 per cent, in the case of the Victorian Butter Factories These figures, I remind honourable members, were presented by a man who is certainly not a supporter of the Labour party. concerns ? co-operative concerns have no more right than an individual trader to rob the consumer. right to make such enormous profits at the expense of the people. the real profits allowance should be made for the capital cost of cattle, land, and equipment. may be satisfied that the producers are making a profit on stock and plant as well. in Adelaidei n connection with the mixing of butter and margarine. report of the Court proceedings statedCourt to-day the Murphy and McCartney Proprietary Ltd., of Adelaide, were proceeded against on the charge of having on or about November6 sold an article in'imitation of butter, which at the time of the sale was con tained in a package whereon was not placed the legitimate brand or mark indicating the nature of such compound. Francis J. Van Cant said in evidence that he had been in the employ of the defendants as manager of their margarine department. He had made a class of margarine known as butter substitute. When he first made one of these samples, Mr J. G-. Murphy saw it, tasted it, [417]2 I deand remarked, "" How would that margarine show when mixed with butter?"" Witness replied : "" It would stand 15 per cent, without chemical detection."" Later witness was called into the presence of Messrs. Murphy (2), Anderson and witness mixed 12 boxes-si x of butter and six of margarine. One day Mr J. 6. Murphy said to him : "" Two lots of the mixture have been held by the Customs. You had better take the blame for them if anything come out of it. I will give you £500 and a trip to Belgium if you do'so."" Witness : '.' No you don't. I have only made the margarine, but I did not sell it.'' He Under cross-examination by counsel for the defence, the witness said he was now engaged in the margarine business under the name of Belgian Margarine Company. Counsel -Did you get anything extra for doing work which you believed to be dishonest I WitnessI was paid £5 per week overtime. Counsel said Van Cant's evidence had taken him by surprise, and he was granted an adLimited. journment to consider the position. Another case of fraud which came before the Victorian Chief Justice was re* ported in the Agep i Saturday last. The Chief Justice( Sir William Irvine) denounced the whole transaction in unA r e they co-operative measured terms.

The honourable member was the real upholder of the true Labour principle in what he said, and for once in his life my exuberant friend from Maranoa was throwing in his in fluence with the reactionaries. -quite clear that what is intended to tbe' accomplished by the amendment is that small growers of wool throughout the country may be enabled to deal directly and in a convenient manner with small buyers of wool, who can go to their very doors for small consignments and enable a swift and practical deal to be made. The present position gives an undue power and influence those very large concerns whose ramifications the Labour party is desirous of curtailing. Being a practical farmer of many years' for the propaganda . for . the conservation of farmers' rights and interests, I am quite prepared to lend my. wholehearted support to the amendment. It is in harmony with the policy of the Labour party to protect the small farmer against the depredations of those large combinations of capital which' from time immemorial have sought to oppress him. I am unconvinced by the argument of my friend from Maranoa, and although a loyal supporter of his in every division in which I have voted in this chamber, except one, I feel that I must, altogether forgetful of party ties, cross the floor and vote in fraternal sympathy with the honourable member for Werriwa. The arguments which seem to have converted my honourable and learned friend ( Mr Brennan) to support the amendment are such as, if he gave them a little further consideration, would make him more antagonistic to it than he is now favorable to it . He has spoken as if the amendment were intended to deprive rich and wealthy combines of a small portion of the power which they possess, or to take away from them some emoluments they may derive from the handling of the clips of small wool-growers. Many honourable members are evidently under the impression that when small country wool merchants buy wool from small growers, they, in some way, prevent it from being passed through the great wool warehouses owned by big firms. If that were the case I could well underI t is stand the attitude taken up by several honourable members who are supporting the amendment. Therefore, it is necessary that I should explain the position. Under ordinary conditions the great bulk of the wool grown in Australia is consigned direct to the wool-selling brokers who handle it , and in whose warehouses it is appraised. If , instead of this wool being sent direct to the big brokers, a considerable portion of it is bought by And monopoly country wool merchants, it simply And monopoly-to means supporting an absolutely different set of middlemen, because every bale of wool bought by these country wool merchants has still to be appraised in the standing, and having wool-selling brokers' warehouses in years taken an interest in exactly the same manner as if the wool were consigned direct to the wool-selling -brokers by the growers. three or four bales is charged 2^ per cent, commission, whereas if a dozen small lots are put into one, making a big consignment, the charge is only 1^ per cent. there seems to be a misconception upon -that point. Under the present system of appraisement, the consignment of the man w i th 10.0 sheep is appraised to the fullest extent, according to its intrinsic value, just as if the lot represented the wool off 10,000 sheep. Before this system came into operation, there was great need for small country wool merchants, because in the big warehouses small lots of wool were described as star lots, and were sold under totally different conditions from those attaching to the sale of larger lots. It has been a matter for reproach for many years past that, owing to the great powerI think too great power-",56,Pairs

298,Mr Jowtett,"That is the case; butexercised by the wool buyers in the wool markets of Australia, particularly in Sydney and Brisbane, small lots of wool had to be sold at different times, and in a different auction-room from the big lots. In .Sydney and Brisbane, the buyers would not even allow the small lots to be shown in the same part of the warehouses as the big lots. That state of affairs continued until the Central Wool Committee took charge. In those days, the small wool-grower seldom got the f u ll intrinsic value of his wool; but, from the moment the operations .of the Central Wool Committee commenced, exactly the same method of appraisement was applied to the smallest wool-grower in Australia a3 applied to the largest grower, and"" the small man got the full value of his wool, just as if he had consigned the wool off 10,000 or 100,000 sheep. grower from getting the full value, unless it was those big combinations which would be affected by the amendment? The wool buyers of Sydney used to go to Brisbane and dominate the trade there also. In fact, they told the wool brokers that they would not buy in their auction, rooms unless all the small lots of wool were relegated to a different auction room and a different part of the warehouse. Under that system the small grower seldom got the full value of his wool, and it was quite natural that there should come into existence a large number of country wool merchants, who bought up small lots of wool, sorted them, and put them into bigger lots for consignment to the metropolitan wool brokers. As the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lynch) has said, the small wool-grower does suffer a disadvantage at the present moment, owing to the continuance of one of. the customs of the trade which might, perhaps, have been altered. Many trade customs have remained untouched, (because the scheme has always been regarded as a temporary one. The grower of wool who forwards a lot valued at less than £200 pays a higher rate of commission than is paid by the man who consigns a larger quantity. I would be very glad if that charge could be altered. charged ^d. per lb. for classification? some States, but it pays him handsomely to do so. be made when wool has to be resorted, in order to make it fit for appraisement. Although the small wool grower may now be at some disadvantage in having to pay a slightly higher rate of commission, what would he be obliged to pay to the country wool merchant to enable that gentleman to get his profit? It must be remembered that this merchant has to send the wool he purchases to be appraised, and has' also to pay commission, and is thus' compelled to get his profit in between the grower and the Central Wool Committee. 'The small grower would probably pay to the country wool merchant very much more than he would pay in the commission referred to by the honourable member for Werriwa. When a grower sends to Melbourne or Sydney, he has his wool appraised at a fixed flat rate; but if he sells to a country merchant, he never knows whether he is getting the ful l value for his .wool. The country merchant knows much moTe -about the value of wool than does the small wool-grower. rently the middleman is an obnoxious character if he is a small man, but is a very excellent fellow if he is a big man. Alsoi t would appear that the small ""cockie"" is an infernal fool; that, after all these years, he is quite ignorant of the fact that he has been using a public convenience to get rid of his small lots of wool at a loss to himself. Small wool buyers visit every country district. After every shearing there are a number of stragglers with a few bales of wool. Chanter) -Order!

He -saidThey treat us in the most autocratic way. Up till Inst year they demanded cash within fourteen days. No pay within fourteen days, no more sugar. Then suddenly they reduced the term to seven days. I can pay for sugar in any way that is demanded, but I do not Like to be treated too dictatorially. The price went up at the end of last year. The company ascertained then that I had a few tons of sugar in stock, and tliey actually charged me the increased price on my own sugar that I had paid for. We are helpless. They are masters of the situation. They send me a contract, and I return it, simply saying, "" I have no alternative but to accept your contract in detail.""

That may be so, but it also has this effect, that when any of the manufacturers or merchants of tliis country try to buy i m ported sugar at a cheaper rate, paying the duty imposed by the Commonwealth, which is the only limitation upon the introduction of foreign-grown sugar, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company steps in, and says, "" If you buy any foreign sugar, we w ill refuse to supply you with any Australian-grown sugar."" The Company lays down the law to the distributors ©f this country, and says that, in no circumstances, shall they buy sugar from any one but the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. do. is one of the methods of the Trust.

The amendment I hoped to be able to submit on this question would have worked out in this way: that not only should those people whom the Colonial Sugar Refining Company select be allowed to distribute sugar, and, therefore, be allowed to obtain a rebate, but -at the will of the Government any merchant dealing in sugar might be at liberty to claim, the rebate and secure a supply of sugar for distribution. The agreement which the Government are operating with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company not only continues, but strengthens the hold of the company upon distributors of sugar. the honourable member refer? bate given by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to large distributors.

The point is, that the Government are importing anything from 80,000 to 100,000 tons to make up the shortage of locally-grown sugar, and the whole of that imported sugar will be distributed through the agency of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and only the chosen representatives of that company w ill be given the opportunity to distribute it . able member suggest that it should be distributed ? the Government permit supplies of that imported sugar to be available to any merchant in Australia dealing in this commodity, and on the same terms as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company allows to the merchants distributing for it? suggests that the Government should themselves become distributors? an alternative which might be more easily given effect, they should insist-that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company shall not discriminate in the distribution of the imported sugar. The difficulty is that the company exercises suchi a discrimination that it holds a threat of a very serious kind-that of interference w i th business and the service of the community-ove r these men, who would otherwise be inclined, particularly in existing circumstances, to exercise some independent action, and make some effort to supply the requirements of tlie country in sugar. ber not know that all this is done on behalf of the Commonwealth Government, and under their instructions?

W h y should not wealth Government makes no discrimination, but the Colonial Sugar Refining Company does. the Government. Sugar Refining Company act under the authority and control of the Government, and my complaint, therefore, is against the Government, and not against the company. The past records of the company go to show that it has exercised a very severe discrimination. The Government have simply said to the managers of the company, "" You take charge of the distribution of sugar,"" and the company has continued its previous methods. It is able to do that, because it has had unlimited control without any Government supervision. I say that the Government are now responsible because they have authorized the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to distribute sugar under the agreement.

Of course, we know that the legal gentlemen have said it is within the competence of this Parliament to deal with the matters mentioned in this Bill.

In New South Wales the railways all'converge on one port, and the same remark may be made of Victoria. It is time that this, or some other Government, did what is possible to prevent this centralization. ask the Minister to consult the Central Wool Committee, with a view to having wool appraised at-the natural port of the district in which it is grown. LJ -Qolonel ABBOTT (New England) [1Q..5]:-We must recognise that, under, present circumstances, a . B ill such as that, before the Committee is necessary. It is impossible to pass from a state of war to a state of peace by a mere wave of the han.d. I do not believei n price-fixing, ordinarily, but our primary industries are of such magnitude and. ramifications that it is. necessary, at the present time, to have some sort 'of governmental control and organization, in order to prevent their future being jeopardized. Although there have been certain shortcomings in connection with tlie management of the Wool Pool, yet, when viewed broadly, it must be recognised that its creation was one of the finest things ever done for Australia. Had we not had this control of the wool industry, and the contract with, the would have been in a difficult position-, .and would have had ' a much greater problem to solve in regard to the payment of our war bill. necessary that we should know what ia. to happen to the wool-producing industry in the twelve months following the ratification of peace. According:to a report published to-day from the Central Wool Committee-The quantity of appraised wool now-in the Commonwealth awaiting -shipment overseas -is12X.266 ibales of the season 1917-18, and 1,211,427 bales of the season 1018-10, or a totalof 1,338,093 ibales, representing a value of, approximately £28,772.027-. carj-.y-ovcron 30,th June,1920; of appraised wooll for* shipment be considerable-and ' there? is a probability of this being the .case-it will constitute a serious menace to the resumption of auction sales during the first season following the -termination of the control .period. Honourable members can realize what the difficulty w ill . be in regard to finding:a market and shipping our wool overseasimmediately the agreement with the British Government ceases. the honourable member should penalize bis constituents to the extent of 2s. 6d. per I bale by concentrating all the appraisement work in Sydney? Lt -Colonel ABBOTT --If I had m y way, there would be several appraisement, towns in my electorate. The report oifthe-Central Wool Committee continuesAnd the Comimi.ttce warns wool-growers of., the-position that .is likely to arise in market-, ing the Australian clip for the season 1920-21 iii the event of a large carry-over of Imperial Government woplS.. Therefore, the continuance of the Wool Pool is absolutely necessary. But there are some things in regard to the control by the Central Committee to which I : take strong exception. There is i u the policy of the Committee too much centralization. Wle talk every day about decentralization; but the power given to the Central Wool Committee is adding to the. evil of centralization.

Under the present system, if I have f l ' 5 worth of wool for sale in the country, 1 must ship it to Sydney or Melbourne. If that wool had been classed in the country, scoured, bulked with other wool, and made into a decent sample, it would have been carried ou the railway at truck rates when it was sent to Sydney. the Central Wool Committee is paying ordinary bag rates for unscoured wool, 75 per cent, of which, in some cases, is filth. The effect of that policy is to take money out of tlie pocket of the small "" cockie "" farmer. We are continually advising the Government to put men on the land. A great many people have an idea that farming and grazing is the only industry in which a man does not require knowledge and experience. What is the greatest cause of centralization to-day? When country boys and girls leave school, the only place in which they can find employment is the ordinary general store. It is necessary for boys or girls with any ambition to go to the city to get further ahead. are established in country towns in which technical training is required they w ill remain in the country, and not flock to the cities.. received in country stores goes back to the city. with which I am acquainted, there are thirty or for t y men employed in a boot factory. That industry is doing more for decentralization than all the rest of the establishments in the town, because it serves to keep the young people from the city and finds them local employment. Every time the Central Wool Committee shuts down a country industry it is adding to that great curse of this country-centralization . encouragement to our boys and girls to remain in country districts, but we can only do this by providing work for them there. Committee has the opposite tendency. The work of woolscouring and tanning is being centralized in the cities where the wool is appraised, adding to the employment there, and depriving country towns of industries which could very properly I can say why be carried on in them. I have not the time nor the opportunity to refer to butter and other matters, but it seems to me that this B ill is necessary, and that, although it is not perfect, it is in the circumstances as perfect a measure as can be got. It is remarkable that, although honourable members of the Opposition have raised objections to it , they did Instead, not appoint any one to represent the in terests of the growers on the Wheat Pool which their Government established. Honourable members opposite know as well as I do that it is a matter of absolute i m possibility to deal with profiteering and the high cost of livin g u n t i l this Parliament receives from the people of Australia by means of an amendment of the Constitution extended powers to enable it to deal with trade in the different States, and all the complex questions arising out of the commerce of a continent. [10.20] -With some surprise I listened to the passionate and violent attack made by the Acting Leader of the House( Mr. If , on the other hand, industries Groom) on the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) and the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs).

441,Mr Mathews (Melbourne Ports),"able mernber was not only unfair to the Leader of the Opposition, but had no ground for the points he sought to establish. I was waiting to hear a statement from Ministers as to whether it was intended to seek further powers from the people at the next election with a view to dealing in a comprehensive way with the exploitation of the community. Every day the newspapers tell us that profiteering, which is the cause of all industrial unrest, is being carried on in an extensive way in all countries of the world, and that every Legislature is being entreated to take steps to prevent it, yet our Ministers give us no hint that they intend to apply to the people for power to deal with it in a proper manner. that proposal up their sleeves. whether that is so, but there is every evidence that an election will be held at an early date-probabl y this year. his programme back. Mi-. MATHEWS Yes, as soon as the. Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) returns there will be wars and rumours of war. He has informed us that he is coming back to flight his enemies on both sides, I presume. As with the K i l kenny cats, there will only be tails left at the end. I know him, and if he is defeated in getting his desires, come what may, he will be uppermost. He has control of the House, and he is the only man in Australia who can appeal to the Govern or-G eneral. Johnson) I ask the honourable member to connect his remarks with the Bill. able to ask the people for further powers to deal with profiteering and the fixation of prices at the next election unless a Bill to amend the Constitution is brought in very shortly. that matter has nothing to do with the third reading of this Bill. bow to your ruling. During the whole of the debate the question of the exploitation of the people has been discussed, but the Acting Leader of the House( Mr -Groom) said that under the Bill the policy of fixing prices could not be perpetuated. My answer to that is that there is evidence all over the world of the necessity for giving this Parliament power to extend the controls exercised under the Bill. The only way to do this is to make preparations for appealing to tlie j>eople. Profiteering is going on all over Australia. Contracts were made by the Government during the war time in the interests of the people and to prevent profiteering. If that was good for the country while the war was on, it will be good for it for all future years; but the Government are not sincere. They are looking only after the interests of a few in placing this Bill before the House. If they desired to do what was essential, with their knowledge of the industrial and commercial troubles caused all over the world by profiteering, they would take action to secure for this Parliament the power to deal with the whole subject constitutionally and comprehensively. As it is, they have never given us even a hint that tliey intend to apply to the people for that power. I regret that I had no opportunity to move in Committee an amendment of which I gave notice, but I ask the Acting Leader of the House( Mr Groom) now to consider the purpose of that amendment, which was to insure that all fellmongers in the Commonwealth shall be fully employed before skins are allowed to be exported to other parts of the world. That is a fair request, because every honourable member wants to see local industries kept at full speed. Will the honourable gentleman give instructions to the Wool Committee that the local fellmongers must be fully employed before any skins are exported? The fellmongers in my district, and other districts, are not getting skins, because dry skins are being exported. That should not be the case in a country like this. I believe the Ministerial party, as a whole, w ill endorse my remarks.

I invite them to assist .the Government in carrying it through in all its stages early next week. It is an important Bill, affecting very serious interests, and I am therefore anxious to get it placed upon the statute book as quickly as possible. On Thursday last the Acting Minister for the Navy( Mr Poynton) placed before this House a shipbuilding programme, covering the Government shipbuilding operations up to date, and embodying as a first instalment, an expenditure of £10,000,000. That statement has arrested public attention in all the States more than has any other recent Ministerial pronouncement. It suggests the creation of another huge Department of State, whether it be approved or not by Australia as a whole, and the magnitude of the undertaking warrants the House being afforded an opportunity of exhaustively discussing it. This is not the time for a private member to initiate any such debate. I merely rose to ask the Ministeri f he could fix a date when this House will be afforded an opportunity of carefully examining the whole of the shipbuilding proposals of the Government. No Bill has yet been presented giving the Ministry authority for the construction of these vessels. All that has been done has been by way of administrative act. Now that we have reached the post-war period, I think we are entitled to ask for a disclosure of the connection. At any rate, I am not prepared to take a bite of £10,000,000 off a nationalization proposal without first being afforded the fullest opportunity for discussing it. The purchase and construction of the vessel to which we previously agreed was recognised as a war-time necesclearest declaration of policy before any further step is taken. Whilst Parliament is sitting I cannot sanction the construction of £2,000,000 worth of ships as an Executive act without first securing legislative authority for it. I enter my emphatic protest against the adoption of any such course. ister for the Navy) [10.52] -On e would think that the announcement of the shipbuilding programme of the Government came before the House last week for the first time.

Yet there was no dissent expressed by the honourable member.
