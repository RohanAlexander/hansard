Thursday, 13 May 2010 ----Petition: Medicare Ms MARINO (Forrest) (9.30 am)-I rise to table a petition by constituents from my electorate of Forrest who strongly oppose the Labor government’s decision to remove item numbers 50124 and 50125 from the Medicare Benefits Schedule. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: The thousands of Australians who, each year, have aspiration of, or injection into a joint. We therefore ask the House to: Review the Labor Government’s removal of item numbers 50124 and 50125 from the Medicare Benefits Schedule which provide for the aspiration of, or injection into a joint. Consideration should be taken into the impact the cutting of the Medicare rebate will have on the thousands of affected Australians. from 365 citizens Petition received. removing these items from the MBS and forcing them to pay the full cost of the treatment is unfair to them. The Labor government is making patients needing such joint injections pay the full costs. During 2008-09 approximately 550,000 services were provided under the item numbers that have been removed. I understand that this was protested by the Australian Rheumatism Association, Arthritis Australia and many others. Principal petitioner and affected local Forrest resident, Kerry Prestage, said that joint injections play a crucial part in the treatment of her arthritis. Kerry has had to live with the effects of osteoarthritis every day since she was 28 years of age and these injections have been an important part of managing her condition. Kerry said: With joint injections, patients have fewer complications and their joints are better preserved. Patients using joint injection therapy do not have the permanent damaging effects on organs such as the liver, spleen, pancreas and stomach-something Ms Prestage has unfortunately fallen victim to. She does not want to see other osteoarthritis sufferers have the same problem. On that note, I would like to take this opportunity to make very special mention of Ms Prestage and to thank her for her very hard work and effort in collecting the signatures for this petition. I note with great concern that there was frustration that this measure was taken by the government without consultation and without regard, in the view of my constituents, to the impact on them as patients-particularly senior Australians. The AMA, individual doctors, the Australasian College of Sports Physicians and the Australian Orthopaedic Association, as well as Arthritis Australia, all oppose this measure. In conclusion, like the many constituents in my electorate, I am urging the government to review the removal of these items from the Medicare Benefits Schedule. MAIN COMMITTEE",139,Business

I would also like to mention a particular group in my electorate that makes a significant contribution to the social fabric of the community through their volunteering. Last week I had the honour of the visiting the Narre Warren SES, led by Tim Howell, to meet four of the dedicated volunteers there. The unit has only been in existence for five years but has already made a massive contribution to the local community. The volunteers are not that different from many Australians-they come from all walks of life; they are retirees, nurses, graphic designers, tradesmen, mothers and fathers-but their contributions and personal sacrifices are extraordinary and for that they are extraordinary people and understated heroes, a very quintessential Australian trait. As an example, in late August last year Melbourne was hit with one of its most savage storms in recent memory. Some areas of the city reported winds of up to 128 kilometres per hour. Blackouts and hail were widespread and falling trees caused significant damage. When events like this occur across the country, when trees fall across roads and on people’s homes, when storms damage roofs, when floodwaters overwhelm suburbs and streets, in the heartbreak of attempting to locate a missing loved one-someone’s mother or father, daughter or son-there is a special group of people to whom the community turns for help. This is the work that the dedicated volunteers that I just mentioned do. Volunteer services like the SES comprise thousands of Australian’s across every state who volunteer their time to help. They do not do this to be recognised in this place and they do not do it for money. Giving the State Emergency Service and its many volunteers some public recognition for their selfless efforts is in my view a small but important gesture we can make as members of parliament. It is particularly pertinent given that this week is National Volunteer Week. During the storm I mentioned, the Narre Warren SES received over 260 calls in a 12-hour period, making them one of the busiest units in Victoria. That was only one incident. The unit’s commander, Tim Howell, and his 27 members work tirelessly to ensure this support can be provided 24 hours a day every single day of the year. It is worth remembering that, in order to perform this support, dedicated members are required to take time away from families, friends and jobs. It is also important to remember and pay tribute to the partners, children and other family members who tolerate and respect their lives being interrupted by the sound of SES issued pagers breaking the silence to notify members of someone in need. At this point in time. I would also like to pay tribute to the many small businesses that give their staff the time to volunteer to undertake this great work. In this week acknowledging volunteers, I would like to make special mention of the Narre Warren SES and pay tribute on behalf of this place to the work that they do to keep our community safe.

That was done in anticipation of this new performing arts centre. The performing arts program involves drama, dance and music programs. The performing arts centre itself, which has just recently been constructed, includes a dance studio, music rooms and recording studios. The heads of the choir department, Sheila Randall and John McPherson, did very well on the day. The head of the arts department is John Foreman and the head of the dance department is Kellie Thompson. They are all doing a fabulous job at Wanneroo Senior High School. I have been informed that Lauren Tarver, who is in year 11, is currently short listed in the national competition for songwriting and is working on a songwriting project. Again, that just goes to show the strength of the performing arts program at Wanneroo Senior High. John McPherson was telling me on the day that the choir has been performing at the local shopping centre and will perform at a big competition at Burswood in the month ahead. I wish them all the best for that event. Apart from the performing arts, the Wanneroo Senior High School also has a very strong Australian Rules football program, which has been running for four years very successfully. They are a dominant force in Australian Rules football in the northern suburbs. Justin Burt is the head of that program and they are doing very well there. I would like to take this opportunity to commend Pauline White, the principal of Wanneroo Senior High School, for her leadership, and Ros Ford and Grant Brown and all of the staff at Wanneroo Senior High for the direction that they are taking the school in. I believe it is a very positive direction and the positive influence of Wanneroo Senior High and the students from Wanneroo Senior High will be a great asset in the years ahead for the Wanneroo district. Blaxland Electorate: Government Services people come into our office looking for help they really do not care about the three different tiers of government; they just want help. They get pretty frustrated when you tell them that their problem is a local government or a state government issue and refer them off to the local state member or the local council. That is why I am organising an event that brings all government services-local, state and federal-together under one roof. On 10 June between 6.30 pm and 8.30 pm 20 different government agencies will come together at the Bankstown Town Hall. They include Centrelink, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, Medicare, the Australian Electoral Commission, the Australian Taxation Office, Housing New South Wales, New South Wales Police, New South Wales Fair Trading, New South Wales Health, New South Wales Department of Ageing, Disability and Home Care, Legal Aid, Bankstown Council, Bankstown TAFE as well as local organisations like the Bankstown Family Relationship Centre and a local financial counselling organisation, Creating Links. It is a government services one-stop shop. Doing this will help people who need help from a number of different government agencies-local, state and federal. In Bankstown unemployment is double the national average. Teenage unemployment is 44 per cent. Over 11,000 people are on Newstart and youth allowance, 18,000 are on the age pension and 33,000 receive family assistance. Bankstown Centrelink makes 88,000 regular payments.

186,Mr Clare (Blaxland,"Parliamentary Secretary for Employment) (9.39 am)-Whenlink, Housing, TAFE or financial counselling support. That is why putting all of these services in the one place makes sense. Bankstown is also one of the most culturally diverse places in Australia. It is home to people from 130 different countries who speak more than 60 different languages. As we know, navigating through government departments and through three different levels of government can be hard when English is your second language. That is why we will also have resources there on the day to help people from non-English-speaking backgrounds. I particularly want to thank the Mayor of Bankstown and the state member for Bankstown for their help in putting this event together as well as all the different government departments and non-government organisations that are making themselves available to help the community after hours. It is a simple idea and, hopefully, it will do a lot of good. Building the Education Revolution speak to the House about my concerns over the BER program. First of all, I congratulate Berwick Primary School council president Jason Barlow, Belgrave South Primary School council president Steve Bills, Berwick Lodge Primary School council president Richard Power, and I cannot forget the Principal of Berwick Lodge Primary School, Henry Grossek. They have been staunch in their outright rejection of the BER process and the rip-offs and rorts associated with it. An article by Kimberley Seedy titled ‘Belgrave South students left in the lurch by building delays’ said: The school received $2.5 million for the project … … … Steve Billsthe school council presidentsaid the entire school community was frustrated by the process. Construction was scheduled to start last December and five classes were moved from the site that will house the new centre. It was only when we got the local media involved that all of a sudden we had a construction date. The article continued: Mr Bills said he was angry new buildings had already been built at independent and private schools while they were still waiting. He said there was no flexibility in the building project, and there were many local builders who could have done the work quicker and cheaper. An article by Jade Lawton of 6 May 2010 quoted Henry Grossek, who said: … schools were getting poor quality “Bi-lo barns” at exorbitant prices. At his school they were initially told to rip down a brick gymnasium that had wooden floors and replace it with concrete floors and something not as good. I have the BER Update from the Berwick Primary School. They are absolutely outraged that their supposedly $2 million project is an absolute rip-off. I have seen what is being built for that money-remembering the school already has the land-and the building being constructed, I think, would cost no more than half a million dollars at best. We took the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, and the national media with us and I can say that everyone was shocked over what was happening there. MAIN COMMITTEE",149,Constituency Statements
187,Mr Wood (La Trobe) (9.42 Am),"For something completely different I am going toI do not know how many times we have to ask the Deputy Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, to intervene. Henry Grossek was assured in a meeting in May last year that the issues would be resolved. They are not being resolved in La Trobe electorate. Remember, this is parents’ taxes at work. It is a disgrace. The government must intervene and must get these situations urgently resolved. Building the Education Revolution the Education Revolution project. Last Friday on 7 May at St Luke the Evangelist Primary School in my electorate of DeakinI was honoured, as was the school, to have the Prime Minister officially open the new discovery centre which consists of an IT centre and a library. There is a National School Pride project as well, which was also part of the opening. The Principal of the school, Deb Egan, has been a wonderful person to deal with right through the project. She has been open about what the school wanted and about how we could achieve it. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 9.46 am to 9.53 am mary School held an official opening of the Primary Schools for the 21st Century and National School Pride projects undertaken at the school. Attending the opening last Friday was the parish priest, Father James Staunton, and nearly 200 students of the school-the whole school was there-along with just about all the parents and a large number of past students, which was especially pleasing to see. The school was originally built in 1962 and, like so many schools in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, it had not had much work done on it since then. In fact, it is the typical old red brick building, with tar covering the ground-not much else. It is all square, very boring and very out of date. The school now has a new library and IT centre with networked computers, where we saw the students learning cybersafety. The school also has a new open-plan library and many other rooms, such as break-out rooms, which students can go to to do other activities during the day. Looking out onto the school’s oval, we saw that most of it is now covered with astroturf. It has a running track, a volleyball court, a playing field and even a giant chessboard, where I think I lost, playing a game against the students-but it was an interesting experience. The school toilets and the staff amenities have been upgraded. The old square quadrangle that was previously covered in asphalt is now landscaped and has nice green mounds of astroturf for the kids to play on. This is a great improvement to the school and certainly makes a huge difference. I know that the school community is over the moon about it. I think it looks wonderful and is a great example of what can be done with funding from both the P21 and the National School Pride program. There was also employment for local subbies and builders on the job, with up to 30 working at the school on any one day. Even more importantly, these are only two of the 24,000 BER projects that are currently running Australia wide, and many of those are in my electorate of Deakin. The developments at Blackburn Primary School and Burwood East Primary School will open very soon, and I look forward to being there on the day. MAIN COMMITTEE",150,Constituency Statements

189,Mr Symon,"As I was saying before we were interrupted, Saint Luke the Evangelist PriCook Electorate: Cronulla RSL Memorial Club Mr Terence James Crowe service of Terry James Crowe to the Cronulla RSL Memorial Club. Terry just recently retired as president of the club, after more than 14 years in that position, and gave his final president’s report to the club AGM earlier this year. During his many years of service to the club Terry Crowe has held the positions of director, junior vice-president and senior vice-president. Terry steered the club through many challenges over his years of leadership, and his clear vision, strong leadership, reliable skills and passion for community service ensured that he passed on the club to the new president, Ian Bourke, in very, very good shape. Last month I attended the ANZAC Day dawn service in Cronulla, which was well attended once again, with thousands of people from right across the community, young and old, including many of the members, obviously, of the Cronulla RSL sub-branch, of which Terry was also a member and continues to remain active. Terry served with the Royal Australian Air Force during the Second World War, between 1943 and 1945, and he obtained the rank of flight sergeant flying instructor. A special presentation was recently held for Terry at the memorial club AGM in March and then again at the sub-branch general meeting in April. He was presented with a framed memorial plaque depicting his military service and an insert of him as memorial club president. During his younger years Terry had a very successful career in business. He was employed as an accountant, then as a sales representative and finally as a manager. He went on to serve as the director of a number of local clubs, including the Miranda Builders and Businessmen’s Club and the Woolooware Golf Club, before becoming president of the Cronulla RSL Men’s Bowling Club. I also understand Terry was also a sportsman who in his later years gave up his time to serve in an administrative role with a number of sports clubs. He has had an association with rugby union, rugby league and surf-lifesaving over the years. Last September I rose in this place to mark the 65th anniversary of the Cronulla RSL Memorial Club and I paid tribute to Terry and his staff for the fine job they were doing for Cronulla and the wider Shire community. That challenge now passes on to Ian Bourke and his new board. Ian is also well respected in the community and I am sure will do an outstanding job with his new team of directors-both those who have come from the previous period and those who will now serve into the new period. An example, once again, on ANZAC Day was the coffee and refreshments they provided at the memorial club-as well as shelter from that very adverse weather that morning-where veterans and families from around the Shire gathered together to pay tribute to those who fell in service of our country. The memorial club in Cronulla is a real icon of the Shire community. It has had great leaders. Terry has lived up to the fine tradition of those leaders and we thank him for his great service to our community.

190,Mr Morrison (Cook) (9.55 Am),"I rise this morning to acknowledge the many yearsAustral-Korean Cultural Foundation’s Visual Art and Essay Writing Competition that was held on the banks of the Lane Cove River. It was an event that was exceptionally well organised by the foundation’s chair, Mr Phillip Min, and fellow foundation members. It was a lovely day and a beautiful setting and was clearly designed to bring out the muse among the contestants-the children and young teenagers who are keeping their Korean language skills alive and brushed up in Saturday morning classes. passionate advocate for Korean Australians, and I see him regularly at community events. This coming Saturday another champion of the Sydney Korean community, Agnes Shim, will host the annual Korean Women’s Day at St Anthony’s Church Hall in Marsfield. Agnes is president of the Sydney Korean Women’s Association, which was founded in 2002. Its aim is to promote a better understanding of Australian society and to provide much-needed settlement services to the Korean community. Agnes and her right-hand woman, Sue Yeon, also provide information and referrals, family support, employment counselling and much-needed disability services to many members of the community. They also provide a variety of recreational programs. Importantly, the Sydney Korean Women’s Association is based on a commitment to social justice and to multiculturalism. As I told my Korean friends last Saturday, the concept of multiculturalism is fundamental to what I stand for and to my colleagues in the Australian Labor Party. We do not seek to debate it; we are proud supporters of the concept of multiculturalism. I have believed always that we must maintain a strong and vocal commitment to a harmonious society in which people care for their neighbours and a society that promotes understanding across the cultures. I thank these Korean community champions and others, like the wonderful Young Byun of the Christian Community Aid service in Eastwood, who not so long ago brought to parliament a group of vibrant Korean seniors. All of their work is greatly appreciated and I thank them for it. Landcare throughout Australia to ask a few simple questions of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. On Tuesday night the Treasurer announced an $11 million cut in spending on Landcare, as part of an $80 million cut to the Caring for our Country program. The first question is: why? Why does this government, which pretends to care about the environment, target the people who actually get out on the ground and undertake practical environmental work? Unlike the bureaucrats in Canberra and the ministers who back this decision, these volunteers are the people who are actually on the ground, getting their hands dirty and getting the job done. These are the practical environmentalists of our nation. They are out there doing revegetation work, erosion control and removal of weeds and assisting in pest animal control. The list of works they undertake is endless. Cutting Landcare funding by $11 million is a kick in the guts to every volunteer who has given up a Sunday morning to plant trees, to remove weeds or to otherwise make a difference to the environment in their local community. Why was Landcare targeted when the same budget announced a $15 million climate change advertising campaign as part of more than $120 million for government advertising this year? It is so typical of the Prime Minister and this government: all talk and no action. They would rather run a propaganda campaign talking MAIN COMMITTEE",152,Constituency Statements

192,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (10.00 Am),"I rise on behalf of 100,000 Landcare volunteersabout the environment than support the practical and direct environmental action undertaken by our Landcare volunteers. It is with a sense of enormous frustration that I make my comments here today. Landcare is an organisation that has enjoyed bipartisan support across its 20 years of history. It is an Australian icon, the envy of many nations throughout the world. It is an organisation that has stood the test of time. Landcare volunteers want to know if the current minister even tried to protect them from these budget cuts. Did he even put up a fight? Did he kick down the doors to the Treasurer’s office and demand a fair go for Landcare? SomehowI doubt it. Just as the Prime Minister is too gutless to govern, just as the Prime Minister runs away from a political fight and sends out junior ministers to announce any bad news, the minister for agriculture has form when it comes to Landcare. He has allowed the number of professional facilitator positions across the country to be slashed and now he has allowed an $11 million budget cut this financial year. The volunteers, like me, are frustrated. But they are also angry and disappointed. The National Chair of Landcare, David Walker, has publicly criticised the decision and there will be many more critics to come-including people like Robert Belcher. Robert Belcher has chaired the Snowy River Interstate Landcare group in Victoria for 20 years. He told ABC Rural this week: This is a continuation of the slide downwards and the money flow going through the natural resource sector is being cut and I agree with the NFF … we are poised and involved with stewardship type programs to try and encourage more sustainable farming exercises given the necessity to produce food now and into the future … But the Rudd government doesn’t really understand rural communities and don’t think it understands the Landcare network and how powerful that can be. That is the crux of this issue. This government does not understand regional communities. It does not understand Landcare. It would rather run advertising propaganda campaigns than support practical environmental action. I urge the 100,000 Landcare volunteers and the 4½ thousand Landcare groups to swamp their local newspapers with letters to the editor, to call talkback radio, to write to their local Labor MP and to send this government a message that they are sick of being taken for granted. (Time expired) Victorian Bushfires Services and Parliamentary Secretary for Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction) (10.03 am)Since the bushfires of 7 February 2009, I have witnessed amazing stories of courage and generosity. Australians have donated $400 million to the bushfire appeal fund and, as well, volunteers have donated countless hours and have fed, clothed, housed and fenced people in the aftermath. The federal government has also expended in excess of $400 million on support and assistance and is working alongside the Brumby government and the Bushfire Recovery and Reconstruction Authority. I have met with many people who have shown a quiet but immense resilience as they have tried to rebuild their homes and their lives. These are people who have lived through more tragedy and heartbreak in the last 15 months than most of us, if we are lucky, will ever be touched by in a lifetime. These are people who have inspired and led others simply by the determination they have shown by starting again. MAIN COMMITTEE",153,Constituency Statements
193,Mr Shorten (Maribyrnong,"Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’sHowever, sadly, I wish to put on record today my concerns about the conduct of a small minority of private builders operating in bushfire-hit areas of Victoria. I believe there are some who are taking advantage of people in desperate circumstances, some who are forcing people to live in sheds for longer periods than they should whilst they wait for their houses to be rebuilt. I believe there are some builders-a minority, I hasten to add; there are many good stories-who are forcing people to go through another winter not in their new home. I believe there are some who are cynically ripping off their fellow Australians in a time of need. I believe that the taxes and the charity gifted to families is in danger of being fleeced by unscrupulous, exploitative operators. I have now, in the last two weeks, uncovered too many stories of builders failing to complete work, of overcharging and of leaving valuable housing equipment on sites to deteriorate in the environment as they are unable to complete the promises that they made to their customers upon signing contracts. These emerging stories are too numerous to be ignored. Deliberately or perhaps just recklessly through an excess of optimism by the builder, people are facing difficult circumstances with a lack of money and unfortunately we are witnessing tactics which are bringing the building sector into disrepute. I understand the decision about whether to return to a bushfire damaged community is a deeply personal one and one that many people are still making. But there is a strong movement of people going back to these towns to rebuild their homes and lives and indeed of new people moving into these areas. There have been 1,386 new building permits issued for new dwellings in bushfire areas. But I believe we need better compliance, and I will be raising it with the state government, to offer consumers substantial protection, which they deserve, in Victoria. We need to have advocates working on behalf of victims. We need the relevant authorities to be visiting the sites and forcing compliance to contracts. There will be talks starting with the Building Commission, the Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority, the Master Builders Association and the Housing Industry Association to work out how we can encourage compliance. I am disappointed by some of the stories emerging from Kinglake but we will remedy the problems. 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded. Intelligence and Security Committee Report Debate resumed. telligence and Security’s oversight of the Australian intelligence community is one of the key elements of our national security architecture. It provides confidence not only to the members and senators in this parliament but to the wider community as providing a parliamentary oversight of what would otherwise be activities that, of necessity, are dealt with largely behind closed doors. I am happy to be able to advise that the committee, in conducting this review, has concluded that the administration and expenditure of the six intelligence and security agencies is sound and I would like to place on record my thanks to the agency heads and all those who MAIN COMMITTEE",154,Constituency Statements

195,Mr Bevis (Brisbane) (10.07 Am),"by leave-The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Inhave contributed to this review. I particularly want to add my thanks for the contribution we received from the Australian National Audit Office. Understandably, the ANAO have a particularly important role in reviewing the financial activities of these agencies. Their report and submissions to our committee are a significant aid in enabling us to better understand and investigate the matters that come before us. I would also like to place on record my particular thanks to the office of the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security and, in doing so, the recently retired holder of that office, Mr Ian Carnell, who has undertaken that work in an exemplary manner. The inspectorgeneral’s office has been a very willing participant in the work of this committee. Its insights, advice and recommendations to the committee have been particularly helpful. There are often misunderstandings of the workload and activities of some of the intelligence agencies that are reviewed by the committee. I thought I would take a brief moment in speaking to this report to refer to one aspect of those activities, and that is the security clearances that are increasingly required to be undertaken. It is perhaps a sad reflection, but nonetheless a necessary fact of life, that increasingly there are various occupations and activities for which our intelligence agencies are required to undertake security background checks on individuals because of the nature of the work they undertake or because of the high-profile nature of events involved. I am not sure that many people actually understand the extent of that requirement. As the report acknowledges, some of the agencies were able to provide the committee with unclassified submissions, which we were able to draw on in our report, and others provided submissions that were classified and obviously were not able to be reported on. So we have tended in this report to talk more regularly about some agencies than others. ASIO have provided a good deal of information in an unclassified format that we were able to report on here. I think most Australians would be surprised to know that ASIO in the year in review conducted in excess of 70,000 security assessments for the aviation security identity cards. That is just in the aviation and maritime industries. That is a substantial workload. In addition, ASIO conducted some 4,500 assessments for those people seeking licences to access ammonium nitrate. Members of parliament will recall that some years ago we legislated to restrict the availability of ammonium nitrate. It is something that is widely used in the rural sector but of course, sadly, is an ingredient of choice for some terrorist activities. ASIO conducted in excess of 1,200 assessments of staff and visitors to the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, ANSTO, which operates the nuclear facility at Lucas Heights. They did in excess of 13,000 assessments for people requiring accreditation for special events such as APEC and World Youth Day a year or two ago. This is a substantial workload that takes a good deal of time for the agencies but nonetheless it is important. I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the extensive work that they do. I am also happy to report that during 2007-08 the agencies were able to advise us that there were no security breaches reported by any of the agencies which resulted in national security classified material being compromised. There were, perhaps understandably, minor difficulties where there were some breaches of protocol but there was no event that compromised national security classified information. MAIN COMMITTEE I also want to commend the agencies for the work they are doing in staff surveys. The agencies have gone through a period of quite dramatic sustained growth. That has had bipartisan support. It began under the Howard government and was supported by Labor in opposition. It is a much-needed boost to those resources. There have been particular difficulties for the agencies in managing the growth and career structures that go with it. They all conduct quite comprehensive staff surveys and have had good responses. It is interesting to see the enthusiasm and the overwhelming support that those who work in the agencies have for what they are doing. That is how we would want it. This is not the sort of employment where you turn up between nine and five to pick up your pay; you do it because you are highly motivated, and I think that is very much reflected in the surveys of staff. The final thing I want to refer to is e-security. This is a matter that the committee has had an ongoing interest in, along with things like electronic passports and their security. E-security is one of the serious challenges that we confront as a nation. It is a challenge for intellectual property for the business community, it is a challenge for governments and, indeed, it is a challenge for this parliament in ensuring the e-security of the systems we all use. It is a challenge that our security agencies are addressing. I know it is a matter that the committee has an ongoing interest in. I commend the report to the House. Debate (on motion by Ms Hall) adjourned. Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 May, on motion by Mr Clare: That this bill be now read a second time. curity Amendment (Flexible Participation Requirements for Principal Carers) Bill 2010. It deals with quite poignant issues in a way for me. One always goes to one’s own personal experience with these things. This bill deals mainly with single parents and with the conditions in which they get support from the community. I can vividly remember my own mother raising me in a single-parent family and there are two things I particularly remember about that experience. The first one is that she went to work. She was a teacher and, right from word go my earliest memories were of her going to work, supporting the family-my sister and me-and it was a good example to set. It is an example that all parents should try to set for their children-to work and to be involved and participate in the community. The second memory I have is of me being very sick. I had childhood asthma and I had to be rushed to the hospital often. This was terribly worrying for my mother at the time. In a way I think she still sees me as that sick little boy. I can remember in particular the strain it put on her as a single parent, trying to juggle work and care for my sister, who was also sick off and on as a young child, so my heart certainly goes out to all single parents who really do struggle. It is very tough to raise children. It is a particularly tough thing to raise them on your own. MAIN COMMITTEE",155,Committees
196,Mr Champion (Wakefield) (10.15 Am),"I rise to support this very important Social SeI meet a lot of single parents in my electorate. They are very good people. They try to work and to participate in the community. I have found them on nearly every occasion to be really dedicated not just to the care of their children but also to participating in our community through paid work, voluntary work and study, and you often find these people picking themselves up from relationships that have broken down. They have got kids and they really do want to prosper and make a better life for themselves and their children. The previous rules were not so much tough as inflexible. I saw a number of my constituents having to deal with being told that they should apply for a job in, say, Noarlunga when they lived in Elizabeth, and that being just completely impractical in terms of picking up the kids from school or finding transport, or for a whole range of other reasons. There was a lot of inflexibility in terms of where you could apply for work. There was also the problem that single parents do tend to work in areas like retail or hospitality and the hours go up and down. You might have 25 hours one week and 10 the next. The previous rules also made it very difficult, I think, for people in casual or part-time employment, because when the hours went down, technically they were required to look for work. So you had a bizarre situation often where people were trying to work, wanted to work, but, because of the nature of their work, they were held up by the rules. This bill really does seek to put a bit more flexibility in the rules for principal carers. It extends the existing 12-month automatic exemption for families with four or more children, for those who are home schooling or have distance education and for eligible families with older children, up to the age of 19, completing their secondary school education. It liberalises the eligibility for the 16-week domestic violence exemption to include parents who remain in a violent relationship as well as those who have left the relationship in the last six months, and that is important and I will come back to that. It recognises the right of respite and emergency foster carers through a new exemption that remains in place for the period of time a child is in the person’s care and for an extended period of up to 12 weeks between foster care placements. That is very important because our child protection system largely revolves around foster carers and, in particular, those who take children in an emergency. This bill also recognises the kinship carers through a new exemption for those who have care of a child under a state or territory case plan. Again, that helps to underpin the child protection system because we know that kinship carers often take a great deal of pressure off the system. So this bill does provide some important exemptions to these fairly tough rules or obligations on these people. It also makes changes to the part-time participation requirements. They allow principal carer parents to meet their requirements through part-time study of at least 15 hours a week or 30 hours a fortnight of contact or non-contact hours. It allows combinations of approved activities, part-time study and part-time paid work as long as the parent is undertaking 15 hours per week of activity. It changes the rules on voluntary work to allow voluntary work alone or in combination with other activities to meet the requirement where parents live in poor labour markets where they have limited training opportunities or where there is a significant vocational aspect of voluntary work. That is an important point because in areas in my electorate which suffer from very high unemployment-and suffered from very high unemployment right through the boom, I might say-people often do not have clear avenues into work, so voluntary work often is the bridge by which people get from no work to paid work. MAIN COMMITTEE This bill also allows principal carers to participate on a part-time basis in the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme that is based around small business and it introduces more flexible arrangements over long school holidays, which particularly gives some relief from the participation requirements during the Christmas-New Year fortnight. That is important because Christmas is a time to spend with friends, family and children. It is a particularly important social occasion but it is also an occasion when there are some stresses on families. We should recognise that people, in trying to celebrate, often put a lot of pressure on themselves. The last thing we want to do is add to that pressure or the obligations over that period. People deserve some latitude during special occasions. I talked a little bit before the domestic violence exemptions, which I think are tremendously important. I would like to take this opportunity to applaud the work of the Northern Domestic Violence Service, which does a great deal of work in my electorate. They are based in Elizabeth South but they work as far afield as Gawler and the rural communities. It is a great service and they have been going for 25 years. I think they would have preferred to have shut down by now but, sadly, there is still demand after all those years. I pay tribute to their dedication over that time. Recently we held a fundraiser with the Deputy Prime Minister for this service, some schools in the electorate and Northern Carers. That was held at Hope Central, a church in Elizabeth South which is a very active and decent group of people. Joe and Jodie Habermehl, who are pastors at the church, and Kathy Tripodi organised a breakfast at very short notice. They have a long history of fundraising in this area, having raised about $40,000 or $50,000 for various charities, including the Northern Domestic Violence Service, and I would like to pay tribute to them. In conclusion, this bill does provide some flexibility but it keeps the obligation for people to be active and to work and to participate in our community. I think that is a reasonable and decent obligation. I commend the bill to the House. Ms ANNETTE ELLIS (Canberra) (10.24 am)-It is a pleasure for me to have the opportunity this morning to speak to the Social Security Amendment (Flexible Participation Requirements for Principal Carers) Bill 2010. With the indulgence of the House, I will say very briefly at the outset that you cannot talk about a bill like this without thinking about the people it is going to affect-a lot of people in the community who live and work under enormous and varying stresses. With that in mind, I wanted to take the liberty of mentioning that I had the privilege this morning of attending the ACT launch of the Salvation Army Red Shield Appeal. I mention it simply because you cannot go to a function like that without hearing the stories of a lot of people in our community, many of whom are affected by this very bill. I want to take the latitude of encouraging all members of this place to get behind their local Red Shield Appeal, because they are fantastic sources of support for these very people. The amendments in this legislation are extremely important. They are in response to the Participation Review Taskforce, which was established by the Hon. Brendan O’Connor MP, then Minister for Employment Participation, and chaired by Patricia Faulkner AO from KPMG, in May 2008. The report was delivered in August of the same year and it made 20 recommendations. The idea of the legislation is to introduce flexibility into employment participation requirements, to help parents balance their parenting responsibilities with those requirements. They will still be required to meet their participation agreements in order to receive income support, unless they are one of the small number that are exempt under this bill. MAIN COMMITTEE Parents will still have to undertake 30 hours per fortnight of suitable activity and will still need to report to Centrelink, as they do now. However, the activities that are now approved have broadened to include such things as part-time study and voluntary work-and I will go into some of the details in a moment. The liberalisation of the 16-week domestic violence exemption, which was just mentioned by the previous speaker, the member for Wakefield, is a very important part of these amendments as well and will provide better assistance to children who have been exposed to domestic violence, regardless of whether or not the principal carer has left the relationship. This is to ensure that the principal carer is able to devote adequate time to children who have been exposed to domestic violence. These principal carers will also have regular contact with Centrelink social workers, and the exemption can be extended at the discretion of a Centrelink social worker. However, the principal carer will still be able to access employment services and participate in activities if they so wish. The government very much recognises that it is very important for parents on income support to remain socially and economically engaged in the community at the same time. They should engage in productive activities outside the home. However, the scope of participation activities really needed to be broader than the ones that were already in place, particularly for parents who are disadvantaged through low education or low skill levels and those who had been disengaged from the workforce, who were more likely to be disadvantaged in the labour market. The changes to participation activities will definitely make the system fairer. I will go into some detail about the changes that this bill will effect but I would like to make some general comments first. It does not matter what part of the economy or the community you happen to live in or participate in to know that today, more than ever, there are enormous pressures on families to try and strike a balance between their employment obligations-or, in this case, obligations to Centrelink-and time with their families and children. Some people think that, if you are in full employment and living a good life economically, you have those choices; you can in fact decide how much time you will or will not spend with your family, community and children. It is a bit unfortunate that they do not understand, recognise or accept that those who are a bit further down that socioeconomic scale are just as entitled to that level of choice and should also be encouraged and helped to spend time with their families and children. It is a very important point that is really brought home to me when I consider the changes that we are making through this piece of legislation. Amongst other things, the bill is going to extend the existing 12-month automatic exemptions for families with four or more children, families who have children in home schooling or families who have children doing distance education, and to eligible families with older children completing their secondary school education. The exemption does not stop principal carers from accessing employment services. The government would still encourage them to do so if they are able. I would call this a very common-sense approach to the amendments. It will also broaden the eligibility for the 16-week domestic violence exemption to include parents who remain in a violent relationship or who have left such a relationship in the last six months. It will also recognise the role of respite and emergency foster carers through a new exemption that remains in place for the time the child is in the person’s care and for up to 12 weeks between foster care and placement. It will recognise the role of kinship carers through a new exemption for those who have the care of a child under a state or territory case plan. MAIN COMMITTEE These are very important steps that will protect children who may have been vulnerable to traumatic domestic situations and who require extra care. The bill will allow principal carers to meet their participation requirements through part-time study of at least 15 hours per week of contact or non-contact hours. It will also allow combinations of approved activities, such as part-time study or volunteer work, as long as the parent undertakes 15 hours per week of those activities-again, thank goodness, very much a common-sense, equal playing field approach. It will allow voluntary work as one of the components to satisfy participation requirements in a poor labour market. Over the years I have had many a comment from people in my community about the inequity of this legislation before the passage of this amendment bill. The bill will allow principal carers to participate in the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme, NEIS, on a part-time basis. It will allow principal carers to take a break from participation requirements over the Christmas and New Year fortnight. I am really pleased to be able to say that. Forgive me, but I think this is one of the most important aspects of the bill, because it actually reflects what the government is trying to do in accepting the recommendations of that review and, as I said a moment ago in my introductory remarks, in actually allowing the people affected by this legislation to lead a life like most of us, or at least giving them the choice to do so. I am particularly pleased to see this common-sense, fair approach. The bill will also allow parents with regular term employment that ceases over the long school holiday break to be exempt, provided their employment recommences after the break-in other words, there is no penalty to them if that is the type of employment they have. This shows a full understanding of their circumstances and is an acknowledgement that the sort of support this legislation can offer is still available to them. These are really important amendments-as I have said, very common-sense and very fair. It allows people who benefit from this type of legislation to actually benefit from it in a fair way along with the rest of our community. It enables them to start making choices the way the rest of us can in that important matter of balancing commitments-between Centrelink, employment, their family, their extended family, their children and their community involvement. It is indeed a pleasure to commend this bill to the House. I am very pleased to see it come through and I welcome it very much on behalf of the people affected within my electorate. cial Security Amendment (Flexible Participation Requirements for Principal Carers) Bill 2010 represents a vital part of the government’s ‘more flexible participation requirements for parents’ 2009-10 budget measure. This measure delivers on the government’s commitment to support the economic and social inclusion of parents by ensuring that all parents on income support have the opportunity to develop their skills, to participate in the workforce and to be treated with the respect inherent in their roles as parents. Before detailing the purpose of the bill, I will take the opportunity to dispute some of the claims that have been made in this debate by the opposition. We should not forget that it was the Hawke Labor government that introduced mutual obligation and penalties as a condition of getting the dole in Australia. From July 2009 to March 2010, this government has imposed 21,189 penalties resulting in a stop to income support. The overriding objective of our policy is to get people into work. The new Job Services Australia is performing very well compared to the former Job Network. On a like-for-like basis about 13 per cent more unemployed peoMAIN COMMITTEE",157,Social Security Amendment Flexible Participation Requirements For Principal Carers Bill 2010
197,Mr Clare (Blaxland,"Parliamentary Secretary for Employment) (10.33 am)-The Sople are getting into jobs, and that is not taking into account the more hostile environment created by the global recession. More than 304,000 job placements have been recorded by Job Services Australia since 1 July last year. Work for the Dole is very important but it is only one of the ways to build skills and get people back to work. Building skills is the key to tackling skill shortages. It is also the key to reducing unemployment in areas where it is highest and where it is most difficult to budge. That is why the government is investing in skills and training: $300 million to build the skills we need for the future through the Critical Skills Investment Fund and the extension of the highly successful Apprentice Kickstart initiative, which were both mentioned in the budget on Tuesday night; $242 million to deliver a better training system, matching the needs of industry and guaranteeing young people a training place; as well as almost $120 million to build literacy and numeracy skills for people in the workforce and looking to get back into the workforce. This investment is about preparing people for work and making sure that they are job ready. Training is now a much more meaningful part of the compulsory participation system for unemployed people. We have already increased the number of unemployed people required to undertake training. From April 2005 to April 2010, the number of unemployed people in training has gone up from 46,000 to 76,000. We have made the employment service system more flexible. A key change has been to allow the professional employment services to decide how best to get people into jobs. They know the labour market, deal directly with unemployed people and are able to tailor support to suit individuals’ needs. They decide if it is Work for the Dole training or another program that will be best to meet the compulsory participation requirements. This principle of flexibility and tailoring employment services to the needs of individual job seekers with the aim of getting them into a job is reflected in this bill. The government recognises that many parents with participation requirements already meet their obligations through paid work and that these families benefit from the parents’ participation in the workforce. However, many Australian families face additional challenges and the government understands that these activities need to support parents’ individual circumstances, replacing a one-size-fits-all approach. For this reason, in May 2008 the government established the Participation Review Taskforce to consider the barriers to participation encountered by parents in the workforce. The task force undertook extensive consultation with the Australian community and reported its findings and recommendations to government in August 2008. The government has responded to the recommendations of the task force through a range of initiatives designed to support the economic inclusion of parents in the labour force while considering their individual circumstances. The government’s response is contained in this bill as well as in changes to the Guide to Social Security Law and amended subordinate legislation. The government’s changes to participation requirements will help parents to better balance their family and caring responsibilities with their participation obligations by improving their ability to undertake education, training and relevant volunteering opportunities. This will provide greater opportunities for parents to obtain relevant skills, qualifications and work experience and to participate socially and economically in their community. Parents will also be able to report their participation efforts more flexibly by utilising Centrelink’s online and telephone reporting services. MAIN COMMITTEE This bill and the wider measure respond to the concerns of parents that the current system is too rigid and the current participation rules are often counterproductive to their efforts to develop skills, gain relevant experience and find work. The greater flexibility introduced by this measure, together with individually tailored assistance provided through Job Services Australia and the Disability Employment Services network, will ensure that parents are fully supported in their efforts to gain skills and qualifications and participate in the workforce. Parents will still be required to undertake 30 hours of suitable activities each fortnight. However, we recognise that parents can gain skills and employment through many different pathways. Parents with participation requirements will be able to undertake part-time study and combine suitable activities, such as part-time study, part-time paid work and vocationally appropriate voluntary work, to fully meet their participation requirements. The bill will directly improve access to exemptions from participation requirements. This recognises that at times some parents face unique challenges that make it difficult for them to be available for part-time work or study. The existing domestic violence exemption will be extended to provide greater support for victims of domestic violence, regardless of their relationship status, to ensure that the exemption is available when needed. The bill also extends existing exemptions for parents with large families, those who provide home schooling and those parents whose children undertake distance education. These exemptions will now extend to parents who have older children who are still in school, therefore recognising the important role that these parents play in the education of their children. New participation exemptions will be introduced in recognition of the important caring role that kinship and foster carers play in our community, including emergency and respite foster carers. These exemptions will be available where a care plan is in place and which has been prepared or accepted by the relevant state or territory government. This bill provides a sound balance between the role of parents on income support as carers, their participation in paid work, their skill development and their involvement in their local communities. The bill responds to the concerns of Australian parents and provides for greater flexibility for parents on income support in recognition of their most important role, that of being a parent.

198,"Debate Resumed From 25 November, On Motion By Mr Mcclelland:",,163,International Arbitration Amendment Bill 2009
199,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (10.42 Am),"I rise to speak on the International Arbitrationlated to the parties’ requirements and is therefore more likely to preserve the relationship between them. The principal act, the International Arbitration Act 1974, implements Australia’s commitments under the New York Convention of 1958 and the Washington Convention of 1965 and gives the force of law to the UN model law on international commercial arbitration. However, problems have gradually arisen in the interpretation and application of the act over the years, particularly as to the application of competing state legislation and the means by which arbitral awards can be challenged. The amendments effect an agreement with the states for a uniform arbitration legislation scheme based on the UN model law on international commercial arbitration, provide for limitations on court intervention and give clearer guidance on the interpretation of the model law. Miscellaneous amendments will supplement the operation of the model law as it relates to interim measures, disclosure of information, interests and costs. The International Arbitration Act 1974 implements Australia’s obligations to enforce and recognise foreign arbitration agreements and arbitral awards under the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, which was completed in New York in 1958. The act also gives the force of law to the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration as the primary arbitral law that governs the conduct of international arbitrations taking place in Australia. Finally, the act also implements Australia’s obligations under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which was completed in Washington in 1965. The amendments to the act contained in the bill can be divided into four separate categories: amendments to the application of the act and the model law; amendments concerning the interpretation of the act; amendments to provide additional option provisions to assist the parties to a dispute; and miscellaneous amendments to improve the operation of the act. In 2006 the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Model Law adopted the first set of amendments to the model law since it was originally adopted in 1985. With one exception relating to ex parte orders, the bill will apply these amendments to international commercial arbitration in Australia. Section 21 of the act allows the parties to an arbitration agreement to resolve their dispute under an arbitral law other than the model law, as given the force of law by the act. For example, the parties could choose to resolve their dispute under state or territory legislation. This creates significant legal difficulties and confusion concerning the interaction of the different laws. The bill repeals section 21, removing the ability of the parties to an arbitration agreement to nominate an alternative arbitral law. The bill also amends the act to expressly provide that the model law covers the field with respect to international commercial arbitration. In doing so, the bill retains jurisdiction for state and territory supreme courts and confers jurisdiction on the Federal Court of Australia. The bill includes new provisions which are intended to confine the circumstances in which the courts can set aside an award made under the model law or refuse to enforce foreign awards under the New York convention and the model law. The bill amends the act to provide guidance to the courts when exercising powers and functions under the act or the model law, exercising powers or functions under an arbitration agreement or award, interpreting the act or the model law, or interpreting an arbitration agreement or award. For example, the bill reMAIN COMMITTEE quires a court to have regard to the objects of the act and to the fact that arbitration is an efficient, impartial, enforceable and timely method of dispute resolution. The bill inserts an objects clause into the act which emphasises the importance of international arbitration in facilitating international trade and commerce and is intended to guide the interpretation of the act. In addition to giving force to the model law as the primary arbitral law governing the conduct of international commercial arbitration in Australia, the act also provides a range of provisions that the parties to an arbitration agreement may adopt on an opt-in basis and which are intended to help them resolve any disputes between them fairly and efficiently. These provisions address issues such as the consolidation of arbitral proceedings and the awarding of interests and costs. The bill includes a number of additional optional provisions that will be made available to the parties to an arbitration agreement. These provisions cover issues such as the availability of subpoenas and court orders to support an arbitration, the disclosure of confidential information and the death of a party. This is the second amendment that has been made to the international arbitration regimethe first being the Federal Justice System Amendment (Efficiency Measures) Act (No. 1) 2008. Both pieces of legislation seek to increase the attractiveness of Australia as a venue for international commercial arbitration. This is a high-value service in which Australia should enjoy a competitive advantage. Any initiative that seeks to enhance that advantage is welcomed by the opposition. Therefore, we support the passage of this legislation. Ms SAFFIN (Page) (10.49 am)-I speak in support of the International Arbitration Amendment Bill 2009, which was introduced into this place in November last year. I want to thank the Attorney-General for causing a review of the act to be undertaken, after announcing it in November 2008. It was a timely review. I note that the review took into account some 30 submissions, a literature review, court cases and judgments-all manner of things-plus the model law and some amendments that were needed. No doubt the thinking of the Attorney-General and, I would say, the people in the Attorney-General’s Department was also brought to bear on this issue. The predominant thinking around the act is to maintain its simplicity and its ease of take-up, application and enforcement. Yes, it is done within the rule of law but it is not so rule bound that it cannot take account of realities and agreements in the world of commerce. Any changes to the legislation need to be considered within this framework because amending laws can sometimes complicate, not simplify, an issue. I have read the review and am familiar with the act and the conventions. One is the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards 1958. It is also called the New York convention because it was agreed to there. This is often how such things are named-for instance, the Doha Round, the Uruguay Round, the Bretton Woods agreement et cetera. There is also the International Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States from 1965, and the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration is what we call the model law. states face the problem of the diversity of national laws. We should be aware that many states MAIN COMMITTEE are also federal in some form, which brings with it another set of complexities when dealing with any international-national system. This is a common way for states to organise-in fact, it is one of the most common ways. The particular challenges and obstacles that this presents to the free flow of trade was one of the key problems that the commission was given to address. The commission’s mandate is to further the progressive harmonisation and unification of the law of international trade. ‘Harmonisation’ and ‘unification’ are terms that we are well familiar with and they sound good, but in practice they can be very difficult, particularly when we are dealing with 192 states. Australia is one of the 60 states on the commission. People are elected for six years. I think that the terms of the current members expire this year. All of this can seem a bit complex but in practice it works well enough. However, it is recognised that it can always work betterhence the bill before this place. One of the problems we face in multilateral jurisdictions such as Australia is that state, territory and federal courts each apply their own enforcement or absence of procedures. Some parties agree to submit themselves, but they agree in the context of electing certain jurisdictions to be covered by certain arbitration settlement and enforcement rules. I have had experience in negotiating some of those contract agreements by way of leases and licences with major international companies and states-namely, Timor Leste. I have also had experience in working on how to introduce a simple law that sets up a no-frills arbitration system for a state and then getting it off the ground so that business and commerce have some certainty and can work to build capacity vis-a-vis this whole area of trade law and trade capacity. It is challenging indeed. In Australia, the states have their own commercial arbitration acts and tribunals. In fact, I was a member of the New South Wales Commercial Tribunal for a number of years-not that it sat in country New South Wales very much. I was also a member of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal. SoI am familiar with the way in which some of this works at a very local level and how it manifests itself in a variety of configurations. The amendments to the act seek to coalesce some of the matters that I have just discussed and some others that I have not discussed. There are three objectives to be achieved by the amendments. Firstly, they are to provide guidance to the courts in the interpretation of the act. IfI remember correctly-because it was some time ago that I prepared these notes-it currently has none and, I believe, no particular or focused objects either. I think they are now being included. Secondly, they are to clarify the application of the act between the various Commonwealth, state and territory pieces of legislation. Thirdly, they will implement amendments to the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration. The bill also gives effect to enhanced flexibility, including a range of optimal mechanisms that parties can use to resolve a dispute, recognising that it does not all have to be strictly legislated. IfI remember correctly, it gives more certainty to what constitutes an agreement. There is a broader definition, including e-communications and e-commerce. Then it addresses some technical matters around confidentiality, court orders, capping costs and subpoenas or the availability thereof. Regarding the model law provisions, there is a good inclusion in that parties will be able to preserve the status quo of disputed assets while arbitration is being resolved. That is always MAIN COMMITTEE quite a problem in practice. Often those assets will disappear, flee or go missing in action while the matter is in dispute, so it will give some effect to that. The bill will set out the types of matters that a court should have regard to when exercising functions under or interpreting the act. The model law and arbitration agreement, or arbitral award, and these provisions emphasise the importance of arbitration in supporting international trade and commerce-because that is what it is about-and recognise that arbitration is an efficient, impartial, enforceable and timely method by which to resolve disputes. That is the ideal, of course, because we want it to be efficient, impartial, enforceable and timely. These amendments will seek to further enhance those attributes. The bill will also clarify the only grounds-and that is important-on which the court may refuse to recognise a foreign award, and these are the ones set out in section 8 of the act. They are consistent with Australia’s obligations under the New York convention. In closing, I would just like to say that the bill will provide clear guidance to the courts on interpretation. That is a good thing. By adopting amendments made to the model law, the bill ensures that we stay at the forefront of international commercial arbitration practice. I will be interested to see how this works in practice, having had a little bit of experience in the area. I know that the object is to simplify and stay ahead of the game. I am sure that will happen, but often things need a bit of tweaking after they are implemented and this is one of those areas that I see as a work in progress. With those words, I commend the bill to the House. tion Amendment Bill 2009. The bill amends the International Arbitration Act 1974 to clarify the application of the act and the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law’s Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration to provide greater certainty concerning the interpretation of the act and the model law to provide additional optional provisions to assist the parties to a dispute and make other miscellaneous amendments to improve the operation of the act. The proposed government amendments make a number of minor amendments to improve the operational provisions in the bill. In addition, they set out a new scheme for the application of optional provisions contained in the act and the bill, insert a new provision modifying the requirements in the model law such that parties be given a full opportunity to present their case to facilitate faster proceedings and add additional measures concerning matters such as evidence and security for costs. The government amendments were developed in response to issues raised by practitioners after the bill was developed. This bill is about the facilitating international trade and commerce by providing a more effective regime for the conduct of international commercial arbitrations in Australia. Our trade is a vital part of our economy. The Australian government continues to support trade liberalisation unequivocally and resist protectionism. We are committed to helping developing countries gain access to international economic opportunities. One of the more recent major developments in trade in Australia was in January this year, when Australia welcomed the commencement of our largest free-trade agreement, the ASEAN free-trade agreement. The historic agreement spans 12 economies with over 600 million people and a combined GDP of $3.1 trillion. The agreement opens up significant opportunities for Australian business in one of the fastest-growing regions in the world. There is great potential for Australian exporters to MAIN COMMITTEE",163,International Arbitration Amendment Bill 2009
200,Mr Craig Thomson (Dobell) (10.58 Am),"I rise to support the International Arbitraenter new markets with Asia leading the global recovery and six out of 10 Asian markets expected to grow at rates at least double the OECD forecasted average in 2010. Australia sees this agreement as an important building block towards deepening this country’s economic integration with the dynamic Asian region. The agreement covers over 70 per cent of Australia’s trade with Asian countries with which we do not have bilateral free-trade agreements. The agreement includes the elimination of tariffs on exports such as cheese, fresh grapes, wheat and sheep meat. It also dramatically expands the subject areas that Australian education providers can deliver in Vietnam. By 2020 the deal, which is Australia’s first multicountry free-trade agreement and the most comprehensive free-trade agreement ever concluded by ASEAN, will eliminate tariffs on 96 per cent of our current exports to ASEAN countries. ASEAN accounted for 15 per cent of Australia’s trade, valued at $83 billion, in 2008-09. This is as large as Australia’s trade with China, Australia’s largest trading partner. Forty-two per cent of our total exporter base, or around 18,500 Australian exporters, trade with ASEAN. That is just one picture of how important Australia’s trade is, especially our growing trade prospects with our own region. No doubt our business community will be doing its best to take full advantage of the many benefits that this far-reaching agreement with Of course, the global financial crisis hit global trade right around the world. With the global financial crisis we saw the biggest downturn in the global economy since the Great Depression. The Rudd government’s intervention with the stimulus package helped to save jobs during this period. If we have a look at the effects of the recessions in the 1980s and 1990s, hundreds of thousands of Australian jobs were lost and it took years and years for those jobs to return. On the Central Coast the economy would have been devastated by the global financial crisis but for the fact of the stimulus package, which helped to support jobs in retail, manufacturing and construction in particular. In previous recessions the Central Coast was hit the hardest of the many regions in Australia. The member for Shortland, who was just here, shares part of the beautiful Central Coast with me. Unemployment in the 1990s peaked at around 15 per cent on the Central Coast. Without the stimulus package, unemployment was going to grow significantly on the Central Coast. As it is, our unemployment has peaked at 6.3 per cent. If in this current downturn due to the global financial crisis there had not been the government’s stimulus package, if there had not been the intervention, and unemployment rates reached 15 per cent as they did in the 1990s, that would have seen an additional 11,100 people on the Central Coast without a job. So that is the effect that the stimulus package had. It is in the context of trade that I raise that particular issue. The bill facilitates international trade and commerce by providing a more effective regime for the conduct of international commercial arbitrations in Australia and the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitration agreements and awards. The proposed government amendments to the bill have been developed following comments received from stakeholders-namely, arbitration practitioners-after the development of the bill. The government amendments can be divided into two categories: those directed at improving the operation of existing provisions in the bill and provisions that supplement the provisions of the bill. The key amendments to the existing measures in the bill will: simplify the arrangements for enforcement of foreign awards in Australia and make it clear that a court can only refuse to enforce an award on one of the grounds set out in the act; and amend the application of the opMAIN COMMITTEE tional provisions in a part of the act to specify that certain critical provisions apply by default, including those relating to costs and interest. The remaining provisions apply only if expressly adopted by the parties. This part of the act, as amended by the bill, supplements the model law with provisions addressing matters such as interest, costs, confidentiality and assistance from courts. It also removes an unnecessary duplication between the two proposed sections concerning court assistance. In addition, the bill will provide that the parties to arbitration are entitled to a reasonable opportunity to present their case to a tribunal rather than a full opportunity as required by the model law. This measure is intended to give arbitral tribunals greater flexibility in managing particular matters before them. It inserts provisions into the act to provide arbitral tribunals with greater powers concerning evidence and security for costs. These provisions would apply unless the parties to the dispute agree otherwise. It modernises the drafting of the immunity provision in section 28 of the act and extends it to entities that appoint arbitrators to tribunals. It inserts a severability clause to provide guidance to the courts on the constitutional basis for the act and inserts a regulation-making power into the act. These amendments will help to ensure that the overall package of reforms contained in the bill achieves its desired outcome: a faster and fairer system for international arbitration that makes Australia an attractive venue for the resolution of disputes. Over time, international arbitration has developed as a practical, efficient and well established method of settling commercial disputes without resorting to national courts. Arbitration is typically faster, less formal and more tailored to the particular dispute than court proceedings whilst retaining the benefits of impartial adjudication. Arbitral awards are also more readily enforceable around the world than are judgments of national courts. Finally, arbitration is a method of dispute resolution that is chosen and controlled by the parties. This helps the parties to preserve their commercial relationship and resolve their dispute in a manner that suits their needs. There are two pillars that underpin the modern system of international commercial arbitration. The first is the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, done at New York on 10 June 1958 and commonly referred to as the New York convention. The convention provides crucial support to international trade by ensuring that arbitral agreements and awards are enforceable between the 144 contracting states. This means that commercial parties can turn to arbitration in full confidence that the award made by the arbitral tribunal will be enforceable throughout the world. The second pillar is the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law’s Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration. The model law was developed by the commission as a basis on which countries may choose to draft their own legislation governing international arbitration. The model law was developed to address the wide divergence of approaches taken to international arbitration throughout the world and to provide a modern and easily adapted alternative to outdated national regimes. As the explanatory note to the model law prepared by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law states: Since its adoption by UNCITRAL, the Model Law has come to represent the accepted international legislative standard for a modern arbitration law … On 21 November 2008 the Attorney-General announced a review of the International Arbitration Act and released a discussion paper to stimulate debate about the future of the act. The MAIN COMMITTEE product of the review’s work were reform measures developed following careful consideration of the more than 30 submissions made to the review as well as academic literature, court decisions and approaches taken overseas. The reforms contained in the International Arbitration Amendment Bill 2009 will ensure the act remains at the forefront of international arbitration practice. The reform provides parties with a wider set of tools to help them resolve their disputes. Once amended, the act will provide a clear distinction between the application of Commonwealth legislation and state and territory legislation. The bill will also clarify the circumstances in which the courts can refuse to recognise and enforce foreign awards. One concern expressed in submissions to the review was parties were finding increasingly novel ways to challenge awards and delay the arbitral process. These provisions are intended to emphasise the importance of speed, fairness and cost effectiveness in international arbitration while clearly defining and limiting the roles of courts in international arbitration without compromising the important protective function they exercise. Thirdly, the bill will implement a number of amendments to the model law adopted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law in 2006. These amendments concern interpretation of the model law, the introduction of a more sophisticated regime for making and enforcing interim measures, and minor changes to authentication and translation requirements. Further, the bill will introduce additional provisions to supplement the operation of the model law. At present, the act includes a range of optional provisions that parties can use to help resolve their disputes. These provisions address issues such as the consolidation of arbitral procedures, interests and costs. The bill will add a number of new tools to this set of optional provisions. The parties will be able to select new provisions that allow them to obtain subpoenas and other court orders to assist with the arbitration. The bill will enable the parties to select new provisions dealing with the disclosure of confidential information. Other opt-in provisions address the death of a party in an arbitration agreement and revise the provisions concerning interest on debt under an award. Finally, the bill includes a range of other measures directed at improving the general operation of the act, including providing a more expansive definition of what constitutes an agreement in writing for the purposes of the New York convention. The former UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, once said: … international trade thrives on the rule of law: without it parties are often reluctant to enter into crossborder commercial transactions or make international investments. Arbitration is an essential tool for doing business across borders. The bill will not only assist Australian businesses in resolving their disputes but also ensure Australia is an attractive venue for parties from around the world to resolve their disputes. I commend the bill to the House. thank members for their contributions to the debate on the International Arbitration Amendment Bill 2009 and I would certainly like to thank the opposition for their support of the bill and indeed for facilitating its passage through this simplified process of the Main Committee. MAIN COMMITTEE",167,Uncitral Was Established By A Resolution Of The General Assembly Back In 1966 To Help
201,Mr Mcclelland (Barton,"Attorney-General) (11.11 am)-in reply-I would like toThe bill is the most significant reform to the International Arbitration Act 1974 since Australia implemented the UNCITRAL model law in 1989. Arbitration facilitates international trade and commerce by providing a quick, cost-effective and enforceable means for commercial players to resolve their disputes. As I said in introducing the bill into the House, the measures contained in the International Arbitration Amendment Bill will ensure the act remains at the forefront of international arbitration practice. In summary, the bill will provide guidance to the courts on the operation and interpretation of the act, it will adopt key amendments to the UNCITRAL model law made in 2006, it will provide a wide range of additional tools to assist an arbitral tribunal to resolve disputes to the mutual benefit of the parties, it will clarify the relationships between the act and the state and territory laws regulating domestic arbitration, and it will make a range of other amendments to improve the operation of the act. The bill, along with other initiatives such as the establishment of the Australian International Disputes Centre in Sydney, will spark a fundamental change in the way international arbitration is conducted. I thank the state and territory attorneys-general and in particular the New South Wales Attorney General for the drive he has shown in this area. The bill provides a strong legal framework for arbitration practitioners to find creative solutions to commercial disputes-solutions that are tailored to the dispute at hand and the real needs of the parties. The bill is not just about helping Australian businesses to resolve their disputes quickly and efficiently, although this is of course very important; it is also about making Australia a regional centre for international commercial arbitration. With the reforms contained in the bill and the strong support of our expert and highly regarded practitioners, Australia can certainly become a significant centre for international commercial arbitration in the Asia-Pacific region.

It has also long been recognised that there is a need for national harmonisation of these arrangements to provide greater certainty for borrowers and lenders and to increase efficiency within the sector. The former Attorney-General, the honourable member for Berowra, Philip Ruddock, gave this issue particular priority during the term of the previous, Howard government.

The principal act applies, with very limited exceptions, to all types of personal property, including motor vehicles, contractual rights, intellectual property rights and uncertified shares. It provides for rules for the creation, priority and enforcement of security interests and establishes a national register of them. There are detailed specific provisions in relation to certain classes of property. The principal purpose of this bill is to make amendments to the Corporations Act 2001 to harmonise the language and to ensure conceptual consistency between the two acts. These amendments comprise terminological changes to the provisions referring to charges and other security interests. References to charges, mortgages, liens and pledges in the Corporations Act will be replaced with ‘security interests’. ‘Floating charges’ will become ‘circulating security interests’. ‘Fixed charges’ will become ‘non-circulating security interests’. Similar changes will be made in the references to holders of security interests. The old terms will be retained to refer to security interests to which the Personal Property Securities Act does not apply. Furthermore, this act provides for the extension of the Corporations Act concept of property to include property subject to the retention of title agreement. Currently, the holder of a security interest over the whole, or part of the whole, of the property of an insolvent company is entitled to appoint an administrator. Under the amendments where the whole, or substantially the whole, of the property of a company comprises property subject to the retention of title agreement, the holder of that interest will be entitled to appoint an administrator in the event of insolvency. Concerning the repeal of chapter 2K of the Corporations Act, chapter 2K provides for the registration of company charges. That function will be subsumed by the personal properties security act regime. The provisions as to charges void against an administrator or liquidator will be retained. The bill further goes to the retention of existing rights in the Corporations Act. Examples include provisions regulating priority in the distribution of proceeds, administrators’ rights of indemnity and the priority payment of certain unsecure creditors. The bill also provides for streamlined transitional provisions. This bill wisely reflects the recommendations made by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which has reported several times on the proposed legislative regime. We in the opposition understand the benefits and importance of establishing a simplified, national personal property securities regime and, as I said, that was something pursued by the previous Attorney-General and by the previous government. Therefore the opposition supports the passage of the bill through the parliament. MAIN COMMITTEE (Corporations and Other Amendments) Bill 2010. When I was training to be a lawyer at the University of Queensland in the late 1970s and early to mid-eighties I did not quite understand, when doing constitutional law, the travails and troubles that the Federation actually caused us. You read section 51 of the Australian Constitution and recognise that the Commonwealth has jurisdiction in respect of certain aspects. But there are areas in which business goes across jurisdictions. I remember the first day I started practising as an articled law clerk and someone walked into the office with all their tax returns and a big box of receipts et cetera. I asked where they had business interests and they said, ‘In the Lockyer Valley just outside of Ipswich, and interstate I have got farming interests.’ I asked, ‘What about your securities? Are you secured on any properties, debentures, companies et cetera?’ They wanted me to check all this out. I remember distinctly contacting my then master, as they called it, and finding out that you had to go interstate to check so much with respect to mortgages, liens and debentures. You really realised then-and I realised as a very young lawyer-what stupidity it was in this country to have all these different systems with different charges and different registries, and I recognised there and then what a shocking impediment and obstacle to a seamless national economy it was-though I did not quite use that expression in those days. When I got into business for myself and built up a law practice which dealt with a lot of commercial clients interstate and overseas, it was an endless frustration to me, particularly in the commercial section. So the creation of this new registry, the idea of personally being able to be searched online and across the country, whether you are living in Queensland or Tasmania, is a great national reform of the reformist Rudd Labor government. I think this is a great initiative. The amendments here are consequential; they are about making sure there is consistency with the Corporations Law and that definitions of property are the same. This is about making improvements to the system, and of course there are going to be changes-that is what happens when you establish a new registry. I noted what the Attorney-General, who is here in the chamber, said on 26 November 2009 when the personal property securities law was passed. I read what he said at the time because I thought it was very important in that the passage of that bill was a major achievement in reforming Australia’s personal property securities system. I say amen to that; I think it was a major achievement. It is a demonstration once again of the Rudd Labor government’s commitment to small to medium sized businesses. We saw that in the budget with the reduction in corporate tax rates and the write-off of $5,000 upfront for small businesses. There is a myth in this chamber, perpetrated and perpetuated by those opposite, that they alone are the friends of small business. It is simply a nonsense. The legislation here is consequential, but it makes the system work better. It is necessary. The COAG implementation timetable requires the personal property securities reform to be implemented in May 2011. This legislation before the chamber makes amendments in accordance with schedules, as we often do, to amend the Corporations Law and the primary legislation, the Personal Property Securities Act or PPS Act, and also other Commonwealth legislation. It is minor but it improves the system, amending terminology in the Corporations Law to make it consistent with the PPS Act and amending the Corporations Law in relation to the concept of property. MAIN COMMITTEE",174,Personal Property Securities Corporations And Other Amendments Bill 2010
205,Mr Neumann (Blair) (11.21 Am),"I speak in support of the Personal Property SecuritiesProperty has a particular concept in law: it is personality or realty; it is tangible assets or intangible ones. Things like contractual rights and intellectual property rights are intangible. Tangible assets, as we know, are things like livestock, property, crops, cars et cetera. This legislation makes the definition of property consistent. It repeals chapter 2A, which establishes the ASIC register of company charges. That is being replaced by the PPS register. It maintains the existing rights of secured and unsecured creditors such as employees, debtor companies, owners, lessors, lienees, pledgees, controllers, administrators or liquidators. It is minor, as I said, but it is important. The Ministerial Council for Corporations have approved the changes and the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General have approved the amendments in accordance with the intergovernmental agreement. It makes a difference, clearly, to make sure this system works better. Small businesses will clearly benefit because they will use the registry on a daily basis. It will improve their capacity to get finance and their security. Nothing causes more disputes between parties than a dispute between a third party and two other people involved in a contract. We see that all the time; that is what causes difficulties. That is why there are complicated provisions in the Corporations Law and the Bankruptcy Act in relation to third parties. If people can get access online to a registry and can check it out to see what the situation is with respect to the security, that will enhance their certainty of transaction. When they go to bargain in relation to a good or service it will improve the situation. I think this legislation is important. It improves the PPS Act. I am very excited about this legislation because it will make a big difference to business and to the many small businesses and farming communities in my regional and rural seat of Blair. It will help business operators in Ipswich but it will also help in the little communities where there are small businesses who need access to that information. It will help people who live in little country places like Kilcoy, Lowood, Minden, Fernvale, Toogoolawah and Esk, as well as the farmers who support the economies in those areas. I support the legislation and I commend the Attorney-General for the work he has done. ous speakers for their contribution to this debate on the Personal Property Securities (Corporations and Other Amendments) Bill 2010, in particular the member for Blair, who has just completed his speech. I would like to thank members for their contribution to the debate more generally. BeforeI turn to some of the specific aspects of the bill, I reiterate the comments that have previously been made that this is a significant reform of Australia’s personal property security regime and will create significant efficiencies, leading to businesses being more likely to lend funds on the basis of identified securities and ultimately making it cheaper for those financial institutions that lend funds to do so more cheaply as a result of a reduction in costs of compliance. The core elements of the bill are amendments to the Corporations Act 2001 to ensure its consistency with the functional approach of the Personal Property Securities Act, or the PPS Act-an easy acronym. Under this approach to security interests, transactions which have the same effect are treated alike. The bill has received significant support and input from stakeholders, including businesses, consumer advocates, representatives from state and territory governments, lawyers and financiers. I am grateful to all of these people for their comments and feedback and, of course, to officers of the Attorney-General’s Department who, for a long MAIN COMMITTEE",176,Personal Property Securities Corporations And Other Amendments Bill 2010
206,Mr Mcclelland (Barton,"Attorney-General) (11.29 am)-I thank both of the previperiod of time, have been doing some tremendously dedicated work on this bill and the overall structure of the personal property securities scheme. The amendments to the Corporations Act in schedule 1 will make amendments to the Corporations Act concept of property to apply the functional approach to security interests, particularly in relation to property in which the grantor does not have title. It will repeal chapter 2K, which establishes the ASIC Register of Company Charges, as this will be replaced by the Personal Property Securities Register. It will maintain existing rights, including employee entitlements in insolvency, and apply appropriate transitional and application provisions. The Ministerial Council for Corporations approved the amendments following a six-week consultation period which ended in January of this year. The amendments to the PPS Act in schedule 2 will simplify the transitional provisions, ensure consistency with existing state and territory provisions on the enforcement of security interests in crops and livestock and reflect the terminology used in the international financial industry in relation to intermediated securities. The Standing Committee of Attorneys-General has approved these amendments in accordance with the intergovernmental agreement that supports the PPS reform. Schedule3 makes minor consequential amendments to other Commonwealth legislation. The bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry. Submissions to the committee raised some possible amendments which would clarify the operation of the bill. To avoid any delays, we are proposing to give appropriate consideration to the issues raised in the Senate committee inquiry and, if necessary, to enact a further amendment bill which will be introduced later in the year. In conclusion, as I have said before, the PPS Act will replace the existing complex regulatory arrangements, based on artificial distinctions between personal property security transactions, with one national functional approach to personal property securities. PPS reform is a key aspect of the government’s continued commitment to cooperation with the states and territories on the government’s deregulation agenda and the national agreement to deliver a seamless economy. I acknowledge the contribution of the Standing Committee of Attorneys General in progressing the PPS reform and this particular bill. As this reform is based on a referral of power from the states to the Commonwealth, I also acknowledge the prompt and cooperative manner in which the states have assisted in this reform. New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia have passed referral legislation and Tasmania and Western Australia will be passing their referral legislation in due course. The states and territories will also be making consequential amendments to their legislation dealing with personal property security interests. In closing, PPS reform is essential to making secured financing more accessible and efficient by lowering risk for lenders, by increasing competition between finance providers, by providing greater certainty for both lenders and borrowers and by lowering costs for borrowers. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. MAIN COMMITTEE AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2010 Second Reading Debate resumed from 18 March, on motion by Mr Shorten: That this bill be now read a second time. nous Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2010. This bill encompasses three schedules. Schedule1 completes the government’s response to the report of the Carer Payment (child) Review Taskforce, Carer payment (child): a new approach. The proposed amendments will bring consistency to the assessment of carers of children for carer payment and carer allowance. Indeed, it was the coalition in 2006 that recognised the gap in government assistance for families caring for children with disabilities. It was the coalition that initiated a review in March 2007 into carer payment (child) to examine the ability to provide a safety net for carers of children with profound disability or severe medical conditions. The review, which recommended a fairer assessment process and less red tape, was handed to the incoming Rudd government in November 2007. In the 2008-09 budget the Rudd government announced it would provide $293.6 million over five years to improve assistance to carers. A key measure was to expand qualification for carer payment paid in respect of a child. As part of the measure, the government announced it would implement a new assessment process to determine qualification for carer payment paid in respect of a child based on the amount of care required by a child with disability or two or more children with disability, rather than the rigid medical criteria used to assess qualification for the payment. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Improved Support for Carers) Bill was introduced in the House on 19 March 2009 and received assent on 23 June 2009. The coalition supported that bill. The amendments made by the schedule commence on 1 July 2010. The proposed amendments under schedule 2, which relate to the income management regime, include: removing the concept of special account and replacing it with the income management record, allowing the collection of income management debts through the social security debt collection system, allowing recovery where funds have been paid to an income management account in error, allowing the secretary to credit the income management of certain customers earlier in some circumstances, giving the minister power to specify the amount of the deductible proportion of two new student scholarships, and some other amendments relating to financial management of income management accounts. The objective of schedule 3 is to provide a guaranteed minimum income of $45 million per year to the Indigenous Land Corporation. The Indigenous Land Corporation currently receives annual income through investment earnings from the realised real return on the investment of the land account in the previous financial year. The land account is administered by the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs portfolio. Since 200405, the value of payments to the ILC from the land account has fluctuated as a result of changes in the value of the realised real return on investments. These fluctuations have caused difficulties for the ILC in its long-term strategic planning. This legislation will establish a MAIN COMMITTEE",177,Personal Property Securities Corporations And Other Amendments Bill 2010
207,Mr Andrews (Menzies) (11.35 Am),"I rise to speak on the Social Security and Indigeguaranteed minimum earning for the ILC. The payment will be set in the first year at $45 million and indexed at the CPI. When earnings from the land account exceed the minimum amount, a supplementary payment will be made in addition to the annual amount. The supplementary payment will be the difference between the land account actual balance and its real capital value. In a situation where the guaranteed payment for any year exceeds the earnings from the land account, no supplementary payments will be made in future years until the real capital value of the land account has been restored. Current capital value of the land account is $1.7 billion, with investment earnings averaging $50 million over the medium term. Regulations will be drafted to establish a review mechanism to assess the revised ILC earning system established through this legislation to ensure the $45 million is sustainable. The coalition will be supporting this bill when it is returned to the House. Services and Parliamentary Secretary for Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction) (11.41 am)-in reply-In this bill, the Social Security and Indigenous Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2010, the government is pleased to introduce a significant 2008 budget measure that supports Australia’s carers. This initiative for carers is the final instalment of the government’s legislative commitment responding to the report of the Carer Payment (child) Review Taskforce entitled Carer payment (child): a new approach. The new changes are part of a $294 million package from the 2008 budget to better support carers of children with disability and serious medical conditions. The legislation for improved support for carers enacted in 2009 had as its centrepiece a new assessment process to determine qualification for carer payment paid in respect of a child. Central to this new assessment process was the introduction of the Disability Care Load Assessment (Child) Determination 2009. In this new bill the government now brings forward amendments that will deliver consistency in the assessment of carers of children for carer payments and carer allowance. This Disability Care Load Assessment (Child) Determination will now be used for qualification purposes for carer allowance as well as for carer payment. This alignment will bring consistency to assessments of carer allowance and carer payment paid in respect of children under 16 and will improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of those assessments. The list of recognised disabilities will also continue to apply in determining eligibility for carer allowance. The demands on carers are well known to the government, the senior minister-Minister Macklin-and indeed all Australians. We recognised these demands by introducing in this bill a further amendment to allow carers a further three months after the child they are caring for turns 16 in which to complete the Adult Disability Assessment Tool to test their eligibility for carer allowance (adult). Under the current rules, a carer loses their carer allowance when the child to whom they have qualified for the allowance turns 16, unless they have been assessed and given a successful rating under the Adult Disability Assessment Tool. Through this bill, the carer will have up to three more months in which to have the care receiver assessed and rated under the Adult Disability Assessment Tool. This amendment will align the provisions for carer allowance with the relevant provisions for carer payment which were amended in a similar way in 2009. MAIN COMMITTEE",179,Social Security And Indigenous Legislation Amendment Budget
208,Mr Shorten (Maribyrnong,"Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’sAmong two non-budget measures also included in this bill are minor improvements to the income management provisions in the social security law. These related to administrative matters such as appropriation, debt recovery and financial transactions. One of the amendments will apply, for example, when a third-party organisation that holds income managed funds for a person such as a community store owner ceases to operate. Under current rules, these amounts become debts to the Commonwealth and the person cannot be reimbursed until the debt recovery process is finished. This amendment will make sure the person can be reimbursed from the Consolidated Revenue Fund before the debt recovery action is finished. Any recovered funds from third parties will be recredited to the Consolidated Revenue Fund once the debt recovery action is finished. The income management amendments in the bill will also fix some current debt recovery inconsistencies between people’s income managed funds and their substantive payment under the social security law. Mr Briggs interjectingremove any ambiguity about the appropriation for income management payments and align the reimbursement processes for unauthorised transactions under the BasicsCard with the Electronic Funds Transfer Code of Conduct. The last measure in the bill is to amend the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005 to ensure a reliable income stream for the Indigenous Land Corporation, which is established under that act. The corporation’s purpose is to help Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders to acquire and manage Indigenous held land so as to provide economic, environmental, social and cultural benefits. The main source of funding for the Indigenous Land Corporation in a financial year is a payment made from the land account established under the act that is equal to the realised real return on the investments of the land account in the previous financial year. The value of these payments to the corporation from the land account has fluctuated in recent times because of the changes in the value of the realised real return. Long-term strategic planning has been made more difficult for the corporation by these fluctuations. The government is committed to securing a more reliable level of funding for the Indigenous Land Corporation. Accordingly, this bill has a guaranteed annual payment of $45 million from 1 July 2010, and the payment will be indexed for later years according to the consumer price index. Where the actual capital value of the land account exceeds the real capital value of the account, the bill will also allow additional payments to be made to the corporation of an amount equal to the excess above the real capital value. The real capital value of the land account will be maintained. This bill also provides for an independent review of the effectiveness of the funding arrangements after three years. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced.

209,Mr Shorten,"I thank the member for Mayo for his support. Further amendments willTAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2010 GST ADMINISTRATION MEASURES No. 2) BILL 2010 Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 March, on motion by Mr Griffin: That this bill be now read a second time. Laws Amendment (2010 GST Administration Measures No. 2) Bill 2010 makes an important difference to assist small and large businesses. Schedule 1, in particular, makes a big difference in ensuring more principled and flexible rules are available to GST groups. Companies can combine in joint venture arrangements to ensure that they improve their cash flow and their compliance costs. To do this, they need the approval of the Commissioner of Taxation, which can take a considerable period of time, as anyone in business knows-anyone who has worked in commercial law or corporate law will understand that that is the case. Currently there are restrictions on the dissolution of a group and amendments of a group, and there is uncertainty about liability issues where they are joint and several, so these amendments are an important improvement in business arrangements for corporate Australia. They will reduce compliance costs and increase certainty by improving the methods by which the Commissioner of Taxation can approve these arrangements. The amendments also make a difference in relation to business arrangements. It is enormously frustrating for businesses, which have to deal constantly with the obstacles, irregularities and inefficiencies in our tax system. The improvements here, which allow self-assessment on eligibility rather than requiring the Commissioner of Taxation’s approval, will make a big difference. I think they are a good and more flexible arrangement for business in this economy. So schedule 1 makes a significant difference to business arrangements for corporate Australia, and I support this schedule in particular. Schedule2 deals with the adoption of rules in relation to indirect taxes and excise. Tax rulings are extremely important for business. I can tell you that, when a client comes to speak to an accountant or a lawyer about a tax problem, it is fantastic when that lawyer or accountant can say: ‘There’s a tax ruling on that. I can just point it out.’ It is a formal mechanism that the Australian Taxation Office can use to interpret the law. We know that happens every day for corporate Australia. We also know that the interpretation of those laws by the Commissioner of Taxation is important to clarify certain inconsistencies in business arrangements. The commissioner does not always get it right, and we have seen that in terms of litigation. However, we want to make sure that taxpayers can be certain, confident and reassured that their tax liabilities are consistent with the commissioner’s interpretation of the law. Currently, there is no framework for GST rulings, and there have been submissions made to the Board of Taxation about that. The amendments before us include indirect tax rulings, excise advice and the general rulings regime. This is a sensible, moderate and reasonable approach and an important reform for corporate Australia, and it will go a significant way towards ensuring that GST, excise and indirect tax rulings make a big difference to the lives of companies and individuals involved in business arrangements. The third schedule is probably the one that makes the most difference to the average individual taxpayer and small business across the country. We know that you can only claim an MAIN COMMITTEE",181,Social Security And Indigenous Legislation Amendment Budget
210,Mr Neumann (Blair) (11.47 Am),"I speak in support of this legislation. I think the Taxinput tax credit if there is a tax invoice. We also know that there are particular requirements to ensure that tax invoices comply with a defined set of requirements. Not everyone who sets up a business will have had prior business experience. Not everyone who opens a newsagency, a fish and chip shop or a flower shop or who leaves a building company to work for themselves as a tradesman will have had prior business experience. Hence, they will not get it right every time they deal with tax laws. The invoices they present will not always comply with the particular prescriptive requirements of the tax legislation; therefore, any flexibility in the legislation makes sense with respect to small business particularly. When suppliers claim an input credit, the schedule allows for a more reasonable approach to be taken where the tax document contains some minor errors. This seems to be prudent and sensible. If there are fundamental mistakes in a person’s documentation-let us say, it does not even look, smell, feel or taste like a tax invoice-then of course it is not a tax invoice. But we want to make sure that, if there are minor errors, people can claim their input tax credit and not worry that there might be problems. Sometimes this can mean thousands of dollars for small and medium sized businesses. This amendment will make a difference. Minor errors can of course frustrate compliance costs for small business, so the changes here will make a difference. They operate from the middle of this year. We think these are important changes. We think they will improve the flexibility of our economy, assist more businesses, allow recipients to treat documents as tax invoices where there are minor changes. That will make a big difference, particularly for small business in my area. We do not have many large businesses in the Ipswich and West Moreton area; however, our many small business operators are the backbone of the economy. This is also the situation for many small country towns and rural communities as well as metropolitan Ipswich. So we think this legislation will make a difference. I am happy to support the legislation because it helps corporate Australia-large businesses in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane-as well as small businesses in places like Boonah, Laidley, Kalbar, Beaudesert and other places up in the Somerset region which I know need certainty with respect to these matters. shadow spokesperson on this issue, who is moving from a speech she is just completing in the House of Representatives to the Main Committee. I will help her in that transit by offering a few thoughts on the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 GST Administration Measures No. 2) Bill 2010. The member for Blair was very well versed on the subject. I will give him credit for his knowledge of tax rulings and the interpretation of the tax act. It is probably something he has far too much knowledge of. I congratulate him on his contribution on the bill. Like the member for Blair, small business is also hugely important in my electorate. I do not have substantial businesses either, so ensuring that small business is able to operate effectively is very important. My business base is made up of about 7,500 small businesses. We recently surveyed them, in fact, and one of the consistent issues that came through was their difficulty with the complicated tax system and the GST. While the GST was a very worthwhile initiative of the former Howard government-and I now welcome the support of it from those on the other side-it can always be improved to make it easier for small business to make sure that they can get on with the job of their business, whether it be a hairdressing salon, a butcher shop or MAIN COMMITTEE",182,Social Security And Indigenous Legislation Amendment Budget
211,Mr Briggs (Mayo) (11.55 Am),"I will rise for a short time to facilitate my colleague, thea winery. They need to keep their businesses open and operating without too much complication in relation to meeting their tax obligations. It is very important that we look at these pieces of tax legislation to ensure that they are as simple as they can possibly be, but obviously ensuring that the tax act and the tax obligations of people are being fulfilled. No-one likes paying tax. It is the view on our side of the chamber that we should be paying the lowest tax we possibly can. We do not support great, big new taxes-not on small business in this case but also on other industries. We think that will damage the economy and will damage the very industry which is driving so much of our economic activity in our country. We on our side of the House are always conscious of trying to reduce the tax burden on Australian business. It is a real balance to ensure that the tax act is being properly implemented and at the same time allowing people to get on and run their business. The member for Blair talked in great detail about the changes contained in this bill-in far better detail than I could-and I agree with much of what he had to say. Occasionally the member for Blair and I do not agree on issues relating to tax, and certainly in recent days I think we probably have a vastly different view on some of the changes to our tax system that are being planned. Clearly the opposition is supportive of this bill, but I will not take too much of the shadow minister’s gunpowder in giving our view. With those few remarks I will conclude. Ms LEY (Farrer) (11.59 pm)-I am pleased to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 GST Administration Measures No. 2) Bill 2010. This bill amends the tax law to further progress a package of reforms announced in the 2009-10 budget aimed at simplifying and streamlining the administration of GST in the areas of grouping, invoicing and rulings. These amendments are from recommendations of the Board of Taxation in its Review of the Legal Framework for the Administration of the Goods and Services Tax. The changes will apply from 1 July 2010. The bill deals with three schedules. Schedule 1, GST groups and GST joint ventures, amends the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 and the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to adopt more principled and flexible rules for GST groups and GST joint ventures. This schedule will enable entities to self-assess their eligibility to form or change a GST group or joint venture and they will only need to notify the commissioner of their action before the due date of lodgement of the GST return for the tax period. Presently, the commissioner must formally approve such changes. Schedule1 also greatly increases the flexibility of the grouping rules by allowing entities to form, change and dissolve the GST group or joint venture at any time during a tax period rather than only at the beginning of a tax period or having to unwind transactions back to the start of a tax period. Further, schedule 1 will enable entities to enter into indirect tax-sharing agreements to limit their joint and several liabilities in respect of indirect tax law liabilities to a contribution amount agreed with the representative members for GST groups or joint ventures. This will increase certainty for members in GST groups and joint ventures in relation to their exposure to group debts. Schedule2 of the bill concerns rulings. Schedule2 amends the Taxation Administration Act, the GST act-both mentioned previously-the Excise Act and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to include indirect tax rulings and excise advice in the general rulings regime. This will address problems arising from not having an express legislative framework for GST MAIN COMMITTEE rulings and from having no formal review rights and no framework setting out the taxpayer’s rights and obligations. Income tax rulings will be expanded to include GST, luxury car tax, wine equalisation tax and excise matters. Schedule 3, tax invoices, amends the A New Tax System (GST) Act to introduce a more flexible set of requirements for tax invoices. It will allow recipients of supplies to disregard certain errors in a document intended to be a tax invoice, where missing information can be obtained from other documents provided to the recipient by the supplier. The coalition support this bill, as we support all measures to simplify and streamline the administration of both GST and other taxation provisions. We appreciate the fact that the changes will apply from July 2010. Without further ado, I commend the bill to the House. (12.03 pm)-in reply-I would like to thank all those members who participated in this debate. The measures contained in the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 GST Administration Measures No. 2) Bill 2010 further progress a package of reforms announced in the 2009-10 budget aimed at simplifying and streamlining the administration of the goods and services tax, this time in the area of grouping, invoices and rulings. These measures arose from recommendations made by the Board of Taxation in its report on GST administration. Adopting the more flexible rules for GST groups and GST joint ventures contained in schedule 1 will reduce compliance costs and increase certainty. In particular, the system of requiring the commissioner’s approval to form, change or dissolve a group will be replaced with self-assessment and notifications. The requirement that the information and changes to a group only take place from the beginning of a tax period will be replaced with rules allowing such actions to take place at any time during a tax period. Finally, entities entering into indirect tax-sharing arrangements will be able to address the uncertainty associated with the existing joint and several liability provisions to limit their liability for unpaid indirect tax amounts. The amendments in schedule 2 of the bill will expand the income tax rulings regime to include GST, luxury car tax and wine equalisation tax rulings and excise advice. This introduces a range of features, including the right to object to a private, indirect tax or excise ruling. Providing consistent rules across different taxes will simplify the tax law and increase certainty for taxpayers. The amendments contained in schedule 3 of the bill will introduce more flexible requirements for tax invoices and allow errors in tax invoices to be disregarded by recipients where the relevant information can be obtained from other documents issued by the supplier. As a result of this measure, minor errors in tax invoices will no longer result in taxpayers incurring the compliance costs associated with revising their input tax credits and obtaining a corrected tax invoice. The measures contained in this bill apply on and from 1 July 2010. I commend this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

Ms LEY (Farrer) (12.06 pm)-I am pleased to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Transfer of Provisions) Bill 2010. The bill deals with five schedules. Schedule1 concerns the collection and recovery of tax. Schedule1 rewrites the remaining sections of part 6 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 into the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and the Taxation Administration Act 1953. Part4 contains rules about the collection and recovery of income tax, including rules about when income tax becomes due and payable, rules allowing the commissioner to make estimates of certain tax debts and to take recovery action based on those estimates, and rules imposing penalties on directors of companies that fail to pay certain tax debts. The rewritten rules of collection and recovery include those giving the commissioner power to seek security from a taxpayer for an existing or future tax liability in certain situations such as a serious risk of tax liability not being paid, expanded security deposit rules to cover all taxes administered by the commissioner and new machinery rules and higher penalties for non-compliance. Schedule2 relates to commercial debt forgiveness. Schedule2 rewrites the remaining schedule 2C to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 into the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and contains the rules for the income tax treatment of the gains made when a taxpayer’s debt is forgiven. Schedule3 rewrites the remaining schedule 2E to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 into the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Schedule 2E ensures that a lessor and a lessee of a luxury car get the same income tax treatment they would have got had the lessor sold the car to the lessee and lent the lessee the money for the purchase. Schedule4 is on farm management deposits. Schedule4 rewrites the remaining schedule 2G to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 into the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Schedule 2G establishes the farm management deposits scheme, which allows eligible primary producers to set aside pre-tax income in profitable years for subsequent withdrawal in low-income years. Schedule 5, on general insurance, rewrites the remaining schedule 2J to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 into the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Schedule 2J ensures that general insurance companies are taxed on premium income received and can deduct liabilities for outstanding claims over the period of risk under the policies to which the income and deductions relate. The subject matter of all those schedules is quite interesting and complicated, but that is not what this bill is about. This is about a rewrite. This is about an ongoing tax law simplification project which rewrites the archaic and sometimes very difficult to interpret rules in the 1936 act into the 1997 plain English act. It is taking an awfully long time. We would like to see it speeded up and we would like to see provisions that are not as simple and straightforward in their rewriting as these ones accelerated in the queue. However, in the rewrite, quite appropriately, there are no changes to the law. The coalition approves this bill. It is uncontroversial and I commend it to the House.

213,Mr Neumann (Blair) (12.09 Pm),"I speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendmentgym when they are here in Parliament House. I have actually never weighed the income tax assessment legislation, but I think if you weighed it it would probably weigh the same as a couple of dumbbells that you could throw around and push up. It is pretty heavy stuff. I remember when I studied it at law school and when I had it on the shelf in private practice. You have to watch the way you pull it out because it is quite heavy. It is also quite complex, and anyone who studies it and deals with it day by day knows how difficult it is. The member for Farrer was correct: it was 1936 when the original legislation went through. That was a long time ago. We have talked about this being known as the Tax Law Improvement Project. It has been going on for a long time. It got a kick along under Paul Keating, when he was the Prime Minister, back in the early nineties. There was a recommendation given to the Keating Labor government by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit to make some changes. But, seriously, we have to do something about this to speed the process up. I commend the legislation that is before this House. We are making changes. We are rewriting 149 pages of the old 1936 act and putting it into the 1997 Income Tax Assessment Act and the Taxation Administration Act. That is significant change. As the Hon. Nick Sherry said in a press release on 17 March this year, that is a reduction of 30 per cent because it will be reduced to 101 pages. But we have to do better long term, whether we occupy the treasury bench or those opposite do. I will not go through the schedules that the member for Farrer outlined, but I will say that we are not changing in any substantive way the legislation that is before the House. We are modernising the law, providing certainty and consistency through the changes, and using language which we use today. The use of modern English in legislation cannot come quickly enough. Some of the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act are almost incomprehensible. They really are. They are very difficult to understand. For those people in small and medium sized businesses who are more interested in selling their goods and services and dealing with their clients and customers, to have to wade through complicated, archaic provisions that use language which they would not use in modern-day life-and which their children certainly would not use-is simply ridiculous. We must accelerate the process of modernisation of our laws when it comes to using plain English. Sometimes you wonder how we draft legislation. We have paragraphs and subparagraphs that go on forever. We have to make changes. I commend the government for what they are doing. This is a significant reform and it makes a big difference to how the legislation looks. These are complicated areas, and I know it takes time, but we have to accelerate the process. The project needs to be given some impetus. I agree with the Hon. Nick Sherry that this is an improvement. I think it does reduce complexity. We are about committing ourselves to slashing red tape and modernising not just the tax law system but other complicated pieces of legislation. Governments of both persuasions do this from time to time. We do this through the Statute Law Revision Act, and we do it on numerous occasions. SinceI was elected to this place in 2007, I have spoken on that piece of legislation and various other pieces of legislation like it on numerous occasions, because there are some quite strange provisions in legislation. I commend the government for tackling the project, for giving it some life, for accelerating it, but we must do better. This legislation does make some changes. It rewrites the 1936 act. I will now make mention of some of the schedules. MAIN COMMITTEE I would like to mention schedule 2G, which establishes the farm management deposits scheme. This allows eligible primary producers to set aside pre-tax income in profitable years for subsequent withdrawal in low-income years. We are not making any change; we are just modernising the legislation. But that is a good scheme, particularly for the farming communities in the Somerset region, the Lockyer Valley and the Fassifern Valley in South-East Queensland, which I represent. In difficult drought conditions it is tough not just on the farmers but also on the small business operators in those communities, so I am pleased that we have seen the drought break in South-East Queensland and that we have seen improvements. I really support this scheme. I think it will make a big difference in farming communities. In particular, I am pleased that we are modernising the legislation with respect to that scheme, and I commend the legislation to the House. (12.15 pm)-in reply-Firstly, let me thank those members who have contributed to this debate. The Tax Laws Amendment (Transfer of Provisions) Bill 2010 repeals five areas of income tax law, adding up to 149 pages of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, and rewrites them into the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and, in one case, into the Taxation Administration Act 1953. The bill does not make any major policy changes to the provisions it rewrites. Indeed, the changes it makes are mostly to the location of the provisions, to their structure and to their text. But, still, those changes are important. The government is committed to having a single income tax assessment act for Australia within a reasonable time. The benefits of achieving that might not be noticed by many, but they will be appreciated by those taxpayers and tax practitioners who have to work with the income tax law, a most difficult piece of legislation. Achieving a single assessment act will reduce the complexity of that legislation, and this bill takes an important step towards achieving that goal, so it is pleasing to see that other members have taken an interest in this matter, which has not always had the profile that it deserves. I commend this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Food Security important not just to my electorate, not just to rural and regional Australia but to all Australians-that is, the issue of our food security. Too often we hear platitudes and too often we see politicians decked out in their brand-new, dustless Akubras and open-necked shirts going out into rural and regional areas trying to get nice Australian type photos; but, when it comes to making real decisions about securing not only Australia’s food supply but the survival and, in fact, growth of rural and regional Australia, too often we have seen a lack of action.

216,Mrs Mirabella (Indi) (12.18 Pm),"I rise this afternoon to speak on an issue that iscerned about the future of this nation. What sort of country do we want to live in? Do we want to live in a country where we import all our food? Do we want to live in a country where we import all our manufactured goods? I would say no. But we need to start now. We are at the crossroads. In this instance, looking at one particular industry, the apple industry, I have met with local growers in my electorate who are extremely concerned about the very serious potential of importing diseases. I certainly share this concern, as do many people on this side of the House. We are pest free in this industry and we have a distinct product to sell. We have seen the area lose many farmers and many workers. There is also this concern: if our green, clean agricultural industries are battered with unfair imports, which could quite possibly contain a variety of exotic diseases, what incentive are we giving to our hard working farmers? What are we saying to them and their families? We are not saying, ‘Thank you;’ we are not saying, ‘You’ve done a great job.’ What we as a nation are saying is: ‘Too bad; we’re still going to allow the importation of these, possibly, diseased fruit.’ I want the government to actually listen to the concerns of industry, rather than fob them off and not do the hard work of considering potential consequences. Once we import any one of these exotic diseases we have Buckley’s of trying to get rid of it. The industry is worth a significant amount of money to regions, it is worth a significant amount of money to our agricultural sector and the Labor Party is, unfortunately, playing Russian roulette with our nation’s quarantine and border security. I join the shadow minister for agriculture in questioning the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry as to how hard he has fought to appeal against any adverse findings regarding the importation of apples from China. I am not sure whether he has fought too hard. I suppose he now has a lot of responsibilities, with the issue of population as well, but he should not forget that he is dealing not just with the sustainability of a population but with the sustainability of the agricultural sector. What contingency plans does the minister have to deal with any outbreak of, say, fire blight? What plans are in place? I do not think there are many, because I do not think the minister has given this matter due consideration. I do not think he has looked into the eyes of these apple growers and said, ‘I’ve done my very best to protect you.’ I have written to the minister requesting that he meet with my apple growers to hear first hand from them not only their expertise but also their critique of the current quarantine system and the current assessments that have been made about the importation of foreign apples into Australia. and I am sure that all honourable members will join with me in giving the member for Indi and her husband, Greg, every best wish with respect to the forthcoming birth of their second child. Australian Army Nursing Service: Lieutenant Olive Weston Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (12.23 pm)-I rise today to recognise the extraordinary contribution that Australian nurses have made to our nation’s history-in particular their contribution to the history of Australia’s involvement in world conflict. Australian troops have marched into war zones over many different conflicts, but they have been supported by personnel such as nurses, who have stood alongside our troops providing support. In the Boer War, the First World War, the Second World War, the Korean War and the Vietnam War the MAIN COMMITTEE",188,Adjournment
217,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Peter Slipper),"I thank the honourable member for Indisame Australian spirit, determination and courage that distinguished Aussie service personnel was also evident in the nurses and other service personnel who served alongside them. Take, for example, the achievements in World War II of a constituent in my electorate, Nurse Lieutenant Olive Weston, of Port Noarlunga/Christies Beach RSL. She is one example in my electorate of a woman who has served this country with great distinction and quiet dedication. She is part of a succession of Australian women whose history of selflessness took them off to places where their charity, efficiency and good cheer made all the difference in circumstances of unimaginable pain and suffering. In her 84 years, Lieutenant Olive Weston has served the country in a variety of contexts that would have tested the moral fibre of the best of us. She joined the army at the age of 15 during World War II and her experience in tropical medicine was put to use in caring for soldiers in the 12th Station Hospital in Townsville. Her four years of service included a stint in New Guinea before she was repatriated to Australia after suffering from malaria and dengue fever. Personal hardship has made little difference to the commitment that Olive has shown in her ongoing years. She explained her attitude to hardship in her biography: ‘We didn’t really have fear; that’s why we were doing what we were.’ This is a very good book and I would suggest everyone read it to learn about the experiences that people such as Olive Weston had and about the sacrifices they made on behalf of the country. In World War II alone, 3,477 Australian women signed up to the Australian Army Nursing Service and, of those, 71 made the ultimate sacrifice while caring for troops overseas. In early 1942, when fighting on the Malay Peninsula reached its climax and retreat became unavoidable, evacuation by hospital ship was not a possibility so the wounded soldiers and Australian Army service sisters returned to Australia via a number of vessels. En route to Sumatra, the Vyner Brooke was sunk by Japanese bombers in the Bangka Strait. A group of 22 survivors made it to Bangka Island but, tragically, when the Japanese found them they were ordered to walk into the sea and were machine-gunned from behind by the Japanese patrol. All of these women were killed except one, Sister Vivian Bullwinkel-she has a very remarkable story to tell. I want to take this opportunity to commemorate these nurses because they are not necessarily often remembered. I also want to congratulate everyone in South Australia involved in remembering these women through the annual Bangka Day service held at the memorial in the Women’s Memorial Playing Fields. It is a significant memorial service. Further, I want to talk today about something very special that the Port Noarlunga/Christies Beach RSL has done. I was very pleased to attend the launch at the Port Noarlunga/Christies Beach RSL of Australia’s first ever honour roll dedicated to nurses. As far as they are aware, this is the first such honour roll in Australia. They have put together a wonderful honour roll and memorial for the nurses who served. I would particularly like to congratulate the Port Noarlunga/Christies Beach RSL for pursuing Olive’s idea and actually putting money behind it to ensure recognition for some of the nurses that were killed. I would like to particularly pay gratitude to the committee that was involved in organising the project: Olive Weston OAM, Steve McInnis, Harry Rollinson, John Fakes OAM, Gary Maynard, Kath Ramsden and David Goodman. The Port Noarlunga/Christies Beach RSL has made a commitment to these nurses by providing funding and in assisting the collection of photographs and names on the honour roll. The president of the MAIN COMMITTEE Port Noarlunga/Christies Beach RSL said that the RSL chose to fund and support the honour roll ‘because we believe it is important to recognise the contribution that women have made in our national history’.

It is by Gerry Cunningham, who, for members’ information, is a brother of former member for McMillan, Barry Cunningham-and very talented he is. It is entitled Hope: The marquee stood in the paddock there Mid the skeletal trees both green and bare. The locals gathered in the sunlit air, And they dared to hope. The Christian band with its fiddlers two played a jaunty tune in the morning dew. They sang their songs and one was new, And it sang of hope. A bible reading from John fourteen, A home for all in a place unseen, It was hard for some, where they had been, Yet they cling to hope. A duet of song spoke for everyman. A solid place where we all can stand. Perhaps it will help us to understand, As we search for hope. A funny man for the kids came out. With his many tricks he did sing and shout, The prodigal son he went on about, And he spoke of hope. The member’s words were brief but true. They reminded us of the things we knew. That the wrath of nature is a bitter brew, But we should still hope. The symbolic sunflowers in their shining gold, A story of regrowth there to be told, They had grown a flowering sight to behold, And they told of hope.

218,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (12.28 Pm),"I would like to read the poem inspired by theAnd we continue to hope. A cuppa together to finish the day, For the true Aussie spirit was here on display In far better mind we went on our way, We were filled with hope. It was a very, very hard commemorative service to go to. I found myself as I stood to speak wishing I were somewhere else and someone other than the federal member on that day. I had the realisation that, as I felt, so did many of the hundreds of people that were there. They did not come because they wanted to commemorate such a tragic event; they came to support one another. Gerry Cunningham was there with his wife. I said to Gerry, ‘Gerry, I know you’re a poet of great means. Have you considered putting words to this day?’ The church had truly erected a tent in the middle of a paddock. We expected a hundred people to turn up. But suddenly out of the bush and along the roads at Labertouche, cars began to arrive. I noticed two women sitting apart-not wanting to be a part of a church but sitting apart. I realised as I watched them that they were here to support others and not because they wanted to be there, not because they wanted to participate. They did not want to remember what had happened on that fateful day in February, but they came to support all the other people that came to support all the other people. They were feeling exactly as I was: ‘What are we doing here? We’ve got nothing to celebrate. It was a terrible, terrible, terrible day.’ I missed the word ‘sunflowers’ in this poem-I actually read out ‘flowers’. I should have used ‘sunflowers’ because they used sunflower seeds that had been planted and then taken from the fire and grown. Then they handed out sunflowers to people. I took one home and I planted my sunflower seed and it grew. It was GM-free sunflower, too, I might say. The day was important, and I said to Gerry, ‘Would you put it on paper? Gerry, if you put it on paper, because I know you are capable of doing that-of capturing the moment in a poem-I will read it out in the parliament.’ I am fulfilling that promise to Gerry today to read this poem out, but not for Gerry and not for the great contribution the Cunningham family have made to our district; I am reading it out for every person that was there on that day at that church service supporting one another, arm in arm and hand in hand. Food Labelling Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (12.33 pm)-The food-labelling regime in Australia, as in other countries, is important for a number of reasons. Labels on food and food products provide information that is critically important in relation to health and safety; in relation to preventative health in terms of diet, particularly for children; in relation to allowing consumers to make informed choices about their food and its origins; and in relation to competitive fairness when it comes to the way that food companies produce and represent their food to the market. As it stands, food labelling in Australia, which is governed by the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code in addition to state and territory fair trading laws and the Commonwealth Trade Practices Act, is a largely self-regulating system, whose requirements cover things like the provision of ingredients and nutritional information; the produce’s country of origin; the date by which a food should be eaten; and a general truth-in-labelling requirement with regard to the description of the product itself-its weight and so on. MAIN COMMITTEE Labels that go beyond this more-or-less raw data and that present what might be called second-order information, in that they draw a conclusion from, say, nutritional information, are perhaps best represented by the Heart Foundation’s Tick. While it is not uncommon for people to regard the heart Tick as forming part of Australia’s food labelling system, the reality is that the Heart Foundation is not a part of the government and the heart Tick is a voluntary form of health accreditation that producers choose to seek or not as it suits them, rather than being something that results from an enforced survey of all foods. That is not to take anything away from the heart Tick itself. Indeed, as a private organisation the Heart Foundation has done a fantastic job in establishing a system of great integrity when it comes to the testing and the random audit compliance for products that first seek and then receive the heart Tick. I am not the first person to observe that the Heart Foundation’s Tick label and the process that underpins it represent an approach to food labelling that many consumers, health professionals and animal welfare advocates would like to see implemented more widely. We must acknowledge that food production, like other kinds of production, is occurring within the context of significant and rapid change and innovation. That in itself is a strong argument for ensuring that our approach to food labelling is proactive rather than reactive. On that point, I have noted before in this place the particular importance of staying ahead of the curve in relation to food products that involve genetically modified ingredients. I am pleased to note that work is currently occurring under the auspices of Labelling and Information Standards in relation to the treatment of nutrition and health related claims. While this will, hopefully, produce better guidelines and compliance when it comes to what are called nutrient content claims and health claims, these guidelines will of course apply only where a food producer seeks to make what is inevitably a positive claim, like ‘High in calcium’ or ‘Calcium is good for healthy bones’. They will not operate to require the disclosure of what might be considered negative nutritional content or the negative health consequences of that content. Again, on this point, I would say with confidence that there is appetite in the Australian community for some guidance in relation to key nutrition and health data, and that a simple, mandated labelling scheme would likely be welcomed by the majority of people, and especially by parents. Last year I wrote to the Food Labelling Law and Policy Review Panel in support of a submission from the Barristers Animal Welfare Panel that called for nationally mandated and legislatively defined labelling protocols to cover methods of production of animal derived products that involve very different outcomes for animals like chickens and pigs. In the case of different methods of egg production, Australian consumers have, in large numbers, demonstrated their preference for eggs from free-range chickens, and yet it was only three years ago that both the Australian Egg Corporation and the Australian free-range poultry association estimated that some 200,000 factory-farm eggs per day were being passed off as free-range eggs. Strengthening the labelling regime in this area is not just a case of providing consumers with accurate information about production methods. It is also about protecting the financial interests of those producers who choose to farm chickens in a way that is both more humane and more costly. Such producers should not have the marketing advantage that comes with genuine free-range farming diluted by unscrupulous producers whose farming methods would horrify some consumers. The current absence of effective labelling compliance when it comes MAIN COMMITTEE to methods of production for eggs and other animal derived products means that some producers are misleading consumers, misrepresenting their conduct when it comes to animal welfare, and having a free ride at the expense of their genuinely free-range competitors. The rapidly occurring changes in food production methods and technology, in patterns of food consumption and in our understanding of the health and welfare consequences that flow from these, require that we continue to review the approach taken to labelling in the interests of public health, consumer choice and fair market competition. Aged Care Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (12.38 pm)-TodayI speak on behalf of the many residents of my electorate of Tangney who have approached me to voice their concern about the lack of new investment in aged care. From recent meetings with aged-care providers and their staff, it is becoming increasingly clear that the current aged-care process is simply not up to the task of meeting the challenges of an ageing population. I am concerned that the lack of investment in aged care is manifesting itself in the lack of allocation of aged-care positions. Staff retention is also a problem, with the well-being of aged-care staff and their facilities also needing to be addressed. With an ageing population we have a growing demand for positions, and the growing labour shortage is not helping to find and train new carers and nurses. In 2007 only 69 per cent of aged-care beds were allocated in Western Australia from that year’s aged-care allocation fund. The actual figure for allocations in 2007 was 644 beds out of 1,006. This was notable, as it was the first time we had had a shortfall in allocations nationally. In 2008, we had a new zero real interest loan round of 334 beds allocated, which was claimed in the Senate to have made up the shortfall of beds from the 2007 aged-care allocation round. Clearly, this was not the case. Then in 2008-09 the aged-care allocation round was reduced from 1,640 to 1,208 bedsand we are yet to receive a reasonable explanation as to why it was reduced. In the 2008-09 allocation round, with 1,208 beds made available, there were only 519 beds allocated. In 2009-10 we had 4,299 beds on offer in WA, and there is no business case for any provider to apply for these beds to meet future needs in WA. The forecast allocation numbers for the next two rounds are 1,176 available beds in 2009-10 and 2,523 beds in 2010-11. My electorate is crying out for aged-care places, yet we have well over 1,000 beds still to be built from allocation rounds going back to 2004 and we have a record number of beds being handed back or unallocated. With a shortage of residential places on offer, this situation seems unfathomable. Further to this, between December 2007 and March 2009, 786 bed licences were handed back nationally and 283 of these were from my state of WA. I have to ask: why is WA leading the way in the aged-care development demise? There are a number of key issues. Firstly, there is the availability and access to affordable large land lots in appropriate areas. This is linked to the land shortage in WA, which drives excessive price growth. Secondly, the cost of construction far exceeds the national standards. This is multifold in regional and remote areas. The industry is currently funded at $109,000 per bed, and the average cost of construction exceeds $200,000. Aged care quite simply cannot be run profitably. Thirdly, many aged-care providers face funding issues, as they do not have the financial resources to service the large loan needed to build the infrastructure. There are also issues with the workforce and, due to the regulation on funding and fees, the industry MAIN COMMITTEE has no mechanism to raise wages to a competitive rate in a competing market in WA, even in these relatively good economic times. As things stand at the moment, wages are poor and the work is challenging. Simply put, they cannot even compete with Coles. Aged care has an ageing workforce, and younger people are not attracted to the roles and responsibilities. The industry has been warning the federal government and relevant ministers for years that there will be a shortfall in applications, and now, unfortunately, it is a reality. This is not an issue that needs political polarisation. A mature debate on the future of aged care is needed to ensure that my constituents in Tangney and the wider Australian population are provided with options, security and certainty in the aged-care system. Autism and on Friday, 30 April, Rainbowland Autism Services Inc. organised the inaugural Autism Rainbow Day as part of a global autism awareness campaign. My electorate office team joined in the awareness campaign on the day by wearing plain-coloured T-shirts symbolising one of the colours of the rainbow. The campaign, not surprisingly, attracted widespread public interest both from within Australia and from overseas. I say ‘not surprisingly’ because of the number of children around the world with autism. Through greater community awareness it is hoped that there will be greater community understanding and, in turn, increased levels of support for children with autism and for their families. I will take a moment to provide some background with respect to autism and the Rainbowland Autism Services community organisation. An autism awareness fact sheet describes autism as ‘a lifelong neurological disorder characterised by impairments in communication, socialisation and restricted patterns of interest and behaviours’. In Australia autism is estimated to affect one in every 160 Australian children and around 30,000 Australian families. The estimated cost of autism to the Australian community is around $7 billion per annum. The social impacts on and costs to the children and those 30,000 families in the form of learning difficulties, limited social opportunities for the children and very high rates of parental depression and separation are immeasurable. There is no cure for autism but providing the right kind of early intervention can be very beneficial for children and, in turn, ultimately saves millions of dollars in costs later on. Understanding the behaviour of children with autism and being able to correctly interpret that behaviour is an important first step. Speech therapy, early intervention, occupational therapy and home modifications all help, but for the families they come at a cost, as does the destruction to the school life of the children, which raises an additional concern. Many schools are simply unprepared; they do not have the resources or the expertise to deal with children with autism. In that respect, autism-specific preschools such as that in Brisbane are a terrific start. I welcome, as I know many of the parents I have spoken with do, the Rudd government’s $190 million Helping Children with Autism package, the first national initiative to help families deal with this challenging disorder. The package provides families with $12,000 in early intervention funding. Rainbowland Autism Services is a local autism group formed by local families in Makin who are affected by autism. The group is led by Alison Dix, who through her determination, her tireless efforts and with the support of other parents has established the Rainbowland playgroup for children with autism. MAIN COMMITTEE",191,Adjournment
219,Mr Zappia (Makin) (12.43 Pm),"April was Autism Awareness Month around the world,I have visited the playgroup, spoken with parents there and seen for myself its benefits for the parents and for the children. There is no doubt, however, that more needs to be done for both the parents and the children. Raising community awareness through initiatives such as Autism Rainbow Day will highlight the needs and in turn hopefully lead to more support being provided. It also serves to remind the parents of children with autism that they are not alone, that support networks are in place and that with others who share their problem they stand the best chance of being heard. I am also aware that through those kinds of networks they are able to support each other both in a social sense and in providing guidance to families who are finding it very difficult to cope by directing them to some help and assistance. It is a terrific initiative, and I commend Alison Dix, Helen Howson and all of the other parents they work with for organising Autism Rainbow Day and for being a voice for the thousands of children with autism and for their family members. It is one of those initiatives that was started by a local group of people who simply believed that there were not enough support services and who were prepared to create this organisation. It is doing a terrific amount of good work, certainly within my electorate, for those families who are faced with the challenges of autism. In turn, they are becoming vocal advocates for families and children with autism around the country. I commend the work that they are doing. Question agreed to. Main Committee adjourned at 12.48 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Queensland Hospitals: Commonwealth Funding (Question No. 1304 amended) Mr Slipper asked the Prime Minister, in writing, on 11 March 2010: (1) Will he guarantee adequate funding for Queensland hospitals under the Government’s National Health and Hospitals Network? (2) Will he consider allocating funds to assist the construction of the Sunshine Coast University Hospital; if so will it be provided no later than 2012? (1) Under the National Health and Hospitals Network the Commonwealth Government will become the majority funder of the Australian public hospital system. The Commonwealth will fund: 60 per cent of the efficient price of every public hospital service provided to public patients; 60 per cent of recurrent expenditure on research and training functions undertaken in public hospitals; 60 per cent of capital expenditure, both operating capital and capital investment, to maintain and improve public hospital infrastructure; and over time, up to 100 per cent of the efficient price of ‘primary health care equivalent’ outpatient services provided to public hospital patients. This Commonwealth funding commitment will apply to every service that states/territories and Local Hospital Networks agree to provide. Consistent with my Government’s commitment, no state or territory will be worse off in the short term and all states will be better off in the long term. By 2019-20 Queensland will be better off by around $3.5 billion under the NHHN reform plan. The Government will also provide an additional $1 billion in new investments in the Queensland health and hospitals system over the next over years, including $150 million for emergency departments, $161 million for elective surgery and $327 million for new sub acute beds. (2) For the first time the Commonwealth will fund 60 per cent of capital expenditure, on a ‘user cost of capital’ basis approach incorporating both depreciation and cost of capital components where possible.",195,Adjournment
