Naturally, the present trouble in Spain has interfered with our trade with thai country. I point out that our exports to Spain are about four times as much as our imports from that country.

15,Mr Casey (Corio,Treasurer ) [3.4]. the development of our fishing industry,18,Prime Minister S Department
16,Mr Francis (Moreton) [3.5],"Ipress, that the Defence Department would oo-operate with the Development Branch by making an aerial survey of Australian waters with the object of finding out the location, movements and habits of pelagic fish. The supply of edible fish to the Australian markets to-day appear to be very limited. ""We import over £1,000,000 worth of fish annually, and I contend that if we developed this industry, very large revenue would be obtained through the sale of locally-caught fish, whilst the resulting activity would provide increased employment. Having investigated this matter, [ find that the consumption of fish in Australia to-day is about 14 lb. a head annually, compared' with 40 lb. a head annually in the United Kingdom, [f our people were encouraged to equal the latter consumption on a proportionate basis, the value of fish consumed in Australia would be in the vicinity of £S,000,000 per annum, and the industry would then provide work for about 35,000 men and youths. Before returning to America, Mr Zane Grey, the well known American novelist, who has a world-wide reputation as a sporting fisherman, and spent many months on the eastern coast of Australia this year, stated that without a doubt Australia had the best fishing grounds in the world, and added that he was so satisfied with the quantity and quality of the fish to be obtained here, that he would lose no time in renewing his visit to these shores. Because of high prices ruling to-day, fish in Australia is a luxury for most people. In Great Britain, where improved methods for treating and marketing are fully availed of, fish is regularly included in the diet of the poorer classes. Tbe position, unfortunately, is reversed here, because of high prices and difficulties in marketing in the inland areas. Furthermore, the by-products of fish provide a very important industry such as the production of fish oil and meal and fish fertilindustry were properly developed it could izer. There is also the development of canning and smoking. I suggest that the Commonwealth and State Governments should give early consideration to the development of this industry on an orderly plan providing for research and examination of the fishing areas, co-operative freezing works at head-quarters of fishing fleets, and suitable transport, distributing and marketing arrangements instead of the present unsatisfactory conditions which exist to-day. There appears to be a serious lack of knowledge regarding the habits of fish in Australian waters, and particularly of fish outside our territorial waters. I am glad to learn that a director of fisheries is to be appointed in Australia. I have been given to understand that Dr. Harold Thompson, who is at present Director of Fisheries Research in Newfoundland, has been appointed to take charge of research work in the Commonwealth at a salary of £1.000 a year for five years. This man is a highly competent and efficient officer, and should be well able to carry out the duties which will be assigned to him. For some years he was the senior officer of the Fisheries Board in Scotland, and, on his way to Australia, he is to investigate the fishing industries of British Columbia and of California. Honourable members will recall that a few years ago Newfoundland passed through a very grave economic crisis, so grave, in fact, that the British Government was compelled practioally to take over its finances. Every effort was made by the authorities to develop the country's industries, of which fishing is the chief, and they were unable to find a more suitable man for the work than Dr. Thompson. His work in Newfoundland included investigations into the preservation of fish, marketing and handling, and the utiliza-: tion of by-products, as well as the making of a general review of the whole fishing industry of the island. In my opinion, it is important that Dr. Thompson, as soon as possible after he takes up his duties in Australia, should arrange a conference between representatives of the Commonwealth and the State Fisheries Departments, and a comprehensive representation of those actually engaged in the industry. If the provide much additional employment, as well as furnishing the people with a cheap and healthy food. Most fishermen use motor boats, and pay tax on the petrol used in them, as well as on the engines, if they are imported. The money derived from the petrol tax and customs duty is supposed to be devoted towards tbe upkeep of main roads, and it would be only fair, therefore, if the tax paid by fishermen were handed back to the States as a grant in aid to help the fishing industry along approved lines. should be applied to the users of stationary petrol engines and aeroplanes. ber must know that in return for the tax paid on petrol the Commonwealth Government is spending a considerable sum of money on the improvement of landing grounds for aeroplanes, and the provision of wireless, lighting and direction-finding apparatus. benefit of the lighthouses erected and maintained by the Commonwealth. trouble about lighthouses. However, some assistance might well be given in the direction of providing beacons inside the harbours to direct fishermen along the channels between banks, and havens or shelters, properly dredged, could be constructed so that they may be able to take shelter during stormy weather. Such work on a generous scale is urgently needed at Wynnum and Southport in Queensland. I appreciate what has been done for those engaged in the fishing industry, but I am sorry that so little proing. gress has been made. Now that it is proS osed to appoint a director of research, trust that development will be more rapid. The industry holds out great possibilities for employment, it being estimated that at least 25,000 more persons could be employed in it. son will be able to tell the fishermen where the fish are, but how are we going to develop the industry? portant improvements required is the provision of modern co-operative cooling plants at the various ports where the fishermen bring their catches. member want the State governments to make that provision? tion that exists to-day there should be coworld. I hope that he will be brought from operation between the Federal and State authorities. Some of the petrol tax could be devoted towards the building of cool stores and . the provision of the other facilities I have mentioned. At present, if a surplus of fish is brought in, it has to be jettisoned, because no storage facilities are available. I recognize, of course, that work of this kind is essentially a State function, but this is not a matter regarding which governments should stand on their strict constitutional rights, and the Commonwealth might well devote some of the proceeds of the petrol tax to assisting the fishing industry through the State governments. Other matters for investigation and improvement include quicker transport from the coast to the interior, and the provision of dry ice, &c. If the State and Commonwealth authorities will co-operate unselfishly in this work, it should be possible to employ our own people in the catching and marketing of millions of pounds' worth of fish instead of our importing fish from overseas. I regard the provision of the sum of £17,500 for the purchase of a fisheries vessel as being only the initial step in the orderly development of this valuable industry, and I hope that there will be no easing up in this matter. The purchase of this vessel for research work must, and can only be, the first step; if it is not, the vessel is not worth acquirWe must co-operate with the States in planning for the development of the whole of the fishing industry. the future? to provide fishermen with opportunities to secure suitable vessels, and to reduce their overhead costs by removing taxation on the industry as far as is possible. Such a policy would enable them to recover from the state of depression which they are experiencing at the present time. I have already indicated in general terms what such a plan should be, but the gentleman most competent to honourable fill in the details of it is the Director of Research, Dr. Thompson, who, I have suggested, is one of the most able and experienced men on this subject in the Newfoundland to the Commonwealth with the utmost despatch.",18,Prime Minister S Department

26,Mr Francis,"First, we must helpcapable men in Tasmania who could fill the position. adopt the attitude that there is no good in any country outside Australia, or vice versa. Dr. Thompson is a man of proved ability. Dp to date Australia has made little progress in the development of its fisheries resources, and its methods cannot be compared to those adopted in England, Canada, and the United States of America. I am sure that no one having the interests of those engaged in the industry at heart would be satisfied with the position as it exists here to-day. The combined wisdom of the world on industry is embodied in Dr. Thompson, and the Government should prevail upon him to take up his duties in Australia as early as possible. hope that these initial steps of appointing seals, there is another reason for the scara director of fisheries and of building a research vessel will lead to a complete revival of the industr'y. The time ia long overdue for the Commonwealth to take action to stabilize the fishing industry of Australia. I do not know the purpose for which the fisheries vessel is being built or what will be the duties of the Director of Fisheries, Dr. Thompson, but I do know that, whereas for many years Tasmanian waters have contained abundant supplies of fish, to-day there is a great scarcity. One of the functions of the new Director of Fisheries should be to study the causes of this depletion of the fishing beds and the reason why large shoals repeatedly travel round the Tasmanian coast. From inquiries that I have made, I believe that one of the reasons for the present scarcity of fish in Tasmanian waters is to be found in the depredations of the hair seal. These creatures are destroying millions of pounds' worth of fish, and a disturbing factor is that they are rapidly increasing in numbers. Trior to my recent departure for Canberra, a deputation representative of the fishing industry waited on the chairman of the Fisheries Commission in Hobart. Speakers described the position of the fishermen as desperate owing to the depredations of these seals. The deputation went so far as to ask the Government of Tasmania to order the destruction of the seals, which have no commercial value. They get in among a school of barracouta and cause havoc there. The barracouta is a valuable fish, which is in great demand on Australian markets, and it could also be tinned and sold with advantage overseas. If these scavengers of the deep are to be allowed Scotland, Newfoundland, to accumulate in such great numbers as to destroy shoals of fish, I consider that one of the first functions of the new Director of Fisheries should be to investigate means of overcoming this serious problem. The seals also chase away shoals of fish such as trumpeter matters affecting the fishing and perch. The Tasmanian trumpeter, perch and the silver trumpeter make excellent eating, and, I understand, have few equals in this respect. Furthermore, I Apart from the depredations of the city of fish in Tasmanian waters. A biologist informed me that recently millions of jellyfish were washed up upon the coast of Tasmania and that when their decayed remains were later washed back into the sea it caused a pollution of the waters, which drove away the fish. The Director of Fisheries should make a survey of Australian waters v/ith a view to taking action to assist the men engaged in this industry. In my opinion they are the highest taxed section of the community. They are obliged to pay up to £30 for a licence to catch food for the Australian public. Another of the great drawbacks of the fishing industry is the lack of sufficient refrigeration space os interstate boats. Honourable members must not lose sight of the fact that because of the geographical position of Tasmania the fish caught in its waters must be conveyed by steamers to the markets of the mainland. At times enormous quantities of good fish are caught, but, owing to the lack of refrigeration space on these ste""amers, only a iimited quantity can be marketed. Fish is a commodity which must be handled very carefully in order to ensure its preservation. It cannot be frozen like beef. If it is kept on ice too long it will become tainted.

He asked, among other things, for information as to the fund from which Dr. Thompson's remuneration was to be taken. His surmise that it is from the amount of £3,422 for "" fisheries investigations"", which appears on page 17 of the Estimates, is quite correct. research work of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research will not he any more extensive this year than it was last year? that. provided for it, for £1,500 was provided last year, and only £3,000 is provided this year, of which £1,000 will be required for Dr. Thompson's services. money is being expended in other directions. tions into the fishing industry. that I can give better information to the committee as to the intentions of the Government and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in this connection, than to direct the attention of honourable members to a statement made on the subject some time ago by Sir David Rivett, Chief Executive Officer of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. Sir David saidQuite recently the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has been instructed by the Commonwealth Government to take charge of this work, and I am sure you w ill be glad of an assurance that there is no intention of merely repeating past effort. There is not, for example, to be any further search made for trawling grounds. Existing knowledge in that direction must suffice for the present. Sea work w ill be restricted to what are called "" pelagic"" fish, meaning the species which swim freely at the surface, from which a great proportion of the supplies of other countries is drawn. We have still to learn much about the occurrences, seasonal migrations, breeding habits, Ac, of our varieties. Even ia the old-established fishing grounds of Europe intensive studies of this kind are continuously carried on. He went on to say-The planning of this vessel, which is to be built in Australia, is not at all an easy matter, for conflicting advices are given to ua by authorities in different places. He added thatThe vessel's work w i ll be intimately linked up with practical work on shore. Apart from marine biological studies, which w ill be carried out with university assistance, the main lines to be followed w i ll deal with preservation and transport of edible fish and the preparation of fish meal. A t the moment negotiations are being concluded between the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, the Meat Commissioner at the Homebush Abattoir in Sydney, and tlie Council for Scientific and Industrial Research for the conversion of certain buildings at Homebush into laboratories, refrigeration chambers, and so forth. Under the joint auspices of these three, and, we hope, of leading firms in the f r u it , meat, and fish trades, work w i ll be carried on along the most modern lines under the supervision of Dr. J. R. Vickery, and a group of keen young men, most of whom have been trained abroad as well as in Australia. Additions w ill be made to this staff by the usual Council for Scientific and Industrial Research method, based on successful experience, of securing 1 first-class graduates from our universities ana sending them to Britain and America for further training. Two such studentships are at present being advertised. There 'is no need for me to burden you with a lengthy statement of our plans; nor is it wise to attempt any prodiction of the course, let alone the results, of such work. Throughout, the fullest use w i ll be made of existing knowledge. Whether the investigations w ill result in fish consumption in Australia increasing from 14 lb. per head per annum to the 40 lb. of Britain, or even the 25 of New Zealand, depends upon many other factors than those which the present investigations seek to control; but the opportunities presented to private enterprise should be materially increased. That is a fairly succinct statement of the intentions of the council. The Leader of the Opposition referred to the fact that fishermen were required -to pay the full tax on the petrol that they use. On several occasions efforts have been made by various Ministers for Trade and Customs to devise a means to grant immunity from the tax on at least the petrol used by the fishermen in their fishing work; but no satisfactory method has so far been discovered. This subject is at present, however, receiving the consideration of the Government.",25,Prime Minister S Department

52,Mr Paterson,"I do not knowSeveral of the matters referred to by the Leader of the Opposition fall almost entirely within the province of the State governments, as I think he will admit; and this makes it quite impossible for the Commonwealth properly to deal with them. I assure the honourable gentleman that a sincere effort is being made to assist the fishing industry to establish itself in the important place that it should occupy in a country with such a long coastline as Australia has. information as to the amount of petrol tax that fishermen contribute; and, if so, will the Government consider granting the fishermen equivalent taxation relief in some other direction ? being made on that subject, and X hope that it will be possible to give the honornecessary exploratory work. able member some information on. it at a later date. About seven years ago, an amount of about £50,000 was placed on the Estimates by the Scullin Government to encourage and develop the fishing industry, but Mr Scullin, who was Treasurer at the time, admitted that he did not think such a large amount could be spent during that financial year. A good many things said during the course of the debate on that occasion are still true to-day. About that time. I visited Thursday Island, which was then included in my electorate, and had the good fortune to meet a gentleman versed in the fishing industry throughout the world. He was a very interesting E erson to discuss the subject with, for e had scientific as well as practical knowledge. He was a scientist. He told me a very different story from that told this afternoon by the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr E. J. Harrison). Mr Lang told me that he did not believe that it would be possible successfully to prosecute the fishing industry on the east coast of Australia, and particularly along the coast of New South Wales, for the reason that the bed of the sea within a short distance of the coast was nearly as rugged as the surface of the country a few miles inland. He thought that the rocks at the bottom of the sea would destroy the nets, and that, even if they did not, the sharks, which were present in thousands in those waters, would tear the nets to pieces as the fish were being trawled. This, in his opinion, would prevent successful trawl-fishing in those waters. There is abundant proof, of course, that plenty of fish exist in the coastal waters of New South Wales, but the expense of catching them would be too great. Mr Lang said that he hoped that if the government of the day brought any a commission to Australia to investigate the Jfishing industry, it would cause the research to be conducted in the southern waters of Australia, where probably the bed of the ocean would be more suitable for trawling. He was definitely of the opinion that there were many men in Australia quite capable of doing tbe He held the view that, although it remained to be proved whether fishing on a large scale could be successfully done in the southern waters of Australia, it was definitely unlikely that any success would be achieved in the waters off the coast of New South Wales and Queensland, where the presence of numerous sharks and also the existence of a rough ocean bed would be almost insuperable handicaps. Nets cost too much to be subjected to almost certain destruction by nse in such waters. Mr Lang did not think there was any need to bring experts to Australia to make investigations, because obviously it would not matter how many fish were in the sea if sharks and rocks made it imnamed Lang, who was well possible to secure them by trawling. He was also of the opinion that it was a matter for Commonwealth rather than State action. I believe that it would be impracticable to make a proper allocation of expenditure to the States to enable exploratory work of this kind to he done. However, if the Government goes to work in the right way, something useful may be achieved. We ought to encourage the people of Australia to eat more fish, and if we can market our own fish, we shall make it unnecessary for the people of Australia to spend large sums on imported fish of one kind and another. It is indisputable that the Australian waters are rich in fish of many kinds, but it does not seem to occur to many people that the migratory habits of fish need to",26,Prime Minister S Department

Undoubtedly, a good purpose will be served if we can develop our fishing industry, but the necessary work could be done by many competent Australians. 6 till, if Dr. Thompson achieves success in this underTaking, the expenditure incurred in bringtion in South Australia showed that the ing him here will have been justified. [4.13-| I do not know where we are heading in regard to the control of our fishing industry, but I am convinced that the time has arrived for a clear understanding to be obtained between the Commonwealth and the State governments as to the controlling authority. On the 8 th October last, a royal commisit is a rather precarious and hazardous sion appointed by the Government of South Australia, presented to the governamenable to the industrial and tariff ment of that State the last of its three reports on the fishing industry. We now have a proposal before us that the Commonwealth Government should import a gentleman from Newfoundland to make another investigation. to Australia to conduct the whole of the Commonwealth Government's operations in the fishing industry. have an easy job, for the Commonwealth's operations are nil. Not many years ago, a Danish expert was employed by the Commonwealth Government to advise it on the development of the Australian fishing industry, but unfortunately he was lost at sea in a government-owned vessel on which he was engaged at the time. A little earlier than that, Australia was visited by a delegation of practical fishermen from Scotland, who, we were told, would turn the whole country upside down, but very little happened. It will be seen, therefore, that -the honourable member for Herbert( Mr proposed purely for the investigation of Martens) was justified in saying that trawling conditions would be entirely different in Australian waters from those that obtain in the North Sea and in the North Atlantic waters, on monsters Another point that seems to have been overlooked is that the fishing industry of a country is dependent very largely on the sea-going habits of its people. will be developed in a country where the people are not uaturally of sea-going habits. Australia is inhabited by people who prefer the land. Even the Britishers who come here try to get as far away from the sea as possible An investigaman-power engaged in the industry is annually becoming dominated by a foreign element, particularly Italian, and that our own British people are not taking to the sea as a means of earning a livelihood. From what I have heard, this would appear to be equally true in respect of the other States. As one or two honourable members have pointed out, way of earning a living, and it is not ideals, which have been prevalent in Australia for so mauy years. Fishing as a means of livelihood in any country does not provide a fortune and, consequently, there is no great attraction to Australian people to embark upon it as an avocation. Some honourable members referred to .the high price of fish. The inquiry held in South Australia disclosed that prices were not unduly high, considering local conditions. In that State we have a fair supply of fish. According to the royal commission, the main difficulty is due to taking close inshore fish whilst sufficient attention is not being paid to fish outside the immediate vicinity of the mainland and islands. In effect, we have not at any time gone seriously into the matter of deep-sea fishing. As the Minister has not remarked upon the point, I do not know whether it is the intention of the Commonwealth Government to go into this matter, but I am of the opinion that it should not do so. surface fish. case its trawlers would have to go seawards, and if the Commonwealth intends to undertake such work it might juet as account of the huge marine well give attention to deep-sea fishing. that inhabit our seas. I do not think it is the duty of this Government to embark on such work. It should act solely as the repository of scientific knowledge gained in relation t« the fishing industry.",27,Prime Minister S Department

The fifth conclusion arrived at by this commission statedIn existing circumstances no tangible advantage would be gained by the abolition of the privately-owned and operated markets or by the establishment of a market either owned or managed by the State. We do not consider that any radical alteration of existing condithousands of pounds have been spent by tions would benefit either consumers or fisherthe Commonwealth Government, through men. That recommendation was made only twelve months ago, so it should be valuable to-day. The main point which this Government should consider in respect of the industry as a whole is that we cannot have a fishing industry unless we have a seafaring population. We have not got such a population, and we have no prospects in that direction. Dealing with the point raised in connection with the petrol tax, I point out that the quantity of petrol used in the fishing industry would be merely a small fraction of 1 per cent, of the total petrol used in Australia. The equipment of craft iB entirely a matter for the owners themselves. No fisherman is obliged to have a petrol engine. He may have no engine at all or, instead of using a petrol engine, he may prefer a diesel engine, which can be operated at about one-fifth of the cost of a petrol engine. a diesel engine is considerably more than the cost of a petrol engine. aware of that fact, but the diesel engine lasts longer and is more economical than the petrol engine in every way. Consequently, I am satisfied that no good will be done by inquiring into hair-splitting points of this kind; neither will any advantage result therefrom either to fishermen or to consumers of fish. This matter resolves itself into two compartments: first, a small one in which the Commonwealth Government should do the scientific work; and, secondly, one in which the work of developing the fishing industry should be left to private enterprise. [4.20] I have dealt with the fishing industry on two or three previous occasions. It appears to me that the two distinct phases of this industry have been confused in this discussion. I agree that this Government should spend money on scientific investigations in connection with all industries. It has already done a great deal in this direction in the fishing industry. Tho information obtained is not up to date, but within the last ten years, probably hundreds of its Development Branch, on this industry. Mucn matter has been typed and printed and maps have been drawn up picturing the coast of Australia, and indicating the locations of fish of various types and also dealing with their habits. If investigations into the fishing are limited in any direction, we shall not make real progress. As the Minister has pointed out, a tender has been accepted by the Melbourne Harbour Trust for the construction of the proposed vessel, the work now being in the hands of a builder. Reports resulting from investigations by the Development Branch during the last six or seven years, on which much money has been spent, still remain pigeon-holed, although effect could be given to them immediately, and the result of work now being done by Sir David Rivett and his students will probably be ready in the near future. The point I emphasize, however, is that the Commonwealth Government should give practical assistance immediately to the men now struggling in the fishing industry. The investigation now proposed, which I have no doubt will be put into practical effect eventually, will bring about the establishment of a big fishing industry, but this phase of the matter has nothing whatever to do with the problem of relieving the 7,000 or 8,000 fishermen now trying to earn a living by fishing in Australian waters. The new industry which the Government visualizes will be established and operated probably by large capitalised companies with modern trawlers, and",28,Prime Minister S Department

Some time ago the Commonwealth collaborated with the States in an effort to give a certain amount of relief to these fishermen. As has been suggested, it is a matter in which the Commonwealth and States should cooperate. I have been asked by the fishermen to advocate the erection and improvement of havens around the Australian coast. As the result of the unusually rough weather, which has prevailed during the last three or four years, this phase ports as Portarlington and all around the of the matter is a burning question with fishermen generally. storms which occurred in this period, numerous fishermen lost their entire kit. I took this matter up with tbe Treasurer, who conferred on it with the States, and I understand that the Commonwealth Government agreed to make available money to the States to afford relief to those men. I repeat that the scheme now proposed will not give any particular relief in this direction, ana I impress upon the Minister, that in conjunction with scientific investigation, a good deal of which has already been done, the Commonwealth Government should pay attention at once, in collaboration with the States, to helping the fishermen who are now struggling in the industry. Fishermen generally will benefit from the scientific investigation now proposed, but in the meantime many of them have to live. Probably there will always be a number of small fishermen with their own boats who will continue to engage in close shore fishing, even after a big fishing industry has been established. I repeat that there are two phases of this industry-First, continue to send out ships to make investigation of the nature proposed should be gations, and, secondly, consideration should be given to the establishment of cold storage, the improvement of havens and the encouragement of private enterThe Treasurer ( Mr Casey) prise to invest in the industry. AgainI appeal to honourable members to pay some attention to the plight of thousands of something comparable to fishermen in Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania, who have already asked for assistance. They have a fairly big We are hopeorganization, they issue periodical publications in all of the States and their secretary has been in touch with all political parties in this House, asking for much needed relief. Taking into consideration the paucity of our population, the number of men engaged in the industry compares with the number who earn their living in the industrv in other countries. I think that the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) will agree with that statement. There are many more Englishmen and Australians than Italians and Greeks engaged in the industry. This will be found to be the case at such coast, not excepting South Australia. honourable member say that there are more Britishers than foreigners engaged in this industry? the honourable member read the report of the royal commission which inquired into the industry in South Australia. report, which I have not read, I believe I am safe in saying that two-thirds of those engaged in catching and transporting fish to markets on the coast of Australia are Australians or Britishers. I am aware that there are many Italians engaged in the industry in Tasmania. I have seen these men at work, and have watched them smoking fish under most unhygienic conditions. However, the great majority of fishermen in Australia are Britishers or Australians and they have every claim to relief from this Government. I support the expenditure of this money on the purchase of a vessel with the object the Government should of developing the industry.

I do not agree with those honourable members who have criticized the action of the Government in appointing Dr. Harold Thompson to the position of Director of Fisheries Research in Australia. Rather do I believe that we should regard ourselves very lucky that Dr. Thompson has accepted the position, particularly as we have proved ourselves incapable of developing our own fisheries. The Government has done the right thing in seeking a man from the other side of the world, where a prosperous fishing industry has been established, despite adverse climatic conlection of this tax on petrol. They are ditions. I should like to be the first to meet Dr. Thompson on the gangway when he arrives in Australia, and to give him the hand of welcome. I am only sorry that he is not bringing with him 50 sturdy fishermen from the North Atlantic to teach us the art of fishing, because we have undoubtedly demonstrated our incapacity. I know of many people in the interior who crave for fish, and cannot get it. ""What is the first thing Finland, France, Belgium, Germany and the man from the outback does when he comes to the city? He goes and has a feed of fish. In the interior there is a large population seeking a fresh-fish diet, wealth Government should confine its and along the coast there are hundreds of thousands who would like to eat fish, but who cannot afford to buy it. We should use this new vessel when it is ready to find out where the fish are, and what are their habits and seasonal migration. We should then concentrate upon the provision of refrigerators, adequate aerial and rail transport, and the use of dry iGO to enable the fish to be conveyed inland to the women and children suffering from malnutrition. [Quorum formed.'] This debate has been most helpful and pany asked that Australian tinned fish be informative, and I hope the Minister will take into consideration the various suggestions which have been made. The importance of the fishing industry may be gauged from the figures quoted by various honourable members, particularly Francis) who pointed out that we imfish each year, while the value of onr local production amounts to no less than £1,275,000. Thore are 8,400 men actively engaged in the industry, and 4,258 boats are employed. I commend the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) that some relief should be given to fisherman from the payment of petrol tax. During the depression, the fishermen suffered probably more than any other section of the community. They do not use the roads in the course of their employment, and it cannot be argued that they receive any considerable assistance from the Commonwealth Government to justify the coltherefore justified in seeking a remission of customs and excise duty on the petrol they use in the course of their work. The Minister has stated that there are difficulties in the way of making such a remission, but I remind him that those difficulties have been overcome in other countries. One has only to study what has been done to assist the fishing industry in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Iceland to understand what a great deal more has yet to be done in Australia. While I recognize that the Commonactivities largely to investigation, and to the giving of taxation relief, it could also help by bringing the subject before a conference of Premiers so that an effective policy might be laid down and pursued. I trust that when Dr. Thompson takes charge of investigations, such a long-range policy will be formulated. It is contended that some canned fish is being produced in Australia of a quality equal to anything that can be imported, and those engaged in the industry have complained of the easy entry afforded to imported fish. When the Port Stephens Canning Com-",30,Prime Minister S Department

72,Mr Forde (Capricornia) [4.35],"used in the Australian Navy, the Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkhill), in reply to the request, stated that it had been decided, after a trial, not to use canned butter' fish in lieu of the tinned fish used at present, but that the article had been noted as a substitute if , for any reason, there was a shortage of some of the imported varieties. It is estimated that the catches of 100 steam trawlers would be required to increase the Australian consumption of fish from 14 lb. to 95lb. a head. That would lead to the direct employment of an additional 1,100 men and the indirect employment of about 5,400 persons. In order to develop the industry satisfactorily, it is necessary to provide improved although this is essentially a State concern, the Commonwealth could assist by bringing the matter before the Premiers in conference. The representatives of the fishing industry point out that the Federal Government has given assistance to other primary industries, such as dried fruits, wheat and dairying, and they are, therefore, justified in asking for specific assistance for their industry, which gives AlthoughI am anxious to see everything employment to-nearly 10,000 men on the possible done to develop our fishing indusproduction side, and sustains nearly try, I do not see what benefit we arc 80,000 dependants.

[4.40] I should like, for a moment, to divert attention from the interesting subject of fisheries research, and ask honourable members to consider the more important subject of research into animal diseases. There appears on the Estimates, under the item for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, a sum of £4,150 which, I understand, is to be spent on this work. From the scanty information I have been able to obtain, it appears that the Commonwealth Government, in association with the University of Sydney, has acquired a block of land near St. Mary's, in my electorate, and proposes to erect thereon certain buildings, either for the purpose of conducting research into animal diseases, or harbour facilities, and for supplementing the work already being done at the McMaster Institute, in Sydney. I should be pleased if the Minister would state what price was paid for the land, what is the exact nature of the work proposed to be undertaken, what buildings are to be erected, and the number of men it is proposed to engage. well as in western New experience, although any one qualified unlimited market for these commodities.",31,Prime Minister S Department
73,Mr John Lawson (Macquarie),,32,Prime Minister S Department
74,Mr Frost (Franklin) [4.43],"The Commonwealth Government should investigate the possibilities of carrying out similar work in Australia on a commercial basis. Between the Straits and the east-coa3t of Tasmania, hundreds of thousands of tons of pilchards and sardines are to be found at certain seasons of the year. They are very choice fish, and in any other part of the world would be caught by trawlers and marketed. In the cold waters of Tasmania, unlimited quantities of the best edible fish are to be obtained. They include the trumpeter and the black perch which are equal to the most palatable fish in any part of the world. Persons who have travelled extensively and examined the fisheries industries in other countries, have told me that other fish do not compare with the trumpeter, which abound in Tasmanian waters. Trawling operations have been carried on in the northern waters of Australia for fish which we know are present there in large quantities; but fish obtained from tropical seas do not compare with those caught in the cooler southern waters. The new Director of Fisheries, Dr. Thompson, should concentrate his attention on the possibilities of expanding the fishing industry off the southern coast of Australia. Apart from the scale fish, there are also unlimited quantities of shell known at what time of the year fish are fish, such as crayfish and lobsters, which could be commercially exploited to great advantage. Up to date the Commonwealth has made little progress in this direction. Last year about £400,000 worth of tinned lobsters, crab and crayfish was imported from other countries. The honourable member for Barker( Mr plies from New Zealand, and ii is a Archie Cameron) appeared to doubt whether Australian fishermen could meet the demands of the home market. In Tasmania there are many hundreds of men who have followed the occupation of fishermen throughout their lifetime, but unfortunately their sons have been obliged to enter other avocations because, I regret to say, the opportunities for marketing their catches are very limited. If these men were able to obtain a reasonable return, which more approached the price which the public pays for its fish, they would be able to earn a good living. The foreigners who are engaged in the trade usually handle the fish after it is caught, and they are the persons who make the big profits by rationing supplies to the public. Figures show that Australians must be the smallest consumers of fish in the world. During my trip overseas, I had the opportunity of visiting, among other countries, northern Bussia, and Latvia, and at RigaI saw vats in the markets containing live fish. The purchaser could select any fish which he chose and have it killed and cleaned for him. Thus, he was certain of its being fresh. Such a system could, with advantage, be adopted in Australia. I fail to see that any benefit is to be gained by delaying action which would develop this industry. The Government proposes to construct a vessel at a cost of £17,000, and has engaged an expert at a salary of £1,000 a year for five years, to investigate the possibilities of expanding this industry. In my opinion the expert will require all that time to carry out his work and I hope that it will not be in the nature of a pleasure cruise. If the Government were to subsidize a company to enable it to purchase a mother ship and eight or nine trawlers, to engage in this industry, it would be doing something really practicable. Australia, in this respect, can profit by the experience of other parts of the world, where it is plentiful, and when they will be drifting in the channels. Such information would surely be of advantage to the Australian trade. We know that there is a market waiting for the whole of the fish caught. At the present time, I think that the Sydney market gets the bulk of its suptravesty that menus on interstate boats and trains in Australia show that the only fish on service is smoked blue cod or kippers. Australian waters contain the best fish in abundant quantities and the sooner we exploit them commercially the better it will be for the industry. [Quorum formed.] Unlike some honourable members, I am not altogether satisfied that the expenditure of this money by the Government on a fisheries vessel is warranted, because it is proposed to assist private enterprise. The fishing industry has been established on the Australian ooaet for some years,",32,Prime Minister S Department
75,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [4.52],"and I consider that the initial step which tha Government should take in this matter is to analyse the reason why the industry is languishing and why persons engaged in it are finding such difficulty in having ready hauls available for their ships. I was informed by an employee on one of the trawlers that a few years ago it was possible for a boat to put out from Sydney Harbour and in 24 hours return with its holds full of fish. At the present time, however, a boat may be eight or nine days at sea before it has caught its requirements. This employee stated that the persons engaged in the industry itself aro mainly responsible for payers' money, it should first satisfy the depletion of the fishing grounds off the Australian coast, because, he said, despite whatever regulations may be in existence in regard to restricting the catching of undersized fish, they are not being strictly adhered to by the' fisherset aside to assist the fishing industry, men, or enforced by government officials. For that reason manv millions of undersized fish are destroyed by boats operating off the Australian coast. This practice has continued for a number of years, and honourable members are well aware of how private industry can operate. It is never concerned to any great extent with the damage which it may be doing to the fishing grounds so long as it is able to obtain a quick return for the capital invested. If this money is spent on a fisheries vessel by the Government, it is doubtful whether the results would be beneficial to the community.. The new Director of Fisheries, Dr. Thompson, is being brought to Australia at a high salary for a period of five years, and he may make certain recommendations. But of what use are any recommendations unless action is taken to ensure that the people responsible for conducting that industry are adhering to the regulations enforced! The Government has, probably, had representations made to it by interested parties engaged in this industry, who have now found that, due to their own short-sighted policy, the industhat in the spawning season, the fish try ia languishing, and hence they now require assistance from the Government to enable them to re-establish it. I desire fishermen. Even the undersized fish are to know what benefits will be derived by the taxpayers, the workers, who are providing this money for the fisheries vessel. in order to protect the fish during the If the Government succeeds in gaining its Mr Ward. objective, the advantages will accrue to private enterprise, which operates the industry for private gain. No guarantee is to be given by those engaged in the fishing industry that, in return for the assistance granted by the Government to enable them to operate successfully, they will bestow benefits on the Australian consumers of fish. There are no guarantees in regard to the regularity of the supply, or of the prices which will prevail on the market. I am not altogether satisfied that the Government is warranted in entering into this expenditure. Before it is prepared to spend the taxitself that some return will be given by the industry to the Australian public. notice that a sum of' money has been and for once I feel bound to agree substantially with the remarks of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward). If money were spent in the various States to protect the fish in their waters, quite a lot of good would thereby be achieved. At certain times of the year, particularly in the spawning season', portions of the coastal waters of South Australia should be protected from fishermen. In the spawning season I have seen fishermen going into shallow waters, and tying their nets together to make a continuous net up to half a mile in length. In that way they catch all kinds of fish, regardless of their size. If the federal authorities were to assist the States with a grant of money to enable these waters to be policed during the spawning season, some practical advantage would be accomplished. The honourable member for East Sydney stated that a few years ago fishermen could go out from Sydney and return in one or two days with their boats laden with fish. Why cannot they do so to-day! The reason is to be found in the fact swim into shallow waters, and are trapped by the lengthy nets used by taken. In all the States there should be a Btrict policing of the shallow waters, spawning season.",33,Prime Minister S Department
76,Mr Stacey (Adelaide) [4.57],"Ilistened attentively to the lucid account given by the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) in regard to the fisheries around the coast of Australia. I have been acquainted with the fishing industry practically from my infancy. The majority of those who are engaged in trawling in Mew South Wales come from the district in which I was born. The honourable member for Denison( Mr against tbe appointment of Dr. ThompMahoney) has given a clear exposition of the circumstances that exist in Tasmania. between the States which would make possible the protection of our fishing grounds by the declaring of a close season while fish are spawning. Each State makes its own regulations, with the result that fishermen can do as they like. The length of net used is not the most important factor. In the Old CountryI have seen an unbroken length of two miles «f net used without deleterious results. Those who market fish during the spawning season, however, are subject to heavy penalties. If similar action were taken in Australia, beneficial results would accrue not only to the fishermen, but also to the industry as a whole. I admit that Dr. Thompson is probably the most competent authority in the world in regard to the fishing industry. I point out, however, that Australia has the longest coastline of any country, and that Field Station at St. Mary's, New South the coastline of Newfoundland is no longer than that of the west coast of Tasmania. Even along our coastline the conditions differ materially, those on the coast of Tasmania being entirely dissimilar from those along the coast of northern New South Wales and Queensland. Government's first step should be to set up an advisory body consisting of river and deep-sea fishermen in every State. Sueh a body would he able to place Dr. Thompson in possession of the most reliable information obtainable. Without the assistance which these men can give, it would take him from two years to two and a half years to make himself acquainted with the different contory and sheep genetical investigations, ditions that apply along our coast. On the coast of South Australia the majority of those who are engaged in the industry are Italians, who have the advantage of (Cook) [5.0] I having experienced similar conditions in the Mediterranean. The deep-sea fishermen have come mostly from the north of Scotland and the east coast of England. The report presented by Sir David Rivett show3 that that gentleman is working along right lines. The associations of fishermen on the Clarence River, in Sydney, Tasmania and Victoria, have declared son, on the ground that he cannot understand Australian conditions. Unless he There is no co-ordination has the benefit of consultation with an advisory committee such as I have suggested, the value of his services will be iargely discounted. I am pleased that the Government has decided to have a vessel built in Australia. I trust that it will go further and act upon the suggestions that I have made for co-ordination of effort to prevent destruction during the spawning season, and for the appointment of an advisory committee. ter for the Interior) [5.9] I shall see that the suggestions made by the honourable member for Cook( Mr Garden) are Lrought to the notice of the Minister concerned. The honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr John Lawson) has asked for information in reference to the cost of the land, buildings, &c, of the Animal Health Wales. It appeared to me that he was under the impreseion that the cost of the land would appear in this year's Estimates. If honourable members will turn to the third column of division 2, at page 278 of the Estimates, they wii'i find that the expenditure last year on the Tho item "" Council for Scientific and Industrial Research-Buildings , Works and Sites"", was £7,400. That was the cost of the land purchased for the Animal Health Field Station at St. Mary's. acres. A property of 400 acres, which was formerly leased from Sir Frederick McMaster for an animal health laborabecame inadequate for the requirements of those purposes, and it was neGessaTy to find a larger and more suitable area for research.

80,Mr Paterson,"The area is 800acres at St. Mary's, on the Blue Mountains, became available for purchase, and the Sydney University offered to purchase 400 acres of it for its purposes, if the Commonwealth would acquire the remainder. The university also stated that it was probable that it would be able to obtain an endowment for the research station, giving a revenue of £1,000 per annum. Both the 800 acres purchased for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and the 400 acres owned by the Sydney University, will be available for research. The property being so suitable, and the sharing of the cost by the university being a strong consideration, the Commonwealth finally decided toacquire the property while the offer remained open. If honourable members will turn to the first column of item 2 of division 2 of this year's Estimates, they will find provision for an expenditure of £23,850. Of this amount, the sum of £3,580 is for buildings on the Animal Research Station at St. Mary's; £2,000 is to cover the cost of buildings for the farm manager and scientific officer, and £1,580 is for impleand the Animal Nutrition Laboratory ments, sub-divisional fencing, yards, and so forth. That leaves a major sum of £20,000, which is being expended on the laboratory in Melbourne, for the division of Animal Health, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. In this connection, I may say that the accommodation available at the Veterinary Research Institute, Melbourne, is now entirely inadequate, for several reasons. First, the council recently embarked on an exhaustive investigation into the problem of contagious bovine secondly, it has been necessary to transfer certain officers from Townsville to Melbourne, where they can carry out their work under better conditions, and in a locality whkh is free from infection; and thirdly, there is no suitable laboratory accommodation for Dr. Bull and certain members of his staff. The University of Melbourne offered to make available to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research an area of land in the grounds of the Veterinary Research Institute for the erection of a laboratory, subject to the condition that it should be built under the supervision of the university. This offer has been accepted, for Mr Paterson. the following reasons: It will provide a centre in which research into animal health problems connected with the dairying industry, and farm animals, as distinct from the pastoral industry, may be conducted; it will provide accommodation in the one place for Dr. Bull and certain of his senior officers, and enable them to maintain close touch with the laboratory work, supervise it efficiently, and take part in it ; it will afford space and facilities for the conduct of investigation which can be carried out effectively only in well-equipped laboratories; it will provide accommodation for the administrative staff and the library of the division of animal health, in a place where Dr. Bull and some of his senior officers can be located; and lastly, it will provide a centre for the training of younger research officers and form, a centre for officers who are engaged in field work in other States. I may say that the proposal to establish a laboratory in the grounds of the Melbourne Veterinary Research Institute is on the same lines as were followed with respect to the McMaster Animal Health Laboratory sheep which have been erected in the grounds of the universities of Sydney and Adelaide. The cost of the laboratory in Melbourne will be £20,000, and this makes up the total vote of £23,850, the £3,850 being for the buildings at St. Mary's. The amount of £7,400, which is shown as having been spent last year, represents the cost of the 800 acres of land acquired at St. Mary's.

I have recently made representations on behalf of certain returned soldiers in my electorate, who desire assistance in the building of war service homes, but they are unable to obtain the funds required. They have been advised that it is not now the policy of the departat Canberra to His late Majesty King ment to build homes, as it merely disposes of reverted homes and pays off mortgages on other properties. As the depression completely disorganized the building trade, and returned soldiers who had lost their employment found it impossible to obtain advances for the building of homes, what proportion of this vote will be made available for the erection of houses? for the Interior) [5.20] -Most of the amount of £6,530 referred to by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr details, among others, to be obWard) will be spent in Sydney at Admiralty House. As honourable members know, the Government of New South Wales some time ago handed over that house to the Commonwealth. It was in a bad state of repair, and required considerable expenditure upon it to make it again habitable. This vote includes an amount of £4,730, of which £4,431 is for renovations at Admiralty House. At Government House, Canberra, the comparatively small expenditure of £293 will be incurred, and £96 is provided for fencing and electrical installations, which make up the total of £4,730. This leaves £1,800 unaccounted for, and this amount is to be spent on the erection of quarters at Government House, Canberra, for the accommodation of the police officer, and for minor services which may be required during the year. The honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) drew attention to the vote of £200,000 which appears as the last item under the Department of the Interior. This sum includes £28,000 for loans to purchasers of war service homes to enable them to connect their premises with the sewerage system and to discharge sewerage costs. The other items are £38,000 for loans to purchasers to provide extra accommodation, and £4,000 for renovations to homes of purchasers who are unable to maintain the properties as provided under the War Service Homes Act. Of the remaining £130,000, £50,000 is for loans for the erection of new homes, and the other £80,000 is for loans for the acquisition of existing properties, including the discharge of onerous mortgages.

Unfortunately, at the Ann-street end of this building, there is a most unsightly galvanized-iron wall. I do not need to describe it to the Minister.

The explanation given by the Minister for the Interior( Mr Paterson) yesterday, why only £83,000 had been spent of the £120,000 voted under this heading last year, was not satisfactory to me. Why should about one-third of the vote have been left unexpended? I ask the Minister for an assurance that this year the full amount of the vote will be spent. The sooner this work is completed, the sooner will it become fully revenue-producing. While so much unemployment is being suffered by people throughout the Commonwealth, the Government should not allow money voted by the Parliament to remain unexpended. At oresent, about 300 men near Euston are being given only rationed work. This is not as it should be. I understand that when the river is too high constructional operations cannot be conducted satisfactorily, and a full complement of men cannot be employed, but at present all these men could be given full-time work, and I request that that be done. We were told yesterday that this job was largely inline control of the State governments, but as the Commonwealth Government provides 25 per cent, of the money required for the work, it should insist that the men employed on it be given full-time work. It would appear that the government is ""going slow"" in the carrying out of this work. ber may rest assured that that is not so. two-thirds of the money voted last year actually expended?

I suppose ail honourable members have had complaints made to them by individual returned soldiers that they have been unable to obtain an advance for the purpose of building a war service home. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) has, on several occasions, given an assurance that all the money necessary for the building of war service homes will ibe made available. In his last policy speech he said that, if the Ministry were returned to office, it would initiate housing and forestry projects in co-operation with the State governments. The electors were led to believe that the return of the Government would ensure that a comprehensive national housing scheme would be put in hand. Instead of that being the case, the Government is actually limiting the amount of money to be made available for building war service homes. As the houses that will be built in the big cities must be of brick, we may safely assume that the average cost of a new war service home during this financial year will be about £750,",38,Department Of The Intebiob

Are we to assume that this number will meet the demands of all the returned men throughout Australia requiring hom.e3? I should be amazed to know that this would be the oase. the Government to give some consideration to the necessity to set up a committee to investigate the administration of the War Service Homes Department. Serious complaints have come to probably all honourable members that certain returned men have been unable to obtain advances for the erection of the homes for which they have applied. As an honourable member opposite has said, there are, to-day, many men occupying war service homes who did not see active service. Many returned men are to-day unable to meet the payments required by the War Service Homes Commission. It is essential, in my opinion, that both the capital cost and the periodical payments for war service homes should be .reduced, for to-day many returned men are earning little more than the basic wage. The stress and strain of the war has undoubtedly impaired their capacity. This is being revealed more and more clearly as the years go hy. Recently, the rentals of some war service homes have been increased from 12s. 6d. to 20s. a week. I should like to know the reason for this sudden jump. From my personal contact with returned men I can assure the Government that there is urgent need to reconsider the present administrative policy of the War Service Homes Department, and a sub-committee of Cabinet, or a select committee of honourable members should be set up for this purpose. If the average price of war service homes of the type now being constructed is likely to be £750 in this finanto the national capital. A modern hoscial year, as suggested by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde), we should find some means to reduce the capital cost of the houses, so that the periodic payments may be correspondingly lower. It would be much better if the Government built lower-priced houses, which would give these men an opportunity to secure a house at a. rental of, sav, 12s. Gd. a week. [Quorum form-ed.] I understand that the Labour Government in Queensland has ereoted a number of houses at a cost of from £400 to £500, in order that they could be let to men on low wages. I recall that, during the last session, the honourable member for Cook( Mr Garden) elaborated on this scheme. It is undeniable that the war service homes administration needs to be re-adjusted in order that men who are failing in health, and are unable to earn comparatively high wages, may be enabled to benefit from its building scheme. I cannot understand why we acknowledge the necessity to provide pensions for sustenance, and, at the same time, refuse to attend to the problem of housing people who are in need. These people are worth looking after, and I hope that the Government will adopt the housing policy which I have advocated. listened to the remarks of the Minister regarding the proposal to erect a statue as a memorial to the late King George V. I contend that, in our generation, it would be more fitting if we devoted this money to some object which would be of benefit to humanity. I suggest, for instance, that as a memorial to the late King, a hospital should be erected in Canberra, as has already been done at Southwick, England. A hospital would be of real benefit to residents of this city, and would also arouse the admiration of visitors. The ANZAC Memorial in Hyde Park, Sydney, which cost £100,000, is a standing disgrace to the architecture of this country. Every one who views it exclaims in wonderment, ""What is this?"" A structure of this kind would be a disgrace to any city. Surely a sum so large as £100,000 could have been spent more effectively! I point out that the present hospital at Canberra is a disgrace pital would provide a fitting memorial to the late King; it would be more in harmony with the times, and would not only be of benefit to the people but would also be attractive to visitors. Certainly it would be a memorial of a more substantial nature than a statue. I hope that the Government, even at this late hour, will reconsider this matter. Modern memorials are usually built to serve some humane purpose; they are of bene-",39,Department Of The Intebiob

I suggest that if a hospital costing about £50,000 were erected in Canberra as a memorial to the late King, we would be doing something more befitting his memory than by spending £20,000 on a statue as is now proposed. The ANZAC Memorial in Hyde Park is nothing more than a huge barn, and I am of opinion that the money spent on it was completely wasted. Sir matter of opinion; I have heaTd very favorable remarks made about it. ber of the Sydney City CouncilI took some titled visitors to look at that memorial and they ridiculed it ; they were of opinion that it was of no architectural value whatever. I urge the Government to give consideration to my suggestion that a hospital should be erected in Canberra as a memorial to the late King; such a memorial would be of benefit to those now living and to generations to come. some time past, I have endeavoured to persuade the Minister lately in charge of War Service Homes to visit Adelaide to receive a deputation from the Municipal and District Councils Association. Although he visited Adelaide on two occasions, once while passing through from Western Australia, and again at tlie time the Premiers Conference was held at that city, the Minister, unfortunately, was understand that the building occupies the unable to meet this deputation. He arranged for the Commissioner for War Service Homes to be in Adelaide to receive it, but I have received much correspondence which makes it clear that the fact that the Commissioner received that deputation does not meet with the wishes of the association. It wants IO see a Minister, and I therefore ask the new Minister in charge of War Service Homes to visit Adelaide at an early date for that purpose. Dealing with war service homes generally, the position in South Australia dees net appear to be in the ehaotic condition which some honourable members [0] claim to exist in other States. Occupants of these homes in South Australia are suffering many disabilities, but the administration in that State is very sympathetic, with the result that there are not so many evictions as there appear to he elsewhere. The fact that the other States have larger populations than South Australia may account for many of the difficulties described. Every case which I have placed before the Minister, or the Commissioner, has received sympathetic consideration. the erection of the new building for Commonwealth Government offices in Brisbane. As a matter of fact, the first question which I asked in this House upon my election to Parliament, dealt with this matter. The Commonwealth Government has at least made an honest attempt to erect a very fine edifice in Brisbane. It seems to me, however, to be a great pity, and I have heard quite a number of Brisbane people comment adversely on the fact, that it has not seen its way clear to build along the full length of its property at ANZAC SquaTe. The new building is a wonderful structure, and it is adjacent to one of the best parks in Queensland, but, fronting Annstreet, near the railway station, a tin shack, apparently, is to be left standing alongside it. This is to be deplored. Commonwealth land ? it occupies only part of the block. I whole frontage to Adelaide-street, but does not run the full depth of the block to Ann-street.

It will interest him to know that the item of £13,000 appearing on the Estimates is for a new meteorological building in Brisbane. The building is to be ereoted on the site of the existing building in Wickham-terrace, and, when it is completed, it may help to solve the problem of providing accommodation fdr Commonwealth Departments. It is expected that the sum of £13,000 will cover the entire co9t of erecting the new building, and for providing the necessary engineering services. The honourable member for Darling( Mr Clark) asked why only £83,000 has been spont of £120,000 allocated last year for works on the Murray River. When he raised the question upon a former occasion, I mentioned, as one of the reasons why the full amount had not been expended, that the continuity of the work had from time to time been interrupted by flooding of the river. However, there is an even more important reason why the money was not expended, a reason which I overlooked in my previous reply. It was expected last year that a considerable sum of money would be paid out for the resumption of land in the neighbourhood of the Hume Reservoir, but the negotiations have been unusually protracted, and very little of this money was actually paid over during last financial year. This accounts for a large part of the £37,000 of the vote which remained unexpended at the end of the year. It is expected, that the full amount of £120,000 appearing on the Estimates this year will be actually expended. It remains true, however, that work in the Yarrawonga section was held up owing to flooding, in addition to which it was found impossible to work three shifts a day in another section, because the nature of the foundation necessitated the making of extensive tests. Another point is that comparatively large sums were received for the sale of plant, and this money was spent on construction work during the year. should like to know what precautions are taken by the Department of the Interior to ensure that men employed by-contractors on government works are paid their wages. A little while ago, the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevsar) mentioned iu this Parliament that wages owing by J. A. Harrison of Sydney to his workmen had not been paid. been paid in full. protest was made in this chamber. This same contractor is the successful tenderer for certain works at Admiralty House, in Sydney, and I should be glad to know what hours and conditions of labour will be enforced, and whether any precaution has been taken to ensure that the workmen are paid. Honourable members on this side of the House realize the need for such precautions so long as the Government persists in its foolish policy of having public works done by contract. ter for the Interior) [6.8] -As I stated by way of interjeotion, the case referred to by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) of the non-payment of wages by a Sydney contractor has since been satisfactorily settled. I assure the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) that everything possible is done by the Department of the Interior to ensure that workmen employed by contractors on government works receive their wages. Contractors must lodge a deposit before being given the contract, the money so deposited is used to pay workmen who have not received their wages. Indeed, that is one important reason for requiring that a deposit be made. Proposed vote agreed to.

I should like him to elaborate on this subject. Does the Government intend to commence the manufacture of aircraft itself?

The Opposition has very definite views in regard to the manufacture of arms. made tude that tured in government factories was reaffirmed at the last conference of the Labour party, which was held in Adelaide, and at which it was unanimously decided that the complete to naval construction, tions should be vested entirely in the Commonwealth Government in order to obviate the possibility of profiteering in the manufacture of armaments. It is considered of vital importance by the Opposition that the manufacture of armaments should be carried on exclusively in factories controlled by the Commonwealth Government. Doubtless, the Minister w ill be able to enlighten the committee upon that matter and thus allay the anxiety which is felt by honourable members of the Opposition.

Can the honourable gentleman also say whether he has been able to reconsider his attitude in regard to the numerous applications that are made to him in his capacity as Ministerf o r Defence to make available grants of money to assist in the preparation of aerodromes in country centres throughout Australia? I know that there are places like Gladstone, which has a very fine port, capable of accommodating the entire Australian Fleet. Residents of that town have asked the Minister to make available money for the construction of an aerodrome there, and similar requests have been made from towns in other parts of Australia. In my opinion, money could be spent with advantage in this direction, because it would mean the felling of trees and the clearing and levelling of land, thus absorbing much of the expenditure in the employment of labour.

115,Sir Archdale Parkhill (War,"may be of some guidance to the committee in discussing these items in connection with the Department of Defence. The first matter mentioned by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to the vote of £599,210 in connection with tlie Navy. I have been asked what avenues of expenditure were included in it, and the purposes for which this money will be spent. The division, it will be observed, relates to naval construction, and the principal item is for a sum of £451,000, which is an instalment on the purchase of the cruiser Sydney. That absorbs a considerable portion of the expenditure. A further sum of £94,000 is to finance the completion of the construction of the sloop Swan, and a further of Australian production. The policy of sum of £3,000 is earmarked for the completion of the sloop Yarra. A sum of £50,000 is placed on the Estimates for new construction during the current financial year. struction take place? shall explain that matter presently. A further item of £55,650 is made up as follows: naval stores, £1,400; ordnance stores, £16,000; and oil fuel, £38,250. These sums are designed mainly to keep up establishments of reserve stocks. Then there is a sum of £4,850 for machinery and plant, which is to provide for increased repair facilities at the naval dockyards, and for the replacement of obsolete machinery. A further sum of £10,920, which appears under the heading of "" Construction of Targets, &c"", is mainly for launches and lighters commenced in 1935-36, and in the replacement of unserviceable launches at the Flinders Naval Base and at district naval depots. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked me to explain in what avenues this expenditure will take place, and he referred particularly to the item of £50,000 for new construction. In reply, I can only repeat what I have said on numerous occasions recently, that the intention of this Government is to build in Australia as much of our naval requirements as is economically possible. The 'reason governing this policy is: first, to honourable member can be no more make the Commonwealth self-supporting as far as possible in respect of the provision of its naval requirements; and secondly, to retain the work in connection with this expenditure in Australia in order to give employment to Australian artisans. That applies, not only to the actual work of construction, but also to the materials used in that construction. If the materials can be obtained in Australia they certainly will be; and the orders which are placed overseas are closely scrutinized, and are Bent baok if it is thought either by myself or by the departmental officials that the requirements can be procured in Australia. 1 know of no steps which could be more satisfactory than those which are now being taken, to ensure that the materials which are being used in thio direction are the Government is definite and clear that, as far as it is possible to do so, the naval requirements of the Commonwealth will be fulfilled in Australia. nebulous. Can the Minister give the committee more concrete information on this surprised that the honourable member should regard my remarks as being nebulous. I cannot say outright that all the requirements, without exception, will be obtained in Australia, because circumstances may arise in which it is not economically reasonable to do the work here. But at the present time the matter of the nature of additions to the Australian Navy is under consideration by the Government. Assuming that it is decided that sloops or destroyers will be a necossary part of naval construction, I say emphatically that the vessels will be built in Australia. to know. endeavoured to make that point clear in my explanation. for West Sydney is naturally anxious about this matter, because of the increased employment that naval construction in Australia would bring about. anxious than honourable members on this side of the House on that point.

However, 1 do not think that there is any necessity for me to continue on these lines. The honourable member for West Sydney, who has displayed a keen interest in this subject, brought a deputation to me, and I gave him an assurance similar to that which I am giving to the committee to-night. I can state in no more definite .terms the determination of the Government to build the naval requirements of the Commonwealth of Australia for the reasons that I have indicated. take to build a vessel? Sir AECHDAL E PARKHILL -A t the Cockatoo Island Dockyard the sloop Yarra has already been constructed, and it ia satisfactory in every respect. The workmanship in that vessel is as good as could be obtained anywhere, and it was also carried out in reasonable time. Subgun3 in Australia for some years to come, sequently, a second sloop was ordered, and it is nearly completed. The cost of construction, I am pleased to say, is considerably less than that of the Yarra. The arrangements under which it was built was that if its cost were less than that of the first sloop, a certain percenstructional programme. tage of that reduced cost should revert to the Government; and that i9 being done. My experience whilst I have been Minister for Defence has been that the construction entrusted to Australian industry and workmen has been perfectly satisfactory. ter will not allow national matters to be subordinated to individual electorates. no means; and nothing I have said tonight could bear that construction being placed upon it. If the honourable member desires any assurance in that connection I ask him to believe that there is no such intention. A sum of £204,428 is set down for the coastal defence. This is mainly to provide for equipment for the 9.2 in. and 6 in. guns, munitions and anti-aircraft equipment, and relative equipment. Some of that equipment is being built in Australia at the factories of the Commonwealth Government. The sum of £502,038 is provided for arms, armament and ammunition, mainly for gun ammunition, supplement to reserve of small arms ammunition, improvement of armaments, new equipment for training, and mechanization. I repeat that so far as the munitions factories in Australia can produce these munitions, to that extent the work will be given to them. The munitions factories at Footscray, Maribyrnong, and Lithgow, are exceedingly well-equipped, and turn out armaments and munitions which are satisfactory in every respect. an order was placed abroad for the purchase of modern equipment for the defences of Newcastle? equipment consisted of 9.2-in. guns, which are not and at the present stage cannot be manufactured in Australia, and have to be obtained from Great Britain. There is no likelihood of obtaining 9.2-in. and as they were required immediately the order had to be placed overseas. That is the guiding principle of the Government. The sum of £2,750, for which provision is made under item 2 of division 12, is required for the Darwin conThe sum of £349,129 is set down for the Air Eorce. This provision is mainly for aircraft of a new type, which is required for new units for ooastal reconnaisance. Eor some years, discussions have taken place as to the most suitable form of fixed or coast defences. The question which has agitated the minds of the best advisers which the Government could obtain, either in Australia or overseas, was whether those defences should be entirely naval, or should also embrace aircraft. It was finally determined that they should be a combination of both. Consequently, 9.2-in. as well as 6-in. guns are being placed at certain points on the Australian coast, and in addition aircraft for reconnaisance and directional purposes are being utilised. The sum of £231,000 will be utilized in the purchase of aircraft of the Blenheim type, which is the latest type in existence",44,Department Of Defence

Sir There is no item covering the manufacture of aircraft in Australia. I thought that that matter would have been reserved for the debate on the general Estimates. The honourable member for West Sydney intimated some days ago that he proposed to question me upon it. Consequently, I have had prepared a brief statement which explains the whole matter. I preface the remarks that I have to make with the statement that, as Parliament was not sitting when a final determination was made, a statement was published in the press, to which this to some extent refers. Some three months ago it was announced that the Government had issued to a syndicate comprising the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited and certain other companies an invitation to establish the aircraft manufacturing industry in Australia. This invitation followed upon a close examination of the matter, and gave effect to the desire of the Government to remedy the unsatisfactory position in which Australia was placed by reason of it3 not having reasonably adequate facilities for the manufacture of aircraft and aero engines. Up to that time the most that had been accomplished was the imported materials, of simple types of air frames-that is, aircraft without engines-and the manufacture of certain limited selected parts of air frames. The position in regard to the manufacture of aero engines was, if anything, more unsatisfactory. During recent years, a small range of spare parts had certainly been made locally, but there had been no advance towards complete manufacture. I have now been advised that the syndicate has thoroughly investigated the matter, and, as the result of the reports and recommendations of experts sent overseas by it, and at its expense, to study that at no distant date the aircraft manuaircraft and aero engine manufacture -in Great Britain, Europe and the United States of America, has decided tc proceed In addition, an with the formation of an aircraft manufacturing company. This company will be registered immediately, and will commence with a capital of £600,000, which will be subscribed as follows:-Broken H i ll Proprietary Company Limited, £240,000; BrokenH i ll Associated Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand Limited, £100,000; General Motors Holden's Limited, £60,000. The new company will thus be assured of adequate financial provision from the outset, and, with the technical resources-which it will have at its command, will be in a position to overcome' the difficulties which must inevitably be associated with the establishment of an industry of this character. It has prepared a plan of production which envisages, as the first step, the manufacture, simultaneously of both aircraft and aero engines of the less complicated types. The experience and knowledge gained in the manufacture of such types will enable it to undertake the manufacture of the more complicated types of certain aircraft, which, in the meantime, will havo to be ordered from Great Britain as heretofore. The most modern plants and methods of manufacture will be employed. Although orders for aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force will play an. important part in absorbing the output of the company, nevertheless, the civil market will not be neglected, but will be catered for to the greatest possible fabrication, principally from extent. given a guarantee of Government contracts ? There is no guarantee of Government contracts; there is no guarantee of a financial character. The preliminary details and investigations in connection with a proposal of this nature, necessarily take time. It is gratifying to know, however, that these preliminaries have now been satisfactorily settled, and facturing industry will be established in Australia on such a scale and under such conditions as will enable it to make a",45,Department Of Defence

It has been conducting investigations, with a view to ascertaining which site is the most suitable. I understand that it is advantageous to have an airport in close proximity to such works. The necessity to manufacture aircraft is so great, the need is so urgent, the difficulties of government production are so nearly insuperable, that the Government could not afford to turn down this offer. The be given? industrialists concerned do not anticipate that they will make any profits from this will be monetary assistanoe, of course. venture for many years, nor can I see Whatever technical advice the department any likelihood of their doing so. It is is able to give is always at the disposal satisfactory to note that there are industrialists in Australia who are prepared to do something for the country in which they live and make profits, in order that its defences may be placed in something like effective order. out of this country. That is admitted. This offer does them credit, and will mean a considerable accession to the strength and security of the defences of Australia. Up to the present, our requirements of aircraft have been obtained only with the very greatest difficulty. Honourable members understand the reason for that. We are bound to obtain airoraft from Great endeavouring to raise the defences of the the Minister Empire to such a satisfactory state that they will prove adequate to meet any threat.

The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) has asked me to say whether there is any provision for the establishment and maintenance of aerodromes in different parts of this country. I explained yesterday, and have stated on previous occasions, that the policy which the Government is compelled to adopt is that of spending the comparatively limited amount of money available for civil aviation at the airports and aerodromes which are on tbe national airways, and are essential for defence. Other aerodromes must depend for their maintenance on the local governing authorities.

Broadly speaking, the defence at this stage, for the Government to help in all aviation activities, because it must present financial year, and the limitaconcentrate on the main airways. Turning to the munitions supply branch, the sum of £9,576 is on the Estimates for the acquisition of the small arms ammunition factory. This is the final payment by the Commonwealth. There is a further sum of £132,934 for additional machinery and plant required under the munitions supply programme for strengthening the manufacturing capacity of munition factories in furtherance of the policy of national selfcontainment in the production of munitions. The main items areAmmunition Factory, Footscray Explosives Factory, Maribyrnong Ordnance Factory, Maribyrnong Small Arms -Factory, Lithgow. . 6,000 Munitions Supply Laboratory, Maribyrnong Inspection Branch, Maribyrnong and Wakefield Revotes from 1935-36 vote to assist rifle clubs? Sir That matter does not arise in the consideration of the ""Works Estimates, but I may mention that half of the free grant of ammunition to rifle clubs is being restored, in accordance with the promise already made, because of the valuable services rendered by these clubs throughout Australia. I hope that the reserves will be sufficiently built up to enable the grant pay for equipment to protect the possesof free ammunition to be fully restored next financial year. is again unfortunate that the general discussion of the defence policy of the Government and the total expenditure involved in this year's programme will take place subsequent to the consideration of these items, because agreement to these votes involves endorsement of the principle of the general programme, although that endorsement has yet to be determined. The total expenditure involved in the programme of works which the Minister has just explained is over £3,000,000, of which a little less than £2,000,000 is to be provided from trust funds, leaving £1,117,000 as the portion of the total appropriation from the revenue account for the Department of programme is to cost £8,000,000 in the tions imposed upon the consideration of the whole programme by this debate restricts the committee to a discussion of the £3,000,000 provided for works. I do not intend to anticipate the general debate on defence, even though the Minister is securing from private enterprise in Australia equipment and resources hitherto obtained overseas. To this extent the programme is welcome, but, as defence is a charge on the entire community, one indispensable requisite is that in no respect should defence equipment become the victim of a profiteers' market. £ We must accept the dictum that defence, 40,000 which is a costly business, is an insur5,000 ance against war, and, perhaps, invasion; 27,000 but it must also be remembered that those who have large possessions in this country 7,000 have infinitely more at stake than those who have no property at all. That being .. 12,000 so, it would be proper to consider the .. 35,000 entire defence programme,, not before we discuss the general taxation policy of the Government, but after we have agreed imposed by this Parliament. As the matter stands, the Government may, in. this piecemeal way, obtain authorization of works which will probably involve transactions with private enterprise, and at the same time lead to the result that, when we come to the discussion of the budget in general, the money required to sions of the rich will be secured through an unfair incidence of taxation in which the principle of ability to pay will be entirely disregarded. tion will not refuse to defend their country. not arise. Never has the Opposition left itself open to the accusation that it is not prepared to defend Australia against invasion and to take proper measures to. ensure the security of the country.

146,Mr Curtin,"That question doesAt a deputation which waited on him a considerable time ago, a resume of the conclusions of Admiral Henderson on this matter were submitted to him. Since that time, considerable expenditure has been incurred by the British Government on the dock at Singapore, hut there are those who Bay that that dock could easily become a veritable harbour of Santiago as far as the British fleet and the security of Australia are concerned. A network of islands in which hostile submarines oould lurk surrounds the port of Singapore, and one can conjecture the possibilities in that regard. that the possibilities have been conjectured by the British authorities. should be recognized that a considerable interval has elapsed since Singapore was selected as an effective naval base, and that the whole outlook in regard to peace in the Pacific has completely changed. I leave the matter at that, having said more, perhaps, than is desirable. But the importance of the northern and western eoast of this continent is such that a mere reliance upon Singapore may be hopelessly insufficient. I shall deal with the general question of defence at a later stage. draw attention to the vote of £204,428 for "" Coast defences--equipmen t and works "". I appreciate the efforts of the Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkhill) in providing for the construction of aeroplanes in Australia. We are very fortunate in having the co-operation of such a leading organization of aircraft manufacturers as that mentioned by the Minister. For more than two years an effort has been made to complete arrangements for the construction of Fort Cowan Cowan on Moreton Island, near Brisbane. Before Parliament adjourned at the end of last year, the Minister indicated to me that considerable delay had occurred in calling for tenders for this work because a proposal had been made to increase the calibre of the guns at the fort; but I understand that tenders closed last week. I therefore ask the honourable gentleman whether he is in a position to give us the name of the successful tenderer? I should also like to know how long it will take to carry out the work, and when a beginning will be made with it. -The statement of the Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkhill) as to the Government's proposals for the construction of additional naval units wa* very interesting to all honourable members. I do not intend at the moment to make a plea for the people in any particular district, for I think all honourable members will concede that the larger the amount of money spent in Australia in connection with the GoI presume vernment's defence works the greater the benefits arising out of the employment afforded that will accrue to aB our people. Such benefits will spread over, not only our city areas, but also all our primary producing areas. I therefore approach my consideration of this subject having in mind the welfare of the whole community as well as that of the men who will actually perform the constructional work. Some of the phrases used by the Minister in tha course of his speech were nebulous generalities. He spoke, for instance, about a thing being "" economically possible"". It will be generally agreed that such a term may be given a wide interpretation.

In determining whether a thing is "" economically possible"" we should not oonfine our consideration solely to the pounds, shillings and pence aspect. an effective national defence policy should be borne in mind. should have regard, for instance, to the necessity to train our workmen to do all the work that may be required of them if occasion should arise to defend our country. be unjustifiably narrow to interpret "" economically possible"" solely or even mainly by consideration of pounds, shillings and pence. We have skilled artisans in Australia who could do all the work likely to be required in all classes of shipbuilding and in a most expert and workmanlike manner, and it seems to me more necessary in these days than eveT before to ensure that we shall be continually training men in this country to do all classes of engineering and other work which would be a vital factor when the defence of the country was involved. We should certainly be opening up avenues for the apprenticeship of our young men who are leaving school, and the engineering trades, particularly shipbuilding, offer wide scope for this. If we adopted a wise policy we should find engineering work of one kind and another in Australia for all our young men who have a preference for such employment. To do so would undoubtedly train them to take an effective part in the defence of their country should the need arise. I trust, therefore, that whether the Government decides to build a sloop or a cruiser the work will be done here. I understand that the Sydney cost about £2,000,000. If that money had been spent in Australia it would have been of vast benefit, not only to those engaged in the shipbuilding industry, but also to primary producers, and, in fact, every section of the community. I, therefore, urge the Government not to give a Mr Beasley. narrow interpretation to the phrase "" economically possible "" but to have in mind the necessity to provide avenues of work for our artisans, openings for the A cruiser oould to-day apprenticeship of our young men, and a larger home marketfor our primary producers. [8.52] I shall be grateful to the Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkhill) if he will give me some more precise inAll the requirements of formation as to how it is intended to use the money proposed to be expended at the' We Lithgow Small Arma Faetory. What is the total amount to be voted, and what proportion of it will he devoted respectively to buildings, machinery and equipment? I have had many requests It would, therefore, from my constituents in Lithgow for information on this subject, and I shall be glad if the Minister will make it available without further delay. I wish now to refer briefly to the development of the Richmond aerodrome. As most honourable members are aware, this aerodrome has increased in importance rapidly during the last two or three years. Two years ago only about 100 men were stationed there, but I understand that within the next twelve months about 1,000 men will be employed there. I direct attention to the need to provide adequate playing fields for this large company of men, either on the grounds of the aerodrome or on grounds adjacent to it. It is imperative in the interests of the health of large bodies of men congregated in any one place that they shall be provided with reasonable facilities for open do everything possible to air sport. I suggest that if no money is included in these Estimates for the equipment of adequate playing fields at the aerodrome it should be provided without further delay from some source. An alternative to the provision of playing areas by the Government is the subsidizing of existing public playing fields in the district. Definite action on this subject is necessary at omoe. If extra land needs to be acquired for the purpose, the Government should not delay in securing it in view of the large and increasing number of men stationed at Richmond aerodrome. ciate myself with the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Our tin)",49,Archdale Parkhill Upon The Incidence Of The Taxation To Be

Like the honourable member for West Sydney, I regard the term "" economically possible "", used by the Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkhill), as vague and elusive. Certainly the phrase should not be interpreted narrowly and other considerations than those of money should be borne in mind. If extensive defence works are put in hand in Australia-and I have in mind particularly tbe construction of naval vessels-the money so expended will undoubtedly circulate over a very wide area. Some of it may even reach Tasmania. I can appreoiate, for example, that if work is provided for a large number of men in Sydney on a new cruiser or sloop, an improved market may be found there for Tasmanian potatoes. I ask the Minister to be a little more explicit as to his own interpretation of the words "" economically possible"". We beard a good deal this afternoon about the Australian fishing industry. It would be highly desirable, in my opinion, to encourage the conMost of the appeals made by honourable sumption of Australian fish on our local naval vessels.

In recent years Arohdaie Parkhill) has been referred to it has been the policy of the Defence as a defence policy, but whon I hear the Department to renovate drill halls in the Minister speaking of the construction of various military districts. Ballarat has cruisers I wonder .if such vessels are a particularly fine drill hall, but this really needed for the defence of Australia structure is floored with asphalt, which is found to be somewhat inconvenient in a district which is situated at an altitude of 2,000 feet. Furthermore, I point out that in order to secure recruits under the present system of voluntary enlistment, conditions in the Military Forces must be made as attractive as possible. For that reason it is essential, not only to attend to the military training of recruits, but also to provide facilities for social activities in connection with their military work. For instance, social committees, composed of friends of recruits, are needed to encourage units. Consequently, drill halls are regarded, not only as head-quarters for military training, but also as centres of social activity such as dances, &c. This claim may sound somewhat incongruous, but the development of the social life of members of units is essential. I . ask the Minister whether any provision has been made in these Estimates to renovate the drill hall at Ballarat, and particularly to replace the asphalt floor of that structure with a wooden floor? members in this debate have been directed towards requesting that works be carried out in their respective electorates.

I ask myself whether this represents a policy for the defence of Australia or whether Australia is being considered merely as a pawn in some militaristic scheme. In recent years we have had visits from eminent overseas naval and military authorities, and we have sent abroad, several alleged Australian statesmen, who received orders overseas from the ""Imperial Defence Committee. The work of such delegations has resulted in the drawing up of a plan of defence expenditure, spread over a number of years, but such a scheme has never really been desired on the part of the Australian people. To me the risks are real. I do not take the matter of defence so Hghtly as do honourable members opposite whose services, in any case, would not be required in the event of war because, for one reason or another, most of them would be rejected. I view the matter of the defence of Australia as one who may be directly involved in any war that may affect this country, and 1 certainly do not under the noses of these unemployed men desire to be involved in any conflict. I have in mind a recent incident in which two Australian warships, manned by Australian crews, were sent to parts unknown; their destination remained unknown because the Minister refused to give honourable members any information on that point. But we know that these ships, at the time to which I refer, were in a zone of war and that there was every possibility of some of the crew losing their lives through being shelled, an event which would possibly have involved Australia in war.

I oppose such a proposal on this country to-day to defend are the the ground that a naval vessel is not an richer sections of the community who arm of defence but is one of offence; and live on the cream of the land and take for I suggest that if this Government themselves everything that is good in life. were concerned purely with the deYet these people will not do the fence of Australia, it would he proactual fighting in the event of viding only arms of defence and war; they hope, by economic preswould not be building up a navy having a range extending far beyond the coast of Australia with the object of using it in the wars of other peoples. The Australian Labour party should not support such a policy. The honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Fisken) was very concerned about the provision of a wooden floor in the Ballarat drill hall; he said that we were depending on a voluntary enlistment system, and urged that every attention should be given to the recreation of recruits; that everything possible should be done to make their conditions comfortable. As a matter of fact this Government has adopted a recruiting policy, but it differs in certain respects from thai suggested by the honourable member. The Minister probably is aware of this new recruiting system. Recently this Government made arrangements with the Government of New South Wales to sack from 16,000 to 18,000 men who were employed on relief work, and then this Government arranged for a steaming oven to be conveyed through the streets of Sydney believing that by such methods thoy would be induced to join up with the military forces. remind the honourable member that he can deal more appropriately with that aspect of defence policy, when the general Defence Estimates are being considered. diture proposed under the item now before the committee is unwarranted, particularly at the present time, because the most important consideration in the defence of a country, is not only the provision of the necessary arms of defence, but icy of defence must exist in the hearts of",51,Archdale Parkhill Upon The Incidence Of The Taxation To Be

For these reasons, this Government, instead of spending large sums of money in the direction now proposed to the committee, should make this country worthy of defending by providing the less fortunate sections of the people with adequate food, clothing and shelter. As a member of Parliament, I have something worth defending; I am well paid and in comfortable circumstances, but there are many thousands of unemployed in the electorate of East Sydney who are in different circumstances. If I were unemployed, I should not be very enthusiastic about the defence programme of this Government. It is true that the inauguration of this policy will provide a few jobs for men now unemployed, and tradesmen, but such jobs will be only of a temporary character. more, only those who will be engaged in this work may be employed in the construction of implements which eventually may be used for the destruction of human life, because when this Government talks about modernizing coastal defences and increasing supplies of munitions and armaments, it seeks to provide these things not merely to beat off a foreign foe; I suggest that if internal trouble arose in this country, for instance, if less fortunate peonle were driven in desperation to rise against a government, which refused to attend to their needs, we would find that the very armaments, for which honourable members are now asked to make provision, would be used as readily against these people as they would be used against an external enemy. defences could not be U6ed in the way the honourable member suggests? member deny that munitions, aeroplanes and small arms could not be used against the Australian populace, and will he deny that this government would hesitate to use them against Australians in the circumstances which I have indicated? If a civil disturbance occurred in one of the States, and the State authorities were unable to cope with it. the Commonwealth Government would not hesitate to send soldiers into that State to shoot down the workers. It was at one time proposed to send soldiers to BrokenH i ll against the workers who were fighting for their rights. Does any one think that the workers like fighting? previous occasions warned the honourable member that his remarks are inappropriate to the item before the committee.

The municipality of Paddington is anxious to have the Victoria Barracks removed so that it may erect workers' homes in this area, and the Minister has never given any satisfactory reason for declining to sanction the removal. I strongly protest against the expenditure of even one pound of Commonwealth revenue on implements of destruction while it is so difficult to induce the Government to spend anything on schemes for the saving of human life. not intended to speak, but I have been the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward). should not take any notice of him. not for the fact that his remarks probably reflect the opinion of a considerable section of the community regarding the Government's defence policy.

The honourable member will recall, however, that a German cruiser, the Emden, wag able to do a very considerable amount of damage to our shipping before an end was put to its activities by an Australian cruiser. Some honourable members have said that this year's defence vote is indicative of the growth of a militaristic spirit, but that IB not the case. Just as the existence of an impartial judiciary, and an effective police force, is tbe best insurance against press. I hope that no such disturbances oivil disturbance, so our possession of a strong army, navy and air force will be the best deterrent against foreign aggression. The Government, by strengthening the various arnm of defence, is aiming to achieve national security, and is not making a threat against any other country. The fact that other nations have Ministers for ""War, while we have a Minister for Defence, indicates perhaps better than anything else the traditional attitude of the Commonwealth Government to this matter. The honourable member for East Sydney also suggosted that this Government would not hesitate to employ arms against the citizens of this country in the event of civil disturbance. To that suggestion, I reply that Australia, during recent years, has passed through the worse financial and economic crisis in its history, during which our citizens have had to make sacrifices of unprecedented severity, but never once has there been any suggestion of civil discord, and under a democratic system of government such as we possess i i is extremely improbable that at any monwealth will be called upon to quell civil disturbances. Thanks to the policy of tbe present Government, prosperity is now returning to ths country, and the people appreciate the part the Government has played in bringing about these improved conditions. congratulating the Government and the Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkhill) on the present defence polioy, and upon the decision to construat war vessels in Australia, as this will have the dual effect of strengthening the defences of the country, and of providing employment for our people. The world is in a very disturbed condition at the present time, and it behoves us to see that our defences are secure. Our country is thinly populated, a fact which may invite aggression from a foreign power, and we must be prepared to defend ourselves. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) mentioned the possibility of civil disturbances which the military authorities might be called upon to supwill ever occur. Like the honorabl* member for Fawkner( Mr Holt), I believe that the common sense of our people would prevail even in times of stress, and that a situation will never exist when it will be necessary to employ military force to preserve order. I am confident that, if the security of our country were ever threatened by a foreign aggressor, every man capable of bearing arms, whether he were employed or unemployed, would spring to its defence. We should then learn that the people of Australia are imbued with ths same spirit which inspired the poet when he wrote these impressive linesBreathes there a man, with soul so dead, ""Who never to himself hath said, This in my own, my native land? I was pleased to learn that the Government proposes to encourage the manufacture of aeroplanes in Australia.

We have already demonstrated that we are an air-minded people, and our airmen have won fame throughout the world for their feats of skill and daring. Strong aerial defence units should be established at strategical points, so that the ships of an invader might be met 500 miles out at sea, and stopped before they are able to land soldiers on our shores. When I was in Darwin last year, I observed that large oil tanks, each designed to hold 8,000 tons of oil, had been constructed on the coast right at the point where the old ship Warrego lies stranded on the beach. I drew the attention of the authorities at the time to the fact that this vessel constituted a prominent land-mark to direct a raiding warship or aeroplane to the location of the tanks, and I suggested that it should be dismantled. Of course, it may be argued that an enemy would know where the tanks wore in any case, but they would be doubly sure to nnd them when they were directed to the very spot by this old vessel lying conspicuously on the sand. It should be broken up, and removed without delay. [9.30] I feel that one criticism voiced by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr to the rest of the world Great Britain Curtin), that we are proceeding to vote the expenditure of large sums of money for the construction of defence works before the actual Defence Estimates and the defence policy have been accepted hy the Parliament, was quite justified. However, I do not suggest that we should divert from that policy now, but I desire to make a few observations in connection with some other remarks passed this evening on the subject of the defence of the Commonwealth. It has been suggested that the Commonwealth Government ' should construct vessels for the Australian Navy at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. In my opinion, the naval situation which this country has to face has been rudely altered during the last twelve months as the result of certain action by a one time friendly power in both the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. We have to consider, not only the developments which have taken place in the Pacific since the close of the last war, but also the which certain forces oan be concentrated, fortifications which are being constructed both in the Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea, and which vitally affect our lines of communication and commerce with Europe; that is, provided that we desire to use the shortest and quickest route, which is through the Suez Canal. The matter of the construction locally of vessels for the Australian Navy does not weigh very greatly with me. If we regard this matter impartially we must realize that by no stretch of the imagination can the Commonwealth ever attempt to secure its defences by naval forces alone. When the Henderson report was issued in 1913, it recommended that the basis of the Australian fleet should consist of eight ships of the first Australia class, carrying eight 12-in. guns. At that time, when the Imperial Navy was the strongest naval force that the world had ever seen, and after taking into consideration the European and the Fair Eastern situations, it was considered that Australia required a fleet consisting of eight huge ships. I do not think that any honourable member is prepared to suggest that we could supply one-quarter of that strength to-day, and yet the international position has been vitally altered as a result of the attitude adopted by Great Britain since the close of the last war. In an endeavour to set an example voluntarily relinquished her position of the world's greatest naval power to one of equality with the United States of America, and of little more than parity with another nation which had ranked fifth or sixth on the list of world naval powers only a few years before. parity now. With this particular power absolutely paramount in its own waters, the Commonwealth of Australia, whether it likes it or not, must pay a certain amount of attention to its naval arm of defence. The position of the Singapore Naval Base was mentioned by honourable members in relation to the defence of Australia. In my opinion, it is time that honourable gentlemen realized that the most effective base in the world is not a form of defence unless it is a base at",54,Cameron Coastal Provoked Into Replying By The Remarks Of

For that reason the only time that Singaoore becomes of any value to the Commonwealth in a period of danger is when it ia occupied by an effective British fleet, to which we must be expected to contribute some strength. I cannot accept the statement that Australian warships should not be sent into a danger zone. Warships were built for that purpose, and for no other, and as soon as there is a danger zone in any part of the world the Commonwealth, as one unit of the British Empire, must be expected to share its responsibility. The fact should not be overlooked that the Commonwealth is a member of an empire whose naval forces, under international agreements which are operating to-day, are considered to be one unit. They are not regarded separately as a British force or an Australian force. In those circumstances, the proper place for any Australian warships which can be spared from their station in these waters is not inside the Sydney Heads, but in the danger zone, sharing the responsibility with other warships of the British Empire. If aircraft can be manufactured in Australia, it will be of advantage to this country, but I admit that I am one of the minoritv who believes that in the next war aircraft will not do the immense damage envisaged by some honourable members of this Parliament. the results of target practice of fast flying aircraft compels one to realize the force of my contentions. On an average, they are unable to achieve little more than 1 per cent, of hits. They may be able to cause immense damage in a sprawling city such as Sydney, and they may even miss the Paddington Barracks and bomb the residence of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) ; but I would not guarantee that. When honourable gentlemen refer to despatching out to sea in order to bomb invading warships, I feel a desire to beg them to study statistics relating to the operations of British forces, which are available in the Library for their perusal. In those publications it is shown that aircraft attacking warships have never achieved more than 2.25 per cent, of hits on trial, Mr Archie Ganieron. and the percentage of casualties under such conditions would not be extremely great. In attacking land forces, aircraft would experience even greater difficulties in inflicting damage. We must recognize that aircraft are an offensive, not a defensive weapon. If we are to seek a definition of a defensive weapon, I know of only one which will suit the situation: that is, that any weapon is an offensive one to the man in front of it, and a defensive one to the man behind it. Whatever side of the barbed wire we may be on, the force of that definition must be conceded. One of the first principles which are taught in the present defence system of Australia is that aircraft are primarily a weapon of offence, not of defence. Under modern conditions aircraft are very necessary for obtaining information, but their capacity to wipe out ships and land forces is severely limited, as I believe the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) will be only too ready to admit. both of offence and defence. honourable member for Bendigo( Mr E. F. Harrison) referred to the necessity for providing social activities for the Citizen Defence Forces, and for spending money to enable those to function. I frankly do not approve of that advocacy. My attitude is that there is altogether too A study of much of the social element creeping into our defence system, and that its real purpose is continually being lost sight of. Under present conditions it is necessary to try to induce men to do what ought to be their duty by law; they should not have to be coaxed into entering the defence forces by offers of amusement. Social activities are necessary in formations which are on active service, or which are in garrison in certain parts of the world, but they should not be necessary in the Citizen Military Forces, as aircraft 500 miles constituted in Australia to-day. The volunteers are obliged to do six days' training in camp every year, and six days in half-day parades. I do not agree with the suggestion that public money should be spent in giving them social entertainment; it is not my view of what the defence system of Australia should provide. The Citizen Forces have certain",55,Cameron Coastal Provoked Into Replying By The Remarks Of

Great War was not won on the playing fields of Eton; it was won in the mud. The adage quoted by tbe honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr John Lawson) might have been applicable to 1815, but I assure the honourable gentleman that conditions of warfare were entirely different in 1915, and the next great struggle seaplanes will be a deciding factor. It may also be somewhat different from the last. It is recognized that a certain amount of money must be expended on fixed defences, but I deprecate remarks to the effect that such defences might be used against the civilian population. These statements emanated from a gentleman who evidently does not understand the position, or who has been actuated by a desire deliberately to misrepresent it. Otherwise I fail to see any other motive for his statements. am disappointed with the works policy of the Commonwealth Government in reference to naval depots and bases. Like the chain that is only as strong as its weakest link, the chain of defence of the British Empire cannot afford to neglect the strategical position of Tasmania as a naval base. Admiral Henderson has been quoted extensively in this chamber to-night by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin), and the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron), as an authority on naval defences, and I would like to hear the opinions of the Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkhill) in this connection. Doos the honourable gentleman consider that Admiral Henderson was an authority on this matter? If so, why has he not taken into consideration the recommendation of the Admiral to the Commonwealth that Hobart as a naval base was one of the most important strategical links in Australian deience? Some years ago the Commonwealth purchased an area of land in Tasmania with a view to proceeding with the construction of a naval base, but suddenly the plan was abandoned. I realize that the Minister for Defence is not a highly qualified militarist, and that he does not concern himself with the recommendations of men who have reported upon and been instrumental in laying down the foundations of the defence of the Commonwealth. He is parochial in his attitude, and he does not consider Tasmania as a unit in the defence of Australia. I point out to him that the lakes in Tasmania provide a suitable base for seaplanes which could operate in conjunction with the Navy. In the protection of the Victorian coast, does not suit the Government to expend large sums in other than the densely populated States, from which it obtains the greatest measure of its support. An eminent authority on the defence of Australia considers that, as the overseas air mail service is to be carried on by means of seaplanes, the establishment of a depot in the Lakes country of Tasmania would provide a landing place at which such aircraft could refill and take off should Australia find itself in the throes of war. I want Australia to be defended from within its borders, not on foreign soil, as was the case in the last war. which resulted in 60,000 of our best manhood being killed, and about 200,000 wounded, more or less severely. The suggestion was made last year that one of the best means of defence was from the air. Although the Minister for Defence pooh-poohed that idea previously, and declared that Australia's first line of defence was the British Navy, he is accepting it to-day as part of the defence policy of the Commonwealth. What has caused him to change his view? The present proposals are based upon the recommendations of high British military authorities, who came to Australia to report on the defences of this country.

There are in the ranks of the Labour party as big-hearted Australians who are prepared to defend this country, as are to be found in the ranks of Government supporters. I hope that consideration will be given to the proposals that I have submitted to-night, not by reason of my own knowledge of the matter, but on tbe recommendation of high military authorities. I am well aware of the race in armament construction which is taking place throughout the world, and realize that Australia must be prepared to make adequate provision for its own defence; but I repeat that it should be defended from within, and not on foreign soil. Consideration should be given to the fortification of strategical points which to-day are unfortified. If heed is not paid to what I am now suggesting, time will prove that the points which I have raised are of vital importance to the defence of Austhe function of flotilla leader in our tralia. Honourable members should be sufficiently broad minded to deal with this matter on a natioual basis, and to advocate the putting in hand of defence works wherever they are needed, whether it be in the northern part of Australia or in the southern part of Tasmania. I should like the Minister to state the reason for not undertaking works in the southern part of Tasmania, while large sums are being expended at points which strategically are not necessary for the defence of this country.

Obviously, such raids would attention to the promotion of a olass have to be made by seacraft, and because of skilled artisans. It is absolutely useof this I agree with those honourable, less to concentrate on the fighting units members who say that the construction if we neglect the skilled artisans who are of additional vessels for the Australian responsible for the manufacture of armaNavy is necessary. I commend the Minisments, the building of ships, and the ter for his far-sightedness in that regard. repair of vessels which have suffered I suggest, however, that construction They have damage in an engagement. Our experience in regard to the building of cruisers under government control has been rather a bitter one, but under private enterprise Cockatoo Island Dockyard has proved itself capable of the construction of vessels on an economic basis. Quite recently it produced a sloop, and I understand that it is now proposed to proceed a step further. The Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkhill) has assured us that the intention is ultimately to build a destroyer. I hope that that destroyer will ibe a worthy example of the craftsmanship of those who are employed at the dockyard. It is the considered opinion of those who are expert in naval matters that we have not one destroyer which is worthy to rank as a flotilla loader. Therefore, when plans are prepared for the construetion of another destroyer, the Minister should ensure that it will be capable of fulfilling squadron. I consider that skilled artisans are as necessary to defence as are the fighting units. I therefore commend to the Minister the remarks of the honourable member for West Sydney. I am confident that the honourable gentleman will receive universal support in the implementing of plans which are necessary for the maintenance of Australia's safety. I applaud him for the steps whioh he has taken in relation to the manufacture of aircraft. That is a very necessary step, and no doubt will be instrumental in forging one more link should not be confined to one destroyer, but that Ave should have a long-range policy embracing the formation of a uavy that will be sufficiently strong to protect us in times of emergency. It is essential also that the strength of our naval ratings should be materially increased. I refer the Minister to certain figures which he supplied recently. It is well known that a lengthy period of training is required to make a naval rating efficient. Therefore, the maximum number of recruits should be made available, and I was amazed to find from the figures supplied by the Minister that the number of naval ratings had increased to only 4,290. I understood that the existing ratings numbered something like 4,500. _ The failure of the Minister to recognize the need for additional recruits has resulted in some of the destroyers which were loaned to Australia by the British Navy, being tied up in Sydney Harbour, because of the failure of the Government to provide the necessary means to man them. I suggest that one of these vessels should be placed at the disposal of the recruiting depot at Rushcutters Bay, for the instruction of naval ratings in sea-going technique. If that were done, the vessel would be in regular sea-going order, and thus would be available if required for any purpose at any time, and it would result in greater effiartisans as a unit of the Defence Force. ciency in the volunteer arm of the service. Will the Minister consider the wisdom of The provision of bases, and the necessary facilities for refueling, are matters to which the Minister is giving attention, I have heard with great concern that the oil tanks at Darwin are particularly vulnerable. given to their protection by camouflage or other means. We have certain armament at Darwin that is not worth a row of beans, as a means of protection against modern warships or aerial attacks.

At Chowder Bay, there is an engineering depot, which I visited in company with an Assistant Minister some three years ago. I was surprised to find that the lineshafting used to drive the machinery wa3 of the most primitive kind, and would not be tolerated for one moment in a modern factory. It consisted of shafting erected on broken timbers . held together by ordinary bolts. With the ingenuity of the average Australian, the engineer in charge of the depot had done his best to surmount this difficulty. I asked why he could not have that particular drive made more secure, and he replied that, although he had asked for the necessary funds, the money had been refused. I recently inquired if the necessary money had been made available for the provision of suitable shafting to enable important work to be done reasonably well, but I was informed that no such action had been taken. I suggest that provision should be made on the Estimates to enable this workshop to be brought up to date.

182,Mr Garden (Cook) [10.5],"On ethe defence programme was under consideration, the Government announced that it proposed to obtain defence equipment overseas. But we now have complete reversal of that policy, because it is found that our present means of offence and defence are obsolete. The honourable member for Barker( Mr of aeroplanes and other modern methods Archie Cameron) spoke of the Singapore Naval Base. After an expenditure of £100,000,000 in an attempt to make Singapore the greatest naval base in the world, Great Britain finds that in five years it will become obsolete. If Japan gained control of China, all the vessels sheltering at Singapore could be destroyed in a day. Last year, supporters of the Government voted in favour of providing means by which human life could be destroyed, but refused to help us to assist the unemployed and their families. tive? Would the honourable member do nothing ? always give my vote to help in the saving of life. Great Britain has changed its defence policy. Within a year it has taken control of the aeroplane factories in the Old Country, which shows that the honourable member for Barker resembles the military authorities exposed by Lloyd George as men in his memoirs who were "" antiquated in their ideas and would not learn by experience."" changed its policy overnight, and why has the Commonwealth Government abandoned its policy of last year? It is because instructions have been received from England that aeroplane factories must be established in Australia. The Minister for Defence would have us believe that certain public spirited manuincreased from 2,000 to 8,000 miles. facturers in Australia have come to the aid of this country by undertaking to produce aircraft here. If the full facts were known, it would probably be found that the work is to be undertaken with the aid of capital from overseas. In Russia, only a fortnight ago, a demonstration was made in the presence of a British military authority, who said that it was the most remarkable exhibition he had ever seen, no fewer than 1,250 soldiers having been transported a considerable distance by aircraft and landed by parachutes in a short space of time. This shows that, under modern conditions of warfare, capital ships will be replaced by aircraft. It was stated that the capture of Abyssinia would occupy four or five years, but Italy conquered that country in four or five months, with the aid of warfare. I agree with the honourable member for Hume( Mr Collins), who was laughed at when he said that the construction of air mail carriers would be of more value than the building of cruisers for the defence of Australia. Australian cruisers have been used in the past for the defence of other countries. They were recently sent to the Mediterranean, not to defend Australia, but to harass Italy in its fight with Abyssinia. Capital ships involve us in foreign wars. The policy of the alternaLabour party is that not a man, not a ship, ana not a gun should be supplied by Australia to be used in any capitalist war beyond our own borders. policy.

Incidentally I congratulate the Minister for Defence on the modern methods he has adopted to obtain recruits for the forces. TheseI shall mention later. It is deplorable, though, that men should have been arrested for distributing handbills containing such statements as "" Although we went to the Front we ask young men to think what they are doing before they join the colours"".

Our bellies are empty, so we will enlist"". ft was a wonderful result to achieve with a roast joint! ringah-Minister for Defence) [10.21]. I wish to supply some information as briefly as I can in reply to the requests of certain honourable members. First, let me say that I take no exception to the view expressed by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) regarding the nature of this discussion. I 'would myself prefer to have the general Estimates discussed first so that matters of policy could be submitted to honourable members; but it has always been -the practice in this Parliament to consider the Works Estimates before the general Estimates. This procedure, however, has not prevented some honourable members from discussing matters of policy, for a number of speeches that we have listened to have been notable for an entire absence of reference to any item in the works programme. I assure the Leader of the Opposition that special consideration is being given to the defence requirements at Fremantle and Darwin. The honourable gentleman also made reference to the necessity for a dock. I clearly recollect the submissions made by a deputation that waited on me in Western Australia on this subject. Full consideration is being given to the representations that were then made. The honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr John Lawson) spoke of the need for additional playing fields at the Richmond aerodrome. His request has been noted and will be considered in due course. The honourable gentleman also asked for information about the works proposed to be put in hand at the Lithgow Small Arms Factory. The amount of £6,21S provided in the Works Estimates is for additional machine tools for machine gun manufacture. This amount is in addition to certain sums that are being provided for excavations for foundations for additions to the small arms factory. It is intended to introduce to Australia very shortly a new weapon known as the Brenn gun, to take the place of the Lewis gun. An officer of the department is at present in Great Britain obtaining information about the manufacture of the Brenn gun and I expect that this work will be put in hand at Lithgow very shortly and will provide a considerable amount of employment there.",60,Cameron Coastal Provoked Into Replying By The Remarks Of

A further sum of £59,875 is provided in division 63 of the general Estimates for work of this character, and an additional £50,000 will be earmarked for the improvement of the Militia. Part of this sum will be used to improve existing drill halls and to remove others to more suitable sites.

[10.27] -The proposed provision for Leichhardt, Sydney. As far back as 1934, modern hospital accommodation for the representations were made to the Gotreatment of disabled soldiers, and of vernment by representatives of the Hosthose suffering from tuberculosis who, as service pensioners, are now treated ia repatriation hospitals, is a very pleasing feature of the Government's works programme. All honourable members are aware of the excellent manner in which these institutions, under the control of the Repatriation Commission, are administered, and of the high standard of medical and nursing attention given to patients. The professional and orderly staffs of these institutions are composed, almost without exception, of men and acute suffering and indescribable conditions of warfare -has convinced them in no other way possible of the necessity for patience and sympathy in attending to those committed to their care. It is obvious, however, that if the maximum benefit from such treatment is to be derived by the patients, modern buildings must be erected to replace those structures which They were hurriedly erected as hospitals some years ago. I presume that the amount of £123,000 shown in this item is to be expended either in renovating existing repatriation hospitals in the various capital cities and other centres, or in enlarging these buildings, because of the increase of the number of patients which the department is now called upon to care for as the result of legislation recently introduced by this Government. It is a sad fact that the number of men who require accommodation in these hospitals has increased from 6,000, in 1926, to 22,000 at the present time. It is obvious that something must be done, and, apparently, something will be done, to improve and extend existing accommodation. I shall be glad if the Minister will explain how it is intended to expend this amount of £123,000. w endorse the remarks made by the honourable member for Lilley( Sir Donald Cameron) regarding the necessity for improved accommodatoin for patients treated by the Repatriation Department. I have in mind particularly the care of mentally afflicted soldiers who are housed",61,Cameron Coastal Provoked Into Replying By The Remarks Of

194,Mr Rosevear (Dalley) [10.31],"Ipitals and Asylums Employees Union and the Leichhardt branch of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League, with a view to securing an extenlion of the accommodation already provided by the department for mentally afflicted patients. About £25,000 was spent in the erection of cottage hospitals, and, at this juncture, I might add, that I do not think there is any finer institution of a similar kind in Australia than that at Leichhardt. Whilst the department at that time, however, segregated these men from ail other cases of mental affliction, it did not make a complete job of that work, because it failed to provide these patients with adequate facilities for recreation outside the ward and with proper cooking arrangements. The cottages are situated approximately half a mile from the main asylum at Oallan Park; food for over 250 patients has to be carried half a mile, whilst the 50 members of the staff have to travel that distance to and from the kitchen for their meals. It would appear that an arrangement has been made between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of New South Wales that when the last of these patients has been treated, the State Government should take over these wards as part of its mental institutions, the Commonwealth, apparently, believing that the time would not be far off when there would be no patients to treat at this hospital. This appears to be the reason for its failure to provide accommodation of a more permanent nature at this institution, but, unfortunately, the number of men requiring to be treated is not getting less, but is increasing. In many cases, men who were mentally stable immediately after serving in the war are now beginning to feel the effects of their war service. Consequently, the Commonwealth Government should give every consideration to finishing its job at this hospital by providing accommodation of a more permanent nature than exists at present. As a matter of fact, I understand that the Repatriation Department permits ex-soldiers who aro not recognised as repatriation cases to go into this institution for treatment. In the present division of control lies the source of muoh complaint. The Commonwealth Government owns the buildings, but the State provides the attendants, and the Commonwealth is charged a certain amount a head for its patients. The attendants are also returned soliders, and they are compelled under the State regulations to pay for their meals at the old Callan Park hospital, whether they have them there or not. Single attendants have £21 a year deducted from their wages for their meals, and £18 is deducted from the wages of married men. Some time ago, a deputation waited on the Minister in regard to these matters, and the Minister agreed to enlarge the recreation room for patients and attendants. This has since been done, and we now ask that the institution be made complete by the addition of proper cooking facilities. The cost would not be great, and the addition the whole of the is necessary. The Commonwealth seems to be buoyed up with the hope that it will shortly be able to hand over the whole institution to the State authorities; but I do not thiuk that it will be able to do so for a long time. When the deputation waited on the Minister, he stated .that, although he did not feel disposed at that time to arrange for the construction of a kitchen, he thought that some conveyance should be provided to take attendants to the place where they obtained their meals. No such conveyance has yet been provided. I earnestly request the Minister to give favorable consideration to the matters I have raised. I should like to know whether, of this sum of £123,000 appearing in the Estimates, any part is to be devoted to the making of additions to the Caulfield Military Hospital. Recently, I had occasion to visit the hospital frequently, and complaints were made to me that no suitable accommodation was available for convalescent soldiers. It is true that tha Red Cross Society has built rest-rooms, but I am told that they are frequently overcrowded, and that the noisy conditions which in consequence prevail are harmful to convalescents. I admit that seats have been placed in the wards, and in the grounds, but seats in the wards are not always suitable, while those in ths grounds are of little use in bad weather.",62,Department Of Repatriation

Debate resumed from tbe 16th September (vide page 170) on motion by Mr said that the reduction would not operate That the bill be now read a second time. By way of preface, I inform tbe House that if this bill is not passed in time to permit of its provisions being given statutory effect by next Thursday, the sum of approximately £30,000 will remain in Consolidated Revenue instead of being distributed amongst old-age pensioners. At different stages of to-day^s proceedings I felt that there was grave danger of pensioners being deprived of that £30,000, by reason of the fact that it would not be possible for the requisite changes of the law to be made in time to allow of their receiving it. I desire to place on record my deep regret at the fact that this bill does not make provision for the raising of the old age pension to £1 a week. I point out that when pensions were first reduced five years ago, a condition of grave financial emergency was distressing Australia. Steps were then taken to deal with the budgetary position of this Government, and of all other Australian governments. The effect of the legislation then passed was to reduce war pensions by £1,300,000, the salaries of public servants by approximately £1,800,000, the maternity allowance by £230,000, and invalid and old-age pensions by approximately £1,825,000. ter, speaking on that occasion, saidThis is merely an emergency measure. Not ODe member on my side of the chamber supports the reduction of wages and pensions, and so far as we are concerned the reduction will not operate any longer than is necessary for the restoration of financial stability. Since 1932, this Government has continuously claimed that there has been considerable improvement of the position, and has said that, in substantial measure, that improvement is attributable to the wisdom of its policy. I definitely make the charge that during that five years there has been in each budget a systematic under-statement of the revenue expected. I further say that in each of those budgetary statements there has been the realization of surpluses much in excess of the estimate. Although in 1931 there was the drastic cut of £1,825,000 in pensions, and the present Prime Minister longer than was necessary for the restoration offinancialstability, and despite the fact that the plan adopted involved certain definite proposals for the reduction of the interest burden on governments, in the following year the right honourable gentleman further reduced the maternity allowance by £60,000, public service salaries by £240,000, and pensions by £1,100,000. This second instalment of cuts was not accompanied by any additional cut in the interest payable upon Australian Consolidated stock. The Premiers plan was envisaged on the basis of general equity, interest rates as well as pensions were to be reduced by a given amount. Yet in 1932, although there were not further reductions of interest rates, there was a further contraction of the payments to pensioners and others, and beyond that the Government also decided that the pension paid in 1932-33 should be a first charge against the estates of pensioners at their death. On the 16th September, 1932, the Government announced that it had decided that, where a pensioner had no income other than a pension, and was entirely dependent on it, the rate of 17s. 6d. should stand. That was a modicum of relief from the second cut imposed upon pensioners. But the Government also decided at that time that The present Prime Ministhe relatives of a pensioner-the wife, husband, father, mother, or child over 21 years of age-coul d be compelled to contribute towards his or her maintenance. That was immediately after it had come into power, and at a time when it had commenced to initiate a series of substantial tax remissions. Dealing with the matter in broad perspective, I point out that since the period of financial emergency the surpluses of this Government have aggregated £10,442,000. Yet it professes to believe that .the existing financial position does not justify the restoration of the old-age pension to £1 a week. Let me show what has been done by way of tax relief. Indirect taxes have been reduced by £9,730,000 between 1932-33 and 1936-37. Direct taxes have been reduced by £5,905,000 in the same",64,Supplybill N O 2 1936 37
204,Mr Curtin (Fremantle) [10.56],"period. 1932-33 to 1936-37, the value of remissions in respect of land tax, property tax, company tax, tax on life assurance companies and shipping companies, is approximately £17,000,000, whereas the cost of the restorations which the Government has made in its various services, including pensions, can be stated at £3,492,000. I bring those figures together. I say that the Government has had a series of surpluses aggregating over £10,000,000, it has reduced indirect taxation by £9,730,000, and direct taxation by nearly £6,000,000, yet .the total of its restorations to those who are adversely affected by its expenditureold-age pensioners, claimants for the maternity allowance, and the like-is less than £3,500,000. Let me state the matter in another way. In 1931*32 the taxes collected totalled £52,000,000. In 1935-36 the total was £63,000,000, an increase of £11,000,000. Yet the annual liability for old-age pensions on the last day of the financial year 1931 was £12,000j000, of which only £11,750,000 was actually paid. In 1936 the annual liability for old-age pensions in operation on the last day of the financial year was £13,000,000. In 1931-32 the Government collected £52,000,000 in taxes, and paid out £11,750,000 in invalid and old-age pensions. It is now collecting £63,000,000 in taxes, an increase of £11,000,000, and its expenditure on pensions has increased by £1,250,000. Notwithstanding the increase of revenue, pensioners are the last section of those who suffered under the financial emergency legislation to receive full restoration of their original rights. When I refer to the last section I do not disregard the fact that soldiers' pensions have not yet been fully restored. Under this legislation public servants' salaries are completely restored, but a cut is still imposed upon the salaries of Ministers and in the allowances of honourable members. Will any one say that the present budget makes it impossible for the Treasurer to find the added £760,000 required to bring the pension up to 20s. a week? The cost of increasing pensions from 18s. to 19s. a week is estimated at £760,000, and I think that I am right in saying that an increase from 19s. to £1 a week would cost an additional ifr. Curtin. It is estimated that from £760,000. Rather than provide that amount the Government proposes to set aside £1,100,000 to reduce the accumulated deficit. The House would be justified in saying that, although the Government has had surpluses aggregating £10,000,000, the Treasurer has never previously been seriously perturbed at the size of the accumulated deficit. Hitherto only trifling contributions have been made towards a reduction of that deficit, and with the exception of the £1,100,000, whioh it is now proposed to set aside, it will remain as it has been for some years. As honourable members are aware the accumulated deficit is made up of the deficits of the Bruce-Page Government, which was responsible for from £5,500,000 to £5,750,000,. and those incurred by the Scullin Government during two years of grievous financial difficulty. After only six months of oflice the first Lyons Government had a surplus because of the budgetary provisions of its predecessor. The present budget discloses that taxation reductions approximate £5,275,000. Income taxation is to be reduced by £2,105,000. If the £2,105,000 to be remitted to income taxpayers were reduced by £760,000, the Government could pay invalid and old-age pensioners 20s. a week without impairing in any way the general character of the budget. But there is another way to do it. Naturally, the credit of the country remains practically the Bams whether the accumulated deficit iB £16,000,000 or. £17,000,000, but instead of using that £1,100,000 in the direction proposed, it should be used to restore completely invalid and old-age pensions, and to restore allowances to the dependents of returned soldiers. The Government proposes to remove entirely the special property tax imposed owing to the financial emergencies existing in 1931. The last vestige of that tax and of the public servants cuts is being removed under the budget. The members of the Opposition will not oppose the abolition of the special property tax, because we realize that it was imposed to aid the revenue of the country at a time of great difficulty. In a total remission of £15,600,000 of taxes the additional expenditure of £760,000 for old-age pensions would not affect the Treasurer's competence to deal w i th the problems and is more humane than a reduction of the difficulties of industrial and economic accumulated deficit. In 1932, after the organization, or with any other of the Premiers plan had been adopted, further subjects specified in the budget. In the concessions were demanded from the penmain, pensioners are compelled to spend sioners, and instead of being left until the whole of their allowance in maintainthe last to be placed in the position they ing themselves from day to day.

205,Sir Archdale Parkhill (War,"by honourable members opposite that financial stability does not exist, the Government has now come to the conclusion that the position of the finances of this country is such that the benefits contemplated in this bill should be conferred on the people without delay. Immediately the Government decided that the finances of the country were again upon a stable basis, it decided to honour the promise made by the Prime Minister, which he has kept in mind throughout, the dark days of depression, that he would return to the old-age pensioners one-half of the cut of 2s. a week made by the Scullin Government. I think it is reasonable to point out that the old-age pensioners will be placed in this better position because the Lyons Government is in power and has been in power during the last four and one-half years. If there had been a Labour government in power, old-age pensioners would have received no increase of their pensions, because the finances of the country would not have permitted it. The thanks of the old-age pensioners will be extended to the Lyons Government for its successful management of the finances of this country. would have received complete restoration in 1932 had the Scullin Government remained in office. Sir AECHDAL E PARKHILL -The Scullin Government was instrumental in reducing the pensions by 2s. 6d. a week, although, clearly and logically, it had no obtain a good deal of credit by agreeing alternative, having regard to the circumstances which existed at the time. has reduced the total pension payments by £1,000,000 a year. pensioners know that under the administration of the present Government they are better cared for than if any other government were in power. Further, the benefit which the pensioners are to receive will not be confined merely to the feeling sure that the Prime Minister's restoration of Is. a week in the pension rate. The reduction of the cost of living which has taken place during the last few years has enhanced the purchasing power of the pension with the result that the 19s. weekly which the pensioners will receive will buy more than any amount which they received at any time. After all, the amount of money which a pensioner receives each week is not so important as what that money will buy. In addition, the proposed reduction of sales tax amounting to between £5,000,000 and £6,000,000 per annum will reduce the cost of commodities which the pensioners will require. The benefit of the sales tax reductions will be felt by not only the old-age pensioners, but also every other section of the community. I know the reasons which prompt the Opposition to assist in carrying this legislation, and I pay honourable members opposite tribute for them. If the hour were not so late, 1 should advance arguments to place in bolder relief the benefits which this measure bestows. The Opposition can take little credit for the contents of the bill, because it originates from the ministerial side of the House. Those who will receive an increase of the invalid and old-age pension, a full restoration of public service salaries and of the payments provided for the children of ex-soldiers, and the benefits conferred in connection with the maternity allowance have all to thank the Lyons Government. All that the Opposition can do to snatch a little credit for itself is to pass this measure as quickly as possible, so that the pensioners and others may receive the increases next pay day. to the amendment. content with the credit which the invalid and old-age pensioners will give to this Government for carrying out the promise made by the Prime Minister. If the Lyons Ministry remains in office for a brief period longer, and this bill becomes law, the pensioners will receive an amount which they could not have obtained from any other government.

[11.56] -The position is that any person who applied for a pension and received it before entering an institution receives 5s -in future the amount will be 5s. 6d and the institution gets the balance.

This line of demarcation was drawn in the very early stages of the pension scheme, and it has since been maintained. I remind honourable members that pensioners in institutions, whether they were granted pensions before or after they entered such institutions, are getting their full maintenance, and, in addition, have been getting this amount of 5s., which will be increased to 5s. 6d., and with this amount may do what they please. certainly is not large, but I emphasize that the Commonwealth Government has an obligation, not only to the pensioner, but also to the institutions concerned. been recognized, and we must play as fairly as possible between the pensioner, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the people controlling these institutions. I do not know what the average cost of a pensioner in an institution is, but I should be very much surprised if it is as low as 13s. 6d. a week, that is, the amount which the Commonwealth Go(Corio-Treasurer ) vernment hands over to the institution on behalf of the pensioner. Bearing in mind the fact that the pensioner receives full maintenance plus this amount of 5s. 6d., it is not unfair that the institutions should get an extra 6d.

I would not have risen to speak on this matter had the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) not said that pensioners would receive this amount of 5s. 6d. to do with it what they choose. Every one knows that inmates of these particular institutions are not visited by relatives, who may bring them tobacco and fruit and other articles, as are inmates of other institutions. At most of these institutions a buffet is provided by an auxiliary staff, from which pensioners can purchase such articles. If the Treasurer is not prepared to accept the suggestion made by the honourable member for Beid, I intend to move an amendment with a view to increasing the amount of 5s. to 6s.

232,The Chairman ( Mr Prowse),"A.m.] -The purpose of paragraph b of sub-clause 1 of this clause is to determine the maximum limit of income plus pension. When amended the table in the principal act will show the lowest rate of pension at 18s. a week instead of 17s. 6d. as formerly. £79 6s. shown in paragraph b of subclause 1 of this clause represents the total limit of income plus pension at a rate of 18s. a week, and in order to get the total limit of income plus pension at the proposed rate of 19s. a week, an amount of Is. a week has to be added to this amount. This calculation is dealt with in sub-clause 3:The provisions of sub-section ( IB ) of sec[12.10 a.m.] -During my second-reading tion 24 of the principal act shall apply in respect of any increase or decrease in the maximum rate of pension effected in pursuance of tlie last preceding sub-section. The effect of this provision is that the proposed increase of Is. a week has to be added to the present rate of 18s., which will make the limit of income plus pension £81 18s., this result being obtained by multiplying the amount of 31s. 6d. by 52. This procedure may be somewhat complicated, but it fulfils the purpose of the bill. of the Treasurer with perfect confidence. -There is an idea in the minds of a great many persons that the rate of pension is based upon the cost of living, and now the Government proposes to vary this scale so that it may make a small increase of the pension. It must be recognized, however, that the pensions have at no time been based on the cost of living, because had they been pensioners would have received an amount sufficient to enable them to live in reasonable comfort, but that has never been the case. The Government would be more honest if it were to abolish this scale altogether, and leave the fixing of pension rates to Parliament, to which the responsibility properly belongs. I have no doubt that, before the next election, the Government will amend the scale again, so that it may be able to make a further small increase of the rate of pensions, and thus furnish itself with a useful election cry. This clause provides for the limitation of pensions, and it is provided that the pensions shall in no case exceed £1 a week. I do not think it is fair that the pensioners should be called upon to make sacrifices in all directions, and there The figure of should be no limit of £1 a week if the cost of living index figures justify the increase of the pension beyond that amount. At present the department will not recognize the index figure if it rises beyond 1,640, but I claim that no such limitation should be imposed. If the pensioners are to lose by a drop of the index figure, they should stand to gain when it rises. speech on this bill, I quoted the actual cost during the last quarter of all the essential items of food in the pensioners' regime, as compared with the average cost in 1929, when the pension was 20s. a week. An examination of these figures shows that, on that basis, the present pension of 19s. a week is equivalent in purchasing power to 23s. a week in 1929. some difficulty in convincing the pensioners of that. prices of such necessaries as bread, meat, butter, clothing, rent, &c, the 1929 equivalent of the present 19s. would be nearly 23s. 6d.

Clauses 24 to 33 (Relief in Respect of Primary Production). I notice that again wheat-growers are excluded from participation in the subsidy on artificial fertilizers. In previous years they were so excluded because other budgetary provision was made for their industry. When the Financial Emergency Act of 1932 was introduced the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) said that the Government had intended to provide for a subsidy on fertilizers to the amount of f l a ton, but following representations on behalf of the wheat industry, it had agreed to use portion of the money as a grant to enable State governments to give special assistance to wheat-growers in necessitous circumstances. That procedure has been followed from year to year. The amount provided for subsidy on fertilizers has been given exclusively to primary producers other than wheat growers, who received benefits or assistance of another character. This year the position of wheat-growers is comparable to that of producers in other branches of primary industry. a very much better position. [10 ] . that. The price level for wheat is nut better than the price level for fat lambs, or dairy products. for fat lambs is 49 per cent, over the rate ruling three years ago. The price level for wheat is over 100 per cent, higher. rose two years earlier, so the comparison is not now a fair one. price levels with prices obtaining three years ago is to indicate an entire lack of knowledge of the true position. for all forms of primary production, other than wheat, is not more than 20 per cent, or 25 per cent. year for the Minister's calculations f 1932-33, when the fertilizer bounty provisions were adopted. as a basis for calculation, prices ruling for primary production during any of the last five years. A comparison of present prices with those ruling in 1932 v for wool would give results entirely different from a comparison with prices ruling a year later, and I contend that present prices for wheat do not place the grower in a more advantageous position than producers of fat lambs, canned fruits, butter or other primary goods. Yet wheat-growers are excluded from benefits under this bill. This is the more unfair in view of the fact tliat the burden of unliquidated debt is pressing more heavily upon wheat-growers than upon other sections of primary industry. Furthermore, I remind the committee that about five vears ago tbe wheat industry alone was the subject of an appeal by the Commonwealth Government to increase production, on the definite understanding that growers would have .in assured price for their produce. They responded to the appeal, but it is history that the Government's undertaking was not honoured. with the Country party. justifiable assertion are in ment expected the smaller States to provide most of the money.",72,Pairs

256,Mr Archie Cameron,"The Governwas a catch provision which, by proposing to mate governments of the smaller States responsible for losses which might well have amounted to millions of pounds, forced the Senate to defeat it. The growers, at tbe request of the Government, immensely increased production, but, owing to the Government's failure to honour its promise of a guaranteed price, they lost millions of pounds. This year, when their position is comparable to that of other primary producers, they are excluded from any form of Government assistance, even of the trifling nature which they would receive in the form of a subsidy on superphosphate. ber intend to move an amendment? were permissible, but I am informed that an amendment could not be accepted. allow the matter to be dealt with separately later? give me an assurance that it will be dealt with later? the honourable member an assurance that it will be considered. I cannot say more than that without consulting Cabinet. the Government, having had its attention drawn to the matter, will give consideration to this discrimination against primary producers? ranct I shall not pursue the subject further. a.m.] I support the remarks of the honourable member ' for Echuca( Mr made prolific by the use of superphosMcEwen). Prices for all forms of primary production have taken a definite turn for the better, and I think that primary producers generally will be grateful to the Government for continuing the subsidy on fertilizers for another year. There was considerable doubt in many minds about the attitude of the Government. I entirely endorse all that the honourable member for Echuca has said about the discrimination against the wheat-growers in this bill. Tn former years the wheat industry, as well as most other forms of primary production, received direct assistance of a more substantial nature than this subsidy on fertilizers. The exceptions were wool-growers and fat-lamb producers, who received no assistance, apart from the preference which they enjoyed in the British market. Because of the assurance of the Minister that the Government will consider the matter, I do not propose to pursue it further at the present juncture. A large number of producers will be exceedingly grateful to the Government for having continued the subsidy this year. [12.26 a.m.] I am in complete accord with the honourable member for Echuca ber for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker). In my district, huge areas of scrub country, much of which is of a rather poor type, not are about to be opened up, and the use of superphosphate is absolutely necessary for its development. I should like the Government to consider the advisability of adopting what one might call a long range policy, covering a period of four I can give or five years,, so that those who take up this new land might have some security iu the development of it. I am not so much concerned in regard to the man whose country is developed. It is universally recognized that a limit must be placed on such concessions when prices reach a payable level. Increased population is desired, particularly in rural districts. Assistance of this nature is particularly helpful to those who undertake the development of new country. Hilly country, such as is to be found on Kangaroo Island, and the country which is^met with in what has been known as the ninety-mile desert, but is now being phate, would he greatly assisted, and the ultimate effect upon Commonwealth finances would be beneficial, if the Commonwealth were prepared to take a fairly long and broad view of the matter. The subject of the subsidy was raised by many persons in South Australia whom I met during the recess. To each of them. I said that if his calculations for next year were based on a figure approximating 10s., he would not be far out. The Government might also consider ths",73,Pairs

What was the reason for the change oveT from the Australian standard log measurement "" Hoppus"" to new tariff methods known as '' Brereton"" T 7. Docs the Government propose to make further investigations before pressing for the proposed new duty 7 orable member'3 qtiestions are as f o i -' lows: 1. No. 2. Under an ill-balanced import tariff on log as compared with that on sawn oregon, certain plant was erected to cut up oregon log. increased from 3.200.COO super, feet in 1931-32 to 100,500,000 super, feet in 1934-35. This growing import in the opinion of the Government constituted a menace to the Austral inn hardwood sawmilling industry. The existing tariff is designed to encourage the greatest amount of employment in cutting up of both log and sawn oregon and in thnbergettiag and sawmilling of Australian hardwoods. 3. No timber merchant was forced to make any investment for purchase of plant for cutting up oregon logs. The duties operating immediately before the 22nd May, 1930, had the effect of concentrating employment on cutting up of oregon timber in a limited number of importing premises, whereas previously cutting up of sf.wn oregon timber was performed in a large number of city, suburban and country sawmilling yards. 4. Yes, in respect of oregon logs imported from Canada a.. No. margin of approximately 6s. Od. a> super, feet still exists in favour of No. 1! Canadian sawn oregon of 12 x 6. 6. No change over from Hoppus to Brereton scale of measurement has been made for the logs, as prior to the imposition of specific duties under the latter scale Buch loga were subject to ad valorem duties. The Brereton scale ol measurement shows the exact or solid contents in super, feet of a log, and is mathematically correct, whereas the Hoppus log feet the amount of merchantable timber contained i u a log. The amount of timber that can be cut from a log of a given size is however not uniform because the factors which determine the amount of waste vary under different circumstances such as the thickness of the saw, the thickness of the boards, the width of the smallest board that may be utilized, the skill of the sawyer, the efficiency of the machinery, the defects in the log, the amount'of taper, and the shrinkage. If duty were to be charged on merchantable timber cut with from the log, customs officers would have to be placed in attendance at the plants. In determining the present duty under the Brereton scale due regard was given to the fact that under this scale no allowance is made for waste. If the Hoppus formula were adopted then to maintain the same relative position as exists at present between oregon log duty and sawn oregon duty the rate of duty under (he Hoppus formula would have to be higher. Oregon logs are invoiced from seller to Australian buyer in Brereton measurement. 7.
