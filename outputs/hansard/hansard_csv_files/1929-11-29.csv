37,Mr Lyons,"Yesterday the rightwas commenced it was anticipated that it would be completed by the 30th October, 1930. The officers of the Works Department have assured me that that is still the date upon which it is anticipated the work will be completed. The following papers were presented:Railways Act-Report on Commonwealth Railways Operations, for year ended SOth June, 1929. Seat of Government (Administration) Act -Fifth Annual Report of the Federal Capital Commission for year ended 30th June, 1929. Ordered to be printed. In Committee of Supply: (Consideration resumed from the 22nd November (vide page 213). Proposed vote-Â£33,000 . When the War Memorial at Canberra was previously the subject of the committee's consideration, it was stated that the sum of Â£20,000 had been placed in a trust fund in the previous year for carrying on the work. Therefore, if Â£30,000 in addition is now to be made available, there will be a total amount of Â£50,000 to be expended during the current financial year. We have been told, however, that it is not practicable to expend the whole of that sum in the current year. I suggest that if the Â£20,000 that was placed in a trust is available, it may be sufficient for the requirements of the coming year, and that, therefore, it is unnecessary to vote another Â£30,000 now. I ask the Minister for Home Affairs( Mr Government cannot expend Â£50,000 on Blakeley) whether it is a fact that there is Â£20,000 in a trust fund, definitely earmarked for this purpose, and, if so, whether he does not regard that sum as sufficient for expenditure on the memorial this year? If he considers that another Â£30,000 should be voted on the Estimates for this year, will he tell us whether it is proposed to add that Â£30,000 to the Â£20,000 now in the trust fund. can see that it is possible that if we pass this item a considerable portion of the money voted cannot be expended, on the voices. and, in that case, the trust fund would be built up unnecessarily. The money we vote for current expenditure should be expended in the year in which it is voted. I think that that was the intention of Parliament in connection with the previous year's vote. Will the Minister say whether the Â£20,000 that it is said was put into a trust fund is there in cash? ringah) [11.33] -When this debate was adjourned last FridayI asked you, Mr Chairman, if I could resume the discussion when the Estimates were next before us, and you informed me that I could. I should like to know, therefore, why you did not call me first this morning? In committee there is no adjournment of a debate, and no honourable member can be given the right to continue a speech on the resumption of a committee's consideranotices first the honourable member who has expressed his desire to continue the discussion which was going on when progress was reported. have risen to emphasize the points taken by the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin). I understood the Minister to say in an earlier speech that the Government intended to proceed with the construction of the War Memorial. It seems that it is not now intended to go on with it, although the Government has Â£20,000 in hand in a trust fund, in addition to some surplus under a vote already authorized. It appears to me that it is unnecessary to place the present item on the Estimates. Clearly, as remarked by the honourable member for Fremantle, the this work in the present financial year. I desire to know whether it intends to continue the present trust fund, and whether the money now available is not sufficient for the work for this year. In the brief time during which I have been in this House, we have twice discussed the matter of the memorial, and on two occasions, hy overwhelming majorities, it was I decided that the work should proceed.",14,Canberra Goulburn Road

42,Mr Gullett,"That was determined,That is so. It is due to the men who fought for this country that the work should be continued. There is an urgent need for the absorption of the workless in the country to-day, and the construction of the memorial would serve the dual purpose of carrying out the decision of Parliament and. also meeting the sentimental views of a very large section of the people. Further, it would have the effect of at least relieving in some degree the distress that is now prevalent through unemployment. understand that a considerable sum is now paid by the Government in rent for the housing of the valuable war relics and trophies that have been collected. Everything seems to point to the wisdom of continuing the work. There should be a clear statement by the Minister as to whether he has sufficient money in hand for this purpose to last uutil the end of the year without Parliament voting a further sum. I realize that the Government has not yet been in office for a sufficient period to enable it to propose a comprehensive scheme for the absorption of the unemployed, but, it should take steps in that direction, instead of denying that we have unemployed in Canberra and that retrenchments have occurred. If the Government frankly informs the House that it has uot had sufficient time to enable it to formulate its policy regardsum of Â£20,000 was placed in a trust ing unemployment, honourable members on this side will accept its assurance, so long as they know that a scheme is being developed. ' I doubtwhether a Federal Government can satisfactorily solve the problem of unemployment; but this Government has promised to do it, and I think that the counti-y expects some explanation from it as to the way in which it proposes to carry out its election promises. for Home Affairs) [11.40] -In reply to the question of the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin) whether the sum of Â£20,000, placed to a trust fund, is availwe decided to discontinue temporarily able, I may say that that amount has been set aside for the building of the War Memorial, but the money is not available; if it were spent, our cash reserves would be depleted to that extent. Honourable members are discussing what is purely a into a trust fund in gold or bank notes. when money is put into a trust fund, it is not put in. tually paid into a trust fund. The sum of Â£20,000 will be available for this work when our financial conditions improve, and it can only be used for the purpose for which it has been allocated. ting that amount into a trust fund ? member might well ask those of his colleagues who were members of the last Government. invest the Â£20,000 or did it propose to leave it idle, earning nothing? was merely credited to the trust fund. I suggest that the ex-Treasurer, the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) might be asked any further questions-on this matter. The Government accepts full responsibility for its action. that the trust fund is overdrawn, and thai this Â£20,000 is not in it. that the trust fund is overdrawn. I have tried to make it clear that although the fund last year, only a book-keeping entry was made, and no actual cash is now available. If this amount were spent, it would deplete our cash reserves accordingly. The Government is confronted with an extremely difficult position, and it has been decided temporarily to suspend operations in connection with the War Memorial. We had a comparatively short time to check over our Estimates and make investigations. We were confronted with the fact that we had to get the Estimates to the printer as quickly as possible, in order that Parliament might have them. It was not until after the Estimates had gone to the printer that the work of erecting the War Memorial. Unfortunately, it is impossible under present financial conditions to proceed with it at present.

He is speaking with little knowledge of this great work. National War Memorial is in its final stages of completion and the work has been proceeding for eleven years. late Government advanced the work steadily over that period, and there has been no unnecessary delay. previously been no cessation of this noble enterprise. The development of the War Memorial falls into two parts. There is first the collection which is to be housed in the memorial, and, secondly, the building itself. No useful purpose would be served in proceeding with the erection of this building at considerable expense unless we were close to the completion of the collection, but the position to-day is that the finest collection of its kind in the world is practically complete It will, we hope, be complete within the next year or two.

The Gofell overseas. vernment is now asked to take the final possess Avas contributed to by the soldiers step in completing the War Memorial. themselves while on service in France, Let me tell the committee briefly the origin and story of "" the memorial. Early in 1917 a few Australians on service in France turned over in their minds the idea of a future memorial to those who fell for us at the Avar, and out of their consultation came the proposal made to the GoA'ernment of that time that Australia's nationa] memorial that is one for which the Federal Parliament Avould be responsible-shoul d take the form of a great collection of historical Avar records, of trophies and souvenirs of all kinds; in other Avords, that Ave should put together a collection Avhich would tell, as no Avritten Avord could tell, the This story of the Avar and the sacrifices of those who served overseas. The proposal made to the Government of the day in 1917 Tbe was that there should be, first, this collection, and, secondly, at the national capital a memorial building in which to There has house it. This Avas approved by that GoAernment, subject, of course, to the r endorsement of the Parliament. The Avork of collecting Avas then begun in Franco, Palestine, and the other theatres of war in Avhich Australians were serving. A few years later the project Avas placed before the Parliament. This House agreed, certainly Avith an occasional dissenting voice, but Avithout a single diA>ision, to the form of the memorial and the successive steps to be taken towards its completion. The magnitude and range of the Avork that has been done on the memorial is shown by the fact that substantially more than Â£100,000 has been voted by the Parliament for the deAelopment of tlie collection. It is no r new beginning that we are asking for at present. We are asking the Government The to take the final steps to the completion of the undertaking by building a memorial in which to house the collection.

61,Mr Gullett,"It is all part of thePalestine, and otlier fields of warfare. It It does not represent idle curiosity. was got together largely in this way: Our troops oversea were promised a memorial in this form, and were invited to contribute to it souvenirs and trophies gathered by our soldiers individually and by the units with which they were serving. Out of that scheme grew a collection the like of which has never been in existence in the world before. The proposal was taken up with the greatest enthusiasm by the troops. Unit vied with unit in its contributions, with the result that we have an extraordinarily large and varied collection of intimate and personal souvenirs and trophies of the war. Thousands of men contributed souvenirs and trophies to the collection, and many of these men afterwards fell at the war. ""We have, therefore, an obligation of the most solemn and sacred kind. The collection was contributed to by the troops under a definite undertaking from the government of the day, afterwards repeatedly endorsed by the Parliament, that at the earliest practicable date this memorial would be built, and the collection which they themselves made would be housed in it . With regard to the suggestion of delay on the part of the last Government, made by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Home Affairs, I have already pointed out that there has been no delay; that the collection is not ready to-day, and would not be ready even if the memorial building were now complete. But it will be ready within a year, certainly within two years. It will be ready by the time the building is constructed if the work is now proceeded with. appeal strongly to the Government not to delay the construction of the memorial building. I would remind it not only of our sacred pledge to our troops, but also of the amazing sentiment that there is in Australia behind this project. The incomplete collection, which consists of pictures, models, and a thousand and one small personal souvenirs, telling of the service and life of the men overseas, has been on view in Melbourne and Sydney during the past two years, and no fewer than 2,300,000 Australian people have visited the exhibition. The interest taken in this collection, even in its incomplete stage, has been unparalleled. Mr Gullett. These people have viewed the collection in no militarist spirit. They have not visited it to revive the lust of battle or memories of the actual fighting. They have gone there in awe and reverence, to associate themselves again with the memories of those four or five years of service and sacrifice. The attendances at the exhibition have been made up almost entirely, not of detached people who have never been associated with the war, but of the diggers themselves with their wives, and children born before or since the war; with their fathers and mothers. I do not wish, and should be most loath, to make a party quarrel of this issue. This War Memorial project is something sacred, and I ask honourable members not to make a party question of it. I appeal to the Minister not to arrest this noble project. I recognize that the Government is in an embarrassing position because of the present financial stringency; but surely it should be possible to find at least Â£20,000, so that a beginning may be made on the actual building this year. I appeal to the Government not to be the first Pederal Government that has allowed the grand progressive work of this memorial to be arrested or to lapse even for one single financial year. I trust that before their decision is final Ministers will visit the collection at the War Museum in Sydney where they will see something in no way calculated to stir up racial or international passions. It is a sacred memorial. I challenge any-one to visit that collection without coming I to loathe war more than ever, and without a prayer in his heart that we shall never again be plunged into such an international conflict as that which it commemorates. I appeal to the Government to find at least a few thousand pounds for building operations this year so that the progress of the work may not be arrested. I make my appeal in the name of those who fought and died overseas, and in the name of hundreds of thousands of the relatives of those who gave their lives for their country. The completion of this work should not be delayed a day longer than can be avoided. for Home Affairs) [12.2] I wish to say something about the matter raised by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I agree with him that very valuable work is still in progress in connection with the erection of this memorial. Plaster casts are being made, and the ultimate casts of metal figures showing the activities of the Australian Imperial Forces will be completed within twelve months. Ten such casts are to be made, and already four of them are finished in the war museum.

He now admits that it might have had to be closed temporarily. Memorial. was in Melbourne, and afterwards in Sydney, is merely an exhibition that must close some time or other. The Minister does-not understand the position. the position, and I assert that, but for the action of the present Government, the museum would have been closed. exist. one and a half million people have visited it in Sydney.

The articles in the museum would have had to be stored and the museum closed. I was able to bring the amount allocated to the museum up to Â£14,500, which will be sufficient to keep it open.

79,Mr Blakeley,"Whil e it is truewar memorial in Canberra. So far as I can see, however, nothing was done, in spite of the fact that during those years there was a succession of extraordinarily good seasons and good budgets. The statement of the Minister for Home Affairs is disappointing. It is good to know that the war memorial scheme is not being definitely abandoned, but something more should be done than the Government proposes to do. Memorial is being only temporarily suspended. I have made sufficient money available for continuing the work on the casts. ment to make sufficient money available to enable the work on the memorial to be continued for at least a year. A few days ago I introduced a deputation from unemployed returned soldiers in the Territory. I then reminded the Minister that there was supposed to be in existence a trust fund of Â£20,000 for work on the memorial. I am very sorry if the Minister has found in the meantime that that fund does not exist. What has happened to it? Trust money should be put should be payable on it. If the trust fund money is not available I make an earnest plea to the Government that other provision be made for proceeding with this work. I emphasize what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has already said, that this should not be a party matter. I intend to say nothing in criticism of the Government, aud I ask all honourable members to. treat this matter as something above party and financial considerations. our complete this work, and if we are honourable men we shall go on with it. We owe a duty to the men who did not come back. It is their names which will be engraven on the memorial. Those dear to them will not forget, but if we remain inactive through some slip in accountancy over a trust fund we shall be breaking faith with the men who died. Published in the press this morning was a statement that the Government intended to spend Â£1,000,000 for the relief of unemployment. The Prime Minister .was asked this moruing whether this was correct, and he said that he was about to consult with the Premiers of the States on the matter. Is there any reason why, if Â£1,000,000 can be spent for the relief of unemployment throughout the Commonwealth, it is not possible to find Â£20,000 this year for work on the War Memorial, seeing that the work has already been approved by Parliament? There are from 30 to 50 unemployed soldiers in the Territory alone, and it goes without saying that returned soldiers should be employed, as far as possible, on the construction of the memorial. The memorial may be somewhat grandiose in design, and personally I think that something simpler, such as a cenatoph, would have met the case. However, we are committed to the present undertaking, and we should go on with it. We must remember that it is not only a memorial, but will also be the repository of the priceless records of the Australian Imperial Force, the perman ent home of the documents and trophies associated with the war. It is our definite obligation to erect this memorial, and I ask that the money for this year's work be found from sums allocated for the into an account and interest relief of unemployment. I trust thatmembers of the Government who have previously spoken in support of this memorial will continue to urge that the work be proceeded with. ter) [12.13] -There is apparently misapprehension in the minds of some honourable members regarding this matter, and I hope to make the position clear. The statement of the Minister for Home Affairs did uot in any way indiI t is cate that the previous decision of the definite moral obligation to Parliament to erect the War Memorial building was to be disregarded. The item on the Estimates is still before the committee. A sum of Â£20,000 has been allocated to a trust fund. It has been stated that this sum is lying idle, but that is entirely erroneous. If that money had been spent it would have meant merely that our cash overdraft had been increased hy that amount.

As soon as this Government has had an opportunity of ascertaining the exact financial position of Australia the work will be resumed. All members of the committee, as well as the Government, must take their share of responsibility for this. The condition of Australia's finances is such that any responsible government must hesitate before beginning a building unless it can see its way to complete the work. There is lying idle at the present time in Canberra Â£50,000 spent on the foundations of public offices, buried in the ground with the dust ready for it. blowing over them. Apart from the doubt as to the security of these foundations, there remains the fact that the last been in office five weeks, just long enough Government was responsible for spending Â£50,000 on them without knowing whether it would be able to proceed with the erection of the buildings they were intended to sustain. That Â£50,000 is a dead loss to the Commonwealth of Australia. The proposed memorial is estimated to cost Â£412,000 and in the present state of Australia's finances the Government cannot see how that expenditure can be undertaken. If we spend Â£20,000 on excavations and foundations and then withdraw the plant because we cannot afford to proceed further, we shall be throwing away the public money.

The present Government is rectifying that wrong and making legal the illegality for which the last Government was responsible. The amount for the commencement of the War Memorial will remain on the Estimates, and I assure the committee that the work will be commenced as soon as the Government can see some prospect of being able to carry it to completion. Often the Prime Minister makes speeches which in themselves are convincing, but which when considered in conjunction with facts other than those stated by him leave a different impression. An item appears on the Estimates for the commencement of the National War Memorial, and naturally Ministers are asked whether they propose to proceed with the work. The Prime Minister has announced that the Government does not propose to do so at the present time. In those circumstances this item should not appear on the Estimates. The work may be commenced before the end of the financial year. what the honourable gentleman has said regarding the ultimate liability of Â£412,000, the Government would be acting logically if it removed this item from the Memorial until the nature of the colEstimates, but it appears to be trying to win both ways. trust fund? has been at pains to explain that a mere addition to the trust fund achieves nothing. of the money that is placed in the trust fund would increase the overdraft and the interest bill. the Prime Minister's speech if the Government had not placed the item on the Estimates.

I do not accede to the proposition that a particular work should be undertaken because there is unemployment; that is not a fair argument. Every work must be considered on its merits.

There are ample reasons for its not having been commenced at an earlier date; but there is now an opportunity to begin it.

He traversed the history of the War Memorial movement from as far back as 1917. I was in Blighty in 1918, and there were very grave doubts even then as to which side would win the war. Fritz was pushing back the allied armies, and it was not known whether ho would succeed in getting through to Paris. When I was sent across to France it was said by those who were acquainted with the area to which I was going that I was being drafted into an ironmongery establishment.

But I am opposed to any attempt to play up to the sentimentality of the people. When I raised this question in the last Parliament I was accused of endeavouring to defeat a vote that would provide employment. The position has not altered in the last three months.

On the other hand, however, why should we not do something for the men who are suffering from war disabilities and paying the penalty of their heroism and sacrifice ? I have done everything I can do to obtain more sympathetic treatment for such men, but have not been very successful. The honourable member for Henty( Mr money has merely been placed in a trust Gullett) said that the men were promised a war memorial.

On the 12tb December next, I propose to move a motion concerning men who are tubercular as a result of their war service.

He says, "" The sacrifices made by the men who lost a leg, an eye, or au arm are apparent to the general community; but our clothes cover our agony, arid the time comes when we have to pay a most exacting penalty."" Any soldier who cau fairly claim that his health has been undermined, or that he is suffering great pain on account of a war injury, should be given at least sufficient to live on. He would be earning at least a living wage if he had not gone to the war. In this way we can honour and give satisfaction to our returned soldiers. here? that. But the man who is merely out of work at least has his health. My first concern is for those whose health will not permit them to work.

I also I appreciate his contention that his Government has not yet had sufficient time to ascertain the exact financial position of the Commonwealth in . regard to our various national obligations, but I share the fear of my leader that the Government's expressed intention not to continue the erection of the memorial during the present financial year will result in statement with some experience of what Â£ s. d. has happened in regard to other war funds to 31st memorials. .. .. 6,506 18 0 ber sat behind a government that did nothing. is one subject that we can discuss in this .. .. 3,605 10 10 House without introducing party politics, it is the proposal to erect a national memorial in honour of those who served and died in the late war. honourable members opposite on a party matter, if this has not been made one by .. 30,112 9 4 them.

I am also a member of the finance committee that works under that board. The intention was not to provide a memorial at Canberra immediately. The Deputy Leadert of the Opposition has traced the history of the movement.

148,Mr D. Cameron,"S o far, I haveof interest as they had found during their service, and that these should be collected and housed in a war museum. Subsequently it was decided that the collection should be accommodated in a monumental building to be erected in the national capital. The utilitarian object of that building was to house those relics, but its aim was also to provide a hall of memory in which should be inscribed the names of the 60,000 ex-members of the Australian Imperial Force who gave their lives for their country, and also the names of those who have since died from the effects of war service. Altogether the names will number 80,000. Apart from those considerations, the collection, which is of untold value, will have a permanent and definite home, instead of being housed in buildings in Melbourne and Sydney, for which a high rent is paid, and where the risk of the total destruction of the relics is ever present. I suppose that there is no other country that took part in the war that, has not established a national memorial to its fallen soldiers. Every capital city of the Commonwealth has either erected or is at present erecting first place the Minister stated that the a memorial, and monuments of some description are to be found in practically every town and village, and even in the most remote parts of Australia. Some of them are intensely pathetic, consisting of plaster figures that are in some instances falling to pieces; but the people have done their best to honour the memory of those who fell. I say without the slightest hesitation that the great majority of the people favour the immediate establishment of a national memorial, not with the idea of keeping alive a militaristic spirit-fa r from it-becaus e we are a peace-loving people, desirous of living in friendly relations with our neighbours. The majority of the people, men and women, would like to see this memorial erected in honour of those who gave their lives during the war. If the Government will proceed with the laying of the foundations of the memorial in Canberra, I am sure that the people of Australia will not rest content until the structure has been completed. I firmly believe that they would even agree to the raising of a special loan for the purpose of completing it, if necessary, and I would support definite taxation on an equitable basis to enable us to raise the sum required to complete ""the work. I appeal to the Minister, and the Government, to make provision to carry on this undertaking during the present year. If the Minister finds in the end that he cannot .continue it, let him ask the House for special assistance to enable him to keep the work in progress. I hope that in some way the Government will find some means of overcoming the present difficulty. I am sure that the country would never permit the spectacle of a national war memorial being left uncompleted, if its foundations were laid at the foot of Mount Ainslie. have been waiting to hear the Treasurer make some reference to the item before the committee. The explanations made up to the present have Confused rather than cleared the issue. My conception of a trust fund is that money is earmarked for a specific purpose, and should be available when the work for which it is allocated is to be undertaken. In the work would be suspended; then, when honourable members on this side of the chamber urged that some action be taken, he said that the work would be proceeded with when opportunity offered. A sum of Â£20,000 has already been voted by this Parliament for the' work, and in the Estimates now before the House we are considering the allocation of a further sum of Â£30,000. It is unlikely that more than Â£20,000 would be spent on the work this year in any case, and I should like to obtain from the Treasurer a statement as to whether this Â£20,000 will be available for the purpose intended. If it is available then the Treasurer should withdraw the item of Â£30,000 included iu the budget. If the Â£20,000 passed by a previous Parliament into a trust fund has lapsed the present amount could be passed without debate provided an assurance was given that the money would be expended. There is no good reason for further delaying this important national work. Sufficient has been said: on the history of the War Memorial proposal. It has been said that the last Govern rneuf was responsible for unduly delaying the",26,Parkhill Bookkeeping Entry An Amount Is Not Paid
149,Mr Mackay (Lilley) [2.30],"Ierection of the memorial, but the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Gullett) has answered that charge satisfactorily. The proposal was before the standing committee on public works for nine months, and after a thorough investigation the committee reported favourably upon it. Architects were invited to prepare plans, and a design was approved. It was arranged that the successful architects should supervise the work, receiving remuneration at the rate of 5 per cent, of the cost. What will be the position in regard to these architects? They will not be prepared to waive their claim indefinitely. The whole thing is a mixup, and I urge the Government, even after so much delay, to reconsider the matter. Perhaps it would be well to postpone the item, and next week the Government may be able to come before the committee with a satisfactory proposal for the early completion of a memorial which will be a permanent record to the memory of those who lost their lives in the Great War. [2.33] I wish to clear up the position as regards the trust fund, and what has happened in regard to the appropriation. That is the only point with which I am now concerned. Minister for Home Affairs and the Prime Minister have dealt with the intentions of the Government, and have clearly intimated to the committee that the Government does not want it to be understood that the work is to be abandoned, nor is there any justification for drawing that inference. Honourable members are under the impression that, because Â£20,000 was allocated to a trust fund last year, that money is available and can be expended. It is true that it is available, and it is equally true that it can be expended, but it can be expended only if the Government considers it wise to start the work, and, having started, proceed with a continuous programme. Nothing is accomplished, even to achieve the great ideal behind the War Memorial proposal, by merely spending Â£20,000 on the work, and stopping there. I think it will he agreed by the committee that, once a start is made, the work should go on without interruption. memorial should not be a long drawn-out undertaking; but should be proceeded with in an orderly manner until its completion. The position, so far as the Government is concerned, is that we regard the present as an inappropriate time for beginning construction. There is no justification for saying that we are illogical or inconsistent in leaving the present item on the Estimates. The sum provided for in this item will at the end of the year be appropriated, and paid into the Trust Eund. tional to the amount previously voted ? the Government placed Â£50,000 on the Estimates, ostensibly for the purpose of initial expenditure on the War Memorial. Presumably it intended to spend Â£50,000, but at the end of the year only Â£11,000 had been spent. Then, so as not to allow the whole vote to lapse, the Government appropriated Â£20,000 of the unexpended vote and paid it into a trust fund. The balance of the Â£50,000 was allowed to lapse, and will have to be revoted. This year Â£30,000 is being placed npon the Estimates for a like purpose. It will be paid into the trust fund, from which it will be drawn as the work proceeds. This Â£30,000 is to supplement The the sum of Â£20,000 already paid into the trust fund, so that at the end of this year there will be Â£50,000 available for expenditure. absolute obligation on the Government to use that money for the War Memorial. ment of a trust fund really means nothing. the money in the fund is definitely appropriated for a specific purpose.

158,Mr Theodore,"Honorabl e memout the balances in trust funds on the 30th June last. There is also an account of trust fund investments. The total credit standing to all trust funds large and small, both statutory and those established by executive minute, aggregates Â£11,957,000, and of that something over Â£9,000,000 is invested. This balance represents the net credit to the trust fund, f t is treated as part of the ordinary funds in the control of the Treasurer. There may be cash standing to the credit of one fund, and an overdraft debited against another. The position to-day is that, taken as a whole, there is an overdraftstanding against the various Treasury funds. There is no cash balance at all. As to the details of the trust fund which we are discussing, if honourable members will look at the budget papers circulated by the late Treasurer in August, they will see on page 87 a statement of receipts aud expenditure from all trust funds. It is shown there that Â£20,000 was received for the establishment of a war memorial trust fund. This Â£20,000 was really part of the unexpended appropriation of Â£50,000 for the erection of a war memorial, and was placed in the trust fund to prevent its lapsing at the end of the year. It is now proposed to supplement that sum of Â£20,000 by a further Â£30,000. to use the money for the purpose of erectwith the work.

There shall be a Commonwealth Memorial of the Australians who died in the war. 2. The memorial shall be known as the Aus-' tralian War Memorial, and shall consist of the collection of the war relics of the Commonwealth, and such building for the accommodation of those relics as is specified by the first announcements of this GovernGovernor-General in the Gazette. 3. The war relics of the Commonwealth shall include the relics, records, pictures, photographs and other articles which, at the commencement of this act, comprise the Australian War Museum and any other such articles, having relation to the war, which are acquired in pursuance of this act. The collection of relics to be housed in the museum is unique in that it was gathered chiefly by the soldiers themselves on the field. It is not a war museum portraying-muc h less glorifying-war ; but a memorial conceived, founded, and from first to last, worked by Australian sailors and soldiers themselves in honour of their fallen comrades. During the time the war museum was open in Melbourne, more than 80,000 people inspected it, and since it has been in Sydney more than 1,500,000 have seen it. The relics it contains are priceless, but under present conditions they might easily be destroyed. in Sydney more people will see it than can possibly see it in Canberra. housed, and might at any moment be destroyed by fire. It is only a temporary building. The various State Governments are pushing on with the building of their'war memorials and so are the people of the allied nations. In some instances their memorials have been long completed. I have already described what Â» has been done by Great Britain. Among the other allied nations which have definitely undertaken war memorial schemes are the following:Scotland -Hal l of Memoryi n Edinburgh Canada -Gothic Tower at Canadian House New ZealandAccording to the War Wellington -Proposed combined Museum, Art Gallery, Carillon Tower and Memorial Hall to cost, not less than Â£20(1.000.

Newfoundland Monumental Memorial, cost 50,000 dollars (Â£10.000). All the Allies have completed, or almost completed, their memorials to their fallen soldiers. In these circumstances it is regrettable that one of the ment was that all work in connection with the National War Memorial in Canberra would be suspended for the time being. The soldiers' organizations throughout Australia have urged that this work should be undertaken without, delay. The resolutions carried in this connection may be read in the evidence given before den, when he was general secretary of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia. The returned soldiers' organizations in Canberra have also requested that this work, should be pushed on with immediately. If memorials of this nature are not built at the proper time, they may never be built, or altogether unreasonable delay may occur. A move was made in Brisbane to erect, a memorial in memory of the Queenslanders who fell in the South African war, but. for some reason the work wap not done at the time.

The Prime Minister has informed us that Â£50,000 of dead money lies in the foundations for a public building it is intended to erect in Canberra. One honourable member said, by interjection, that the foundations might not be sufficiently strong to carry the building. Whether that is true or not, there can be no sound reason advanced for curtailing the work at the Hume Reservoir. I ascertained a couple of months ago that Â£3,310,000 had been spent on this undertaking.

This authority will, however, enable the Government to proceed with the work when it feels disposed to convert its credit into cash. Does the Government sincerely intend to proceed with this memorial? We know that it can raise the money whenever it wishes; but does it consider that the matter is sufficiently urgent to warrant its making that effort within a reasonable period ? I know that Ministers are "" up against it "" financially; a majority of those honourable patriots but, in view of the general desire of all honourable members that the memorial shall be proceeded with as soon as practicable, we should have a more definite declaration thanwe have so far had from the Government regarding its intentions.

General) [3.17],I have received what sounded very like a challenge, but what I propose to accept as an invitation, to make a speech upon this subject; and, so that it may not appear that I am exceeding the limits of that hospitable invitation, I shall make only a short one. I wish to recall the fact that this subject has been before the committee on at least two previous occasions; also, that the war has been over for about eleven years, during which period there was in power a government whose patriotism was so pure that the people confidently believed that it was all the time favorable to the policy of constructing a national war memorial. But I regret to learn that, although the spirit was so willing, the flesh was so weak, and that, beyond constructing roads in the direction of the site upon which the memorial is to be built, nothing has been done. memorial, it is so. all part of the memorial. gerated the work that was done by the last Government, I apologize; but that is the information which was supplied to me by the Minister in charge of this item. Turning to Hansard, volume 119, page 6288, I find that, on the 31st August, 1928, I ventured to make a short contribution to a debate which took place on two totally unrelated subjectsa main road from Goulburn to Canberra, and this very subject of a national war memorial. It was necessary for me to couple the two subjects on that occasion in order to call attention to the fact that who now sit on the other side of the chamber man is an authority on patriotism. majority of those honourable patriots had devoted the greater portion, of their skilled rhetoric to the discussion of the policy of constructing a main road from Goulburn to Canberra, and very little to arguments in favour of a national war memorial. I pointed out that the two. subjects were not of a kind that should be bracketed together, and that it was desirable in the interests of good taste that the greater measure of their eloquence should be devoted to the War Memorial, and the lesser to the motorists' road from Goulburn to Canberra. Having disposed of that point, I went on to sayI turn now, for a moment, to a proposed expenditure which is of so much greater importance that I almost hesitate to bracket it with a proposal to spend money on main roads. It was for that reason I criticized the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Bowden) for disposing of the War Memorial with a few perfunctory remarks, and devoting the greater part of his very earnest address to the much less important question of the road between Goulburn and the Federal Capital Territory. The War Memorial is a vastly more important matter, because it raises considerations other than those of mere economy. I have no doubt that the intention underlying the proposal to spend money on such a memorial is that honour should be done alike to our living soldiers and the honoured dead. I should like to do them honour to the limit of my small powers for the iaeals which",33,Parkhill Bookkeeping Entry An Amount Is Not Paid

I should like that honour to be done to them in the first place in the hearts of the people; 1 know that it is being done in tbe homes which the war has left desolate. I should like to honour them in service to the afflicted, relief to the suffering, an unfounded and cowardly personal in the provision of homes for the homeless, and in taking the burdens from the shoulders of those who are grievously overburdened. I should like to do honour along those lines to the soldiers who returned, and to those who did ftot return. There are a great many practical methods by which substantial service can and ought to be done to those men who in its hour of need served tlieir country in the spirit to which I have referred, and the Government has in many respects fallen very short in making just recompense and provision for them. That expressed my view in regard to the National War Memorial at that time.

My attitude to the war, its origin, and its conduct, is all on record. record when some honourable gentlemen, who are endeavouring to make themselves conspicuous in this Parliament, were hardly out of leading strings. Although my attitude in the early stages of the war was the subject of fierce criticism, nobody ever alleged that I had made a poisonous attack on the Australian Imperial Force. I venture to say that many of those who indulged in that criticism have come to join with many public, writers and thinkers who have vastly modified the views then expressed. But it is my happy lot to have no reason tu change by one iota the opinions I then held and expressed, and which I trust I shall continue to hold and, if need be, express. The particular matter under discussion is, in a certain sense, no longer apt for debate; it has been settled. With others, some honourable gentlemen on this side have given it wholehearted support. Some who are ex-members of the Australian Imperial Force have opposed it on grounds that they have eloquently stated. In like manner, among the Nationalist party, some returned men like the honourable member for Darwin( Mr Bell) have spoken in opposition to it. I think that the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr submit that it is deplorable that a discus-' Maxwell) opposed it, and so did other members of the Nationalist party. Until to-day it has been treated and debated absolutely and scrupulously as a non-party inatter.

This great national work, from its very nature-it s permanency, and its association with the gradual development of the national capital-must , of necessity, proceed slowly, and by' regular stages; it is to last for all time. It is a work for the nation, and, above all, it is not a matter of party politics. My view regarding it is recorded in Hansard. The proposal has been accepted by the Parliament. I have agreed to the principle, and I have at least bowed to the will of the majority in expressing views of the kind that were voiced without difficulty this afternoon by the honourable member for Indi( Mr Jones), in the face of the opposition from the other side. The honourable member addressed his challenge to me, and it has been accepted. SinceI see tht honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) straining at the leash to quote some passages from Hansard about what the late Mr Andrew Fisher and Sir Joseph Cook said, in a vain attempt to bolster up the charge that I made a poisonous attack on the Australian Imperial Force, I leave ""that hopeful young gentleman to his task. sion concerning the Government's defence policy should be dragged into the consideration of the vote for the National War Memorial. I challenge honourable members to read my two speeches regarding the memorial, and show that they contain one word that could be said had party significance. I was disappointed in the Prime Minister, when he made reference this morning to the controversy in regard to defence that we had had in the press. He still challenges me to produce the remarks he made concerning returned soldiers. Is it a fit time to do that when we are discussing the National War Memorial?

256,Mr White (Balaclava) [3.36],"1swords with the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General in the press, I did know something. I have been for nearly 30 years in the military forces of the Commonwealth, and I have always taken great pleasure in being associated with them. I am going to say nothing about the war at all. If any honourable member doubts whether I was a soldier, I invite him to look up the vvar records. I do not know anything about the Attorney-General's challenge. I was not in the chamber when it was issued; but this morning I made an appeal to honourable members on the other side to vote sumcient money for the carrying on of the work in connection with the memorial. We were led to believe that there was a trust fund in which his characteristic way, I am forced to there was Â£20,000 that could be drawn upon. Only two days ago I introduced a deputation of unemployed returned soldiers in the Federal Capital Territory to the Minister for Home Affairs, who was asked to sanction the spending of some of that money in order to provide them with employment. Some of those men had been receiving food and lodging out of charity, but they could be given employment if the erection of the memorial were proceeded with. We now find, from the Treasurer's statement, that that money terms other than of praise and appreciation. is not available, and we accept that explanation. I asked the Prime Minister this morning whether, seeing that he had stated in the press that Â£1,000,000 was to some of whom gave their lives in that service. be spent in relieving unemployment throughout the Commonwealth, a paltry Â£20,000 could not be provided to enable the work in connection with the memorial to proceed. We should be breaking faith with the returned men if we adopted the deplorable course of abandoning this national undertaking. Referring to the Government's policy of training, I realize that the Cabinet is unique, because it is 100 per cent, a non-soldier ministry. Not one member of it has given military service, so far as I am aware, in peace or war. Certainly they rendered service of the kind given by the Attorney-General during the war period, but I think that they had no sympathy with the soldiers. I have gone further than that, and have said that both that honourable member and the Prime Minister have attacked the soldiers at different times. Prime Minister made a speech that was distinctly slanderous of them. statement, I apologize to the honourable gentleman, but I shall quote his remarks in that regard when the defence vote is before the committee. I would have scorned to bring this subject into the present discussion; but, since it has been introduced by the Attorney-General in reply to him. On Armistice Day, of all days, the Attorney-General, according to a report in the Argus, of the 11th November, saidArmistice Day appears to be a fitting occasion to refer to a statement whicli has been attributed to me by Mr White, M.H.R. . . . It was to the effect that I had made a most poisonous attack on the Australian Imperial Force during the war. There is not a scintilla of justification for such a statement. .1 have never at any time referred to the Australian Imperial Force in Even had I been inclined to do so (which 1 was not) I should naturally have been deterred by remembering the long list of relatives and warm friends who wore serving in the ranks, If Mr White is correctly reported, I look to him to make tbe amende honorable. take, I apologize to the Prime Minister, and I would have apologized to the Attorney-General also, but, unfortunately for his reputation, my remarks concerning him are only too true. I happened to be in the country when Armistice Day suspending compulsory military was celebrated, and I had not access to the newspaper files for some time, but I noticed the following statement in the Melbourne Herald of the 14th November lastJustification of his remark tliat the Federal Attorney-General( Mr Brennan) had made a most poisonous attack on the Australian Imperial Force during the war was claimed by Mr White, M.H.R., in a telephone message to the Herald to-day.

Mr White added that at present he would be content to quote from one of Mr Brennan's speeches made during the height of the Gallipoli campaign'on the 4th July, 1915, in which he saidI f I were suddenly transported to Gallipoli, and a loaded rifle was placed in my hands and I saw a Turk in front of me I would not pull the trigger. . . In this war, Socialists are fighting against persons they have nothing against, and with whom they have a great deal in common. They are fighting alongside those who have always been their enemies. In reply to that statement, the Attorney General, in the Melbourne Herald of the 18th November read the reported reply. It is published between inverted commas, and purports to be a statement by the Attorney-General. It is as follows"" I gave Mr White an opportunity to make amends for a wrong he did me, but he has not accepted the offer. There is nothing more to be said for the present. The public will judge whether the extract he . quoted is by any stretch of imagination capable of the meaning he ascribed to it . "" In these terms the Attorney-General( Mr chance ? Brennan) to-day referred to the personal controversy between himself and Mr White, M.BT.B. (Nationalist, Balaclava). Mr White has accused Mr Brennan of making "" a poisonous atack on the Australian Imperial Force during the war,"" and when challenged supported it by quoting a 1915 speech from Hansard, in which Mr Brennan said, among other things, that if he were transported to Gallipoli, and a rifle were placed in his hands and he saw it levellel at the head of a Turk, he would 'not pull the trigger. The report from which I now propose to quote was published in the Argus on the 24th August, 1915. It deals with a speech made by Mr Brennan when speaking at Eitzroy Town Hall the previous evening. Mr Brennan is reported as follows:The whole military system was based on corrupt foundations, and' in all its avenues and ramifications it was bound to have corrupt outcrops. Appeals were made to the courage of men to go to the front. Young men were sensitive to that sort of appeal, but the invitation was extended to the good and also to the bad. The military business was the only business for which a man required no reference: so long as he was a killing man he would do for the militar y business. The result was that not only good men and true, but wasters of the worse type, attached themand his request for tlie amende selves to the military. Some of them got to tlie front, stimulated maybe by passion and hatred infused into them by the press, and by other things that would lead them to give rein to their natural inclinations to rapine and slaughter. There was any number of men about Melbourne who would cut a throat for half-a-crown, and if they enlisted them as soldiers, made heroes of them, and sent them out to k ill , they would do more than k ill . says "" Hear, hear."" Apparently he is still of the same opinion. I sent that extract for publication in the Melbourne Herald in reply to the Attorney-General's statement. Mr Brennan, in the course of his statement said that he left it to the public to judge between us. I also stated in my letter that Hansard of the 28th August, I claim permission to 19.16, recorded that Mr Cook, now Sir Joseph Cook, asked the Prime Minister. Mr Fisher, if he had seen the report of this speech, and "" If so, what did he propose to do with regard to those repeated utterances by the honourable member concerning our troops and recruiting generally?"" ber is not quoting my words by any of a greater man, Sir Joseph Cook. In my letter to the HeraldI stated furtherMr Fisher, in reply, said . . . "" I do not hesitate to say I deplore the utterance in question. I consider that it reflects on the honour of Australia generally, and that if it were believed by the people, it would be degrading to the troops who are fighting our battle . . . I think the honourable member's remarks are a grave reflection on our defenders."" Those of us who read those reports on service have not forgotten the indignation Mr Brennan's remarks aroused, coming from a representative man speaking in perfect safety at home. I think it may reasonably be asked, even at this stage, whether Mr Brennan does not owe an apology to the men he maligned, and to their relatives, and whether he is a fit and proper person to be entrusted with a prominent say in the policy, of Australia's defence. able member to point out one of those statments which is wrong.

The honourable member for Batman has said that he has not changed his opinions since he made that speech. He quoted an extract from Hansard in which he stated his approval of the building of the War Memorial. I applaud him for that. But the politicians who stayed at home and carried pious resolutions during the war were not a bit of use to the men at the front. If the honorahle member for Batman says that he still agrees with the statements he made, and which I have just quoted, I say again that he is not a fit and proper person to be a member of the Government of this country. In conclusion, let me say that I deplore that party issues should have been dragged into the debate on the proposal to erect the War Memorial. Progress reported. That the House do now adjourn.
