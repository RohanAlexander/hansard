That contributes to the estimates that were made and changes which appearance of the bottom line and the general occurred in the national economy and in impression which the budget can provide.

What the government has achieved is a surplus one year increase the size of the dividends which they earlier. As I say, the surplus is in excess of pay to the government. So each of those has $700 million. an impact on what we refer to as the bottom line of the budget. I know that comments have been made Procedures of that kind do not cause me about the surplus. There have been references, any concern. I do not think they should cause for example, to what some people choose to anyone any particular concern. It is important call creative budgeting.

That is why we need to was a slight current deficit of $1 billion; in ensure that national governments in particular 1985-86 it was balanced; in 1986-87 there take on the responsibility for ensuring that all was a large surplus; and those large surpluses of that infrastructure is in place and, in effect, continued through until 1990-91.
