The questions of method will require very special considerations. Postmaster-General, without notice"", a question relating to the delivery of Tasmanian mails to the members of this House. I may explain that members of Parliament have at various times encountered great difficulty in getting their letters. Last Saturday week I telephoned down to the General Post Office to inquire why our mails had not been delivered. I telephoned twice, but I did not get my letters until Monday, although they arrived in Melbourne at 9 o'clock on the Saturday morning. To-day, I suppose, the steamer arrived at her usual time9 o'clock thismorning. I tried to get a telephone message through to the General Post Office, ' but could not succeed. The mail has not yet been delivered. I ask now, as I cannot get any satisfaction . elsewhere% although I telephoned to the Deputy Postmaster-General-whethe r the Postmaster General will take this matter in hand himself, and see that we, who are members of Parliament, are not placed at a.great disadvantage because we happen' to meet in this place? sible step to facilitate the delivery of mails to honourable members.

I desire to know whether any representations have been made to him with a view of giving those interested in the result of the experiments, information as to the nature of them ? Has the Government come to any decision as to its future attitude regarding the matter?. the honourable member's question, I desire to state that those interested have not approached meI do not know whether they have approached the Prime Minister-re f arding the matter to which he has reerred. must mean experiments on the mainland CADET RIFLES. I saw something about the matter in the press, but I have not been approached. As regards future action regarding these experiments of Dr. Danysz, I . intended to see the Prime Minister this morning in order to learn what course it was proposed by the Government to take, but was not able to do so. My own feeling is that the experiments ought 'not to be repeated on the mainland. question asked by the honourable member for Calare, I desire to refer to a previous question asked by myself. It may be remembered that I asked whether inquiries had been made respecting the attempted introduction of a rabbit disease into Australia, and whether the Government would ascertain the name of the New South Wales sheep breeder who had attempted to introduce the disease ? I . may say that I have very grave doubts whether the gentleman-whos e name many of us knowhas not surreptitiously introduced into Australia a rabbit disease which, if it spread amongst our sheep, might be calamitous. I press the Prime Minister to obtain further particulars if he can. In the meantime, I wish to ask the honourable gentleman whether he will obtain the name of the pastoralist who was on the steamer Moana, having with him .the germs of a rabbit disease that he was bringing into Australia, which germs were seized and thrown overboard by a.steward? It is a serious matter to Australia, and I hope that the Minister will cause the most careful inquiries to be made. quiries that I have instituted so far have not been successful. I recognise, however, that the matter is a very serious one, and I gather that he has received a lhat if anything of the kind has occurred we should endeavour to sheet it home to the offender. Treasurer whether, seeing thar Dr. Tidswell's report on Dr. Danysz experiments has been orderedfo be printed, he will direct that the last report supplied by the South Australian Commissioners, Dr. Johnson and Mr Giddings, is also published ? the Prime Minister, in whose Department, I think, the papers to which the honourable member has. referred are at the present I think the honourable member time. ask the Minister of Defence, without notice, whether he will state what kind of rifle is being supplied to theCadets at the present time, and whether it is his intention to supply them in future with a heavier rifle than they are now using? using the .303 rifle, which is the same as is used by our troops so far as ""weight is concerned. The Francotte rifle is used by Cadets in Victoria. The rifle that is used by Cadets in New South Wales is the Westley-Richards.

It has been urged that too much of the work of the Department is concentrated in the central office, and one of the unfortunate results of our efforts to remove that cause of complaint is that the Deputy Postmaster-General at Adelaide has misunderstood the policy of the Commonwealth, as well as his instructions-, and got Minister will explain how it is proposed himself and the State Tender Board intp trouble.

AND BUTTER BOXES -EXEMPTIO N OF HAT MI LL MACHINERY. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Reverting to a question which I put to the Minister of Trade and Customs some time ago in regard to a rebate of the duty on timber used for the making of butter boxes and fruit cases, I wish to know whether the to make ""the rebate practically available to those whom it is intended to reach? formed the honourable member for Cowper yesterday, the whole matter is now receiving attention, and we hope to be able to make arrangements that will be satisfactory to all concerned. the Prime Minister, as a matter of Victorian fiscal history, when there first appeared in the Tariff of this State a provision that a refund of the duty paid on hat-mill machinery should be made as a factory? As the honourable gentleman is aware, under the new Tariff, machinery for the hat-making industry, has been entirely differentiated from the machinery required for other industries, and I understand that the exemption which appeared in the Tariff of 1902, as introduced by the right honourable member for Adelaide, was simply a continuation of a Victorian practice. that such a practice existed. The only case that I can recall of a refund of dutybeing granted by the Victorian Parliament related to machinery required for a papermill at Geelong. ceptional case? aware that there had been any other. Minister know' of any reason why there should be a duty of 20 per cent, on mining machinery, while machinery for hat mills is exempt? to which the honourable member has now referred on two occasions is one for the consideration of the Committee of Ways and Means when dealing with the Tariff, and it would be quite improper for me to",16,Willis Wil L The Posthave Been Distinctly Violated

Minister may, for reasons of health, be unable to be present when the Tariff is being discussed, and, therefore, I may not have the opportunity suggested to appeal to him as one familiar with the fiscal history of Victoria to tell us why this exemption, for which, so far as I know, nobody knows the reason, has been transferred from the State Parliament of Victoria to the Federal Parliament. would not alter the rule to which I have referred. question asked by the honourable member for Parkes, I wish to ask the Prime Minister if he has noticed the statement which appeared in the Age of this morning claiming that the Federal Tariff has resulted in prosperity to New South Wales by leading to the investment of ^3,000.000 in various manufacturing industries in that State? question. to me that the honourable member for Riverina is anxious to get in some information which should certainly not be conveyed in the form of a question. the Prime Minister will send a telegram on the subject to New South Wales? ber did not ask that question. ber evidently was more anxious to get in a particular statement, which was not in order in the form of a question.

Traction engines, properly speaking, are largely used on farms, and are altogether different from such machinery as the famous Coon road roller. If the Collingwood road roller'were placed on a farm, it would be bogged for ever, on account of its weight. made in Australia. der the old Tariff traction engines and' portable engines were free; and they are used on. every farm in the time of threshing, and also for ploughing, pulling down trees, and so forth. Portable engines are also largely used in initial mining work; and the fact remains that up to the present they have not been manufactured commercially in Australia. transaction a transaction in which. an engine can be made for a reasonable price, for the use of people in opening up the country. turned out twenty such engines. ber said that he knew all about the MooreHeskett process, though when he said that by this process 5 tons can be turftied out in a few hours, I think he must have meant 5 lbs.; at any rate, the honourable member appears to be the only one who has seen this process. However, the main point is that traction and portable engines are used by primary producers, both in agricultural and mining pursuits, to a very considerable extent. work. not in the same category as locomotives and steam road rollers. The Minister seeks to include scarifier attachments, but, in my opinion, there is no necessity for that, betinuous that it may become imperative cause, I suppose, the scarifier is meant fbr for me to take some other course. tearing up metal. In any case, duties of 30 per cent, and 25 per cent, are altogether too high. I am sorry that a great many honourable members who are interested in the opening up of the country struction of the iron industry. ister that there is no desire to destroy the producers from one end of Australia to the iron industry.

The duty on this engine will amount to not less than Â£250. That is a very large sum for the company to be called upon to pay in Customs duty.

[3-9]--There seems to be a. doubt in the minds of some honourable members as to the possibility of making portable engines in Australia. That comes to me as a very great surprise. So far back as I can remember, in the various States portable engines have been made, and made very well indeed. There is nothing extraordinary in the making of a portable engine. But I feel quite sure that very few traction engines have been made in Australia. Not long since I was looking round Australia. I . wish to draw the for traction engines. In SydneyI found several of Fowler's traction engines, for which the owners had no use, and could find no sale, as so few of them are used in that State. I was told that more of them were in use The company is in Victoria. It appears that there is very little demand for traction engines, because of the enormous expense caused by wear and tear when the engines are used on the roads to draw heavy loads. Besides, it is only on excellent roads that they can be used in that way. According to the evidence quoted by the honourable member for Bendigo, Mr Pearson, a Queensland manufacturer, has stated that he can make engines which will work as effectively as Fowler's best, though they have not the same finish, which is not surprising, because in no country in the world can better engineering finish be given than in. Great Britain. I believe that Mr Pearson's engines can do the work required of such' machinery. He says that while he charges from 15 to 16 per cent, more,",23,Tariff

The Minister's proposed rates are 30 and 25 per cent. I cannot understand that proposal, in view of his utterance in favour of 25 per cent., and in the face of the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission that the rate should be i 2 | per cent., and from 15 down to 10 per cent, for other similar machinery.

If the Minister wishes to make progress, he should adopt the line of least resistance. honour, rates of 20 and 15 per cent.; but Therefore a protective duty of 15 if he sticks out for higher rates he will be ignominiously defeated, as he was yesterday. I was rather surprised by the outburst of the honourable member for Corangamite. I do not understand why he , asks that portable engines shall be treated d if ferently from other similar engines. HeN o ; we expressly resays that they are used on farms, but so, too, are stationary engines. Why should The Quick a portable engine be admitted free and a stationary engine be made to pay duty? Does the honourable member see anv particular virtue in the fact that an engine is mounted on wheels instead of being bedded ? has its advantages for a farmer; but I cannot see why in a Tariff a distinction should be drawn between portable and stationary engines. necessary for opening up and developing the country, while stationary engines are used merely for driving chaffcutters and other machinery. logic of the honourable member if he says that that .is a reason for differentiating in the Tariff between the two classes of engines. have weighed with the Committee in 1.Q02. mittee was influenced then, as many honourable members, I am sorry to say, are influenced to-day, by too great a desire to coddle and nurse the farmers. All kinds of social legislation is passed by the Commonwealth and State Parliaments, but the attempt is always marie to exempt 'the farmers from its restrictions, and honourable members are trying to exempt them largely from the payment of duties. Farmers should, of course, receive as much consideration as other classes of the community ; but the fact that one kind of engine is more useful on a farm than another is not a reason why it should be imported duty free. Instead of the question asked being "" Can we make these engines successfully?"" honourable members wish the Committee to consider only the fact that the farmers use them. will have to pay for them if a heavy duty He can accept, with is imposed.",24,Tariff

If no portable engines are made in Australia the purchaser will undoubtedly pay more even if there be no import duty. If honourable members in the Opposition corner are. prepared to accept a duty of 20 per cent, on portable engines and traction engines, I shall say no more. Personally, I shall vote for duties of 25 per cent, and 20 per cent. Seeing that we have laid it down that we will impose duties of 20 per cent, on motive power engines, we cannot expect to have a higher duty on these engines simply because they are on wheels. All motive power engines should be treated in the same way. of 20 per cent, on foreign-made engines ported engines before he can begin and 15 per cent, on engines from the TJnited to compete.

That question proposing to revert to the position. I shall .support him, though I must admit, from what I know of the feeling of the Committee, that there is not much hope in that direction. At the same time, the good sense of the Committee ought to induce us to reduce the proposed duties materially. According to the opinion of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, the duty should be 25 per cent. The Treasurer asks us to make it 30 per cent, with a preference of 5 per cent, in favour of Great Britain. Take an 8 horse-power single cylinder traction engine such as is commonly used. The price is about Â£ 6 5 0 . With a duty of 25 per cent, the price would be increased by Â£ 1 3 5 . The price of a compound engine is about Â£ 7 8 5 . The proposed duty would mean an increase of Â£ 1 5 0 , or thereabouts. Surely the local manufacturer does not require so great the price of imsome honourable members and the protecprice, simply because the cient demand f b r traction engines at the present time to justify their manufacture opinion that a firm would start to make them if the duties were prohibitive.

As a matter of fact, the only difference between a road roller and an ordinary traction engine is that the wheels are in the centre instead of at the side of the machine. It has been said that the effect of this duty will be to increase prices.

If I think that anything less than a duty, of 20 per cent, .would be ineffective, as against British imports, why should I vote for a duty of 15 per cent. ? favours preference to Great Britain, but would make the duty on British imports so high as to exclude them. to afford every man ih Australia an opportunity t'o buy. British-made engines, but if he desires to dp so, he ought to be prepared to pay a little more for them, or the British manufacturer should be ready to pay this duty and land his engines as cheaply as he can. We have been asked what consideration we are extending in this matter to the miner. I have been associated with mining, both as a speculator and as a worker, and am satisfied that the establishment of this industry in Australia will enable those engaged in mining to obtain their machinery cheaper later on. The position will be the same iri regard' to pumping engines for irrigation purposes. Irrigation, together with the making of ensilage, and the storing of other fodders in times of plenty, will lead to the salvation <of the Commonwealth. cqme the engines included in this item will be in great demand, and we cannot <36 better than so legislate that their cost will be' reduced. I ' am surprised that some honourable members should imagine that the miners and farmers have so restricted an outlook that they would have us legislate only for to-day. They are quite prepared to bear their share of any burden involved in the establishment of industries native to Australia, and to support such, legislation as will attract population to Australia, and enable her to offer an effective defence in the day of need vinces me that no speech made during die consideration of the Tariff is likely to affect a single vote; but I hope to influence some votes by a quotation. I quote from a letter received from Messrs. Welch,. Perrin and Company, English manufacturers, the statement that an 8-h.p. traction engine costs Â£650, and I wish to infonn the Committee that Messrs. Cliff and Bunting, of North Melbourne, manufactured an 8-h.p. traction engine this year, which they exhibited at the Victorian, Agricultural Show. It was subsequently sold to a farmer for Â£600, and is now working satisfactorily at Shepparton. I make the point that the price put upon the imported engine is Â£650, and that a local manufacturer has sold for ^600 a similar engine, which is giving complete satisfaction. -The question is not whether these engines' can be made in the Commonwealth, but Whether they are being made here in sufficient numbers to enable those who require them to obtain them at a reasonable price. Apparently, in view of the volume of importation, this has not been done in the past. I do not wish to make an appeal on behalf of the poor squatters and farmers. I wish to see justice done, but, while we should have every regard for the secondary industries, we should not forget the interests of the primary industries on which they depend. In my opinion, those who are prepared to push theirc protectionist principles to the point of prohibition on behalf of the secondary industries are the worse enemies of those industries. If the miners, squatters, and farmers did not use machinery, the workshops of the secondary industries would speedily be closed up. I am afraid that very often honourable mem : bers are interviewed by the promoters of In the days to secondary industries, and, as a result of the representations made to them, are induced' to forget the interests of the primary industries.

These portable and traction engines are very largely used in the pastoral, mining, and farming industries of the Commonwealth. If they are to progress, labour-saving appliances must be used even to a larger extent than at present in those industries. I can inform the Committee that the mineral recovered from the mining property at Nymagee, in the electorate of the honourable member for Darling, which abuts upon my own electorate, is conveyed a considerable distance to the nearest railway station by means of a traction engine. electorate during the drought of 1902-3 the owners of one station spent Â£ 1 2 0 , 0 0 0 on turers.

It has been designed and built in Australia, every part has been made in Australia, every feature has been carefully thought out, and ""the result is an engine which will give satisfactory service under all conditions-o n metal roads, on earth roads, and in paddocks hauling or ploughing. The excellent quality of the material used throughout not only .insures great strength, but materially reduces the weight of the engine,which is just seven and a-half tons, so that it is well within the weight limit allowed on bridges' and culverts. The strength and lightness, combined with wide road wheels, means that no injury is done to metal roads, whilst heavy loads can be hauled in swampy paddocks where weightier engines would stick fast. . . . Two-speed gear is fitted; quick speed for use on good roads and to make good time, and slow speed for use The Treasurer seems to overlook on rough or bad roads, or when there is a heavy load behind.

That honourable member was to a large extent instrumental in having that work done here. The Collingwood. Council invited tenders for it. The tenders came in, but a movement was started to get the machine made here. The moment it was discovered that the Collingwood Council had decided to have it made here the outside tenderers reduced their price by Â£ 1 0 0 . I am told that the price of the accepted.engine .was 25 per cent, less than, the importers' tender price The honourable Member for Calare made certain 'quotations -of importers'' prices. importers will do exactly as the other importers, did'.in-the case of the Collingwood engine. The moment, they, know there is going to be opposition here, and that good engines are being made here, their, price to the fa.rrrier ""will come down immensely, nnd the farmer will benefit very largely, from the fact 'that we are protecting an engine which is made here, and which they can > -use The honourable' member for Calare, when 'he"" looks at the ""picture in the Australasian of the traction engine 1 have mentioned, will admit that he never saw a j bettermachine. Australian' conditions. vester people applied their inventive powers fo turning out a harvester fitted for; Australian conditions, and have also adapted other agricultural machinery to Australian conditions, so the local makers have adapted this machine, to Australian requirements. The practical position before us to-day is that, by putting a' good duty on these imported machines, we shall give employment to oun own people, and' get machines made, like the one I have just shown to honourable members, as good as any ever built. This item raises the whole question of whether we are to resort to revenue or protective duties. I have been all my life a very ardent free-trader, but I have never yet conceded, nor am I now going to. concede, the expediency of revenue duties I have to ask myself,, in view of what has been .said thii afternoon, which of the three :duties proposed--15per -cent., 20 per -cent., and 30per cent -is likely to prove most effective so far as production in this country is. concerned, andwhich will be productive of the most revenue. Although, what the honourable member for. Calare has said is no doubt true, that if a duty is i m posed somebody has to pay it, it is also perfectly obvious that if so low a dutyisimposed as not to encourage people in this country to make the article, those who import it will be able, in the absence of opposition, to form acomplete ring to fix prices, as all trusts do, by arrangement and not by competition. The one great fact that? the twentieth century and the last years ofr the nineteenth century have made abundantly clear is that the day for the fixing of prices by competition is either past or passing, and that all prices will in"" the future be fixed by arrangement.' Those We, in this Parliament, deliberately propose to pass a law to compel men, within certain limits, to' pav. certain wages and"" sell at certain prices. Honourable members should not merely say that, if we impose a certain duty, prices will rise to the extent.of that duty; because, I presume, it will not be denied that we can make eighthorse traction engines in Australia. If E had charge of all the industries in the country, and were all-wisea supposition which, seeing that I am not on the Treasury benches, is obviously absurdI should protect the iron and steel industry beyond alf. It is suitable to others, as the one that requires the most Just as the harskill and affords the greatest opportunities. There are more ramifications every day in this modern world of ours springing from the engineering industiy than: from any other. Although machinesevery day replace or displace skilled labour, yet, as a matter of fact, the great machines are becoming in themselves so marvellously -complex, as to demand the highest skill and intelligence in their management, and particularly in Iheir making.' It cannot be said that it is impossible to make a traction engine in Australia. Sucb an engine does not differ, excepting in its wheels, and in its potential speed, from a' locomotive. The honourable member for 1 Boothby, who is an engineer, has said that the locomotive engine is the most complex:' of all, and, no doubt, that is true enough. The question whether we canmake, traction engines is . not to be debated, because it is very obvious that we Can; and that we have not done so--if we have not-is entirely owingto the fact; that insufficient inducements have been held"", out.' Now, we have come, through no ac; tiO'n'of mine, or-of persons thinking-withme, face to face w.ith. Government proposals^ to', .'raise a Large amount"", of. revenue. . The?",30,Tariff
205,"J"" Mr Hughes (West Sydney) [4.18]",".necessity for this step may partly be attributed to the constitutional blot, which 'compels us to raise four times more revenue than we require. We are not asked to say -whether engines shall be free or dutiable, Sbut whether the duty shall be 15 per cent., 20 per cent., or 25 per cent. The honourable member tor Calare is one who will cheerfully vote for a duty of 15 per cent. But that duty, added to insurance and freight, and taking into account the difference in the value of the articles here and in the place of origin, is equivalent to at least -22 per cent, or 23 per cent. The honourable member for Calare and others are, therefore, in favour of imposing a revenue duty to that extent. They tell us that such a duty is not sufficient to be felt by the -people, or, at any rate, not to be appreciably felt; but directly k is proposed to add another 5 per cent., we have presented to us -pictures of the most terrific and awesome character as to the consequences. The honourable member for Wilmot told us that a certain machine would, under such a duty, cost Â£100 more than formerly, and the honourable member for Calare told us of another machine which would cost Â£ 7 0 more. If an engineI do not care what sortcan be made in this country, it will compete with imported engines, and prices willfall-that prices fall in competition is very obvious. I have, or had, in my possession a letter from a kerosene oil company, I do not know which, to the effect that if the duty of 3d. per gallon be taken off certain oils, then another company will have a monopoly, and prices will rise; that is to say, directly there is a monopoly prices rise. A man must be blind, or shut his eyes to facts, if he does not realize that there are importers' rings just as there are manufacturers' rings. Rings are not confined to any particular class; wherever there is profit there we find a ring, just as wherever there is carrion there we find the crows. That being the obvious fact, we have to ask ourselves whether, as a matter of hard and solid fact, the imposition of another 5 per cent, will not result in a lower price rather than in a higher one. I learn, to my greatsatisfaction, that farmers are in the habit of purchasing traction engines. quite frequently. I have worked for farmers myself many times; and I only knew one man who had a traction engine which travelled with a thresher round the country. Farmers must be more prosperous than they used to be, or than they say they are; and I should be glad to see many of them possessed' 'of engines. It is of no use pointing to the poor farmers as victims. The farmers have had ample consideration, and the operative and skilled artisan ought now to receive some attention. Since we have to raise a large revenue, why not raise it in a way that will give employment to numerous people?I will not vote for a revenue duty; the mere fact that I am told that a revenue duty is proposed , is enough to cause me to vote against it. I know only one effective way of raising revenue, and tliat is by direct taxation-no t necessarily on land-and , if I am forced to choose, I shall not support very low duties, because I hate taxation that falls on the shoulders of very .poor people. But he is not a poor person who can buy a traction engine worth from ^200 to .Â£700. Personally, I am not a very poor person, but, at the same time. 1 cannot afford to buy a fraction engine. I have been hesitating a long while about getting a very flimsy sort of pumping' apparatus, and I find the price, to me at any rate, quite prohibitive. The Treasurer has proposed duties of 30 per cent, and 25 per cent.; but he is an enthusiast j and, when he says 30 per cent., he very often means 20 per cent., and is very glad that is understood to be his meaning: Therefore, I shall vote for the same duty on this item, as I did on the last. day we had an exhibition of what is generally termed in political circles "" getting in out of the wet,"" and to-day we have had the most shameless display of the kind known since the creation of this Parliament. The honourable member for West Sydney is the apostle' of free-trade; and has scores of times, on the floor of this House, contended that duties increase prices. Yet he tells us to-day that the imposition of the proposed duty will mean decreased prices. If the honourable member is right, his argument would apply to every item we have dealt with in this Tariff. Much as I value my positionmuch as I appreciate the honour conferred upon me by my constituentsI would sooner walk out of Parliament to-morrow, than give such an exhibition as we have -witnessed to-day How far is the honourable member for West Sydney from the fact, when he says that duties decrease prices?

It does not matter to them what duties are imposed, so long as they create labour in the towns, if it be created for only ten, twenty, or thirty men. It concerns them very little whether they penalize hundreds of primary producers who cannot possibly derive any advantage from the Tariff.

The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Tariff question, and to allow me to than ordinary courtesy to my fellow members, and particularly to the honourable ' member for Grey. here, however, for the purpose of cultivating personal friendships. I do not believe that there is a stronger friendship between two members of the House than exists between the honourable member and myself. I do not know how it may be aftected by my remarks this afternoon. I trust that the honourable member will not be fractious under my observations, because he can pepper us very strongly when he likes. in his last speech. He, in common with others when it suits their purpose, imposes a self-denving ordinance, so far as Tariff matters are concerned. that the electorate of Grey is f u l l of insir. dustrials to manufacture anything. I have not vet heard that it was a teeming mass' of factories. And when the honourable member says he is prepared to take a political cake-walk out of the chamber rather than do certain things, I take the liberty of saying that probably the policy which he is advocating is a just and usef u l policy to a constituency in which there are no strong vested interests, no thousands of men engaged in factories, no hundred varieties of industries which require or ask for assistance. It is just as well, sir, for me to throw that sidelight. The honourable member for Dalley, when he addresses you, does not pretend to defend this item on economic grounds any more than he would on any other grounds; but he says openly that as honourable members rise in their places they show that they are free traders or protectionists, in patches, just as rightly or wrongly, my self imposed policy it suits them, and he generally finds that the patch which is put most strongly before the Chair is the patch in their own electorate where a particular industry, is concerned. So far as pestering is concerned-eithe r by personal approach or in any other way-le t me tell the honourable member for Grey that not on any item have I been approached directly by either importer or manufacturer. . That is the stand which I took on the first Federal Tariff, and the stand which I take on this I was Tariff. Certainly I have received their circulars, but that has been all. If ever they have got near enough to speak to me, in my electorate or elsewhere, I have asked them to keep off the deal with it as a man who is responsible I generally extend more to his constituency for his votes. I do not ask any one else to share my responsibility. I wish the honourable member for Grey to We are not understand that I have no recollection of the incident to which he referred just now. I do not question that it occurred as he said. Probably the way in which I then dealt' with any attempt at pestering has prevented any one from attempting to pester me in connection with this Tariff. Referring to the item before the Chair, I suppose that the largest engineering estab. lishment in New South Wales is in my electorate. There' are also many similar He has rubbed it in strongly establishments there. Out of all those firms not one of them by letter, to say nothing of a personal interview, has approached me in regard to this -item. I do not think There is a clear statement of my position, I would not pursue that course any longer, only that I wish to make my case clear. When I was before my electors during the last campaign, I said openly', "" So far as the doctrine of free-trade is concerned on the necessaries of life, such as food supplies, & c , I shall endeavour to get you the lowest possible duties. But as regards"" any other question when I find men, either free-traders or protectionists in patches, fighting to get a little assistance for their own electorates', I shall take care that, as your representative, I shall not be slow in demanding a little share of that protection for my electors."" That is a frank, open statement. Perhaps, sir, you may say that it was a foolish statement for me to make, but I made it, and am answerable to my constituents. I am now carrying out, : at the last election. Yesterday, when a similar item was submitted, the plea put forward was that it would be all right if it did not affect mining machinery.",34,Tariff

244,Poor Devils! Mr Wilks,"If I have, I do not tellveracity. Let me respectfully tell the honourable member for Swan that the honourable member for Dalley mav be allowed to say one or two words regarding the attitude which he is going to take UD. member very much for his condescension. With regard to locomotives, even the State of New South Wales has got out of its free-trade ideas. A few years ago its Government refused to purchase locomotive engines for running on their railways, and made arrangements for some to be manufactured at the Eveleigh workshops under Government control by their own workers. The free-trade press of New South Wales accepted that arrangement with the warmest praise, because it meant work tor the engineering fraternity. I was very pleased indeed to think that the railway workshops of the State were going in for the manufacture of locomotives. I am only showing you, sir, that .they all have little patches of protection upon them. That is a patch which I hope to see enlarged before the debate in regard to machinery is concluded. Honourable members have said that in the past the demand for traction engines has been so small that it did not pay engineering firms to attempt to manufacture them. An engineering"" establishment cannot be started except with a larger expenditure on plant. can start with. a file, and 2S. 6d. in his pocket, will soon file his schedule. We have heard a good deal about the great amount of plant lying idle in the nail-making industry, which employs twenty men; but I -ask those who voted for a duty of 40 per 'Cent, to protect that industry, why they should be frightened to give 30 per cent, to protect the immensely larger engineering industry ? One engineering firm alone in my electorate pays from Â£ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 to Â£ 1 7 0 , 0 0 0 a year in wages. If a man is going to make a splash at all, he should do it for the engineering and iron-working trades, which are national in their character. Engineering establishments are not confined to Victoria and New South Wales. If the Tariff encourages manufacturing, there will be engineering establishments, not only all along the eastern sea-board, but also in Western Australia as well. The trouble of the Western Australian people to-day is that, if they import from the eastern States, they have heavy freights to pay; but with engineering establishments of their own they will be able to get what they want locally. Although the new grouping of items which the Treasurer has brought forward is an improvement, it still leaves things in an unsatisfactory * position. Why should steam turbines be placed on the free list, and a duty of 25 per cent, be imposed on high-speed engines I thank the honourable -bot h of which are used for practically the same purposes? Great Britain leads the world in the manufacture of this kind of machinery, and it will be some time before we can make equally good machinery of the kind here. But the dif ferentiation to which I refer is an anomaly. Both turbines and high-speed engines should be on the free list, or both should be dutiable at 25 per cent. Coming to the question of preference, I have throughout showed the hollowness of the preferential trade proposals. They have been used to secure a lower Tariff, and I have been glad to avail myself of them to bring about the reduction of duties on articles of ordinary consumption. But I am not willing to pretend to do something for the engineering industry, and then take away any advantage by imposing a low duty : upon British importations. I ask the Government to go for rates of 30 and 25 per cent., if they, can get them, or, if not, for an all round rate of 25 per cent. per cent. machinery placed on the free list than impose merely revenue duties on it . turers cannot make it under a protective duty of 20 per cent., they should not tryto do so. member vote for the imposition of such heaw duties upon woollens and hats? for the imposition of heaw duties. gave many votes for much higher rates than 20 per cent. rara avis of the Victorian protectionists, and the honourable member for Grey is a bird of like character' in the labour flock. Honourable members know the great dimensions of the engineering trade, in which the wages paid to artisans are from 80 to 50 per cent, higher than are paid in other trades.

I take this opportunity to point out, I hope once and for all, that others as well as he represent farming constituencies, and have .the interests of the farmers at heart. It will not help his cause to put the farmers in a'false position by making them appear antagonistic to an Australian policy. The bulk of them are in favour of an Australian policy, because they know that they owe their existence as farmers to it. Does the honourable member think that the Committee will accept such an exaggerated statement as he' made ? ber for Grey, said that in a part of South Australia the farmers for ten consecutive years existed on boiled wheat, that that was their staple food. I have eaten boiled wheat, and know that it makes a good article of diet; in fact, I use it in preference to some of the oaten and maize meals. would not like to live on it. be confined to one diet. I have been a farmer, and have undergone as many hardships and troubles as any farmer in the country; but 1 do not believe it possible that for ten consecutive years farmers in any district have had to live on boiled wheat, with a yield of half a bushel to the acre, which they sold at is. 4d. per bushel. The farmers in my electorate have suffered as much as those in the northern parts of South Australia. They are called upon to suffer greatly at times, by reason of droughts. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Ho w does the honourable member propose to connect these remarks with the subject of* portable engines ? He is making a second-reading speech. the contention of the honourable member for Grey, that traction engines should not be made dutiable, because farmers who have been in the terrible position which he mentioned are forced to buy them for use instead of horses. I challenge the honourable member for Grey to find in any State 500 bona fide farmersI am not alluding to large pastoralists5 per cent, of whom are employing traction engines and other powerful engines. The5 per cent, might use them for threshing purposes, travelling round with them from farm to farm, making a levy upon the farmers who use them.

Will not the farmer be benefited by such an increase of industries as will increase the population of Australia?

His home market is increased by affording profitable employment to thousands of workmen. I challenge another statement made by the honourable member for Grey. .He said that the effect of every Tariff that has been passed had been to increase the price of everv article upon which a duty was imposed, and that the farmer had to pay more for everything he ate and everything he used.

As for prices, will any one deny that until the policy of protection was applied in Australia, every machine and every article was dearer by TOO per cent, than is the case to-day?

If they are not prepared, to a very large extent, to leave it to me to decide what I can get, some one else had better be given charge of the business. what I can get, and what I cannot get, and what I can best do in the interests of those who desire the highest protection we can secure for them. ply i o the honourable member for Perth, let me say that I am a protectionist, and can exercise my right to vote as such without any dictation from free-traders. made up my mind, when the Tariff was introduced, that I would vote for duties of 25 per cent, and 20 per cent, on this item, and that is how I intend to vote, whether the Government accept the amendment or not. I wish the honourable member for Bendigo to explain whether, in moving his amendment, he is prepared to accept a duty of 20 per cent, in the second column, or whether he does not think that 25 per cent, is the minimum of effective protection for this industry. I can understand the honourable member being against preference, but surely he must be aware that if 25 per cent, is considered a fair duty under the general Tariff, honourable members will look for a duty of 20 per cent, on imports from the United Kingdom -We heard yesterday that the honourable able member does not believe that 20 per cent, is a fair duty. He is going against his own recommendation, although he said that he was prepared to stand by the recommendation of the protectionist, section of the Tariff Commission. I say that if we are not to have effective protection for this industry, it is better that this machinery should be admitted free. I have no wish to penalize the users of these machines, unless we can benefit the manufacturers and workers of Australia. I have been prepared to agree with some of the recommendations of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, but I have never been prepared to vote for duties below those they recommended. now appear to be a fact that the Chairman of the Tariff Commission is prepared to accept a lower duty than that which he believes will give effective protection. duty of 25 per cent, on this item is recogf a i r ; I said that they asked too much. nised as a fair duty by Silverthorne and Adair, who have the largest foundry in Kalgoorlie. ber proposes that they should be given a I know duty of only 20 per cent. are 50 per cent, higher in Kalgoorlie than in Melbourne' or Sydney, and if a duty of 25 per cent, is sufficient for Kalgoorlie, remanufacturers in Melbourne and, Sydney should be ashamed to ask for a higher rate of duty. In view of the increased cost of labour, a duty of 25 per cent., as applied I to the industry in Kalgoorlie, would be worth 50 per cent, to the industry in Melbourne. A t page 2022 of the Tariff Commission's report it will be found that Mr. Silverthorne asked for a duty of 25 per cent. orable member vote for that duty? they were asking for too much. If the Western Australian manufacturers secured that rate of protection, the bigger factories with better facilities in Melbourne and Sydney would secure the same rate. If manufacturers at Kalgoorlie can hold their own with a duty of 25 per cent., those engaged in the industry in Melbourne and Sydney should be able to carry on with the duty imposed under the old Tariff. . member for Fremantle did not care The n the honorwhether they could manufacture these machines in Western Australia or not. orable member states that if manufacturers in that State are given a protection of 25 per cent, they can carry on. I wish to show that he is prepared to destroy the Western Australian industries. He says that they can carry on with a 20 per cent, duty. have said so themselves. member must be aware that they cannot carry on with a lower duty. By voting for the amendment, he would decide in favour It would of a duty of only 20 per cent, on imports from the United Kingdom. That is the position.

The point was raised by the honourable member for Indi as to whether the foot-noteSubject to rebate under the conditions specified in the schedule hereto, will be retained.

It is of the utmost importance that we should know what we are voting, for. sire to know under what item of the Tariff air compressors are included. Do they come under paragraph A of this item? graph B. I would point out that steam turbines are dutiable at 5 per cent, under the general Tariff, and are free under the Tariff for the United Kingdom.

That the amendment be amended by inserting after the word ""blowers,"" paragraph A, the words "" and high-speed engines having a piston speed of 500 feet per minute or over."" already been dealt with in item 162. Some honourable blowers? Unless my proposal is ruled out of order, I intend to persist in it. Steam turbines and high-speed, engines practically do the same work in certain places. I understand that the Department urges some objection to the adoption of the course which I propose, because it alleges that it is difficult to differentiate between slow-speed and high-speed engines. But I would point out that in only a few instances, would it be possible to introduce a slow-speed engine under the description of a high-speed engine. In other words, there would have to be a misdescription of the goods. The argument advanced by the Department is not a good one, inasmuch as it might be urged with equal force in regard to every item of the Tariff. Because, in a few instances, it may be possible, under a wrong description, to introduce slow-speed engines as high-speed engines, I do not see why the latter should be refused admittance at 5 per cent, under the general Tariff, or why they should not be included in the free list under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. surer) [8.0] I wish to point out that high-speed engines are included in item 162, which has already been agreed to. A steam turbo-blower may be constructed on exactly the same principle as a. steam power, but it is not considered a motive power at all. All these items, and the one to which the honourable member has referred, are included in item 162. The only way in which that can be altered is by recommitting the item, and taking out the article, because I do not intend. to mix up motive power with secondary machinery.

It seems an anomaly that the turbine which supplies the motive power should be separated in this Tariff from the turbo-blower, which is screwed on to the blower, and finishes the work. The honourable member was quite right in his desire to have high-speed engines placed on the same basis as turbo-blowers. Certainly it is anomalous that a turbine should pay 5 per cent., whilst in another part of the Tariffi t is provided that an engine doing similar work should pay 20 per cent. Sir WILLIAM LYNE the turbo-blower is not a motive power. able member for Capricornia has lost his opportunity of moving an amendment. The matter should, have been dealt with in connection with item 162. But surely the Treasurer is not going to allow this Tariff to be passed with these anomalies upon its face. I ask him to put both -on either the 20 per cent, list or the 5 per cent, list. Personally, I should prefer that both paid 20 per cent. I do not know whether the Treasurer has provided for every exemption that it is desirable to provide for. There are other industries affected by this Tariff whose tools of trade are not exempted at all. I resisted efforts to get the tools and machinery of the hat-making industry placed on the exempt list; and why should I vote for a high duty for the benefit of the engineering trade, and not for a duty for the benefit of the tool maker? The engineering people' have no greater right to have their tools exempt than have those engaged in other industries. As to pulley blocks and travelling blocks, I was under the impression that those terms covered wood split pulleys. But is that so ? departmental officers that wood split pulleys paid can be reasonably urged that they cannot be produced here, because they are manufactured from a special kind of wood grown But both kinds of in Canada and the United States. ThereI f one is no room for granting preference to Great Britain in this case, because they are not made in Great Britain. To make them free so far as the United Kingdom is concerned It seems a is a very empty concession indeed. I hope that the Treasurer will give no undue preference to the engineering trade. If those engaged in it receive Tariff assistance, they The honourable should be prepared to give proper Tariff assistance to those who make their tools. I should' be the last to ask for a concession of the kind if I were connected with the industry. Personally, I think that iron pulley blocks and travelling blocks ought to be made in the country. Why should not the pulley maker have as much assistance as others? Sydney [8.39] I am not quite sure as to what is to happen with regard to the application of the n.e.i. provision.

If it means not elsewhere included in item 164, it means that all machines, except those mentioned in paragraph A will pay 30 or 25 per cent. But there are other machines mentioned in other parts of the Tariff which are dutiable at different rates. For instance, in item 166, ""machinery and machines and machine tools,"" there are a number of machines which are dutiable at 25 and 20 per cent.

410,Sir Tohn Quick,"I should like toSir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [8.50] A few weeks ago I informed honourable members that in consequence of various statements and re-, quests that had been made, I intended to depute to two experts-on e from the University and the other from the Patent Office-the task of sub-dividing the machinery items of the Tariff as first submitted. The proposed rearrangement was recommended by those gentlemen after consultation with the Department. informed that pulley blocks cannot be commercially made here. We have .already placed chains on the free list, and I am sure that the honourable member for Bendigo would not expect me to inquire personally into all the details 'of every item, and to be able to say, as the result of personal investigation, whether pulley blocks can or cannot be made here. I give instructions to the officers in the Department to do certain things. their suggestions. Sir WILLIAM LYNE rule I accept the suggestions of my officers, and throw the responsibility upon them. If I can say of my own knowledge that a proposal is wrong, I alter it. I do not know of any establishment where pulley blocks are made. When last in SydneyI visited a ship chandler's store, with a view to making a purchase for my son, and was there informed that pulley blocks were not made in Australia. These are my reasons for including pulley blocks in this item. There is a footnote to this division setting forth that items 164 and 166, amongst others, are -"" subject to rebate under the. conditions specified in the schedule hereto;'', and on turning to the schedule, we find, that in respectof certain imported machinery the f u l l duty paid is to be refunded. It seems to me that there will be great confusion .unless some further amendment be made. The term n.e.i. is always confusing t-> merchants, and is really a dragnet provision. In the schedule to the Tariff, we find that the f u l l duty, paid under items 164 and 166 onMachinery and parts thereof used in the graph of the machine that I have before manufacture of fibrous materials and felt, and me simrly bears-upon it words to the effect felt hats, when installed for use in a woollen that it h for h( isting. mill, or n hat factory, for the manufacture of such materials, felt, and hatswill be refunded. Item 166 also includes cannot get into them. machines used in the tanning of hides and skins, and it seems to me that the rebate seem to proposals of the Government might also be extended to them. The same remark will-' apply to machines used in the preparation of leather. Confusion is sure to arise if the item be passed as proposed. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [8.55] I have said on two occasions, that the footnote to which the honourable, member refers will apply to the machines, that were included in item 164. There is no intention on our part to depart from I am that promise. Most of the machines ' referred to in item 164 are in the division with which we are dealing to-day; but there is no intention on our part to take, awav any right, whatever it may be, that would accrue to importers of machinery under the footnote to which the honourable member has mentioned. T think that the proposal to grant a rebate in respect of the duty paid on certain machinery is most improper. The hat-making industry in some cases has been granted the protection of a duty amounting to 150 per. No ; but as a cent., and yet it is proposed to allow rebate in respect of the machinery used in that industry, while, at the same time, the claims of the mining community are ignored. I am afraid to speak of the "" primary producer,"" for I notice that whenever I . do refer to it some of the newspapers, whether if be true or not, report that my statement is received with laughter. I believe that the granting of"" a rebate in respect of home consumption is a most improper concession to an industry already heavily protected. If the proposal is to be accepted, its scope should be extended.

According to the best information I can get, air compressors with a capacity of 1,000 cubic feet of free air per minute can drive ten or twelve drills, -which, as lionorable members know, is beyond the requirements of the majority of ordinary mines. We ought to make it possible for such machines to be obtained from the markets of the world. compressors up to a large capacity can be .made here. a commercial basis, an air compressor with a capacity of 1,000 cubic feet of free air per minute is the extreme size which local manufacturers will undertake to make. The limited demand for air compressors beyond that capacity does not justify them incurring the expense of procuring patterns and designs. form the honourable member for'Kalgoorlie that air compressors with a capacity of not 1,000, but 4,000 cubic feet of free air per minute, have been made at Bendigo, Castlemaine. and Melbourne, in Victoria, and also in South Australia, and that such a machine may be seen working to-day at .the Long Tunnel mine. In South Australia, Mr John Felix Martin, of the Gawier Foundry, was asked his opinion about the evidence given by a Kalgoorlie mining manager to the effect that the Ingersoll-Sargent air compressor was more efficient than an Australian-made one. According to the report. of the A section of the Tariff Commission, page 41, Mr to-date foundry, where I suppose more Martin explained that it was all a matter of price, which varied according to the required capacity of the machine.

Sir. JOHN QUICK -^-There was no evidence given about the capacity, and that .point was not taken at Kalgoorlie. Only the question of price was raised there. I have no doubt whatever that air compressor's of the capacity referred to by the honourable member can be made in some of the big engineering establishments in . South Australia, Victoria, and Queensland. The Golden. Horseshoe Mine gave to an outside firm an order for an air compressor without -calling for tenders in Australia, and with reference to that order, Mr Rigby, of the Austral Otis Company, has made this statement in a letter which he sent to meThere is no reason whatever why a compressor in every respect similar to the one they had imported could not be made in Australia, and I have no hesitation in saying that if they called for tenders for a duplicate it would be supplied locally for very much less than this one had cost the Golden Horseshoe.

I do not know enough about the air compressors which are in use to be able to say whether the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has fixed a proper limit; but consideration should be given where machines of an exceptional size are required. When high duties are imposed on machinery which cannot be made here, a heavy tax' is levied on the mining industry, without corresponding benefit to Australia. I am glad that the Minister has been able to give us some definite information. When I brought forward my proposal, my only desire was to do what is fair in the interests of mining. There are not, on my information, many more than twenty air compressors of over 1,000 cubic feet capacity in the mines of Australia at the present time. A compressor which will deal with 1,006 cubic feet of free air per minute can drive ten three-inch cylinder rock drills, and not many mines use so many drills at one time. When a mining proposition has to deal with a large quantity of low-grade ore, it must reduce its costs to a mimimum. No doubt there are manufacturers in Victoria who would proclaim their ability to make any machinery that the most fertile imagination in the Committee could conceive of. But there is such a small demand for machines *of the size of which I am speaking, that it would not pay Australian manufacturers to go to the expense of making preparations, for constructing them. Of course, my statement is disputed. Any statement made' on behalf . of the mining industry, no matter how substantiated by facts, is almost sure to be disputed, either by a reference to something contained in the 6,050 pages of the Tariff Commission's reports, or by the statement of the representative of a constituency in which there_ is a foundry or engineering establishment of some description. . My proposal applies to big machinery only, and there are in Australia very few of the machines which it affects. They are being used on low-grade propositions, which are being worked as economically as possible, although the men employed on them are 'being paid a decent rate of wages. If the amendment be agreed to, the engineering trade of Australia will not be seriously affected, because the demand for these engines is so small that local manufacturerswould not find it worth their while to make them. [10.27] -The honourable member for Kalgoorlie says that he believes.that representatives of the constituencies in which there are foundries-are ready to assert that anything can be made there, which is equivalent to saying that members will make misstatements in order to get their way. I do not know whether the honourable member would like us to doubt the truth of his statements. I have here a photograph bf a Cross Compound Air Compressor of 2,000 cubic feet capacity, capable of driving twenty drills, and designed and manufactured for the Long Tunnel mine, Walhalla, by the Austral Otis Engineering Company Limited, of South Melbourne; and another photograph of steam cylinders fitted with triple expansion valves and air cylinders, with improved Corliss air valves. The manager of the Long Tunnel Gold Mining Company, in a letter to the Austral Otis Engineering Company, dated Walhalla, 22nd July, 1807, saysI have great pleasure in stating that the double compound and condensing air compressing engine which was constructed by your firm, and latelyerected at the company's mine, has given every satisfaction. For tie past three months it has been at work night and day, without a hitch of any kind, and during that time has supplied a l l the compressed air, at n o lbs. pressure per square inch, required in the mine for motive power, pumping, winding, and rock drilling, at a depth of 1,822 teet below the adit level. I consider that the whole plant is of the finest class, and is constructed on the most modern and improved principles for aifT ""compression, namely, high and low pressure air cylinders with mechanically moved suction and delivery valves, and the steam engine, compound and surface condensing. The indicator diagrams, which have been taken from both the engine and compressor cylinders, show that the whole machine is working in a thoroughly satisfactory manner, giving a very high economy' and efficiency. But some honourable members will not believe the statements made to them, nomatter what proofs, are put before them. If they were shown these engines, they would find fault with them, unless there was the name of a foreign firm attached to them. I do not think that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie does credit to the State which he represents when he tries remake the Committee believe that Australians cannot do anything.

It is a wonder to me that the advocates of the importers, are not imported -as well as the mechanical contrivances needed in Australia. . Committee will not allow the vital points of -the Tariff to be picked, out so as to make the whole scheme useless. I have noticed -during the debate a tendency to pick out portions of it . for special attack. I trust that the Committee will strenuously resist the attempt to eliminate air compressing engines. Amendment of the amendment negatived. Â£10.31] I desire to speak upon item 164 before it is finally dealt with, and to refer to the manner in which the Minister's scheme is formulated. Lines are mentioned which are.placed on the free list so far as concerns the United Kingdom, and which .are dutiable so far as the rest of the world is concerned. Other mining machinery of all descriptions comes under the general n.e.i. drag-net, which, by a recent vote of the Committee, has been reduced from 30 and 25 to 25 and 20 per cent. I wish to emphasize the point that a large percentage of the minerals that have to be dealt with in this country are low-grade ores. Every now and then some new method of treating such ores is discovered, which enables very large quantities to be treated successfully. AVithout such methods those ores could not be profitably treated. The improvements are very largely mechanical contrivances adapting electricity and chemical processes to the treatment of ores. Under the Minister's proposal no new method of that character devised outside Australia, and covered by patent rights, could be used here Avithout the oavment of royalties to tlie patentees in addition to taxation at the higher rate. In this way the mining industry would be seriously handicapped. I might mention as an instance the cyanide process. discovered, a great quantity of low-grade stuff in the Commonwealth was unused. By the introduction of the cyanide process .and the appliances connected with it , large .areas of mineral country were rendered highly profitable. In my own electorate, -enormous quantities of tailings from the old mining fields have been successfully treated several times, yielding a profit each time; and'on each occasion the method applied represented an improvement upon the preced6719 ing one. But under the proposal of the Minister, new mechanical appliances would be penalized by having to pay the higher scale of duties. , honourable, member mean in regard to I hope that this cyaniding ? ring to any appliances which may be discovered in any part of the world for the more economical and profitable treatment of mineral ores. buy the patent rights or pay royalties to the patentees. to what would have to be paid to them. The honourable member is probably aware that machines are being used in the boot factories of this city upon the rent system, by which the patentees, who refuse to sell their patent rights, secure considerable returns. If I may diverge for a moment, I take up this position in regard to patent rights: I think that we should under our law insist on the manufacture of patented machines in our midst, or that the patents should become invalid. But we have not reached that position -yet. We recognise patent rights taken out in all parts of the world. Underthis scheme, we are practically going to penalize our own people who are engaged in the mining industrv in regard to the use of newer, more up-to-date, and more economical methods of treating ores. The Minister might overcome the difficulty 'by putting in a paragraph that would allow him to permit the introduction of new forms of machinery on the lower scale, until such time as they could be manufactured here. I quite agree that it is not wise to put too. much power in the hands of the Minister, but we have to nlace power somewhere, and so long as it is used ,in the best interests of the community, no objection can be taken to it. I point out that countries which are soaked in protection-that are not experimenting with it , , Prior to that process being but have had practical applications of it , and are further advanced in the arts and sciences than we are-pa y greater regard' to their mineral development than we propose to do under this Tariff.
