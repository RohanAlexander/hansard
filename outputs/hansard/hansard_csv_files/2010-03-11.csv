Thursday, 11 March 2010 ----Flinders Electorate: Crib Point Bitumen Plant In the last weeks we have seen the shock revelation that the Victorian Minister for Planning and Community Development had been engaged in a program of public subterfuge. A press plan was released inadvertently by his office which showed a sham process for consultation over the Windsor hotel development. It was thorough, complete and malevolent, and it took the public for contempt through the planning process. The relevance of that issue to the electorate of Flinders, and in particular the Crib Point bitumen plant, is that the decision by the minister to approve a Crib Point plant must now be rendered null and void. It should be negated; it should be rejected. The reason is very simple. We have a pattern of misuse of position by the minister-we have clear evidence-and, in the case of the Crib Point bitumen plant, there was a public hearing and an independent panel. The independent panel recommended against the Crib Point bitumen plant and the minister, in a shabby deal, overruled the independent panel and approved the Crib Point bitumen plant. The problem with the plant is very simple: it is reindustrialising a residential town. This town did have a history of industrial development but Crib Point is now a residential town. That moment, that time-that stage of history-has passed, and it is simply unacceptable to reindustrialise the town and to have multiple heavy truck movement right through the streets that are at the heart of this town-multiple carriages per day, multiple B-doubles-throughout the day. More than that, there will be the odours and the impact of the bitumen plant. All the time we are being responsible by saying that there is ample space at North Port, in between BlueScope Steel and Esso’s gas fractionation plant. There is an alternative five kilometres away which the community would accept, the council would accept, the state member would accept and I as the federal member would accept. So there is a clear, responsible, economic alternative. But instead we see a decision by Minister Madden which overturns the independent planning process. It smacks of the same misuse of public consultation to act as a sham. The decision must be overturned, and the minister simply cannot sustain that position. (Time expired) Corio Electorate: Corio Bay Development Earlier in this term I spoke about a vision for a walking and cycling trail around Geelong’s Corio Bay. This trail would extend from Eastern Park through the city’s waterfront along the western and northern shores to Limeburners Bay in Corio. It is a big plan. It would open up a nine-kilometre stretch of foreshore that is presently accessible only in sections. It involves skirting around and through some of the busiest sections of Geelong’s industrial heart, including the Port of Geelong. But I believe it can and should be done. The western arm of Corio Bay boasts beautiful stretches of shoreline, and the view of Geelong from this vantage is one of its best. A cycling and walking trail will create a wonderful community asset for locals and tourists alike. It would also link to the bike path that already runs from Limeburners Bay to MAIN COMMITTEE",120,Adjournment Drug Council That Treatment And Counselling

This plan would open up and improve access to the bay for people who live in the northern suburbs, creating a safe and scenic recreational route to the bay which is currently denied. It would also be a commuter path for those who live and work nearby. For example, people in Lara who work in Geelong’s CBD could cycle to work. Any community facility that increases options people have to pursue a healthy lifestyle is in my opinion a winner. I am delighted to say that progress has been made during the past few months on this initiative. Meetings between me, the City of Greater Geelong and various landholders have been held to canvass the possibilities and the challenges we face. The biggest issue is how we get around sensitive areas like the port, where security and safety are the primary concern. There are legitimate concerns about intermingling of pedestrians and cyclists in areas of heavy industry. Commercial operations cannot be compromised and safety for all must be paramount. This will require innovative engineering solutions in some sections. Pedestrian bridges, tunnels, flyovers and boardwalks are issues that need further consultation with all stakeholders involved, especially industry. Once we have a clear idea of the solutions available and what solutions stakeholders would accept, we will be in a position to develop a concept plan that can be costed and that will guide the best route available. There are clearly issues that need to be worked through, but what has been great to see is the positive response to the concept of a cycling and walking path around Corio Bay. The City of Greater Geelong have been very helpful in taking this initiative forward and I thank them. Industry has been prepared to attend meetings, look at the options and discuss the issues, which I really appreciate. This is a long-term plan but it is a plan that in my view has enormous merit. Our north-facing bay is a world-class asset, but in some stretches it is also a hidden treasure. My aim is to see this hidden treasure, which is after all the very reason Geelong was established as a settlement in the first place, opened up so that Corio Bay can be enjoyed by all. McMillan Electorate: Hazelwood Power Station attention and that of this parliament to the vile campaign by Environment Victoria to close down Hazelwood Power Station. Of course I stand in protection of my own working families, those that work at Hazelwood Power Station, those that are surrounded by Hazelwood Power Station and those that hang off all 500 of the people that work at Hazelwood Power Station. Environment Victoria has one simple aim, to close down Hazelwood Power Station, and they are running this campaign to do such a thing. My mind is not closed, and never will be, to our need to address climate change and to clean up our power stations. I have been the member for McMillan in the past and I am its member today. I do not actually have the power stations in my electorate anymore, but I have the people that work in those power stations in my electorate at Moe. BecauseI care for those people, I like to keep an open mind about where we can head with the marvellous resource that is Victorian brown coal. I am reminded of the local government council candidate who says, ‘I will give you cheaper rates if you elect me.’ When elected, that local government councillor finds out that the potholes on the road, at the front gate of the farmer that elected him or her in the first place, have to be serviced by someone. MAIN COMMITTEE",125,Constituency Statements
247,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (9.36 Am),"Deputy Speaker, today I rise to draw to yourWe as politicians and leaders in our community have to govern for the day, in the day. We cannot govern for what may be into the future. There are great opportunities in Latrobe Valley, particularly with changes to how we generate the power. To close down Hazelwood Power Station would cut off 20 per cent of Victoria’s power supply, which no government would ever allow anyway, because we have a growing community with greater needs and because we have greater opportunities for manufacturing. That has been the basis of our wealth for many years and will continue to be so in perpetuity. We have already cleaned up our act in Latrobe Valley, and we have to be open to how we can do better and where we will be in the future in regard to gasification of coal and how that can be introduced in existing plants or new plants that will be built. There are great opportunities running into the future. I have said before in this House that we are locked into coal for the next 50 years. That does not mean there will not be opportunities for renewables, that there will not be opportunities for abatement or that there will not be opportunities in how we go about using that marvellous resource of brown coal into the next 10 or 20 years. That is why I stand today and say it is wrong to send money to Environment Victoria to help them run this campaign, which has the simplistic view that just closing down a power station will change the world forever. We need as a community to address the issues but to address them in such a way that we have a long-term viable future for our families and our future in the Latrobe Valley. Indonesia Australian Indonesian President’ than Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. Sadly, he will be appreciated more after his departure from office. Yudhoyono brings the torch of friendship to an Australia still deeply equivocal about the equation of democracy, Islam and nationalism that constitutes our great neighbour. That was the judgment of Paul Kelly, one of Australia’s pre-eminent political commentators. There is no regional relationship more important to Australia than our relationship with Indonesia. As President Yudhoyono said, it is not just an economic relationship; it is a strategic relationship that is central to Australia’s security. Cooperation between the two peoples in effectively stamping out the Islamist networks that carried out the Bali bombings has been one of the more positive developments in our region in recent times. Dulmatin, one of the surviving architects of the Bali mass murder, was among the three terrorists killed in Jakarta yesterday. It is a remarkable thing that Indonesia has managed simultaneously to become a successful democracy and to crack down very strongly on these terrorist cells. President Yudhoyono pointed out that the relationship between Australia and Indonesia is becoming a people-to-people relationship. I must say that during the lunch I thought the avuncular remarks of the Leader of the Opposition about travel warnings and Australian tourists going to Bali were fair enough. I personally am going back to Indonesia for, I think, the sixth time in April. But I am sorry to have to draw attention to one jarring note in yesterday’s proceedings. That was the speech made in the parliament by the Leader of the Opposition. In only 300 words, he managed to work in two partisan jibes directed at the Prime Minister: one on the MAIN COMMITTEE",126,Constituency Statements
248,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (9.39 Am),"‘It is impossible to imagine a more prosubject of people-smuggling and the other on the Prime Minister’s proposal for a new regional forum. The Leader of the Opposition needs to learn that there are times and places when partisan politics are not appropriate, and one of them is when making speeches in front of visiting heads of state. To make partisan jibes in such a speech is inappropriate, undignified and harmful to Australia’s national interests. It is something that John Howard, for example, would never have done. No doubt our guests will draw their own conclusions about the man who puts himself forward as Australia’s alternative Prime Minister-although, of course, they are too polite to make any references to his inappropriate remarks. I, however, am not obliged to be so diplomatic. The Leader of the Opposition confirmed the view held by most observers of his behaviour since becoming leader last year that he does not think before he speaks, he always manages to offend someone whatever he says and he never knows when to stop. These are not the qualities Australia wants in a Prime Minister. Mrs Gash-Are you worried about him? judgements about foreign affairs and appropriate remarks in front of the Indonesian President. Most people know that I do not try to make partisan political points about Australia in international affairs, and I do think this was a really undignified and stupid partisan display in front of the Indonesian President. Mitchell Electorate: Mrs Peggy Womersley former Baulkham Hills Shire mayor and councillor and long-time resident of the Hills district, Peggy Womersley, on 16 January after a long and protracted struggle with illness. Peggy was an outstanding contributor to the growth and development of our district not only through her stint on council and as mayor but also within our local small business community in the Hills. A pharmacist by profession, Peggy opened a store at the Kingsdene shops on Felton Road, Carlingford, before expanding into much larger premises at Westfield North Rocks. When I was growing up in Carlingford as a youngster, my family and I were frequent visitors to Peggy’s chemist shop, and I can distinctly remember the personal level of care and attention that she delivered to our community. She was a very successful small business woman because of her ability with people. She will be greatly missed throughout the communities of North Rocks and Carlingford, where she served the community with distinction for so many years, and her successful small business enterprises, pharmacies, continue to flourish in those communities. Peggy, together with her husband, Noel, and children, Jan, Roger and Sue, first moved into Carlingford in 1967 before moving to North Rocks in 1986. She was elected to represent the residents of East Ward and the former D Riding for three terms, from 1987 to 1999. During this time, Peggy held the office of shire president and mayor for three years, in 1991-92, 1992-93 and 1993-94. She later went on to serve as the shire’s deputy mayor for a further three years, in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99. In December last year, the Baulkham Hills Shire Council moved to thank and acknowledge Peggy’s fine contribution to our community by naming a local reserve in her honour.

250,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (9.42 Am),"I rise this morning to acknowledge the passing of aroad from my family home, Carlingford’s Kingsdene Oval, is now known as the Peggy Womersley Reserve. This reserve is located just a stone’s throw from her former pharmacy and, indeed, is an appropriate and much welcomed development in our community. Peggy was a much loved community advocate who was always held in high esteem by the residents of Carlingford and North Rocks. She was at one time a state political candidate after the demise of Tony Packard and, in a field of 25 candidates, she missed out by a single vote. Our state, New South Wales, was the poorer for the lack of her experience in small business and her ability with people. It was a great privilege to attend the thanksgiving service held in honour of her diverse and varied life on 22 January. At the service donations were made to the Peggy Womersley Westmead Medical Research Foundation, raising significant funds for research. TodayI want to record that Peggy was a great woman and an outstanding contributor to the Hills community. She will be sadly missed by her family and those who had the honour of working with her, but her legacy will continue, her small businesses will continue to flourish and her family are making a great contribution to the Hills community. Epilepsy Ms HALL (Shortland) (9.45 am)-TodayI wish to table a report completed by the Parliamentary Friends of Epilepsy following an informal inquiry into the impact of epilepsy in Australia. On 30 October 2009 we held an informal inquiry in Canberra, and at that inquiry we took evidence from a wide range of epilepsy support groups, doctors and people that have epilepsy. We had a roundtable discussion in the afternoon, and that was a fantastic experience. I think all the members of parliament that attended learned first hand what impact epilepsy has on the lives of those people who either have epilepsy or are carers of people with epilepsy. I would like to acknowledge the fine work of my staff member Mark Raper, who put a lot of effort into putting together the submissions and helping with the organisation, and Pat Davies from Gary Humphries’s office, who also put in a lot of work. Today in the chamber we have Jacinta Cummins from JECA, who was also a great asset to those of us that were involved in the hearings. We had more than 360 submissions and I have received quite a few since the day of the hearing; I think the total number is closer to 400 than 360. The committee made some very good recommendations. These recommendations will be given to the Minister for Health and Ageing and to the Parliamentary Secretary for Health. The recommendations range from the need for comprehensive education and awareness to educating government departments, the need for positive employment initiatives and looking at issues surrounding travel. One that I support quite strongly is a national health survey to provide accurate information on the data concerning the incidence and treatment of epilepsy. There are also recommendations on greater research, better training for doctors and support for carers. We touched on transport issues and a greater effort to demystify what epilepsy is and how it should be treated. I recommend the report to the House and I thank everybody that was involved, including my parliamentary colleagues Senator Humphries, Damian Hale and Mark Coulton. I seek leave to table the report. (Time expired) Leave granted. MAIN COMMITTEE Centrelink Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (9.48 am)-I wish to raise the concern of a constituent of mine in relation to current Centrelink office operating procedures. He and his elderly father-in-law were trying to use the services at Centrelink in Fremantle. He became frustrated with the procedures they faced and contacted my office. The gentleman was very concerned that, especially, elderly people have to stand and wait for a long time in queues just to get a ticket to sit down and wait some more. This is not the first such complaint that I have received. My office has received calls from people actually in the queue at Centrelink venting and voicing their sheer frustration at the length of time they have spent in the queue. It is also worth noting that some people are required to visit Centrelink offices more regularly than others or need to return to provide further documentation only to be faced with long queues and long waits. The constituent I mentioned said the system in Medicare was much better in that you got a ticket immediately and then were able to sit and wait instead of standing for long periods at a time. I wrote to the Minister for Human Services expressing my constituent’s concerns and outlining the reasons behind his complaint. The minister replied, saying that ticketing machines were used in the past but were discontinued because the preference of customers was ‘to be addressed by name rather than a number’. The minister continued, stating that there were various procedures in place to assist managing queues. My constituent and his father remain unconvinced. They told me that this sort of reasoning for such a necessary treatment of our most needy citizens is wrong and should not be tolerated. Also, if these reasons are valid, why does it not apply to a similar situation in Medicare offices? People do not seem in the least offended by having a number called out there. Many government departments and businesses use ticketing systems with provision for people to sit down and wait. This method is especially important and beneficial for those Centrelink customers who are elderly, disabled, unwell or who have small children with them. Despite the advances in technology mentioned by the minister, I would urge him to rethink the use of ticketing machines in Centrelink offices and consider the benefit that many Australians would receive by streamlining this Centrelink procedure. Lowe Electorate: Visually Impaired Electors Special Minister of State, Senator the Honourable Joe Ludwig, concerning blind and visually impaired electors. I am very pleased that our government yesterday introduced the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Close of Rolls and Other Measures) Bill 2010 providing blind and visually impaired electors the legal option of casting a secret vote. These amendments will ensure that arrangements can be put in place before the next election while longer term solutions are prepared. Importantly, it is part of our government’s response to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ratified in 2008. Under article 29, the convention states: ... Parties shall guarantee to persons with disabilities political rights and the opportunity to enjoy them on an equal basis with others ... In 2004, I first raised my concerns in this place that visually impaired electors did not have the right to cast a vote in secret, and I called on the government and the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to investigate this matter and provide the necessary technology and a system that would realise this goal.

251,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (9.51 Am),"This morning I welcome the recent initiatives by thebut in 2009 the electoral matters committee deputy chairman noted that the electronic trial did not increase participation levels enough to make the cost worthwhile. A secret ballot is a democratic right in Australia and I am pleased that the Special Minister of State has ensured that the Rudd government will provide a means to uphold this principle for our visually impaired citizens and that we continue to work to fulfil our obligation under the United Nations convention. In my electorate of Lowe, I am proud to host two wonderful organisations that provide invaluable support and resources for the visually impaired. The head office of Vision Australia is located in Enfield and the Association of Blind Citizens of New South Wales is located in Burwood. I know that their members deserve our attention in this place to ensure that we continue to work towards voting equality. I know that our government and in particular the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’s Services, the Hon. Bill Shorten, have been working tirelessly on the National Disability Strategy, which aims to improve the lives of people with a disability. I commend both the Special Minister of State and the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’s Services for their efforts and I look forward to further improvements for the benefit of Australians with a disability, as well as their families and carers. Gilmore Electorate: Bella Gilbertson gong and delivered what I considered to be a very impressive speech to the Gerringong Lions Club. She attends Kiama High School, and I would like to share her words with you: I want to live in a peaceful world. I want to hear about our leaders agreeing, on the news. I want to see something being done about global warming, rather than just being a topic which will just get talked about and occasionally act as a form of leverage or accusation. Barack Obama, President of the United States, once stated that change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we’ve been waiting for; we are the change that we seek. The world has recently adopted this position of being in the process of alteration. Whether this is just a facade or for real is yet to be revealed. Personally, being an optimist, I believe that the next few years will unleash a somewhat dramatic difference to what the world has been subject to throughout the past decade. Maybe I’ll be proven wrong. Maybe all the promises that we’ve been fed throughout those in power are meaningless words, a broken vow just to get to a high place of authority. Yet, why do we need our world leaders, prime ministers and presidents alike, to create the pathway which we will obediently follow? Why don’t we create our own pathways, off the track, leading to where we believe the right decision lies. As a seventeen year old, lucky enough to be a school captain I’ve met many strong and promising peers, and through these experiences I really do believe the key to the door of change rests within the children of today, the leaders of tomorrow. We, as the youth are provided with opportunities to become what we want; what we are willing to work for and where our skills and capabilities lie. Is this an opportunity wasted? HereI am thinking that I really don’t really take much time to appreciate that I’m provided with: an opportunity to make a difference. I’m able to question my place and what society asks of me. Able to present my views on what’s right and wrong and hope people listen. And I’m able to dream of that peaceful society. MAIN COMMITTEE",130,Constituency Statements
252,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (9.54 Am),"Bella Gilbertson is a young lady who lives in GerrinIt is a rarity for us to stop and think we are actually provided with an opportunity to create change. We can consider problems like greenhouse gas emissions, a form of polite conversation; something where we can meet most people halfway in. But world issues will only ever be talking points unless we do something to abolish them. Not in front of the cameras, not to gain points in a political hierarchy but genuinely to make the world a better place. So why aren’t we actually doing something about it? Rather than just waiting on someone else to do the work? Even now I can talk about the combustion of fossil fuels or why I believe regardless of whether it’s an actual issue or a false theory, we should still treat the environment with respect. I can fool myself into saying that I am creating change. By raising awareness I’m causing others to think and talk, which will lead to these people being ‘aware’. They will then let others know, who will then tell other people. Leaving us ultimately in an aware world … where we can talk about things? Speaking is all well and good. But let’s make the next move. For a journey of a thousand miles really does begin with that single step. An example of this journey whether it actually be a thousand miles or lets say one and a half kilometres can be taken from Glenn Cunningham. The 12 year old boy that was told by doctors that he would never walk again due to being the unlucky recipient of major burns. Twenty years later, this boy grown into a man runs the 1500 metre in the Olympics, and wins silver. Not the special Olympics, the actual Olympics. So whether we are working to change ourselves, the environment or the world. There is nothing stopping us from taking that one step SoI will. (Time expired) Holt Electorate: Christians Helping in Primary Schools retary for Trade) (9.57 am)-I would like to take the time today to pay tribute to an organisation in Melbourne’s south-east that I have worked with in the past and whose director I had the opportunity to meet with again last month. Christians Helping in Primary Schools, or lessly for young kids who have had a tough time. Wieckmann, often known as ‘Captain Eric’. Eric was awarded the Ministry to Children children’s worker of the year in 2000 and won Citizen of the Year for the City of Casey in 2005. Eric has been working with kids for over 20 years and each year works with some 10,000 children in Australia and overseas. In my immediate region there are well over 60 schools, and CHIPS aims to help children in as many of these schools as possible. One of the most impressive things about Eric is that he is constantly trying to find new ways to help members of the community. He often speaks at school speech nights, leaders’ retreats and seminars. As an example, CHIPS’ response to the devastation of the Black Saturday bushfires showed this organisation helps those in need. CHIPS staff and volunteers directly contributed by conducting survivors’ retreats, school seminars in Warragul and Drouin, financial assistance to Casey victims, camps for children and memorial services at Glen Crombie and Jindivick. MAIN COMMITTEE",131,Constituency Statements
253,Mr Byrne (Holt,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary SecOn an ongoing basis, CHIPS provides seminars for students, teachers and parents; counselling and welfare services; camps and programs for children in crisis; and sailing programs for disadvantaged children in places like Lysterfield Lake. It organises a Christmas show that visits numerous schools and last year performed to over 3,000 students and, of course, runs other programs in schools. There is no shortage of kids in need who CHIPS in fact help, whether this be in the form of taking kids on a sailing camp-an opportunity that they may have never experienced beforeor just providing them with some much needed love and attention. Take the boy whose family forgot his birthday, so they threw him a party; or the girl who was suffering from depression or grief, so CHIPS waited through the pain with her till she felt some comfort; or even the young man who had his youth stolen from him, so CHIPS took him to a farm where he could let go of his inhibitions and play like any normal kid would. It is often the kids who have the toughest time in their lives who need looking out for, but the work that CHIPS does will help the ones who will help look out for each other. Too often, the work of organisations like CHIPS goes unrecognised. Employees and volunteers like Captain Eric do not pursue a career with organisations like CHIPS because they are seeking the fame and glory for doing so. I reckon this place is a great forum for recognising the efforts of those making the community a better place to live in. Today, accordingly, I am pleased to mention the great work of Eric Wieckmann and CHIPS in this place. 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded. (WEEKLY PAYMENTS) BILL 2010 Second Reading Debate resumed from 10 February, on motion by Ms Macklin: That this bill be now read a second time. vulnerable families in my electorate of Paterson. The Social Security and Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Weekly Payments) Bill 2010 will allow these families to access support payments twice a fortnight instead of once. It will be the responsibility of the secretary of the department to speak with the Centrelink customers to decide who needs weekly payments of social security, the family tax benefit and the baby bonus. The measures introduced through this bill will help families manage their weekly budget and will provide more timely payments for those struggling most. In particular the bill targets those who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. It will reduce the amount of time people have to wait for the next support payment when they have a particular need. According to figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, there were 3,500 recorded homeless people in New South Wales in 2006. In the Hunter there were more than 200, with 51 in Port Stephens alone. Some charities suggest this number is actually far greater and, to make matters worse, growing higher ever year. As reported by ABC Newcastle on 4 March 2009: An extra 7,600 people were made homeless in New South Wales last year, when interest rates and rents were at their height, but the State Government is expecting the figures to get worse. MAIN COMMITTEE",132,Chips Has Been Operating For Over 10 Years Now Which Is Testament To The Work Of Eric
254,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke),Order! In accordance with standing order,133,Social Security And Family Assistance Legislation Amendment
255,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (10.01 Am),"I rise today to give my support to the needy andThe latest figures released by the state’s Housing Department show around 22,500 people sought temporary accommodation in 2007-2008-an average increase of 643 people a month compared to the previous year. These numbers are simply devastating. I cannot begin to imagine what it must be like to be forced to spend a night on the street, with nowhere to turn to have a roof put over your head and no-one to help keep your family safe and warm. This is a scary reality for far too many people, and the Rudd Labor government needs to do more to help the needy in our community. Our Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, promised to do more. In fact, in 2008 he promised to halve the homeless rate by 2020. But, as the figures I have mentioned show, homelessness so far has only increased. The Prime Minister has conceded this himself. Unless something changes-and changes soon-our number of homeless will only skyrocket further. I say this because the cost of living, which our Prime Minister also promised to fix, has spiralled out of control. If families cannot afford to eat, cannot afford to drive and cannot afford child care while they go off to work then chances are they will be forced onto the street. Therefore, we absolutely cannot afford this continuum of broken promises from Prime Minister Rudd. Let us consider the rising cost of living in Australia with a look at grocery prices. The Rudd Labor government promised to put downward pressure on food costs but, after wasting more than $7 million on failed GROCERYchoice websites, bills have increased. The Daily Telegraph reported on 4 February this year: months. Figures released yesterday show families were slugged far more for meat, fruit and vegetables, beer and various other grocery items in the three months to Christmas, compared with the three months to September. Prime Minister Rudd’s living costs broken promise No. 1: groceries. Now let us move on to power. First Paterson families copped a 20 per cent rise in electricity bills in July 2009. Then the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal released its draft price report on 15 December. This report states that power bills will rise by up to 62 per cent by 2013. That is right-in just three years we could see prices increase by around $900 a year for the average household. According to IPART almost half of this price rise is to pay for the Rudd Labor government’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, Prime Minister Rudd’s tax on everything, which will do absolutely nothing for the environment. It makes a mockery of his promise to make things cheaper. Prime Minister Rudd’s living costs broken promise No. 2: electricity I will move on to fuel costs. In 2007 opposition leader Rudd said that the Howard government had: … lost touch with working families under financial pressure, not just from interest rates, not just from rising rents, but grocery and petrol prices … He suggested that he as Prime Minister would do something to fix this. But, after a failed and very costly Fuelwatch system, nothing has been delivered. As my constituent Jeff wrote online in January: Today… I paid 132.9 cents for E10 at … Nelson Bay… Your ave Sydney price 120.9 MAIN COMMITTEE I wrote to the Rudd Labor government’s minister, Dr Emerson, on behalf of Jeff last year, but to date he still has not replied. Meanwhile drivers in my electorate are still being forced to pay higher than average prices and a few petrol stations are being monitored by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The Australian Institute of Petroleum website also shows how families in my electorate are paying higher prices for fuel. According to its figures for Forster, locals were paying 116c a litre in May last year, while now they are paying 128c per litre. That is a rise of more than 10c per litre. Meanwhile, to add further insult, Sydney figures show city drivers paid just 120c per litre on average last month. Paterson is less than two hours up the highway from Sydney, yet we pay 10c per litre more. Here we have Prime Minister Rudd’s living costs broken promise No. 3: petrol. Finally, let us look at child care, where the Prime Minister has again been exposed as all talk and no action. A report in the Daily Telegraph on 23 January revealed how the Rudd Labor government changes to childcare standards will see parents slugged up to $40 extra per day or $200 a week. Seventy-nine per cent, or around four out of five, regional childcare centres have admitted that they will be forced to increase charges under the plan, yet nothing has been done to alleviate the problem. Child care is often relied upon by parents who go off to work and need a safe, trustworthy and secure place to leave their children. This service needs to be affordable for working mothers and fathers. Prime Minister Rudd’s living costs broken promise No. 4: child care. I could go on to examples 5, 6, 7-the list is long. However, my point is already clear: Prime Minister Rudd needs to start delivering on his promise and take some real action to help families in Paterson and indeed across Australia afford basic costs. If he does not do so, more and more families in my electorate will be forced to seek help and could end up without a home. The Social Security and Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Weekly Payments) Bill 2010 is a positive step towards helping those who are vulnerable. But we must see even more action to stop families struggling in the first place. We must have a multipronged approach to really tackle this problem and to make a change. Allow me to read an article from one of my local newspapers, the Maitland Mercury. On 19 February, an article by Emma Swain read: Maitland’s Samaritans emergency relief centre is almost out of food and vouchers as an unprecedented number of residents face financial crisis. The Samaritans’ 11 emergency relief centres have nearly exhausted all food, grocery and electricity vouchers with little sign of replenishment. Typically February is a slower month for the Hunter-based charity giant, but this year is proving to be an exception with demand for vouchers constant since Christmas. In December 2009, the Maitland relief centre in East Maitland, recorded its busiest month in 17 years. ‘I can’t remember a time where we have had nothing to offer those seeking assistance,’ Samaritans chief executive officer Cec Shevels said. ‘If the next six months continue with the same trends in emergency relief we will have a 40 per cent increase on last year.’ Samaritans have assisted 3011 individuals and families through emergency relief along with 4000 dependent children in the past three months. About 30 per cent of these people had not sought Samaritans’ assistance in the past. MAIN COMMITTEE ‘It’s the basic things that are pushing people to crisis point,” Mr Shevels said. ‘Those on a low income are pushed to the limit and rises in bills such as electricity and water along with skyrocketing rental payments, build up over a period of time to a point when something has to give. Often it is food on the table, so we always send people away with food from the pantry or vouchers to buy food items but with our allocation exhausted, we’ve got nothing left to give those in crisis.’ What Mr Shevels explains here is that a rising number of families are under pressure because of the added living costs under this Rudd Labor government. These people, who have never struggled before and who suddenly have to rely on government assistance, may need the more flexible support payments that this bill delivers. Mr Shevels also demonstrates the amazing work done by volunteers and groups in the Paterson community. These people, who number in their thousands, give of their time to support our region’s most vulnerable, and I cannot thank them enough for their efforts. They are often the last resort for people who have nowhere else to turn, and they do a wonderful job in helping people financially, physically and emotionally. Another example in my electorate is the Raymond Terrace Neighbourhood Centre. This centre is headed by Colleen Whittle and runs entirely on a not-for-profit basis. It offers a drop-in centre, financial assistance, counselling, advocacy and referral, as well as crisis accommodation. The centre allows people to get help in a caring environment without discrimination and has helped many people who would otherwise have ended up on our streets. Unfortunately, because there is such demand on welfare services at the moment, support services simply cannot cope. As noted in the article from the Maitland Mercury, not-for-profit groups are running out of supplies, because there is such an overwhelming demand. Today, I would ask anyone who can spare a donation, even in these tough times, to give what they can to local charities. I have seen the spirit of giving from so many of my constituents first hand, and I know what they are capable of. Many people are doing it tough. Many people are relying on government assistance. Many people are out on the streets, despite the Prime Minister’s promise to cut homelessness. This is simply not good enough. In real terms, across the Paterson electorate, more than 20,000 people relied on the family tax benefit last year to run their homes and support their children. It is vital that they are looked after. On top of this, more than 1,400 baby bonus payments were made in the 2007-08 financial year so that parents could provide the essentials to their babies. Weekly payments would help many of these people manage their family budgets and stop them becoming homeless. To date, there has been little action on homelessness from the Rudd Labor government. The Prime Minister announced the boost to the Personal Helpers and Mentors Program, an initiative first announced in 2006 by then Prime Minister John Howard. However, Prime Minister Rudd has committed just $10 million to this program. Compare this to the $250 million he recently gave commercial television station operators or the $200 million that he has wasted on the inflated and disastrous insulation rebates-not to mention the $50 million about to be spent to rectify it. It appears awfully inadequate, especially for those Australians who will sleep tonight on benches, in parks and on the street. The Social Security and Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Weekly Payments) Bill 2010 is a bill to help struggling families and to prevent at risk people becoming homeless. MAIN COMMITTEE It gives more flexibility to the social security system and can help people balance their weekly budgets by reducing the time between payments. Trained professionals will decide who needs this flexibility and for how long. However, the Rudd Labor government needs to do more to stop the rising cost of living which is forcing people out of their homes. Prime Minister Rudd promised to do so; he must deliver. I clearly remember his election commitment to apply ‘downward pressure on prices’. I also remember his promise that the buck would stop with him. Well, Prime Minister Rudd, it is time for this downward pressure to begin, because prices are only headed up and up. Finally, I would urge anyone who has the time to volunteer to help those vulnerable people in our community. More can be done to make sure everyone in our community has a place to call home, and the Rudd Labor government must make this a priority. Assistance Legislation Amendment (Weekly Payments) Bill 2010. The background to this is the government’s strong commitment to reducing homelessness. Homelessness is a curse in our society. It is not a choice as the opposition leader infamously said recently; it is often the result of violence in the home, sexual abuse, alcohol and gambling addiction, personal circumstances, familial circumstances and employment circumstances. Young people who grow up in homes where they are afflicted by these problems are more likely to repeat the cycle of homelessness and trouble. That results in criminal activity and on many occasions it results in low educational attainment and achievement, lack of employment skills, lack of productivity in the workplace and a more harsh, brutal and unfair society. One wonders what the Howard coalition government thought about homelessness in their nearly 12 years on the treasury bench. Perhaps they were going to address the issue in their 13th, 14th or 15th year of office. Certainly, when I listened to the member for Paterson, I heard nothing about the achievements of the Howard government and heard nothing about what a coalition government under the current Leader of the Opposition would do in relation to homelessness. There was much complaint, much whingeing, much carping and much aggravation but no solutions to the problems and little bipartisanship. It really is quite sad that recently in the Sydney Morning Herald the opposition leader, dealing with this issue of homelessness-and that is what this legislation before the House is about-had this to say in relation to the issue of homelessness: But we just can’t stop people from being homeless if that’s their choice or if their situation is such that it is just impossible to look after them under certain circumstances so I would rephrase a commitment like that. It is typical of those opposite, who think homelessness is a matter of choice. For them it is all a matter of choice. Sadly, homelessness is not the fault of so many people. Women and children find themselves in terrible situations. On any given night in this country there are about 105,000 people who are homeless-about 19 per cent in crisis accommodation, about 20 per cent in insecure accommodation, boarding houses and the like, about 45 per cent will be staying temporarily with friends or relatives, and about 16 per cent will be sleeping rough on the street. Tragically, about 17 per cent of those people are Indigenous. Homelessness is worse amongst our Indigenous brothers and sisters. This is what the census says. This is what the facts say. And it did not all happen on 24 November 2007. It happened, so much, on the watch MAIN COMMITTEE",133,Social Security And Family Assistance Legislation Amendment
256,Mr Neumann (Blair) (10.15 Am),"I speak in support of the Social Security and Familyof the previous government. In fact, St Vincent de Paul stated in its report, Don’t dream: it’s over, that the number of families with children which were seeking assistance from homelessness services had increased by 30 per cent over the past five years. So let’s not kid ourselves by coming into this place and claiming that it is all the fault of the Rudd Labor government. The background to this is that we made an election commitment to do something about homelessness. In January 2008 the Prime Minister and the Minister for Housing, the Hon. Tanya Plibersek, announced the development of a comprehensive long-term plan to tackle homelessness. A steering committee was appointed and in May 2008 a green paper on homelessness was released entitled Which way home? A new approach to homelessness. There was much public discussion, which was sought across all states during May and June 2008. More than 1,200 people attended 13 consultations and almost 600 written submissions were received. More than 300 people who were homeless expressed their views. As a result of that, further developments took place and the government announced a white paper called The road home: a national approach to reducing homelessness. That was released in December 2008. Part of our strategy to address the issue of homelessness is to bring forward legislation like this. I will address some of the other issues about what the government is doing. I did not intend to make a very partisan speech, but the previous speaker has goaded and prodded me into doing so. The legislation that is before the House introduces weekly payments of social security periodic payments, family tax benefit and baby bonus for a certain class of persons. People have the option, having been identified by Centrelink as potentially vulnerable people, to receive their payments in a way which will help them manage their bills better. Sadly, some people who are homeless are not well educated, do not have the skills and capacity to manage their money as they ought and need help. That is what Centrelink is there to do: give them assistance to meet their needs in terms of food, rent and essential services. Paying the money weekly is more likely to assist people than paying money on a fortnightly, monthly or three-monthly basis. The legislation before us assists those people who lack capacity and gives them the certainty of knowing that they will have money on a weekly basis. For many of these people it is the necessities of life that they need; they have little access to money for recreation or pleasure. They just need a helping hand to get through and extract themselves from their positions of vulnerability and distress. The total amount paid to social security and family assistance customers will be the same. It is about the delivery of assistance. So the legislation is a fair piece of legislation; it gives a helping hand to those in distress. We believe we need to help not just those who are homeless but those who are vulnerable in our society or at risk of being vulnerable. Tragically, according to the figures, more than 12,000 children last night were homeless or at risk. We cannot allow this to happen. It is a national tragedy in one of the wealthiest countries in the world. Tragically, the coalition did little to address the issue during its tenure as government. As a result of the white paper the Australian government, in partnership with the states and territories, has committed $1.2 billion to address homelessness over the next four years. This is a 55 per cent increase in funding-real money on the table. It is a demonstration of the commitment of the Rudd Labor government to helping those in distress, in disadvantage and in difficulty. It will enable new MAIN COMMITTEE support services to be created for people who are homeless and it is about creating new houses as well. When it comes to social housing-which is so critical and which the previous government had an appalling record on-money is being poured into my electorate, the federal electorate of Blair. I have had many discussions over the years with housing authorities in Queensland and you only have to hear the words of the Hon. Robert Schwarten, who was a long-term minister for housing in Queensland, to realise that the previous government, the Howard government, did little in the area of public housing. In fact, it was quite amenable to ripping the heart out of public housing in this country. In my electorate alone, under the Social Housing Initiative, we are seeing close to $32 million put into the creation of new dwellings, and about $1.2 million put into repairs to and maintenance of existing dwellings. We have also seen-to assist our defence personnelanother 111 houses being built in the Ipswich area. This is real money. Allied with our initiative to address homelessness, on 3 February 2009 we released our Nation Building and Jobs Plan-and the above is the evidence in my electorate of the money we are putting into addressing homelessness. We are putting in $6.4 billion to build 20,000 new public and community housing dwellings across the country. There are many great communitarians in my electorate who are at the coalface of dealing with people who are vulnerable, and I want to pay tribute to them. They will be dealing with the people who will be able to avail themselves of the benefits of weekly payments. I want to pay tribute to Pastor Fred Muys from the Rivers of Life Christian Church for his ministry through Harvest Rain Christian Care. That particular church is a small church with a shopfront in Brisbane Street in Ipswich. They deliver hundreds of food parcels every week. They run literacy classes to help people from non-English-speaking backgrounds to gain literacy and greater employment skills. They have created a great enterprise there on the grounds of the old Tivoli drive-in, and created many opportunities and training facilities for our young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Pastor Fred Muys and his great team of workers are to be commended. They will see the benefits in the lives of people who will be the recipients of weekly payments. I want to pay tribute to my own church, Ipswich Baptist Church, for its 241 Ministries, located right across from the church’s old site. For a long time, that church ran community kitchens and also provided food parcels, and continues to do so. It gives counselling to people in central Ipswich who are suffering from homelessness, addiction and from other problems, of domestic and family violence. I want to pay tribute also to Ipswich Region Community Church, under the leadership of Pastor Mark Edwards, for that church’s assistance to and the partnership it has with Ipswich Baptist Church-putting on a psychologist to give psychological services and counselling to those people who attend at the 241 Ministries in Brisbane Street, Ipswich. I want to thank Bianca Law from the Booval Community Service for the great work she does, in particular, and the community service for the great work they do, for those families in distress. I have been round with Bianca to visit families in Ipswich who have lost jobs and, as a result, are facing hardship. I have seen the despair, humiliation and not just the anger but the sadness in the eyes of men and women who have fallen into circumstances where they never MAIN COMMITTEE thought they would go. Bianca and her team at Booval Community Service have done great work there. I want to thank also David Martin, who has chaired for a long time ICYS, which is a youth community service in Ipswich that has been around almost forever. The service has done great work in dealing with people who have suffered from disadvantage, particularly young families. Hannah’s House, run by the Pentecostal churches in Ipswich, particularly the Assemblies of God, deals with young women who have been forced out of their homes as a result of violence, drunkenness or other parental misbehaviour. They are all suffering challenge also. All of these great services have done great work. They will see the benefit of this legislation. I want to pay tribute to all these local people but also thank them for what they are doing. They work closely with Centrelink, with the 90 Centrelink community engagement officers that the Rudd government employed to deal with the issues of homelessness and the risk of homelessness. Those 90 Centrelink community engagement officers help people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, particularly by connecting them with mental health services, hostels, boarding houses, drug and alcohol rehabilitation services and emergency accommodation. We are committed to improving the delivery services for all Australians and to making sure that the reform in this legislation will target vulnerable Australians who find it difficult to budget. Having no money in your wallet, in your household, in your coffers at the end of a fortnight is extraordinarily difficult. Thousands and thousands of Australians find themselves in that situation every night, every week and every fortnight. I support this legislation because it will help struggling families-women in particular, children in particular-to put a roof over their heads, to put food in their bellies and to put clothes on their backs. This is good legislation. It is part of the matrix and the fabric of what the Rudd government is doing to assist the vulnerable in our community. It is a good initiative, it is a Labor initiative and I commend the legislation to the House. lation Amendment (Weekly Payments) Bill 2010 enables weekly payments for certain members of a class of persons who receive a social security periodic payment, family tax benefit or the baby bonus. It is intended to target people who are assessed as being vulnerable, such as those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. This measure was foreshadowed in the homelessness white paper, The road home: a national approach to reducing homelessness, which was released in 2008. The amendments allow the secretary of the department to identify at-risk individuals, generally by discussion with them, who may benefit from weekly rather than fortnightly payments. The class of persons from whom the individuals might be drawn will be determined by a legislative instrument to be made by the minister. I also note that a trial of this scheme with around 1,700 disadvantaged welfare recipients was conducted in 69 Centrelink customer service centres by the then Department of Employment and Workplace Relations and Centrelink from October 2005 to April 2006-a period of time in which I was one of the responsible ministers in the department’s concerned. It has been made abundantly clear in the bill that the government has no intention of weekly payments becoming a mainstream measure, reserving it for those who are regarded as highly disadvantaged and at risk of becoming homeless. The coalition support this bill and support action that will help people who are regrettably living on the streets move into more permanent MAIN COMMITTEE",137,Grocery Prices Have Soared With The Cost Of A Standard Basket Of Goods Rising By About $10 In Three
257,Mr Andrews (Menzies) (10.32 Am),"The Social Security and Family Assistance Legisaccommodation. We believe that, in the process of taking people from homelessness to the home, we give people the tools to live and to move towards independence. The Prime Minister’s pledge to halve homelessness by 2020 is unrealistic, especially when we have a government that is more focused on political outcomes than on real outcomes on homelessness. For example, the Prime Minister has recently announced additional funding for the Personal Helpers and Mentors Program which, on the government’s own projections, is the equivalent of only around $33 per homeless person per year. It is not even enough to buy a homeless person a roof over their head and a meal for one night, much less for a year. This is a token commitment which makes a mockery of any serious plans to halve homelessness by 2020. Even the Prime Minister and the Minister for Housing have now conceded that the rate of homelessness has risen since this pledge was made. Indeed, in a recent report in the Australian newspaper entitled ‘Kevin Rudd losing the fight on homeless’ a number of welfare agencies that are closely involved in addressing the issue of homeless people in a very practical and personal way on a daily basis indicated that, in their estimation, even though official statistics are yet to come out, homelessness has risen in Australia since the Prime Minister made this pledge. I know, from speaking to welfare organisations in my own electorateto Doncare, for example-that this is an issue which is of great concern to them, as it is to similar organisations right throughout the country. We believe that the Prime Minister must explain why we should take his promise any more seriously than his promise to fix hospitals or to put a computer on every secondary student’s desk or to turn back the illegal boat arrivals. There is a major problem and it is, as the Prime Minister said, a national obscenity. But it is wrong to promise dramatic improvements without the architecture to actually deliver those improvements. Remember Bob Hawke’s empty promise: ‘No child will live in poverty by 1990.’ It would be a tragedy for homeless people in Australia if that promise, full of the usual hyperbole that we get from the Prime Minister, cannot be achieved and indeed if the architecture is not in place to realistically have a chance of delivering upon that promise. As I said, early indications are that things have gotten worse, not better, since the promise was made. The government’s failure to deal with the housing affordability crisis, which the Prime Minister described as the ‘ultimate barbecue stopper,’ places enormous pressure on all other areas of the housing market. Less affordable housing means more stress on private rentals, which means more stress on social housing, which, in turn, means more people on the streets who cannot get into the market whatsoever. This is at the base of the problem that we are dealing with. Homelessness, if you like, is at the end of the line. It is the problems further up the line in terms of housing affordability and availability across this country that have tragic consequences for those who are homeless around this nation. As I said, the coalition does not oppose this measure. It believes it is a good measure that will assist many who are at risk of homelessness to better balance their budget. It is an important measure, but it needs to be supplemented with the necessary social support and other measures to ensure that what has been promised is indeed delivered to the Australian people. Ms HALL (Shortland) (10.38 am)-In making my contribution to this debate on the Social Security and Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Weekly Payments) Bill 2010 I am pleased to hear that the opposition will not oppose this measure. Although, in listening to the previous speaker, the member for Menzies, I am not 100 per cent convinced that, when it MAIN COMMITTEE comes to the crunch, they will not oppose this measure just for the sake of opposition. We on this side of the House have become very familiar with the fact that the opposition, under Tony Abbott, will oppose absolutely every piece of legislation that comes before the House. It does not surprise me that speakers on the other side have tried to highlight negative aspects of homelessness and programs designed to address homelessness. It is interesting that this legislation has been developed after a series of trials. I should state at the outset of my contribution that this bill makes weekly payments available to certain vulnerable customers of Centrelink or people who are homeless. The bill also makes a small number of technical corrections which are unrelated to the main part of the bill. As I was saying, this legislation has been developed from previously conducted trials that showed that weekly payments were beneficial to a number of people who receive welfare and are struggling, for various reasons, to maintain a budget over the fortnightly period. One of those trials was in the town camps in Alice Springs. The trials were carried out from September 2001 to March 2003 as part of a broader trial of culturally sensitive banking and financial services in the town camp communities. These trials showed that there was some benefit in the weekly payments. At that time they were funded through FaCSIA, and the aim of them was to break the ‘feast and famine’ cycle. Siobhan McDonnell, a former visiting fellow at the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research, studied the results of this trial, and she found that there was indeed some benefit to be obtained from providing weekly payments. There was also another trial that took place within the broader community. As with the town camp trial that I have already referred to, it was found that there were some benefits associated with weekly payments. The trials sought to determine the costs and benefits of weekly payment arrangements both for the people who were taking part in the trial and for other stakeholders. They included Centrelink, social workers, support services that catered for the needs of disadvantaged welfare recipients, and Centrelink staff who had to deal with many of the people that were constantly requesting advances or urgent payments because they were unable to manage receiving their payments fortnightly. The results of these trials support the extension of the scheme. Michael Raper from the National Welfare Rights Network, based on feedback provided to him by community groups, said that the weekly payment trial worked well for very vulnerable clients and that they had been able to turn their lives around, with improved health and personal outcomes, more stable accommodation and reduced costs for and demands on the health and legal services. So, when you look at it from the background of the trials that were conducted by the Howard government and that I suspect members on the other side of this House supported, you would have to wonder why we have had some of the contributions to the debate we have had today. Weekly payments on their own will not be sufficient to turn around the lives of people who are suffering severe disadvantage. There will need to be programs that run in conjunction with the weekly payments scheme-programs that help people get their finances in order and help them with daily living skills and with problems that they may have in their lives at that particular time. One of the major problems faced by people who are struggling with the fortnightly payments is homelessness, and we have heard homelessness mentioned this morning on a couple of occasions. The member for Blair stated-and it is common knowledge-that on any one MAIN COMMITTEE night there are 105,000 people in Australia who are homeless. That is why the Rudd government is investing $1.2 billion in trying to turn around and address the issue of homelessness. In Shortland electorate there are homeless people, but quite often those homeless people are hidden because they move on a daily basis from home to home to home. You do not have many visual pictures of people sleeping on the streets, but you have many people who are unable to find accommodation. Under the Howard government money that was invested in social housing was ripped away from the states. One of the actions of the Rudd government that I am very proud of is that of massively increasing money to the states to build social housing. In Shortland electorate there are 2,000 people on the eastern side of Lake Macquarie and in Wyong shire waiting for social housing. The person who has been on the waiting list the longest has been on it for 18 years-that is, 18 years waiting for social housing. I think that that is unconscionable; I do not think it is good enough. I do not think it is good enough that, on a daily basis, we have people in Shortland electorate sleeping in their cars; I do not think it is good enough that, on a daily basis, we have families moving from house to house to house; I do not think it is good enough that we have families who are forced to live in tents; and I do not think it is good enough that, for a very long period of time, the issue of homelessness was ignored and the previous government failed to act to address the need. It is little wonder when you hear the Leader of the Opposition make statements such as the one in Perth in midFebruary when he said that you cannot stop homelessness, basically attributing it to the fault of the individual and implying that people choose to be homeless. That shows what a sheltered life the Leader of the Opposition has led. It shows that he has never really been faced with true adversity in his life. It is very easy to make those statements when you come from a very privileged background, when you have been offered the best of education-attended private schools and gone to university-and your life has flowed along smoothly. I have news for the Leader of the Opposition: anyone can become homeless, and we do need to have in place the proper support for people who are homeless. I was also most disappointed when I read a report in the newspaper about a Liberal party forum, a get-together, here in Canberra, where everyone sat down and tossed around a few ideas. The Leader of the Opposition had some very strong thoughts on welfare and welfare payments. Basically, he felt that welfare payments to disadvantaged people were not something to be guaranteed universally-that every person who received a welfare payment should have to work for that welfare payment and that it was a privilege, not a right, to receive a welfare payment. Taking that a step further, you come to the conclusion that there will be a massive increase in the number of people that are homeless and that Australia will move away from what I have always been proud of as an Australian: the ideal that every Australian will be supported in their time of need and that as a nation we can afford to look after those people that are more disadvantaged than others. We do this, as I said, through social housing and through the strategies that have been put in place in relation to housing. We do it through ensuring that there are payments in place for people when they are disadvantaged. The weekly payment scheme will be a scheme that will really benefit those people most disadvantaged in the community. It will enable the family tax benefit to be paid on a weekly basis and it will allow for the baby and social security periodic payments to be paid on a MAIN COMMITTEE weekly basis. There is great interest in the community in relation to this particular piece of legislation. I received a phone call from the social work department at the Mater hospital in the Hunter asking about this information. They had identified that this would be a really good program to assist those people they were dealing with who have trouble handling their finances. I strongly support this piece of legislation that we have before us today. I condemn the Leader of the Opposition for the statements he has made about homelessness. I would like him to read the white paper, The road home: a national approach to reducing homelessness. I would like him to open up his mind and to be a little bit more compassionate. I would like the members on the other side of this House to give real thought to the issues that surround the most disadvantaged people in our community. It is more than paying lip-service to disadvantage. It is more than standing up and attributing increases in homelessness to increases in prices, trying to play the blame game, trying to trivialise the issue, because that is what they are doing. In the whole time they were in power the Howard government did nothing, absolutely nothing, to address homelessness. They did nothing whatsoever to improve the lives of those people that are most disadvantaged. Instead, they made it harder for people who were homeless to access their social security payments. They made it harder for people who were most disadvantaged to get their lives together, to get their lives back on track and to be able to access the services that were available in the community. It was under the Howard government that so many people were breached and a number of those people that were breached suffered severe financial hardship. Those people were often homeless and if they were not homeless the actions of the Howard government of the time led to them become homeless. This is a very, very constructive piece of legislation. It will help the most disadvantaged people in our community. This, coupled with the right sort of support programs, will help people turn their lives around. Assistance Legislation Amendment (Weekly Payments) Bill 2010. This bill enables weekly payments to be made to a class of persons who receive social security periodic payments, family tax benefit or the baby bonus. It is aimed at those people who are assessed as being vulnerable, such as those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. Historically, most welfare and family assistance payments have been made in Australia on a fortnightly cycle. This has been sufficient for most but not all recipients. In particular, some people suffering disadvantage due to homelessness, mental health issues, alcohol or substance abuse conditions are unable to organise a budget-not only over a fortnightly period but sometimes over any period at all. Many of these vulnerable people may spend their entire fortnightly payment in only a few days or, as circumstances have been related to me, in one day. The knock-on effect is that food and shelter may then be unaffordable for the remaining days of the fortnight, leading to health and accommodation problems for those affected and their families. There have been trials of weekly payments for welfare recipients in the past which, by published accounts, have been quite successful. As the member for Shortland mentioned only a few minutes ago, the first of these trials were started back in 2001 in Alice Springs town camps. Although that trial ran through until 2003, it was not stand-alone; there was a broader package that went with it of assistance for people in those town camps, including culturally MAIN COMMITTEE",140,Grocery Prices Have Soared With The Cost Of A Standard Basket Of Goods Rising By About $10 In Three
258,Mr Symon (Deakin) (10.54 Am),"I speak in support of the Social Security and Familysensitive banking and financial services. That trial was funded by the then Department of Family and Community Services, and it was intended to address the problems associated with the feast and famine cycle that had accompanied fortnightly payments for some recipients. A report on the trial, titled Chasing the money story: an evaluation of the Tangentyere bank pilot project and its relevance to Indigenous communities in Central Australia, was undertaken by Siobhan McDonnell, a former visiting fellow at the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research. This report was generally supportive of the use of weekly payments but also noted some problems with the implementation. These problems included problems with Centrelink putting the weekly payment system in place and people choosing to leave the trial and revert to fortnightly payments, as weekly payments were sometimes insufficient to allow them to make purchases of large or highly priced items. However, the report found the weekly payments were helpful to some people, especially if additional services were provided as well and that they were worth making more widely available. In particular, though, the report found that if weekly payments were to be successful then they should be of a voluntary nature. A broader trial was then undertaken in 2005, again by the then Department of Family and Community Services. It ran through until 2006. This trial provided for the option of weekly payments to disadvantaged welfare recipients at 69 Centrelink customer service centres, with the majority of those being in South Australia and Western Australia. Around 1,700 recipients signed up for involvement in this larger trial, with most of them being paid a disability support pension and suffering from some form of mental illness. This trial also offered access to other support services to assist in stabilising clients’ circumstances so was not limited to weekly payments as a form of assistance. The then President of the National Welfare Rights Network, Michael Raper, was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on 7 April 2006 as saying that as a result of the weekly payments trial: … very vulnerable clients have been able to turn their lives around with improved health and personal outcomes, more stable accommodation and reduced costs in terms of demands on the health and legal systems. Given the reported success of the trial, Michael Raper was ‘at a loss as to why it was being wound up’. As I understand it, the trial was only undertaken on a limited basis, mainly due to legislative restrictions at the time. Therefore, this bill before the House provides for vulnerable income support recipients to receive weekly payments through two part payments in respect of their 14-day instalment period, thus fixing up the legislative problems of the previous trial. The effect is to treat the two part payments as though they were a single payment being paid at the end of the fortnightly instalment period. In December 2008, the Rudd government released the homelessness white paper titled The road home: a national approach to reducing homelessness. The intent of the white paper is to provide for a national plan of action on homelessness for the years leading up to 2020. Three strategies were identified in the report to tackle homelessness: a focus on early intervention in the provision of homelessness services; a need for increased responsiveness to and connectivity between homelessness services to achieve better outcomes in relation to sustainable housing whilst improving economic and social participation and reducing the level of homelessness; and moving homeless people quickly out of crisis accommodation and into stable housing along with the necessary support to ensure that homelessness does not become recurMAIN COMMITTEE rent. Contained within the first strategy was a recommendation for the weekly payment of income support. Weekly payments for vulnerable people will be voluntary under this bill, and Centrelink will be able to flag likely claimants who may need this support. Homelessness can happen to virtually anyone due to an unexpected change of circumstances. It happens right across society, and in many cases it does not matter which suburb you live in or your family circumstances. The census in 2006 revealed that 105,000 people were homeless on census night. A breakdown of the percentages showed 56 per cent were male; 21 per cent were between the ages of 12 and 18; 12 per cent were under the age of 12; 23 per cent were staying in boarding houses; 45 per cent were staying with friends and relatives; 16 per cent were sleeping rough; and 14 per cent were staying in accommodation provided by the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program. Of course, what the census did not include was the people who were not in the census, and I do not know how many people that is-probably no-one really does know the real figure. WhatI do know is that it is addition to that 105,000 that were actually recorded in the census. Nearly half of the 105,000 Australians who are homeless on a given night are under the age of 25, and more than 12,000 are children. As the white paper explained, homelessness can affect children, families and older people just as insidiously as single people who are in difficulty for whatever reason. Our Indigenous population is affected out of proportion to their numbers, and those with mental illness are often among the homeless, especially following the deinstitutionalisation of the mentally ill in the 1980s. The Rudd Labor government has already demonstrated commitment about how serious it is in dealing with the issue of homelessness with measures that provide an extra $1.1 billion to boost services for people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness and by increasing spending on homeless services by 55 per cent. There are measures such as an additional 80,000 social and affordable homes to the national housing stock, with 30,000 through the Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan and another 50,000 through the National Rental Affordability Scheme. Also, there is the investment of around $80 million in emergency relief and financial counselling services. In recent weeks we have seen the announcement of funding for both emergency relief and financial counselling in my electorate of Deakin, and I am happy to commend the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Jenny Macklin, for taking these vital measures to address these problems not only in Deakin but right across the country. Deakin covers the eastern suburbs in Melbourne, and some people have the perception that all is fine in what look like nice settled, stable suburbs. But I can certainly tell the House that we have a high incidence of homelessness in those suburbs. Sometimes it is hidden away, but you do not have to go very far to find evidence of it. You can go down to any of the local welfare services and they can tell you how many people on a daily basis they are dealing with and, even worse, how many people they have to turn away because they do not have the accommodation: it is not there. The Rudd Labor government is funding 41 specialist homelessness projects across our housing programs to provide more than 1,680 new units of accommodation. Centrelink also provides specialist support for homeless people; income support for those who are vulnerable, disadvantaged and socially excluded; and an indicator in its systems to identify homeless clients or clients who are at risk of homelessness. There is also the network MAIN COMMITTEE of community engagement officers to work with NGOs like drug and alcohol rehab services, mental health services, hostels, boarding houses, refuges and drop-in centres. Centrelink also provides counselling, access to Centrepay and other support programs, and referral to community services if required. I have two Centrelink offices that service my electorate. They are both staffed with wonderful people who really go out of their way to assist those who come in their doors. Sometimes I wonder how they manage to do it all in one day; they really do get through a lot of work. They do a great job out there, but local issues mean that they are often overwhelmed as well. It is a big issue that goes right across the country. I also note that the provision of weekly payments has been welcomed by Clare Martin, CEO of ACOSS, who said: their payments on a weekly, rather than fortnightly, basis … … … … Homeless people in particular can struggle to maintain a budget and often operate on a day-to-day basis rather than in fortnightly cycles. Giving people a choice to receive payments weekly will empower them to take control of their finances, minimise hardship and prevent people from slipping into homelessness. This proposal has also received support from Homelessness Australia, the national peak body working to prevent and respond to homelessness in Australia. The changes implemented in this bill are small for most of us, but they are very necessary and worthwhile measures that seek to reduce homelessness, and for those who are in that position these changes are not small; I suspect they will be rather large. As the white paper states: Investing in services to prevent and reduce homelessness delivers benefits not only to those vulnerable to homelessness but also to the entire community. I commend this bill to the House. tance Legislation Amendment (Weekly Payments) Bill 2010, I note the good work being done by an agency in my electorate called Goori House, headed up by John Close and supported ably by David Carson and Dr Bill Deacon. I also note the hostel and rehabilitation services that they offer to homeless people in my electorate and, in fact, the whole greater Brisbane area. Many of those homeless people are struggling with the demons of drugs and alcohol and are trying to find their way back by learning new skills in a residential setting that is now, I am pleased to say, back in vogue after a number of years when we believed that residential rehabilitation from drugs and alcohol was not cost effective. I am glad to see that over the last five years that has changed and that the benefits of centres like Goori are now recognised. Yesterday they opened the men’s shed, which is an important opportunity for young men to earn certificates I and II in basic trades-great steps back into self-worth and the belief that they can contribute again in society, leaving behind the years lost to drugs and alcohol. I also congratulate their partners: the Redland City Council, Miller Communications, Finlandia Village, Faith Lutheran College and Bendigo Bank. On another notion of the important investments that have been made in public housing, I note while the minister is here that we have seen, in the search for shovel-ready programs and the commendable effort to see public housing built on occasion in places like Narangba and MAIN COMMITTEE",144,Grocery Prices Have Soared With The Cost Of A Standard Basket Of Goods Rising By About $10 In Three
259,Mr Laming (Bowman) (11.07 Am),"In supporting the Social Security and Family AssisMary Street, Birkdale, a rushing of the process. We can understand that there is some haste required, but environmental concerns and communication with the local communities have been lost in the effort to build these public housing facilities quickly. The request to state governments, I acknowledge, was to find shovel-ready locations that did not have to go through the full council approval process, and in many cases developers raised their hand and said, ‘Please take this block of land.’ I want to tell the Mary Street story very briefly as it applies to addressing homelessness in my community. What happened was that, because it was deemed code-assessable, a very crude division was done. The 2-6 Mary Street block was 4,000 square metres. It was divided by 200 square metres per dwelling, allowing 20 units. Only 12 car parking spots were included in the development. That is of great concern in a fairly small street where there is a childcare centre on one side and a school on the other. People were desperately concerned about the impact the traffic would have, the access for emergency vehicles and the significant koala overlay on the block being ignored. I am glad to say that the Queensland government has moved to freeze this development until further consideration occurs. I want to acknowledge in particular Margaret and James Hardy, Karen and Simon Clark, Maree and Neil Hickson, and Willa Venz, who worked very hard to mobilise the community, which knew nothing about this development until very early in February-and that in itself is a breakdown of communication which we should not tolerate from any level of government. When the state Labor member was informed, there was a very quick series of community meetings, and another one is planned for this Saturday. It looks like the community has succeeded in having the koala overlay considered. At the present time, with only 12 car parks proposed for 20 units, anyone could look at those plans and see that there will be traffic chaos, as would be the case with any 20-unit development. The notion that people who live in public housing do not own motor vehicles I think is a thing of the past. This is outer metropolitan urban living, and virtually everyone owns a car in this day and age. I would like to see those vehicle-to-dwelling ratios adhered to. Even if it is a state government spending federal government stimulus money, that does not allow them to steamroll a local council. I would like to have those laws protected in particular cases. The corridors of koala vegetation overlays in the very delicate ecologies of outer metropolitan Brisbane, where our koalas travel from, say, Thorneside to Birkdale and through to Belmont, need to be very carefully protected. We can do environmentally sensitive development if we think about it. It takes a little bit more time; it takes a bit more care from the state offices. But we can solve this homelessness problem with more public housing, which is welcomed in my electorate, without necessarily destroying valuable koala feeding trees and their root systems. Certainly it is as simple as can be. Moving a retaining wall, altering the foundations and moving car parks into locations where they will not harm trees would be a very noble objective and we would still have a happy community welcoming public housing instead of what has happened in this case, which has been the reverse. Mrs D’ATH (Petrie) (11.11 am)-It is my pleasure to add my support to the Social Security and Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Weekly Payments) Bill 2010. This bill of course implements another key reform set out in the Australian government’s white paper The road home: a national approach to reducing homelessness, which was released in December 2008 by the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and the Minister for Housing, Tanya Plibersek. As MAIN COMMITTEE the minister is in the chamber today, can I acknowledge the wonderful work that she is doing in relation to housing and homelessness. It is a very important issue not just for my electorate but across Australia. I will get to my electorate in more detail shortly. The white paper outlined a plan for reducing homelessness in Australia by 2020 with specific goals to halve overall homelessness and provide accommodation to all rough sleepers who seek it. There are currently 105,000 homeless people in Australia, of whom around 16,000 sleep rough. The white paper provided a huge injection of funds, an additional $1.2 billion over four years, a 55 per cent increase in investment in homelessness and a substantial downpayment on a 12-year reform agenda. It included a commitment of $800 million over the next four years for new support services for homeless people and $400 million over the next two financial years for social housing to house the homeless. This injection of funds is part of the $15.1 billion package agreed by the Council of Australian Governments to stimulate the economy and generate up to 133,000 jobs over coming years. In response to the overwhelming feedback from consultations on the green paper, the white paper focused on three core strategies: turning off the tap, better prevention of homelessness and improving and expanding services to help more homeless people, breaking the cycle of homelessness by providing long-term housing and support. Through the new funding provided by the Rudd Labor government and through reforms made by this government, we aim to help up to 9,000 more young people to remain connected with their families, help up to 2,250 more families at risk of homelessness to stay housed, provide day-to-day support to an extra 1,000 adults with mental illness, build up to 2,700 additional public and community houses for low-income households that are at risk of homelessness, fund a network of 90 community engagement officers within Centrelink to support people at risk of homelessness, build up to 4,200 new houses and upgrade up to 4,800 existing houses in remote Indigenous communities and allocate aged care places and capital funds for at least one new specialist facility for older homeless people every year for the next four years. Centrelink has a critical role to play in reducing and preventing homelessness. We know that Centrelink provides income support payments to 6½ million people, many of whom are disadvantaged, vulnerable and socially excluded. As a key first-to-know agency, Centrelink is well placed to identify people who are at risk of homelessness and assist them with stabilising their housing situation. Centrelink has already introduced an indicator in its systems to identify clients who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. This indicator will let Centrelink staff know that the client needs active follow-up from a Centrelink social worker to make sure that they are receiving the support that they need to stay housed. The indicator allows Centrelink to improve and tailor its services to the people who are most vulnerable to homelessness. In October last year, Centrelink also began to establish its network of Centrelink community engagement officers. This program now has 90 specialist staff located across all capital cities and many regional centres. They support some of the most vulnerable people in our community. This bill provides another reform to be implemented by Centrelink under the Australian government’s white paper on homelessness. As part of the Australian government’s efforts to prevent homelessness, we are introducing weekly payments of income support payments for people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. We know that some Australians have MAIN COMMITTEE difficulty budgeting and spend their fortnightly welfare payments too quickly. This can mean that they are left with no money to pay rent, buy food or pay for essential services. Vulnerable customers who are being supported by Centrelink staff will be able to choose to receive their income support payments weekly instead of fortnightly. While the payment amount will stay the same, weekly payments will allow the most disadvantaged welfare payment customers to budget more easily. It will also give these vulnerable Australians an opportunity to stabilise and improve their circumstances. Another important aspect of this measure is its extension to recipients of the family tax benefit. I commend the component of the bill that allows families on income support that also receive the family tax benefit to receive their family tax benefit weekly as well. The family tax benefit is critical to helping many low-income families in my electorate and around the country in making ends meet and enabling the family tax benefit payments to be received weekly along with income support payments is yet another example of this government’s commitment to a responsive and flexible family support system. In my electorate, more than 13,000 families receive family tax benefit A and more than 10,400 receive family tax benefit B, with many of these families receiving both. I am certainly proud to support the bill as yet another example of the Rudd government delivering on its promises to tackle homelessness and support families and individuals that are under financial pressure. I certainly know that many vulnerable people in Petrie will benefit from this bill. I heard the member for Bowman speaking about some of the local organisations in his electorate. I have many wonderful community organisations in my electorate that do amazing work. The minister and the Prime Minister have spoken at length about the organisations that they have visited around this country to discuss what this government’s future policies should be in addressing homelessness. There are organisations such as the Orana Youth Shelter and Chameleon House, which are the only two youth shelters in my electorate. They do wonderful work in supporting our young people. But they have to send away far too many young people on a daily basis. There is the Redcliffe Community Association and the Redcliffe Area Youth Service, which do wonderful work in supporting our young people and also many women with children who have been subject to domestic violence who find themselves homeless. They also help those people suffering mental illness who, as a consequence of their medical condition, find themselves homeless. These groups deal with these situations and these real people every day. There is the North Moreton Public Tenants Association, the Deception Bay Neighbourhood Centre, Near North Housing, the Deception Bay Child and Family Alliance, Boys Town Deception Bay, the Deception Bay Community Youth programs and the Youth Advisory Group. These are all groups, among many others, who do wonderful work locally. But we need to do more, and as a government we need to support these community organisations. I heard one of the members, the member for Deakin, saying earlier that anyone could find themselves homeless. In fact, I remember having a conversation with a woman back in 2007, when I was a candidate. This woman explained to me how she was a stay-at-home mum with two young children. Her husband was a middle-income worker. They never considered themselves to be struggling. He was a middle-income earner; she was at home raising the kids. They were in rental property. They thought they were doing well until one day they were given notice that the property owner wanted them to vacate because he wanted to renovate MAIN COMMITTEE and put the property on the market. The woman and her family found themselves in a very difficult position, trying to get into another rental property that was affordable for them. In fact they ended up moving into a local caravan park with their family. The even thought that this was acceptable, except that the caravan park notified them that they were closing down. And suddenly this family, who never saw themselves as struggling and never thought they could ever become homeless, found themselves in a situation where they were about to be living out of their car. Friends stepped in and helped them and eventually they got back into another rental property. That is an example of how easy it is to become homeless. We always think that it is people who come from difficult relationships, who have some health issues or who are long-term unemployed who end up homeless. But anyone can end up homeless. I know that the white paper identified that of the 105,000 homeless up to 23 per cent fall into the category of older people and that children form up to 22 per cent according to the census data in 2006. Families made up up to 11 per cent and rough sleepers made up 16 per cent of the homeless. I know there are many young people in my electorate who are sleeping rough, sleeping on friends’ couches or moving around every night. I have had men who manage boarding houses in my area say to me: ‘Yvette, we don’t know what to do; these women turn up on our doorstep with young children. This is not an appropriate place for them to stay. We’re concerned about their safety. This isn’t a good environment for the children. We can’t take them in but what else can we do?’ There are many of us working on how we can change this situation locally. Redcliffe Area Youth Space in their last annual report looked at the predominant issues that they encountered as a youth service. In 2007-08 homelessness was a predominant issue in 62 per cent of cases, up seven per cent. In 2008-09 the homelessness was a predominant issue in 75 per cent of cases. That was up 13 per cent from the previous year. So this problem is growing. Interestingly, mental health was a predominant issue in 90 per cent of cases. So there is a link there, and it is a link that we cannot ignore-nor is the government ignoring it. I am very pleased that the government has said that in our health reforms and future announcements we will be very much focusing on mental health, because that is an important area. I am pleased that the government is dealing with homelessness through its previous announcements and through this bill and that through the stimulus package and nation building there is extra social housing. In terms of refurbishments, repairs and maintenance, in my area alone 374 social housing units are being repaired. I know that those repairs included providing safer bathrooms for elderly people, support baths, wider doorways and fans to keep them cooler. The fact is that our summers are getting hotter, especially in Brisbane and Queensland, and with safety as a major priority, heat stress is a major problem for elderly people. I was pleased, when I was talking to the Queensland government’s QBuild operators, to learn that they had put in a large number of ceiling fans into the oneand two-bedroom units that elderly people are living in, in social housing throughout the electorate. We are also building another 43 social housing units and I know that the Urban Land Development Authority and the Brisbane Housing Company are building new rental affordability properties in Fitzgibbon. That is another fantastic announcement. While we are doing all this wonderful work, unfortunately, there is a lot of obstruction from the opposition. I would hate to see more obstruction in any areas that deal with the MAIN COMMITTEE homelessness issue. In just the past year 41 bills have been obstructed in the Senate. That is four times the average number of bills that have been obstructed by any opposition over the last 30 years. While we are trying to be fiscally responsible and to make sure that taxpayer dollars are going into those really important areas that we need them to go into, such as health and homelessness, we have the opposition leader, Tony Abbott, now wanting to increase costs for households by introducing a great big new tax through a paid parental leave scheme. He does not want to fund it in a responsible way; he wants to tax big business to ensure that those costs will then flow on to households, and women particularly will feel the pressures of those increasing costs to their home. There is no point in giving paid parental leave when every time parents go to the supermarket it is going to cost them more to get food, to get essential services and to clothe their children. These costs will flow. We know these costs will flow, and it is at the very least disappointing. It fails the Australian community in putting forward these proposals. But it is my pleasure to be part of the Rudd Labor government, which is actually not just fiscally responsible but is looking after those important areas of our community such as homelessness, and I am very pleased to commend this bill to the House. Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney-Minister for Housing and Minister for the Status of Women) (11.27 am)-The Social Security and Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Weekly Payments) Bill 2010 implements a key reform of the Australian government’s white paper, The road home: a national approach to reducing homelessness, which was released in December 2008. To support the government’s goal to halve homelessness and to offer accommodation to all rough sleepers who seek it by 2020, state and territory governments and the Commonwealth together have committed more than $1.1 billion to increase services for people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. On top of this, a further 80,000 social and affordable homes will be added to Australian housing stock by 2012 through the Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan and through our National Rental Affordability Scheme, as well as the measures for remote Indigenous housing. The white paper on homelessness committed all governments to work hard to prevent homelessness, to give people the support they need to remain in their homes and to link our new housing initiatives with the intensive specialist support that is needed to break the cycle of homelessness. We know that there is a critical need for housing and we have acted to boost its supply, but resolving homelessness is not just about providing a roof and four walls. There are a number of other challenges that people need to overcome to find housing and to stay housed. The government’s white paper highlights the need to address these challenges. Centrelink, as the critical first-to-know agency, plays a crucial part in addressing these challenges, and I really want to congratulate the management and staff of Centrelink for the thought and effort that they have put into addressing this issue of homelessness. Centrelink’s role in identifying people who are at risk of homelessness is critical to reducing and preventing homelessness as well as helping people stabilise their housing situation, and Centrelink has been both willing and able to change the way that it has traditionally worked to better support people who are vulnerable to homelessness. Centrelink is responsible for providing 6½ million customers, many of whom are disadvantaged and vulnerable, with income support payments. Centrelink has introduced procedures to identify customers who are homeless or at risk of homelessness and who may require extra assistance from a Centrelink social worker to get the support they need to stay housed. EnMAIN COMMITTEE hancing Centrelink’s ability to identify people at risk of homelessness will enable the Australian government to improve and tailor our service to those people who are most vulnerable to homelessness, and it will prevent people from becoming homeless. Centrelink, in October 2009, established its Centrelink community engagement officers across Australia. These officers are working with non-government organisations such as drug and alcohol rehabilitation services, mental health services, hostels, boarding houses, refuges and drop-in centres to provide some of the most vulnerable people in our community with better access to income support and other services available through Centrelink. I cannot stress enough how important this role is. We know that there are a number of people who are homeless who have no income because they are illiterate or, for mental health reasons, they are unable to cope with filling in their Centrelink forms or going into a Centrelink office. Getting these people the income that they are entitled to under our social security system is the first and most critical step to finding and maintaining a roof over their head. With no money coming in, there is absolutely no way that you can keep a roof over your head. This bill delivers another critical Centrelink reform. As part of the Australian government’s strategy to prevent homelessness, this bill introduces weekly payments for the first time for people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. We know that some Australians can find themselves in financial difficulty as they have problems budgeting and spend their fortnightly welfare payments too quickly. In some cases, we know that vulnerable people-again, often people who suffer with a mental illness-can be imposed upon by people they see as friends to hand over their fortnightly payment. This can result in their having no money to pay for all of the essentials-obviously, rent, food and other necessities. These vulnerable customers will be able to choose to receive their income support payments weekly instead of fortnightly. It is important to emphasise that this is a voluntary measure but one that has been enthusiastically accepted by many people during the trial period and, indeed, by welfare organisations who support the most vulnerable Australians. Although the total amount of a person’s welfare payment will stay the same, making payments weekly will allow the most disadvantaged welfare payment customers to budget more easily. It will also give these vulnerable Australians an opportunity to stabilise and improve their circumstances. Currently, for people receiving social security payments, the social security law is unclear about whether the secretary has the discretion to determine that more than one payment can be made in respect of an instalment period. This bill clarifies that, for individuals in a declared class, a social security payment may be made on a weekly basis in respect of a 14-day instalment period. Accordingly, weekly payments will be made available to customers on commencement of a legislative instrument defining ‘vulnerable customer’. The bill also makes changes to the family assistance law. Vulnerable customers who receive family tax benefit in addition to income support will be given the opportunity to receive their income support payment weekly. At present, the government’s intention is to limit weekly payments to income support payments while retaining family assistance payments on a fortnightly basis. However, this bill amends the family assistance law and introduces the capacity to make weekly payments for family tax benefit and baby bonus, allowing the government to respond to changing circumstances as necessary. These changes are intended to assist Australia’s most vulnerable people, who are experiencing financial hardship, and consequently to prevent these people from becoming homeless. MAIN COMMITTEE It is an important measure. Once again, I want to congratulate the management and staff of Centrelink, who, although they are a very large organisation, focused very efficiently and nimbly on the part they can play in reducing the vulnerability of people to homelessness and to helping homeless Australians stabilise their lives, get a roof over their heads and move on to more regular and rewarding lives. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (11.35 am)-I move: That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Victoria: Antisocial Behaviour creasing street violence and antisocial behaviour in our wider community. I would also like to highlight the complete failure of the Brumby Labor government to deal with the issue and the need for a national strategy and more resources to combat the problem. We have all seen the headlines in relation to increased violence on the streets of Melbourne and the muchpublicised attacks on Indian students. Unfortunately, Premier Brumby seems to be in denial in relation to these issues and refuses to acknowledge the extent of the problem in Victoria. This is not just a Melbourne issue. The issue is of concern to people right throughout regional Victoria. Statistics released last year showed that, since 2006-07, assaults in the Traralgon area increased by 15 per cent. I would like to refer to a recent article in the Latrobe Valley Express newspaper where McDonald’s Traralgon owner, Darren Cowell, who is a respected local businessman, was so concerned about the safety of his staff that he had to cut back on business hours. About three weeks ago one of his security guards was assaulted with a weapon and during that same weekend a staff member was assaulted as they waited for a taxi at about six o’clock in the morning. I would just like to quote from Mr Cowell’s comments to the Latrobe Valley Express. He said: … I got to the stage where I just didn’t want my people exposed to that … … We couldn’t control it anymore and there was an increase in incidents at the weekends. … When staff are being assaulted waiting to go home, that was the last point for me. These attacks affect everyone. In this case it means fewer working hours for the staff. It has also had a severe economic impact on them. It has also had considerable social impacts on people in the region in that they are too afraid to walk home at night. I fear that the state government’s response in this case has been woefully inadequate. Undoubtedly, the best deterrent for this type of activity is a visual presence of police on the streets. We cannot believe the numbers that we see allocated to our police stations, because the actual officers are simply not there. There are vacancies on the books. They simply do not have the staff on the beat that they are meant to have. Police resourcing, I believe, is one of the keys to this problem. It is not just a weekend blitz or a one-night operation. We need to have an ongoing strong presence in these areas where it is known that trouble has been occurring. MAIN COMMITTEE",147,Acoss Welcomes This Move By The Government Which Will Help Severely Disadvantaged People Access
260,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (11.35 Am),"I rise to, again, raise my concern about the inLast week I had the pleasure of hosting the federal Leader of the Nationals, Warren Truss, in my electorate. We met with senior police in the Latrobe Valley and, to be fair to the police, they are doing their absolute best with the resources available to them, but they do need to have the numbers they are entitled to under their current allocations. As I have previously told the HouseI believe that increased police numbers and more security at these known trouble spots is just part of the solution. We also need to change the laws regarding liquor licences. We need to impose harsher penalties on these gang offenders who commit these mass attacks. We need to act decisively and take licences off poor business operators and we need to work harder to change the culture which appears to have desensitised people, particularly young people, to violence. I fear that there has been a cultural change which is linked to a lack of respect towards our police, a lack of respect for other individuals and a lack of respect for community standards at large. This culture simply has to change. We need to be serious in our efforts to change the culture in the community of excessive consumption of alcohol. We do not need Mickey Mouse schemes like increased taxes on readyto-drink products, which we have seen with the so-called alcopops tax. It is much harder than that. These are much more significant issues and it will take a whole-of-community response. Change is needed in our behaviour, in our own homes, at our sporting clubs, at community functions and in the behaviour of our sporting role models, whom many people look up to. I have also spoken previously about the need for governments at all levels to do whatever they can to keep investing in our sporting and community clubs which have a youth focus. We need to provide positive examples for young people to get involved in alcohol-free activities in our community and help to develop a sense of belonging within the community. I would like to refer to a friend of mine who passed away quite recently, Doc McKenzie, a life member of the Lakes Entrance Surf Lifesaving Club. Doc always used to say that the local police never had any trouble with the kids from the surf club. Whether it was because they were too busy or too tired after being on the beach all day, I am not sure, but they certainly had a sense of community and a sense of being part of something bigger than themselves. I think it is a real credit to organisations like surf lifesaving and other community and sporting organisations that provide those positive examples for young people. As I mentioned before, those habits which are formed early in life are certainly likely to stay with people as they mature and go on to become well-regarded and well-respected members of our community. I want to say at the outset that improving community safety and reducing violence needs to become a national priority. The federal government should be providing more funding to help local communities find their own solutions. I met recently with the Traralgon CBD Safety Committee, which has been working in partnership with the local council, the police, the entertainment industry and the taxi industry to help clean up the streets in the Traralgon area. They have been seeking funding for closed-circuit television and a night-rider bus service, but both the state and the federal Labor governments are, at this stage, refusing to support those applications. The government really should be supporting some of these local solutions to local problems. In this case the initiatives have the support of local police, the local business community and the local council. SoI urge both the state and the federal governments to start getting serious about the issue of community based crime and street violence and to start working with their communities to develop local solutions. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE Chile: Earthquake Friendship GroupI offer my condolences and, I am sure, the condolences of all members of this parliament to the people of Chile, as well as the Chilean community in Australia, for the damage and destruction that has been caused in that country by the recent earthquake. On 27 February, an earthquake registering 8.8 in magnitude occurred near the city of Concepcion, just over 300 kilometres south-west of the Chilean capital, Santiago. It was one of the most powerful earthquakes in recorded history and caused devastation from the capital right through central Chile and into the south. There is very major damage in Concepcion and in other towns. Chileans are a strong and resilient people. As floods and fires are for many Australians, earthquakes and tremors are a part of life for Chileans. But the fifth most powerful earthquake on record-since 1900-is one of the worse to have hit Chile and has left some areas of the country in ruins. Continuing earthquakes in the affected region since 27 February are described as ‘aftershocks’, which is technically right but understates their magnitude: some of these aftershocks are in themselves major earthquakes. Hundreds of people have perished and millions have been affected by this earthquake. With searches still in progress for missing people, the death toll is expected to rise. Much of Chile’s infrastructure and hundreds of thousands of homes and beautiful heritage architecture in many cities and towns have been damaged and destroyed in this disaster. Thankfully, the damage and death toll have not reached the scale of devastation seen in Haiti earlier this year, despite the fact that the Chilean earthquake was stronger. Chile can thank its strongly designed buildings, well organised society and geographical nature for managing to limit the catastrophe to what it is. Coastal towns, in particular, have borne the brunt of the destruction, with tsunami waves crashing into the already earthquake-affected cities and towns. For me, this disaster hit home at a personal level. I have deep ties and a great affection for Chile. One of my sons is currently in Chile on student exchange. Much to our relief, he is safe. I have fond memories of travelling and living in Chile with my wife and family, and to think of how this tragedy is affecting the whole Chilean community brings us much sadness. Australia has a long standing, close and warm relationship with Chile. At the beginning of the last century Chile was Australia’s major trading partner. Australia signed a free trade agreement with Chile in 2008, further strengthening the bonds between our two countries. Many wonderful Chileans came to Australia seeking refuge from the brutal military regime of General Augusto Pinochet. There are some 23,000 Chilean-born Australians who made their lives in Australia, and they are here to stay. They and their Australian-born children form a substantial Chilean-Australian community, and many of them live in the south-east of Melbourne, where my electorate is located. In recent years, Chile has developed rapidly. Until the global financial crisis hit in 2008, the Chilean economy was growing strongly. I hope that this disaster, which has caused damage measured in the many billions of dollars, is a setback from which Chile can recover quickly and return to that path of growth. I have great faith that, with the assistance of nations like ours, the Chilean government and the new President, Sebastian Pinera, will rebuild the devastated areas and display the strength that the country needs at this time. I was very pleased to MAIN COMMITTEE",154,Adjournment
261,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs) (11.40 Am),"As Chair of the Australia/Chile Parliamentaryhear the immediate initial response from our government, announced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, of $4 million in reconstruction assistance and $1 million in emergency assistance, which included the provision of tents, generators, stretcher beds and blankets. I also acknowledge the hard work that the Ambassador for Chile in Australia, Jose Luis Balmaceda, and the new Consul-General for Chile in Victoria, Diego Velasco-von Pilgrimm, are doing to keep the Chilean community in Australia up to date with the latest situation and to raise funds for the care of those affected in Chile as well as for the reconstruction effort. I would also like to thank the Australian Ambassador in Chile, Virginia Greville, and the embassy staff for working around the clock to locate and contact Australians in Chile in the aftermath of the earthquake-according to the embassy, at the time of the earthquake there were thought to be some 400 Australians in Chile but it is likely that there would have been many more backpackers because, in recent years, Chile has become a very popular destination for young Australians travelling through South America. I can assure the ambassador Virginia Greville that for families like mine who have a loved one in Chile the work of the embassy is very much appreciated indeed. Isaacs and I am sure that all honourable members would associate themselves with the sympathy and condolences expressed by him in this adjournment debate. Swan Electorate: Bali Memorial the Governor of Bali, Governor Pastika, and also Lindsay Ross of the Bali Peace Park Association. The purpose of the meeting was to update Governor Pastika on the association’s activities and to thank him for his previous assistance and to seek further help from him. The Bali Peace Park Association is a Western Australian group whose members are made up of survivors, families and supporters of the 2002 Bali bombings. The bombings, which took the lives of 202 people, including 88 Australians and 39 Indonesians, affected my home state of Western Australia in particular. Western Australians visit Bali in large numbers and it was therefore not surprising that the largest number of those killed or injured during the attacks were WA residents. The attacks have left their mark on many members of the WA community. That is why the Bali Peace Park Association and its goals are so important. The central goal is to establish a memorial park on the land where the bombings took place, providing a physical place for reflection and encouragement for the families to remember the dead. The association was incorporated on 2 September and is an established not-for-profit organisation. Members might recall that I spoke in October last year in support of the Bali Peace Park Association’s effort to seek a special application for deductible gift recipient status. I am pleased now to say that that has been granted. The group has now turned its attention towards negotiating the purchase of the former Sari Club site in Kuta where they want the peace park to be established. Official negotiations began on 25 February. The garden will look to build a future without fear by promoting tolerance, understanding and freedom for generations to come irrespective of nationality, culture, religious belief or race. I support the work and the mission that this organisation is committed to delivering in honour of those killed in the attacks. The purpose of the meeting I hosted on MAIN COMMITTEE",156,Adjournment

263,Mr Irons (Swan) (11.46 Am),"I rise to speak today about a meeting I had this week withTuesday was to discuss those ongoing negotiations with the governor. Lindsay Ross did an excellent job in representing the Bali Peace Park Association. I am pleased to be able to say that Governor Pastika was supportive of the project and even said that he would make a representation on behalf of the group to President Yudhoyono. I am sure the governor understands the significance the site will have to Australians and Indonesians and the role it will play in strengthening the relationship between our two countries. Last year was the seventh anniversary of the bombings. Last year, on the date of the anniversary, I stood beside state Liberal Party parliamentary colleagues including the Premier of Western Australia Colin Barnett, the families, the friends, the survivors and supporters who were affected by the terrorist attacks on 12 October 2002 and also those affected by the bombings in 2005. As I stated last year, this annual gathering takes place on the anniversary at the specifically designed Bali memorial in Kings Park. Out of this tragedy the relationship between Australia and Indonesia has been strengthened. I would once again like to take the opportunity to acknowledge those who have taken part on the committee of the association. Phil Britten, the association’s spokesperson is one of the many injured in the bombings and suffered third-degree burns to about 60 per cent of his body. He also sadly lost many of his close friends in the attack. Gary Nash, vice chairman of the association suffered burns to 51 per cent of his body as well as suffering shrapnel wounds that will see him having to wear pressure garments on his legs for the rest of his life. His partner Sharon Kermac is also on the committee as treasurer. I would also like to acknowledge one of the patrons of the Bali Peace Park Association, Dr Fiona Wood. Dr Wood is known as a burns specialist and heads up the Royal Perth Hospital Burns Unit and the Western Australian burns service. Fiona Wood was Australian of the Year in 2005. Dr Wood worked with many of the injured during the Bali bombings, leading a courageous and committed team. I recently visited the Burns Unit at RPH with the House of Representatives Health and Ageing Committee. They have fabulous staff and do wonderful work. I would like to conclude by acknowledging that both President Yudhoyono and Governor Pastika have both had children attend Curtin University of Technology, which is in my electorate of Swan. It is a great credit to our local university that world leaders choose our local university for their children, and I understand from the university they both did very well. It is positive for the future of Western Australia’s relationship with the Republic of Indonesia. In finishing, I would like to give to Governor Pastika the same message that Tony Abbott gave to President Yudhoyono yesterday: we have been with you when you needed us and we are confident that you will be with us when we need you. Infrastructure in the lucky country. We have plenty of open space; a clean, fresh environment; plenty of opportunity; and an entrepreneurial spirit, which means we can always punch well above our weight. Most of this cultural characteristic comes from our colonial penal past and also a strong vibrant attitude on the back of immigrant workers that built this country and came here to make a new life in the land of opportunity. Certainly where we are today did not come from planning or vision. The past rarely gives you a good insight into the future, and nothing could be more true in terms of our urban planning and population growth.

264,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (11.51 Am),"Australians generally still regard themselves as livingnever really got the population/lifestyle/cities and towns mix quite right. It all just happened by accident or necessity. The reality is that we have only had a couple of hundred years to work this out, unlike other parts of the world, like Europe, that have been at it for thousands of years. This is both good and bad, but should be a case for us to rethink where we are today and where we want to be in the future. Speaking in broad terms, our cities are choked, our population centres are wrong and our job centres just simply do not work. As a result, our lifestyles and standard of living suffers. If you do not believe me, just ask the millions of people stuck in traffic every day trying to get to work, those that are locked out of home ownership because of overpriced city centres, and those unable to get decent health or education services within a reasonable distance from where they live or the sorts of lifestyle opportunities that most of us expect as being normal. The central problem here is that there is no one agency, there is no department or government or anyone who really is responsible for a complex mix of economic, social and infrastructure issues at hand. But I believe there is some light at the end of the overcrowded tunnel with the release of the Australian government report from Infrastructure Australia, State of Australian cities 2010. This government is paying much more attention to these problems and, importantly, focusing on how the solutions may look. Part of the solution, of course, is a complex mix of relationships between the three levels of government, the private sector and planning agencies that can alter the way that cities, regions and people develop into the future. It is not necessary to undo the mistakes of the past, but I think it is essential to plan for the future. This planning needs to interact between areas such as education and health, transport systems and food production. These all play an integral role. It is time we had a strong futurelooking vision that is based on a strategic plan and which cuts across local government borders and state boundaries. It really is something for all Australians to be concerned about. Why is this important? If we get this mix right not only will it provide for a healthier, better educated population with a higher standard of living but it will also reduce the pressure that we all face. You only need to turn to the Intergenerational report to look our ageing population and some of the bigger challenges we have got to the year 2050. This message, I believe, is getting through to commentators and representative bodies in this area-and certainly in the findings of the Infrastructure Australia Major Cities Unit report. This report should be essential reading for anyone who has even a passing interest in how we live, where we live and the standard of life in Australia. As the report says, Australia is one of the most urbanised nations on the planet, with 75 per cent-three-quarters-of everyone in Australia living in just 17 major cities of 100,000 people or more. But I think even more startling about this statistic is that the majority actually live just in five cities. Most of our people live in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide or Perth. This is a result of nonplanning rather than poor planning. The task at hand is for us to decide what we want Australia to look like in 2050. There are plenty of reports and projections that give us a clear idea of the challenge ahead and I believe you need to look no further than two great reports: one, the Infrastructure Australia report on the state of our cities and the other, the Intergenerational Report with its stark warnings on our population makeup. There is a way forward and I believe that in part it is the commitment of this government to once again get involved in the area of urban growth and development, infrastructure development-how our cities will look into the future. I think it is an important area and one that we should tackle with resources as well strategic thought. MAIN COMMITTEE The challenge for us is to partner with the states, territories and local government. We cannot do it without them. We need to find consistent, sustainable policies to take us through the next 40 years and ensure the standard of living that we cherish so much-all the opportunities that we have-are shared and that they do not slip away and are not diminished over time just because of a lack of will or planning. Lymphoedema phoedema and funding for lymphoedema in Australia. I want to pay tribute to the Castle Hill Country Women’s Association, who raised this vital issue in two motions in their community group at a recent meeting. The first motion read: That the CWA of NSW urges the state and federal governments to establish treatment centres for lymphoedema, with a central register of approved clinicians. And the second motion read: That the CWA of NSW urges the state and federal governments to cover the cost of prescribed compression garments necessary in the effective treatment of lymphoedema. This comes on the eve of the 2010 Australasian Lymphology Association conference, which is being held at the Sebel Albert Park in Melbourne from 27 to 29 May. The theme for this year is ‘Reflections of the Past, Inspirations for the Future’. Lymphoedema is the term given to swelling as a result of malfunction of the lymphatic system. It can be congenital-primary lymphoedema-or secondary lymphoedema, which results from damage to the system, such as trauma, but it more often results from surgery for cancer or melanoma. In recent times it has become more common. With an increase in the number of obese people or of people with weight-related problems, there is evidence of increasing numbers of diagnoses of lymphoedema. One of the important features of the motions that the Castle Hill Country Women’s Association has passed is that they have some therapists and people involved in the treatment of this area who have some very direct suggestions that can help government with their funding. I note that the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, when he was the health minister in the previous government was one of those who recognised this challenge and provided funding of half a million dollars to the National Breast Cancer Centre for initiatives to help patients affected by lymphoedema after treatment. In a press release dated 15 April 2007 he noted that the Australian government was providing this half a million dollars because: At present, there are no lymphoedema guides in Australia for either the public or health professionals. That is one of the consistent themes that I hear in relation to this topic: that there needs to be an improvement in the awareness of this issue generally and, indeed, the attention given to it. So the Leader of the Opposition, as then Minister for Health certainly saw ahead on this particularly important issue. The Castle Hill Country Women’s Association is concerned about two issues associated with lymphoedema. The first is the cost of the garments used in the ongoing management of people suffering from lymphoedema. The second is the need for designated, trained therapists and, potentially, what they term as dedicated lymphoedema treatment areas in our hospital system. This is of quite serious concern considering that there could be an extra 38,000 people MAIN COMMITTEE",158,Adjournment
265,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (11.56 Am),"I rise today to speak on the important topics of lymbeing diagnosed with cancer each year, of whom at least 8,000 are expected to develop lymphoedema. As to the cost of treating this condition, the garments that individuals are required to wear need to be made to measure-they cannot be factory made or simply one-size-fits-all. For example it was put to me that one made-to-measure garment with two full legs would cost $712. That could be very significant for people already in difficult circumstances. The cost of treatment is not as great as that for other things, but it is a significant impediment to a person’s ongoing healthcare management and there is little or no attention paid to this serious consideration. There is also a push-which I support, and which is part of the motions put forward by the Castle Hill Country Women’s Association-for lymphoedema to be regarded as an illness in its own right and managed as such, and I accept that that is something that should be looked at seriously. The suggestion that there be dedicated treatment areas within our hospitals has a lot of merit as well. I think if we are seeking to make improvements to the management of ongoing issues related to cancer treatment, then this is an area that could well benefit from attention from state and federal governments. A great deal of money has been allocated to researching this illness but, from the advice that has been provided to me, the best-practice guidelines that have resulted from the research are not being followed. I think it is important that treatment centres are established, or looked at by government as an option, for early diagnosis and therapeutic management of this condition. I want to record my thanks to the Castle Hill Country Women’s Association for these wonderful motions and to record my support for lymphoedema being diagnosed as an illness. Great Barrier Reef International Marine College Cairns and the Far North Queensland region. Next week, construction will start on the Great Barrier Reef International Marine College. There have been over five years of hard work by local marine businesses and the education community to see this come to fruition. It has been a partnership between not only the business community and the education sector in Cairns but also the federal and state governments. It is going to be critically important to the long-term security of and support for the marine industry locally, but also it will help to diversify and strengthen our local economy. Cairns is a great place to come and get an education, whether from our James Cook University, our local TAFE or the Cairns Aviation Skills Centre, and now we are going to have a world class marine skills training centre-the Great Barrier Reef International Marine College. It is an $8 million investment, and the federal government has committed $2 million towards it through our trades training program. There is no reason why Cairns cannot establish itself as a marine training hub, not only locally but also nationally and internationally-we are well-positioned in the Asia-Pacific region. In Cairns we have been going through some particularly difficult economic times with unemployment now in double digits, and this type of diversification will provide a real opportunity. It will also provide a boost and a shot in the arm in terms of confidence for the local community to see construction start next week. A significant amount of sea traffic goes through the Gulf of Carpentaria, the Torres Strait and the Great Barrier Reef, and Cairns has a highly diversified marine sector that includes MAIN COMMITTEE",160,Adjournment
266,Mr Turnour (Leichhardt) (12.01 Pm),"I rise today to speak about good news forcommercial and recreational fishing, tourism, Merchant Navy, Customs and Navy, and an expanding white boat industry-the superyacht industry. There is a desperate need for specialised training facilities to service these industries. That is why industry has been working locally for more than five years to secure sufficient funding to build this college. With its close proximity to the Asia-Pacific region and an international airport, and located in the lovely warm waters next to the Great Barrier Reef, Cairns is extremely well placed to build on these local industries and to service national and international areas. I think Cairns is a much nicer place than Launceston to come to to get a marine ticket, and that is something that we will certainly be marketing. They do a fantastic job down in Launceston, but it will be great to see Australia build another internationally recognised marine centre in Cairns. The Rudd government have been supporting this initiative. We have also moved, since I have been elected, to support industries like the superyacht industry. This is an industry that has been expanding in Australia and contributes about $50 million to the economy in Cairns and $150 million to the nation’s economy. Similarly, the state government is investing in an upgrade of the development of the cruise shipping terminal. All of these areas require skilled staff. A training framework will enable people to come to Cairns-from places local, national and international-and receive training which will be a pathway into these careers. The superyacht industry was looking for reforms in terms of a visa that would enable more superyachts to come to Australia, and I am very pleased that we were able to secure that for them in the lead-up to the last election, and I want to thank Minister Evans for delivering that on time. I know it has already driven benefits in that it has allowed new superyachts to come to Cairns, and there will be further benefit to local industry. These commitments have come about through a good partnership between the community, business and state and federal governments. I want to particularly pay tribute to the chairman of the organisation, Allan Wallish, and the project manager, Kim Andersen. They have been critically important in driving this project along. Other critically important people have been Tony Fuller, the principal of Woree State High School; Joann Pyne from Tropical North Queensland TAFE; Sheridan van Asch from the Department of Education and Training; Ian McKirdy from the Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation; John Downs from TNQ Institute of Tertiary and Further Education; and Chris Boland from FNQ Ports Corporation. I know Alan Vico and Mike Colleton, also from FNQ Ports Corporation, have played an important role in bringing this project to fruition. It is a great project. It is going to be a real shot in the arm for the local community. Construction starts next week. We are all really looking forward to it, and I know that it is going to provide pathways for local people into the marine area not only in the traditional areas of fishing or tourism, but also in the Merchant Navy and other areas. It is fantastic and I would like to again congratulate those people for the work they have done to bring it to fruition. Solar Energy liament on my first day back this week. On 19 August, as part of a question on ceiling batt insulation, I tabled papers outlining 14 rorts and doubtful practices as conveyed to me freely by the office manager of AllSafe, Tai Cullum-a reputable franchisee installer in Bundaberg. On 16 September, three days after I left for duties in New York, the then Minister for Environment, Heritage and the Arts, knowing that I could not respond until well into this new year, MAIN COMMITTEE",161,Adjournment
267,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (12.06 Pm),"I want to enlarge on a statement. I made in the parin a very cowardly fashion tabled a letter from David Jordan, the franchisor of AllSafe-a letter that the minister had been sitting on for 3½ weeks, accusing me of misrepresenting the comments from AllSafe’s Bundaberg franchisee. It also accused me of ‘incorrect statements’, ‘political point-scoring’ and having hurt the stimulus factor of this package. But nowhere did the minister or his correspondent detail where I was incorrect or where I had misled. These 14 items included things such as non-provision of quotes prior to fitting, forging of signatures, overstating of square metres in a roof, not insulating the whole roof of a house, poor insulation material and misrepresenting that they were from the government. Tai Cullum sent that letter to me, and, as I said, I tabled it in the House. Mr Jordan, in his letter to the minister, accused my staffer and my media officer, Kate Barwick, of getting this information under the ‘guise’ of seeking advice. That is not correct. She was clear, straightforward and direct, as she always is, in discussions with the company’s office manager and fully informed him that the information that she sought would be used in parliament. Indeed, I spoke to him as well and I found him a very polite and focused young man. And there was nothing unusual in what we were doing, because the very same firm franchisee, on 13 August in the Bundaberg News Mail, had made similar warnings. The minister, instead of attacking me, should have taken these 14 points on board because they have proved to be not only accurate but also prophetic. And not only have they happened in Bundaberg and in the Wide Bay Burnett area of Bundaberg, they have happened all over Australia, to the point where the government has admitted it, the outgoing minister admitted it, the new minister yesterday in his statement admitted it and the department has admitted it-to the point where the minister is now going to refer matters to the Australian Federal Police and the Auditor-General. The point I am making is this. In August last year, if the government had gone in and taken on the shoddies in the industry, there and then, instead of denigrating me-and I was the first one to raise these matters in a serious way-we possibly would not have had a number of these deaths, fires and dreadful things that have occurred since. It is ironic that the good firms, the reputable installers, would still be in business and doing good business. What do they have now? Because the whole system has been corrupted, these good installers, and I certainly include AllSafe, are now in a situation where they cannot operate properly. In his letter to the minister, Mr Jordan said that they employed 12 people in Bundaberg, but I have an article from the Bundaberg News-Mail which says that since the minister closed the scheme down they are 14 employees down-so they have actually dropped two. Not only that, we have warehouses full of material, some good and some bad, all over this country. AllI would say to the outgoing minister is: you treated me badly, you did not take my advice and we have suffered a woeful consequence because of it. (Time expired) International Women’s Day Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (12.11 pm)-TodayI rise to speak on our recent celebrations of International Women’s Day and I want to take the opportunity to commend some of the local women in my electorate of Calwell. I want to commend them for their achievements, their hard work and their sacrifices which, as we know, all too often remain unacknowledged. In my electorate of Calwell our women hail from a range of ethnic, linguistic and cultural backgrounds, yet we have found that with this diversity comes a sense of collective unity as MAIN COMMITTEE we all cope with the challenges we encounter in our roles as women, mothers and activists. In my electorate there are hundreds of women that I have come across in the time that I have been the member for Calwell, all of them deserving acknowledgement. In fact, it has been their support and their encouragement that has helped me get through my job as a female member of parliament and as a parent. I often reassess my own frustrations when I look at what most of these women have been through, and I draw a lot of confidence from their accomplishments and their strengths. TodayI want to pay tribute to four women who are stalwarts of their community and whose activism and volunteerism have transformed the lives of the people around them. They are women who have families but who have always found the time to give to their community. I would like to begin by mentioning here today long-term Broadmeadows resident and mother of four children, Ms Terri McNaughton. For most of her working life Terri worked for the then Telecom, where she was a shop steward for her union and spent most of her time advocating for the rights and conditions of the people she worked with. Terri has maintained a lifelong interest in the rights of working people. Terri has an interesting and poignant story. Growing up in the hard years of the depression and one of eight children abandoned by their father, Terri and her siblings were taken from their mother-who was deemed not able to look after them-and brought up in a convent by Catholic nuns for a number of years in which she was separated from most of her siblings. Terri’s mother, however, fought hard to be reunited with her children. Part of this fight involved writing to the great Australian politician Arthur Calwell, pleading for him to give her a house in order to house her children. Arthur Calwell responded to her pleas and found her a house, and thus the family was able to be reunited. In 2003 Terri, my very good friend and supporter, was given the opportunity to publicly thank Mary Elizabeth Calwell, the daughter of Arthur Calwell, on behalf of her mother and siblings for his intervention all those years ago that allowed the family to be reunited. Terri had a difficult childhood and a difficult life but dedicated her own life in activism to helping disadvantaged people, especially children and women. She has set up a very small but very effective support group for abused children and women and continues to be involved in issues which effect her community. I want to also acknowledge Mrs Thekla Scarcella. Thekla is a woman of many talents who migrated to Australia at 20 years of age in 1967. She created a family and pursued her great passion for writing. Thekla has been involved in many organisations. She has written, directed and taught over many years. She continues her good work by raising funds for breast cancer and for the children’s hospital and has been a teacher of Modern Greek. In fact, she set up a school in Shepparton many years ago. She teaches her senior citizens groups anything from computer skills to healthy living skills. She is forever active and constantly giving. She transforms the lives of the people in her community. Thekla has received many awards recognising her services, including the Premier’s Multicultural Award for services to her community. I want to also mention Sonja Rutherford, an icon in the Broadmeadows community. Together with her husband John, she established the Broadmeadows Progress Association over 30 years ago. This association has been at the forefront of lobbying on behalf of the community on issues from stopping the fast train link to the airport, when I first became the member in 2001, to supporting the Coolaroo station for many years. Finally, thanks to the Brumby MAIN COMMITTEE state government, that has now been built. Sonja has also strongly lobbied for the Broadmeadows town hall to be saved from becoming a poker machines venue of the North Melbourne Football Club. She has been involved in countless campaigns. She also has time to run the Broadmeadows Community Singing Group. Sonja is a champion weightlifter in the over 60s category. She has travelled abroad, representing Australia, and is a national champion. This is a multifaceted woman who continues to serve with a passion and energy that has no rival. Finally, Ayse Koksyz, a long-time resident of Meadow Heights, established the Turkish Women’s Group and has dedicated her time to giving women from the Turkish-speaking community opportunities to meet and socialise when otherwise they would be isolated and unable to connect with the broader community. Her group has a vibrancy and colour that is a joy to be a part of. They conduct festivals and showcase the magnificent Turkish handicrafts that are made by local women. They run wonderful festivals with lots of wonderful Turkish food and music, and I love every minute of my attendance. (Time expired) Home Insulation Program recent times. It has been brought into the spotlight in a negative way as a result of the government’s attempt to shovel as much money out the door as possible. The result has been an absolute fiasco. There has been fraud. There has been damage to property. There have been deaths. The failure of the system has been monumental, and it will go down in history as a comprehensive failure of this Rudd government. Leaving that aside, my intention today is to speak of what this failed program has done to a local business in Cowan, Mr Insulation; its owner, Martin Perry; his family; and the dismissed staff. I would like to say at the outset that, having spoken to Mr Perry and visited his business in Landsdale, I have a far greater appreciation of the insulation industry and a high regard for this insulation business, which has been around for more than 20 years. Mr Perry produces his own cellulose blow-in insulation. For those who do not know of it, it is shredded newspaper that has borax and boric acid flame retardants mixed into it. Mr Perry produces this cellulose insulation in accordance with Australian standards. It will not burn. He demonstrated this by holding a handful of the cellulose and trying to burn it with a propane torch. It went red from the heat and then black, but it did not burn. He similarly showed me the classic fibreglass batts and polyester insulation, lighting a petrol fire and then placing these forms of insulation over it. Again, they did not burn. Mr Perry attributes the fires not to burning insulation but to poor and inexperienced installations. Apart from the problems with the infamous foil insulation, Mr Perry told me that the major problem has been downlights installed in older houses where no guards were placed around the lights, which are exposed in the roofs. Particularly in homes surrounded by trees, years of combustible leaf litter can accumulate. If the downlights do not have guards around them, that litter can fall onto the top of the downlights and catch fire when it gets hot enough. Even a small fire can then cause the leaf litter through the rest of the roof to also catch fire, creating a roof fire. What makes this more likely is when inexperienced insulation installers do not clean out the roof cavity first but instead push the batts into the roof space, pushing the leaf litter along and into the low points on the ceiling-the downlights. Mr Perry’s point is that the fire MAIN COMMITTEE",162,Adjournment
268,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (12.17 Pm),"A lot has been said about the insulation industry inrisk in older houses with unguarded downlights installed before two years ago are at great risk if insulation is put in without a clean-up of the combustible materials in the roof space. I, like many members, have been contacted by those local residents who, having participated in that program, are concerned about the reported dangers of insulation installation. The concerns of the public have been fuelled by the reports of fires and deaths and by the cancellation of the scheme. This has resulted in an immediate halt to new orders. For Mr Perry, the owner of Mr Insulation, $300,000 worth of forward bookings have been cancelled. His $80,000 worth of insulation batts in stock are almost worthless. In reality the only part of the business left is new home insulation and, given the stock sitting around, prices for that work are likely to plummet. Five days before the program ceased Mr Perry paid $4,500 to put staff through a training course. They were staff that have since been predominantly let go. Mr Perry is still owed around $5,500 from the program and I hope that those funds will be forthcoming in the immediate future. If you include prepaid commissions-amounting to $18,000-to some former sales staff, it is estimated that $40,000 has been lost as a result of the program’s closure. I should also say that Mr Insulation was around a long time before the program; it was not one of these businesses that sprung up to take advantage of the scheme and in some cases the loopholes and weaknesses in the scheme. Before the program Mr Perry’s business would insulate between three and five homes per day; last week they had one job for the whole week. Because of the way it was set up this program invited fraud, shoddy work and major risks. The minister and the government got more than enough warnings yet the program comprehensively failed, with grave results. From visiting Mr Insulation I understand how a legitimate and creditable industry has been brought to its knees because the government did not put the work into making sure this program had the safeguards in place but preferred to shovel the cash out the door. I think it is important for all participants in this program to assess the risks and seek inspection of their homes if they think they are at risk. There was a time when Australians had confidence in the insulation industry-and they were right to have confidence, if Mr Insulation is typical of the businesses that existed before the program. Now Australians are lacking in confidence because of the government’s mismanagement of the Home Insulation Program. The blame for this lies directly at the feet of the government, whose reckless haste in spending resulted in failures in set-up, administration and governance. We are still waiting die details on how the government will help businesses like Mr Insulation that have suffered as a result of this program. for Melbourne PortsI would like to congratulate the honourable member for Barker on his appointment as Government Whip.

271,The Deputy Speaker,"A Freudian slip on my part. I do apologise to the MainAustralian Electoral Commission since I have been on the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters, since being elected to this place. Recently-within the last day, in fact-legislation was passed in the House of Representatives, which is going to go before the Senate, on the early closure of the rolls and provisional voting. I want to remind this place that at least 50,000 people we know of, on the basis of past experience, would have enrolled during the traditional seven-day period of grace after the calling of the last election, but they were prevented from doing so at the last election because of the early closure of the roll. Many more were disenfranchised by being taken off the roll by the AEC when they changed their address and were deterred from re-enrolling by the more onerous enrolment and identification requirements. Let me remind the House again of the context in which these changes were made at the last federal election. Emeritus Professor Colin Hughes, the highly respected former Electoral Commissioner, and Brian Costar wrote in 2005 that there was a: … thorough review of the electoral roll conducted in 2002 by the Australian National Audit Office, which concluded “that, overall, the Australian electoral roll is one of high integrity, and can be relied on for electoral purposes”. There are adequate safeguards in the current electoral laws and procedures to deal with any future attempts at fraud without stripping the vote from hundreds of thousands of citizens The inquiry by the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters into the 2007 election received a submission from the Australian Electoral Commission, the impartial organisation that runs Australia’s elections to our great credit. In fact, its model is used by agencies all over the world for the running of other elections. The AEC submission said: ... it can be clearly stated, in relation to false identities, that there has never been any evidence of widespread or organised enrolment fraud in Australia. It is very interesting to review the various claims that have been made about this. I think the member for Banks dealt with this in his remarks on the recent bill. I urge senators to understand what happens. Sometimes in seats there is evidence of multiple voting. The highly professional people in the Australian Electoral Commission go into it and examine why names appear on certain occasions. In table 2.3 on page 18 of the Australian Electoral Commission’s report, the following really relevant piece of information appears. This was pointed out by the member for Banks. In the admissions by age category, 98 per cent of people involved in multiple voting were 70 and over. Of the 64 cases referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions, 25 were subsequently investigated by the AFP and no cases were referred back to the DPP. The small evidence that there is of so-called electoral fraud is mainly committed by people in our electorates who are in nursing homes. They might vote in mobile booths and then, confused and perhaps forgetful, vote on election day or perhaps in some other prepolling arrangement because they have forgotten that they have voted. There is no evidence of widespread electoral fraud in Australia. Let me turn to the effect of the change in the photographic proof of identity requirement if you show up and claim a provisional vote but are not registered on the roll. You show up, according to the member for Banks, and have to produce a drivers licence. If you do not have it, you get a provisional vote. If you do not produce your licence within so many days, your vote will not count. That provision alone has resulted in a massive increase in the number of votes MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Adjournment
272,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (12.23 Pm),"I want to return to an area of interest of minerejected. In 2004, there were 89,841 votes rejected. In 2007, there were 143,470 votes rejected. That is over 40,000 more votes rejected. The traditional way we dealt with this-and under which the current opposition won many elections where there were no accusations of fraud-when people who had moved within their electorate turned up for a provisional vote was that the Electoral Commissioner took down their provisional vote and took a copy of their signature. Then they went back to the Electoral Commission some days later to see whether they were included in the roll. If they were not then they were excluded. (Time expired) Paterson Electorate: Ambulance Crews community who may one day have to rely on an ambulance and the expertise of those on board. The New South Wales Labor government has a plan to use volunteer ambulance drivers in Stroud, Gloucester and Bulahdelah, which all fall within my electorate of Paterson. This is extremely concerning. It is a thoughtless, penny-pinching way of trying to make up for the fact that neither our state nor our federal Labor governments have provided enough funding to train adequate numbers for the ambulance corps. I must make it very clear that volunteers are the absolute backbone of our society. They do tireless work, not only without pay but often without thanks or recognition. I sincerely thank them. However, responding to a stressful and often life-threatening medical situation of this magnitude is not a job for volunteers. This is a responsibility that should only be given to the most highly trained, professional paramedics working in teams of two so that lives can saved. Allow me to give some background on the training of our paramedics. Firstly, there are qualified paramedics. These people have done at least three years of intensive training, including four written exams and 10 months probation on the road. They then move on to be a paramedic intern. This involves another two years of practice, mentoring and more intensive training. They would have many skills, including CPR and haemorrhage control, and an intimate knowledge of the many different drugs. They have to requalify every 18 months. Finally, there are intensive care paramedics, who deal with even more serious cases, including cardiac care. An ICP can administer 27 specialist medications to both adults and children. Clearly, these are people who are highly trained to deal with emergency situations and to give patients quick, accurate and vital medical care. They have years of intense training and in many cases decades of experience on the road. These are people who should not be replaced by volunteers, should not be responsible for volunteers and should be supported and protected by a professional colleague in a two-person crew. These two-person crews are vitally important so that each and every life-saving treatment can be delivered. If volunteers are used, this simply cannot happen. For example, in the outer Hunter, paramedics are authorised to give two specialised medications to someone having a heart attack. But, according to protocol, this medication cannot be used unless two paramedics agree that the patient meets the criteria. So, if there is only one trained paramedic on the scene, the patient just has to go without. This could be the difference between a life saved and a life lost. Another important consideration for paramedics in my electorate is the roads through Gloucester, Stroud and Bulahdelah, which are dangerous black spots. This means that the likelihood of a motor vehicle accident needing an ambulance is a very real possibility. Under MAIN COMMITTEE",167,Adjournment
273,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (12.27 Pm),"I rise today as a concerned member of my localLabor’s plans, volunteers would have to be phoned up at all hours of the night and drive these same roads to get to the ambulance station. Are we seriously supposed to believe this is a workable and safe idea? I note these measures have only been suggested for regional towns, and so I ask our Labor governments: why should those of us in regional areas have to put up with substandard ambulance services? Are our lives and our safety of less value than those in the city? I have started a petition to stop this reckless proposal, and I have strong support. Already there are over 200 members of my Facebook cause page against this idea. It is my job to take action on behalf of concerned constituents. It is also important that I take action because local Health Services Union organiser, Jim Arneman, has failed to bring about a solution to this problem, despite his position in the union and the Labor Party. Mr Arneman has been quick to speak on this issue, but his action has been extremely lacking. In the media this week Mr Arneman blames the New South Wales ambulance service for this plan, even though it is our state Labor government which has failed to invest enough money to train adequate paramedics. Some local ambulance drivers have even told me they left the HSU because they were not being properly represented. A new body, the Emergency Medical Service Protection Association, has now been established and has more than 700 members. While volunteers are absolutely vital in keeping our society running smoothly, they do not have a place as ambulance drivers. The New South Wales and Australian Labor governments need to take action now to ensure that enough paramedics are trained for two-person crews right across New South Wales-regional and city areas alike-as patients such as those in Paterson deserve the best care possible, and that means fully trained, properly qualified ambulance crews, not crews manned by volunteers. Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program Ms KING (Ballarat) (12.32 pm)-I am pleased to stand here today and recognise the important changes brought about across my electorate over the past 12 months through the government’s Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program. The program is part of the Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan and in round 1 it has seen more than $1 billion invested in communities across Australia since it was introduced in November 2008. The program was designed to stimulate local economies and support employment by building community projects. By providing funding, the government empowers local councils and shires to identify infrastructure projects that most benefit local communities. In my electorate, for example, nearly 40 projects received funding totalling $9,780,000 last year. These ranged in size from $5 million to upgrade facilities and amenities at the Eureka interpretive centre and $2.24 million for the construction of a multipurpose community recreation centre in Creswick, to a smaller and wonderfully diverse range of grassroots projects. Across the Ballarat electorate we have seen footpath extensions and installations, drinking fountains installed in playgrounds, new playground equipment, resurfacing of cricket pitches, improvements to public pools and sporting facilities, improvements to public irrigation systems, and even the laying of a walking track in the township of Korweinguboora. While many of these small projects fly under the radar of media and wide public attention, we should not underestimate the power of even the smallest infrastructure improvements to have a profound effect on local communities.

274,Mr Hunt,"Pink batts!of new public barbecue facilities with residents in the small town of Elaine, towards the southern boundary of my electorate. On a cool and windy day we sheltered under a pergola and shared cups of tea and cake. The residents told me that the barbecue had become almost a de facto town centre, a place for locals to meet, get together, cook a chop or a sausage and share news and friendship. They were also hopeful it might encourage travellers between Ballarat and Geelong to pull over and take time out from the road at Elaine. At $9½ thousand dollars, which also included resurfacing the reserve car park, it was one of the smallest RLCIP projects in my electorate last year, but it has made a significant difference to this vibrant community. In the town of Ballan $56,000 was invested in refurbishing the outdoor pool. This included works to the change rooms, upgrading first aid amenities and plant controls. Again, the work was probably long overdue and it has made a real difference to the lives of Ballan locals over the summer. In Trentham, another small town in my electorate which has an increasingly vibrant tourism scene, $30,000 was invested in improving the public toilets. This included installation of water tanks, diversion of stormwater and other water-saving devices. In Bacchus Marsh the tennis courts at Maddingley Park have had lighting installed to extend their use at night. I congratulate the three local councils in my electorate that have both recommended these projects and worked so hard to complete them within the allocated time frames. I am certainly proud of the way the City of Ballarat, the shires of Moorabool and Hepburn and also Golden Plains shire, a small part of which is in my electorate, have administered these projects. The federal government has pushed these councils hard and they have responded quite magnificently. The program has been a magnificent example of the federal government working in partnership with local governments to provide tangible on-the-ground benefits to communities. I also note the program’s success in creating and sustaining jobs throughout the global financial crisis. Dozens of small businesses, tradies, building supply companies, local landscapers, plumbers, electricians and others across my electorate have all put up their hands for this work. I congratulate them on the quality of their involvement. Last week I was back in Trentham, this time inspecting change rooms at the rec reserve. It was another cold, very wet and windy day and it was gusting through the broken windows. I just imagined what it was like for those local sportspeople to use those facilities. We were able to announce that the Trentham change rooms would be one of the first facilities to benefit out of the further 19 ready-to-go projects of $1.1 million across the electorate of Ballarat. That they convinced Hepburn shire their RLCIP project should be the first cab off the rank is an enormous testament to the way the Trentham Football Club and the recreation reserve put forward that project. It has been a very good program for local councils and I certainly commend it to this chamber. Flinders Electorate: Gunnamatta Outfall my electorate. This is an outfall which sees 150 billion litres of partially treated sewage dumped off the coast every year. Four hundred million litres of partially treated sewage is dumped off the coast at one of Australia’s great surf beaches every day. Seventeen million MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Adjournment
275,Ms King,I can tell you who is bats! Only last week I was out celebrating the installation,170,Adjournment
276,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (12.37 Pm),"I want to speak in relation to the Gunnamatta outfall inlitres of partially treated sewage on average is dumped every hour, every day, every year. What we see here are two things, the first of which is a vile pollution of our coasts. In the 21st century we are using a 19th century approach which pollutes our coasts, wastes water and dumps it off the coast. That is unacceptable. Secondly, this is a monumental waste of a valuable resource, water, which could be recycled for industry and agriculture. Against that background I am delighted to say that the Victorian EPA has finally given the go-ahead for an upgrade to the Eastern Treatment Plant. That is a fantastic result for the Mornington Peninsula which should see class A water discharged at Gunnamatta within the next 18 months. That is part 1 of the two-part process, the first part of which is to clean up this water to make sure that the coast is dramatically improved. That is a great step forward. It is a huge victory for the Clean Ocean Foundation. It is what as a peninsula, as a community, as a group of people, we have argued for. I congratulate the surfing associations, the Clean Ocean Foundation, the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council and the general community of the Mornington Peninsula. They have all worked towards this moment. Gunnamatta is on its way to being cleaned up. The next step, however, is very simple. There must be uses found so that this water is not wasted and discharged off the coast-so that this water, which will be cleaned up, is reused for industry and agriculture. This could include recharge of the aquifers in Boneo on the southern peninsula. If we can recharge the aquifers we can work to ensure that the salt infiltration, which is currently threatening parts of the aquifer system, does not occur. If we can recharge it, that is the perfect vehicle for using that water for local industry and, in particular, local agriculture throughout the Boneo region. That is the step forward which must now occur. The first step of cleaning up the outfall is underway. I am delighted and proud to see that we as a peninsula have been successful and I pay tribute to the work of the Clean Ocean Foundation. We must now push the state to ensure that this water is recycled for industry and agriculture, to take the pressure off using our drinking water, which should not be used for those purposes where recycled water is available. We must also ensure that there is a long term health management plan for the southern peninsula’s aquifers. Against that background, I also want to make reference to one other group on the southern peninsula and that is the Mornington Peninsula Human Rights Group. Helen Howells, Chair of the Mornington Peninsula Human Rights Group, has approached me. She has asked that I table a petition, with 117 signatories, calling for a federal human rights act. I am happy to do that. I made that pledge to Helen and I now so do. I present this petition from 117 different representatives, two-thirds of whom, I am advised, are from the Mornington Peninsula. I thank the House. Hunter Electorate the next three years, the Hunter electorate has experienced and will experience unprecedented levels of infrastructure funding from the Commonwealth government. Just to give a few examples: $1.65 billion for the Hunter Expressway; $1.2 billion to enlarge capacity and efficiency of the Hunter coal chain; and $134 million on Building the Education Revolution and on our VET-that is, vocational education and training-facilities in the electorate. The funding also includes $3.3 million on social housing, more than $5.5 million on the regional local infrastructure program, $1.36 million for defence housing, around $140 million on expansion MAIN COMMITTEE",170,Adjournment
277,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter) (12.41 Pm),"Over the past 12 months or so and, in turn, overand improvements to the Singleton infantry centre, and $4.56 million on the Black Spot Program. These are all critical projects for the Hunter electorate and, indeed, for the Hunter region. Let me dwell on a couple of them for a moment. The Hunter Expressway has been on the drawing board for around 20 years. It is absolutely critical to economic efficiency in the region and, of course, will bring much needed relief for motorists who spend a terrible peak hour every morning and afternoon trying to make their way from the Upper and Lower Hunter regions. The expressway will also provide much needed bypasses for a number of communities throughout my electorate which have had to put up with heavy vehicle movements for many years. It took a Labor government to conceive and plan the idea and it took a Labor government to fund the project, after almost 12 years of stalling on the part of the former government. The coal chain is obviously important not only to my electorate but also to the region more generally. The $1.2 billion spent will allow us to move more coal to port more quickly and more efficiently by putting in an additional dedicated rail line and removing gradients along the way, which slow down trains, and also removing railway level crossings along the way. That will also promote efficiency. As we upgrade the port to a similar capacity, this will make a big difference to the coal industry and therefore to the region’s wealth. Schools speak for themselves. As you know, every primary school not only in my electorate but in all electorates will receive new facilities, typically libraries, school halls et cetera. The regional and local infrastructure program has allowed councils to build or upgrade parks, swimming pools and amenities blocks. Members are familiar with the projects-they go on and on-and they have been a real boon to each of the local government areas in my electorate. Social housing speaks for itself as does, of course, the upgrades to the Singleton Infantry Centre, a key driver for the electorate but in particular a key driver for the Singleton Shire Council area. Amongst the schools and education funding streams we have new science and language centres et cetera, with places like Cessnock High School, Kurri Kurri High School and St Joseph’s High School in Aberdeen receiving science and language centres. In Kurri Kurri nearly $8 million will be spent on TAFE facilities. The list goes on and on and it is great news for the electorate. Ironically, this is fuelling additional growth in the electorate and that additional growth will call on more and more investment. One of the ironic consequences of the Hunter Expressway, for example, will be a greater need for bypasses of both Singleton and Muswellbrook as more traffic flows up the New England Highway. In Scone we have the ridiculous situation in the 21st century where coal trains go across a level crossing on the New England Highway, cutting off the town for up to eight minutes-a ridiculous situation and something which I am determined to resolve in partnership with the state government. The state government has primary responsibility for it, but I am talking to Minister Albanese about how the federal government may be able to assist in what is a critical issue for Scone; not one which just goes to convenience but one which goes to the safety and welfare of the residents of that town. Ms Jessica Watson has well and truly completed two-thirds of her journey around the world and is on her way home. The teenage adventurer from Buderim on the Sunshine Coast has shown immense MAIN COMMITTEE",171,Adjournment
278,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (12.46 Pm),"I am particularly pleased to say that Jessica Watsoncourage, strength and determination in pursuit of her dream to be the youngest person to sail solo around the world. She is truly an inspiration to many, and has proven to many people around the world that with determination, self-belief and preparation anything is possible. Today, 11 March, marks the 145th day of Jessica’s journey. She has completed some 16,500 nautical miles, and has fewer than 6,000 nautical miles remaining until she arrives at her destination, Sydney. Jessica and her pink boat, Ella’s Pink Lady, are on the homeward stretch and due to finish their journey and arrive back in Australia in late April or May. She is currently 700 nautical miles-about 1,300 kilometres-east of the southern tip of South Africa. On behalf of the residents of Fisher, I would like to formally congratulate Jessica for what she has set out to do, what she has done so far and for the inspiration and encouragement she is generating for all young people around Australia and the world from the message she is spreading: they should dare to dream big and achieve big. At 16 years of age, Jessica attracted both praise and criticism before she embarked on her journey in October 2009. She also battled equipment failure and mishaps on her practice voyage, but she has proven to date that often times it is the right thing to ignore the detractors and chase your goal. Jessica’s journey has highlighted the fact that it is important in this world that we still have people who are adventurers and innovators, and inventors and dreamers; people who will blaze new trails and attempt new things so that mankind can still discover the things that can only be discovered by taking a risk and going out on a limb. Jessica Watson should be proud that she can be classed among those valuable people. I want to point out that Jessica has a very informative website that includes regular diary entries, videos, a map of her journey so far and a blogspot where members and residents who are following her progress are able to catch up and leave a comment. It is not uncommon for her to have up to 250 comments posted in response to her diary entries. On Monday alonethat is, 8 March-there were an amazing 982 comments. It is fascinating to read some of those blog entries and get an idea of the inspiration that Jessica is imparting to those back home in Australia and all around the world who are following her journey so closely. Her diary entries to followers are well-written, interesting and unpretentious. They convey a real sense that she is bringing all of these regular readers along on her journey. For those who have not yet visited the website, it is great to read and I encourage you to have a look at www.jessicawatson.com.au. Jessica has shown wisdom and skill beyond her years, and I wish her every success, safety and fun on the remaining part of her journey. I thought I might read in the time available to me an extract from today’s diary entry: First off, a huge thanks for all the book title ideas. That was a pretty amazing response and certainly gave us plenty to think about, as well as a lot of laughs! So thanks again. Ella’s Pink Lady hasn’t been breaking any speed records lately but we are sailing along steadily. Yesterday was pretty slow but today’s been better. The sunshine and calm seas continue, so we’re not exactly doing it too hard. But when the speedo drops below 3 knots it becomes a bit of a test of my patience. It’s not that I’m in any terrible rush, because I’m having such a good time still, it’s just that it feels so much more purposeful to be going somewhere. The warm sunshine, amazing starry nights and lovely pink sunsets put in me in a great mood, but add speed as well and I’m one happy girl! MAIN COMMITTEE Another great thing about the quiet conditions is that I’ve been able to leave the front hatch open, which is doing wonders at giving the cabin a nice freshen up. It is really helping my efforts to keep the mould and damp at bay. You wouldn’t believe some of the places I’m finding little patches of mould. The damp works its way in everywhere, for example all the zips on my jeans have corroded into place which is a little annoying! Finally, I’m relieved and pleased to be able to report that the dunny is back in action, the problem was some tiny bits of grit stuck in the pressure relief/air valve. Jessica Watson is an inspirational young lady. She is 16 years of age and is doing something that makes her a role model for all young people in Australia. Australia needs many more young people like Jessica Watson. I applaud her, I salute her, I congratulate her and I look forward to her safe return home. Cunningham Electorate: Overseas Students Ms BIRD (Cunningham) (12.51 pm)-I endorse the comments of the member for Fisher about the amazing efforts of Jessica Watson. I think a lot of young people are interested in following her journey and are inspired by it. I want to talk today about an event that I attended in my local area during the past non-sitting week of the parliament. The University of Wollongong has a very significant intake of international students each year. It has a great reputation, and I would be a bit biased in saying that that is, by and large, a result of the fact that we are such a wonderful part of the nation. For students coming from overseas it is a city without being a place where you can get lost, like you can in the big cities. Certainly Wollongong has proved very attractive to international students for quite a long time. This is the third year that the university has put this function on, and I put on the record my great commendation of those at the university’s international student centre who organised this. It is called a welcome to Wollongong event for international students, and it has a twofold effect. Firstly, it makes those students and their parents or family who are there with them at the beginning of their studies feel welcome and confident that the students, who have come so far to study in Australia, will be part of and valued in the community where they are studying. Secondly, it also enables the community to get to know these young people and to feel comfortable and confident that these young people are bringing real value, interest and diversity to our community. I was invited to address the event, which was held at the Illawarra Performing Arts Centre. It is about a 500-seat auditorium and it was full. It was just wonderful to look out and see young faces from around the world, in all their diversity, coming into our area to study, full of hopes for their future and dreams of what their qualifications will allow them to do with their lives. It was a really good event. The event itself was not only for students of the university, although it had facilitated it; it was also for students who are coming to study at our TAFEs and indeed for some students who are coming to study in our schools. So it was across all the sectors for international students in our region. I spoke to them about why I am so passionate about international student engagement in Australia. When I gave the speech the report of the Baird review into vocational sector issues had not been handed to government, but it has since and I recognise the efforts of Mr Baird, a former colleague on the economics committee of this House during the period of the past government, in that critically important area. Not only is there the economic issue. These young people come to a region like ours to study and they spend money in the area, but the interest that they create in their home country MAIN COMMITTEE amongst their families and friends, encouraging them to visit as tourists, is really valuable. Decades ago, post World War II, many countries in the West started scholarships and programs to encourage people from developing countries to study in their country. The principles that lay behind those schemes at the time are just as relevant in today’s world-that is, the more we know each other the less we fear each other. It is a really important component of international peace and friendship. When people travel to another nation, with a different culture, a different language and a different religious base, and they form friendships, they go away with a positive feeling about that place, and that contributes to a much happier world across all the challenges that we face in modern times. I challenge young people-as their parents and their teachers would be telling them-to not only study hard and get a good qualification but also make friendships, learn about the place they were and become lifetime ambassadors about world peace and understanding of difference and diversity. It was a wonderful event. We went from the hall to the open area. There were stalls, dancing, music and food. I commend the organisers of the event. It is a great initiative. I reaffirm my great commitment to the importance and value of international students studying in Australia and our value of their work. Barker Electorate: Kimberley-Clark Australia an issue of great concern and angst in my electorate. It concerns the Kimberley-Clark mill in the township of Millicent. Millicent is in my electorate of Barker. It is a town with a little over 5,000 people and about 700 of those are employed at the Kimberly-Clark factory. The Kimberly-Clark factory uses a lot of our wood products and produces tissues, toilet paper and that sort of thing. The government, quite rightly, commissioned a report into whether, under WTO rules, tissue is being dumped in Australia by Indonesia, Thailand and China-countries like that. That report showed that, yes, those countries were dumping tissue and toilet paper in Australia to a quite extensive amount and up to 60 per cent below the cost of production. When you are faced with that sort of evidence-that product is actually being dumped in Australia, which affects what is produced in Australia and is competing unfairly with what is produced in Australia. I would have thought that the government would have said, ‘We’re going to impose some penalties in the form of tariffs or whatever on the tissue that is being dumped in Australia.’ But, unfortunately, about four weeks ago the Attorney-General announced that they were not going to take any action. That really surprises me. It would really concern me if this company, which has invested millions of dollars into some of the latest technology, world’s best technology, to produce tissue and toilet paper in Australia, is affected and has to close up shop. That would be an absolute travesty. As the Prime Minister said, we want a country that makes things, not just imports things. This decision needs a rethink by the government because, under the WTO rules, we have the right to impose penalties on the dumped product. I am just amazed that they have not done so.

Ms Kate Ellis-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: Total expenses are yet to be finalised. Hearing Services (Question No. 1193) Mr Oakeshott asked the Minister for Ageing, in writing, on 4 February 2010: Why does the Government cover 100 per cent of the cost of treating hearing impediments with hearing aids, but not for hearing impediments beyond the benefit of hearing aids, ie cochlear implants, and what will it do to rectify this inequity. Mrs Elliot-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The Commonwealth provides funding under the Australian Government Hearing Services Program (the Program) through Australian Hearing’s Community Service Obligations, for cochlear processor upgrades, replacements, repairs and maintenance for children and young adults up to the age of 21 years. The cochlear device itself is treated as a surgically implanted prosthetic device and is funded either through public hospital arrangements or private health insurance, Medicare benefits are provided for the surgery for private patients and any follow-up treatment. Implantable hearing devices (such as cochlear implants) are provided under a range of Commonwealth and state/territory funding arrangements. The Commonwealth provides funds to each state and territory government to assist with the cost of providing public hospital services, to enable these devices to be provided free of charge to public patients. Additionally, the Commonwealth provides support through legislated minimum benefits that private health insurers must pay for cochlear implants that are included on the Prostheses List and funds services through Medicare.
