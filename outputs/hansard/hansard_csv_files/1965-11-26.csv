17,Dr. Forbes,"I read reports of thisI have already initiated inquiries to find out whether the reports are correct and whether Australian soldiers in South Vietnam are affected in any way. When these inquiries are completed I will give the honourable member further information. So far I have had no reports that the drugs being used by Australian soldiers have not proved effective against malaria. If there were any doubt about their effectiveness I think I would have heard of it because the Director-General of Medical Services has arrived back only in the last few days from a tour in South Vietnam during which he has been looking at matters such as this. However, I will give the honorable member further information when I have concluded my inquiries. Minister for Health a question. Is it a fact that many Aborigines in the Northern Territory have died as a result of an epidemic of measles? Is the Minister aware that the Government of Western Australia has for some time been carrying out a programme of immunisation of Aborigines against measles? Why has not a similar border area as part of their long-established programme been carried out in the Northern normal routine of maintaining contact with Territory, and what steps have been taken isolated areas throughout the Territory. to remedy the existing situation? this matter last night. The measles epidemic in the Northern Territory has reached fairly serious proportions. It is amongst the Aboriginal population in Arnhem Land. We have diverted practically the whole of our medical resources in the Northern Territory to this area to deal with it. So far, the epidemic has been just contained. If it appears likely to continue, we will undertake a vaccination campaign. The reason why we have not yet undertaken vaccination in this area is that we are not certain of the effectiveness of the vaccine that is produced in the United States of America. Reports indicate that it is only partly effective. Under the present circumstances, it will be used by us only as a last resort. I can assure the honourable member that, if the epidemic continues, we will try everything possible to prevent further deaths and see that the best possible assistance is provided. WEST NEW GUINEA. to the Acting Minister for Defence. Is there any substance in a report that an Australian Army patrol has been airlifted into west New Guinea in a combined operation to clear helicopter landing strips close to the Indonesian border? Are troops from the Pacific Islands Regiment spending a period of one month on this border? If so, what work are these troops carrying out? when I saw a statement on this matter in the "" Australian"" of, I think, yesterday, and I made some inquiries. 1 would like to be precise in the answer which I give to the question. There are no visiting Australian troops currently located or engaged in building helicopter pads close to the Indonesian border. There are some Australian troops presendy undergoing routine acclimatisation and orientation training approximately 100 miles from the border. Current operations by troops of the Pacific Islands Regiment are not, as suggested, part of any plan related to West Irian. Pacific Islands Regiment troops patrol the general Their work in clearing helicopter pads is designed to facilitate such routine patrolling. ARMY OPERATIONS. the Minister for the Army. As Army operation "" Sprinkler Two"" is reported to have been delayed by the late arrival of chartered aircraft, I ask: What plans are in hand to correct the position of the Army's dependency on civilian transport? As there are known cases where Ansett-A.N.A. has had to borrow or charter planes from Trans-Australia Airlines to meet its additional commitments, will the Mmister say what percentage of Army transport contracts are let to each of our two major airlines? ledge, the arrangements made by the Army to charter aircraft from the civilian airlines for this purpose or for any other purpose have been satisfactory.

The 260 tons came into competition which they are quite rightly convinced will with a domestic production of cheese of react to their very great detriment? Is the about 60,000 tons. The effect of the free Minister interested in consulting the farmers trade area will be to permit in the first only when he is reasonably sure beforehand two years a maximum of 400 tons of cheese that they will agree with what he proposes a year to be imported.

30,Mr Mcewen,"The honourable memberA calculation based on the worse assessment that the importing of 100 additional tons of cheddar cheese from New Zealand will require the Australian dairy industry to export an additional 100 tons at a realisation of some pennies a pound less than the domestic realisation shows, my advisers tell me, that the price reduction in terms of butter fat and the return to the dairy farmer will be one-tenth of a farthing per lb. That is not serious for the dairy industry. But there are advantages that flow from this. In the first place, where there has hitherto never been any limit on the quantity of cheese that could be imported from New Zealand, the Agreement itself stipulates that there shall be a quantity limitation in each of the first two years of 400 tons and, in the fifth year and thereafter, of 1,000 tons a year. is getting hurt on cheese and I shall hurt him worse on pig meats in a moment. The dairy industry will lose, at the outset, one-tenth of a farthing a pound and in the fifth year a little more. As against that there will be, by a treaty signed, a ceiling afterfiveyears of 1,000 tons a year upon the quantity of cheddar cheese that can come in from New Zealand. There will be, for the first time, a condition that this cheese will only come into Australia at a price agreed between the Dairy Board of New Zealand and the Australian Dairy Produce Board. A reference has aheady been made to the Tariff Board to consider whether cheeses other than cheddar cheese require further protection in Australia. This was requested for the dairy industry and was accorded. These events occur in circumstances in which this Parliament has been voting regularly each year £ l i million for the support of the Australian cheese industry. The dairy industry is not going to be hurt by this. I address myself to the whole of the Australian Labour Party and say this: The greatest market for Australian manufactured goods-and it is in manufacture that employment is mostly created in Australia-is the New Zealand market. I would ask the whole of the Australian Labour Party, in the interests of the workers in this country as well as in the interests of the relationship between Australia and New Zealand, to pause before engaging in a campaign to try to destroy an amicable arrangement which is mutually good for our two countries. Minister for Trade and Industry. It refers to the efforts of the right honourable gentleman to seek an increase in sales for certain Australian exports in Japan. Did he find any likelihood of increases in sales of Australian wines and brandies, in view of the serious surplus existing in these industries, or alternatively of canned or dried fruits? Secondly, did he find the increasing trend of demand for Australian cheese-chedda r cheese-in Japan maintaining its rate of increase, which could alleviate any over-supply of cheddar cheese on the Australian markets? of trade in Japan, it became clear, as I and others have known, that the Japanese are not, by and large, drinkers of the type of wine that we produce. There is but a modest importation of Australian wine and brandy and I could not hold hopes, in my own judgment, that there will be a substantial increase in the importation to Japan of Australian wine or brandy, or a very big increase in the importation of canned fruit, because Japan is a very big exporter of certain types of canned fruit, particularly mandarins. There has been a very heartening expansion of the importation of Australian cheese. I had discussions about butter, in respect of which our prospects do not appear to be good, but I am hopeful that these may be improved. The great opportunities for Australian foodstuffs in Japan are to be found, in the first place, in sugar and in wheat. I believe there will be a substantial increase in the exports of Australian beef to Japan. There is no limitation today on the importation of Australian sheep meat into Japan. These are the industries to which we can look for substantial expansion, but there has been quite a big expansion in cheese exports to Japan.

I preface it by saying that you have always impartially and, I think, correctly reproved members who have sought to use question time for the purpose of disseminating political propaganda rather than to seek information. Has your attention been drawn to a comparison made by a well known political correspondent between the operation of question time in the House of Commons and in this House wherein he states that our question time suffers because of the verbosity of Ministers in replying to questions? Could the practice adopted by some Ministers of using question dme as a vehicle for blatant party politics, as on two occasions yesterday, be considered? questions without notice-o r question time, as the honourable member described it-is a matter for the Standing Orders Committee. With regard to procedures in the House, the Chair is dependent entirely upon the co-operation and goodwill of all honourable members. Faults are not to be found on one side only. Every effort is made to enable the business to flow smoothly. However, a few honourable members are inclined to disregard this aim, and that makes things very difficult for the Chair. At times an honourable member may appear to be a little more severly dealt with than the circumstances would seem to warrant, but honourable members do not always see the pattern of conduct from the rear. whether, under the arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States of New South Wales and Queensland for drought relief, it is permissible for the State Governments to provide loan funds from the State Treasuries, administered by a State rural or agricultural bank, to be made available through the agency of normal lending institudons to bona fide drought long term low interest loans for carry-on and restocking purposes, provided applicants are regarded by State authorities to be appropriately qualified for such assistance. as the Prime Minister has pointed out to the House, we have conveyed to the Premiers of the drought affected States a general expression of the willingness of the Commonwealth Government to support financial action which the State Governments believe to be necessary in order to assist drought affected farmers to carry on their farming operations and to deal with difficulties they have experienced as a result of the drought. We have not attempted to lay down in any detail how this should be done. We believe that the State Governments are in a better position than is the Commonwealth Government to decide the needs of those affected inside the boundaries of their States and the use that can be made of the appropriate State instrumentalities for this purpose. I believe that the State rural banks are well suited to deal with requests which might come for special assistance. To the extent that the State Governments found it convenient to make finance available for this purpose through those instrumentalities, that would enjoy the support of the Commonwealth Government.

Let me tell the House, in terms as strong as I can use, that I object to this legislation. I object to it because, in my view, it opens up the way for unjustifiable intrusion into the normal business affairs of secondary industry and tertiary industry and intrusion by the Government and its officers into the affairs of free enterprise, about which they know very little. We, as a Liberal Party and Country Party coalition, have gone to the polls at every election since 1949 on the promise that, as a Government, we would set the canvas to enable free enterprise to carry out its affairs in the normal and proper way. We were swept to the Government benches in 1949 on the promise that we would give relief to industry, commerce and trade from oppressive legislation then on the statute book and placed there by the Australian Labour Party. As I have said, since then we have gone to the polls on the central premise that it was the job of private enterprise to bring that time we have gone into each election campaign saying that the economy was booming, that there was very little inflation of an unrestricting Government formed by tions.

67,Mr Whittorn (Balaclava) [10.17],"very limited areas. The Government and particularly the Attorney-General should specify more definitely where these areas are. Neither the present Attorney-General nor his predecessor, Sir Garfield Barwick, has made any attempt to specify the areas in which the protection of the public interest will best be effected by this restrictive form of legislation. In April last year, when addressing a seminar on restrictive trade practices convened by the Victorian Employers Federation, the Attorney General was questioned about public interest. In reply he saidI have never seen a piece of legislation in which the legislator or the draftsmenHe meant the Parliamentary Draftsman and his stafffelt confident to define public interest, because public interest changes from day to day, almost certainly from year to year. ral said it when addressing a seminar convened by the Victorian Employers Federation in April 1964. That tells me, Sir, that when the Commissioner of Trade Practices and the Trade Practices Tribunal get under way they will be able to change the form of attempts at encroachment on industry and private enterprise from day to day, almost certainly from year to year. I say that the Government must define the restrictive trade practices that apparendy prevail in this country. It must define them more specifically and more lucidly so that industry and private enterprise will know what this legislation is about. We as a government will be responsible for its gazettal and in 5, 10 or SO years' time it will be useless for members of a free enterprise government to say that we at this time did not intend the legislation to be altered or interpreted in the way in which changes will be effected over the years by succeeding governments, the Commissioner and the Tribunal. Once the Government defines more specifically what restrictions have been taking place in trade and industry the list can be added to or reduced as experience shows changes to be necessary. But the present Attorney-General and, indeed, the Government want us to go ahead full blast in attacking this problem. They want us to use a sledgehammer to frighten industry and commerce into submission. I say that this Bill will serve no useful purpose in protecting the public interest. That is why I object strongly to the imprecision and uncertainty to which it will subject chief executives of commerce and industry throughout Australia. The previous Attorney-General, Sir Garfield Barwick, stated that he and officers of the Department had made what he described as extensive investigations in all States of the Commonwealth and he was convinced that practices not conducive to the public interest were in operation. Let me quote his words. He saidDuring my investigations . . . I have accumulated a good deal of material as to the existence of various practices in the Australian community. Of course, there are plenty of practices in the Australian community that have nothing to do with businesses and nothing to do with the public and they are good for the people who practice them. But the Attorney-General-bot h the previous one and this one-hav e been far too general in their explanations of the advantages to be gained by the public from legislation of this type. If the investigations made by the previous Attorney-General and by his Department were so wide, then the present Attorney-General should be able to nominate, not only industries, but the particular firms that are using these practices to prevail over other firms. I feel sure that when the present Attorney-General was a back bencher he prepared some of the information that was referred to by Sir Garfield Barwick. This measure, I feel, is an intrusion into the affairs of private enterprise and the statement that we are now freeing private enterprise of its own restrictions does not make sense. The history of trade practices legislation in other countries, particularly in the United Kingdom and in the United States of America, has produced substantial and authoritative opinion that legislative action is not effective in enforcing competition throughout the economy. How can the businessman be induced to change his tactics in his business approach by enforcement? How can a public servant talk to a businessman and say: "" Thou shalt do this in this way; thou shalt do that in some other way ""? The businessman has been trained to use the way he knows best.",21,Trade Practices Bill 1965

In May of duced by the Bureau of Census and Statistics this year the present Attorney-General and which was given to me by the Institute delivered to the Parliament his second of Public Affairs. In 1950 an average male reading speech on this legislation and even factory employee needed to work for 14,500 General's Department five years to issue to this Parliament a piece of creaky legisI say that it is meddlesome because it It is my view, as I have said, that it is private enterprise that has transformed the From the point of view of public benefit, hours to purchase a home. In 1965 he needs to work for 9,200 hours or less than three-quarters of the time that he needed to work in 1950. To purchase a bedroom suite he needed to work for 200 hours in 1950 but in 1965 he needs to work for only 150 hours. That takes into account the same bedroom suite and the increased prices that prevail in 1965. To purchase a Holden car, which is a working man's car, he needed to work for 3,770 hours in 1950 but in 1965 he needs to work for only 1,950 hours. I have on my list nine items that are useful to a man who runs a home and who is looking after his family. In 1950 this man would have needed to work for 19,137 hours to purchase those items, but in 1965 he would need to work only 11,560 hours. In other words, the little man in the community-thi s is where public interest comes in-need s to work now only 60 per cent, of the time that he needed to work in 1950 to buy the same items. Let us hear an explanation from the Attorney-General, and from the Opposition if you like, about where public interest fits into a set-up like that. Many members of this House must be descended from Rip Van Winkle. Otherwise they would not talk about public interest as they do. Apparently many honourable members cannot appreciate what private enterprise-industr y and commerce-ha s done for Australia generally and for the working man in particular. If they take the trouble to do a little research and read some of the information that has been made available by the Bureau of Census and Statistics and other bodies in the community, they must come to the conclusion, as I have, that today the working man is affluent and can do things that he never expected in 1950 to be able to do. The only time that members on this side of the House talk about what private enterprise has done for the community and about what the Government has done to set the pattern to ensure that private enterprise will be able to do as they suggest is at election time, when we go to the polls and tell the populace how good we have been in setting that pattern for private enterprise. But now we are prepared to introduce this aggressive, oppressive legisthat only certain well defined practices are covered lation to control this section of the community which has done excellent work for Australia. I wonder why the chief executives of companies have not been more vocal. They have had opportunities to tell the Government a good deal about this legislation. I should say that they have not been vocal because they have not really understood how powerful this legislation will be or how wide will be its scope over their affairs in future. In 1950 when Mr Fairless, the then president of the United States Steel Co., was under pressure from government servants acting under America's anti-trust legislation, he said: ""The only way a businessman can be sure of obeying all the laws is just to go broke "". Admittedly that is an exaggeration, but nevertheless it is largely true. Many companies in Australia will find in the years to come that they wili be oppressed by government servants or by the Commissioner of Trade Practices. Businessmen will have to surround themselves with legal advice to ensure that they give the right answers to the Commissioner and the people who represent him. The trade practices laws, or anti-trust laws as they are called, of the United States of America are oppressive. They have had a profound and not too wholesome effect on company behaviour. The same sort of thing will happen here within a few short years. Companies will have to hide information from government servants because they believe that they cannot trust them and that the information might be given to their opposition. I wonder how many businessmen realise what is involved in registration. Do they know that it is a costly and cumbersome instrument and that it will throw an unnecessary financial burden on the business community? Do business executives realise that agreements for registration include "" any informal implied understanding""? What does that mean? The present Attorney-General, under the pressure of questions asked by the Victorian Employers Federation in April last year, went to great lengths to explain how specific this legislation was. He saidI want to enlarge a little on this statement That is, a statement that he had previously made to this gatheringby the Government's proposals. The position is that certain practices of a limited number of clearly defined descriptions will become registrable practices-practice s that by their nature are likely to eUminate or reduce competition. 1 think more clarity emerges when it is understood thai defined Australian industry, commerce and managepractices are registrable. Does this mean the same as "" any informal implied understanding ""? 1 wonder whether it does.

Never let anybody tell me that this added My time is becoming short, but I do 1 wonder whether the Attorney-General the gross national product of Australia is wages. They are responsible for 50 per cent, I wonder how many members of the employees in Australia receive over award payments of between £2 and £3 a week, that 15.7 per cent, receive over award payments of between £3 and £4 a week, that 17 per cent, receive over award payments of between £4 and £5 a week and that 9.7 per cent, receive between £5 and £6 a week above award rates. There are 2,553,000 adult male employees working in Australia. Taking the average of these over award payments at £3 per week, this means that, each week, £7,500,000 above the award rates is being paid to the little men, the workers of Australia. Taking 50 weeks as a working year, this means that over award payments totalling £375 million are made to the workers of Australia each year. I believe I could make a good case to support an argument that the public interest would be benefited if our costs of production were reduced by this £375 million a year. Does the Labour Party realise that the Bill can be altered by the insertion of a provision to ensure that manufacturers, distributors and people engaged in commerce do not make these over award payments? I should like every unionist who is listening now to understand what the Labour Opposition-and some members on this side-wil l say about this Bill, because the workers will be the ones most affected in a negative way once this legislation is gazetted. As I said earlier, I believe that we are turning the clock back to 1949 by introducing this oppressive legislation which is directed against the private enterprise sector of the economy. I share the doubts of all the doubters that the excellent relationships that now exist between private enterprise and the Government will be benefited by this form of legislation. I say again that trade practices legislation in other countries has produced a profound and not always wholesome effect on company behaviour and the behaviour of company executives. I object to the legislation because of its high costs to the community, because of its high cost to the little man, and because it will inflict high costs on the Australian worker. -The honourable member for Balaclava by suggesting that wages could be brought ( Mr Whittorn) has just described the within the ambit of this legislation.

In the short title, it is referred to asA Bill for an Act to preserve competition in Australian trade and commerce to the extent required by public interest. I should like to give the Attorney-General( Mr Snedden) some consolation. He has not had very much consolation from the last three or four honourable members on his own side who have spoken. I should like to give him the consolation of reading again the amendment proposed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) to the motion that the Bill be now read a second timeThat all words after ""that"" be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof:"" this House notes with approval that, in response to public pressure, the Government has introduced this limited Bill. . .

We also suggest that the Bill removes from the scope of its operations certain things that the former Attorney General( Sir Garfield Barwick) had regarded as coming within the scope of restrictive trade practices and monopolies. I should also like to assure the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Whittorn) that the trade union movement and the Labour movement know that this legislation, like legislation in other enlightened parts of the worldI refer to the United States of America and Great Britain-specificall y excludes from its operation the question of wage fixing.

Referring to the Restrictive Trade has been effective. Mr Heath, who is now Practices Act 1956, which has been in the Leader of the Conservative Party in operation for nine years and prior to which Great Britain, in this document, under his there was a modern Act from 1948 dealing seal, stated that the English Act had secured with monopolies and restrictive practices, tbe document statesThe Restrictive Trade Practices Act 19S6 is based on the principle that restrictive trading agreements are in general adverse to the public interest because they impede the free play of competition. Circumstances may exist which justify such but this must be demonstrated in each in the Act and their automatic reference to the parties can plead that a restrictive practice is to prove they are wrong rather than it has to be proved that they are right. The Government believe that as an instrument conditions. the termination of many restrictive agreements and thus promoted more competitive trading conditions. However, experience has shown that in the course is that the machinery will become terribly of time ways of circumventing the Act have been found. It is now intended to amend the Act to deal with these cases. The United Kingdom Government, a few months later, brought in the amendment ol 1964 dealing with resale price maintenance, and latterly-in August of this year I think-the present Labour Government went further and brought in the Monopolies and Mergers Act 1965 which goes far wider than our Bill and which, as far as I can judge from reading the debates, was not opposed very strenuously by the British Conservative Party. Who is right and who is wrong? I believe that restrictive practices do exist in the community and I think they are deleterious to the public interest. They may serve the cause of particular individuals and it seems to me that some of the high apostles of private enterprise in this Parliament think that private enterprise-and who is private enterprise when all is said and done but often just a small coterie exercising great economic power over assets and people-shoul d have the unfettered right to determine what is good and what is bad for the public. That is not my interpretation of fair compretations of it in the light of changpetition. I believe there are distinct limits to competition, and in a moment I want to try to find out what sort of competition it is that the Attorney-General hopes to preserve. The very necessity for a Bill of this kind is an indictment on the existing working of what is called a competidve free enterprise system. I believe that competition is being stifled and restrained. If we want to preserve it we have to take measures of this kind. We support the measure, although it does not do all we would like it to do or think should be done. Had we been in office, we might have approached the problem somewhat differently. I still believe that what was called in 1948 the pragmatic approach to the British problem is the correct one. First, a survey should have been made through an extensive inquiry in which people could have given examples of restrictive practices as they have injured them. Others could have defended the practices. I think it would have been found that some practices are more severe than others and that, some need quicker remedial action than others. One of the faults I find in this approach cluttered to begin with. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Hughes) is shaking his head. I hope he is right. It is all very well for the honourable member to say that control of restrictive practices is costing so much in America, but he has no means of assessing the value derived from that control. After all, what is £5 million in terms of the Australian economy? Nobody heard a boo in this House when it was suggested that to change from one form of currency to another form would cost between £30 million and £40 miUion, yet the honourable member seems to be appalled at the prospect of the administration of this legislation costing between £4 million and £5 million a year. In any event, I suggest that it wiU be many years before that amount of expenditure wUl be incurred in Australia. forgets that both political parties in America have supported the Sherman Act for 75 years. it has been found necessary to modify the Sherman Act and change intering circumstances. The legislation we are debating raises the difficult problem of expressing in legal form many economic concepts, some of them rather abstract. One criticism I make of the presentation of this measure is that an attempt should have been made to provide the Parliament with an explanatory memorandum along the lines of those provided in respect of taxation legislation. This Bill contains many clauses, and the Labour Party committee formed to deal with it has been examining it for a good number of hours and days in the last month or two. We have found great difficultyI say this with all respect-in understanding the meaning of certain sections. In some instances, we doubt that the words used cover the intention of the legislation. That is a reasonable enough doubt to have about this type of measure.

76,Mr Crean,"I referred to that subjectof Queensland. The article is entitled "" Competition and Anti-Monopolies Legislation "" and the authors say that in practice the term "" competition "" may refer to such things as pure competition, monopolistic competition, price competition, non-price competition, unfair competition, cut-throat competition, workable or effective competition, and so on. The authors say that which concepts are relevant depends on the problem being investigated. I suggest that possibly the concept which the Attorney General has in mind is the one rather vaguely described as workable or effective competition. I am sure he does not intend to regulate prices directly. In my view that is not within the ambit of this legislation. IfI am glad to see that the Attorney-General his tribunal or commission is to work to preserve ultimate compensation, it surely must first have some concept of what competition is in the realities of Australian trade and commerce and, secondly, it must make its adjudication in the light of that rather amorphous thing called the public interest.

At least we on this side those appearing in this legislation as far of the House are praising the legislation as collusive tendering and collusive bidding with faint damns. I do not know what the are concerned. Spokesmen who have deigned Government supporters are doing. Their final attitude to the legislation remains to be seen. We regard it as a tentative move in the right direction. The problems associated with controlling restrictive practices are far more complex than any of us realize. In an answer supplied yesterday by the Attorney-General to a question placed on notice by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) the Attorney-General listed a number of restrictive practices reported by various official bodies. These practices are additional to those revealed by the former Attorney General in a document published in 1962. believes that many of the additional practices referred to in the answer to the question come within the scope of this legislation. In my opinion the honourable gentleman has been rather unfairly criticised in certain quarters by people who say that this legislation is a pretence and a facade. Those people may be wrong. I particularly hope that they are wrong about the interI hope that this legislation becomes to comment have said that they do not think that otherwise the Victorian legislation will impede the operation of this legislation. They have not come out directly and said that if necessary Victoria will hand over its powers to the Commonwealth. Most of the other States have been silent on the matter. I think they are silent because discussions have already taken place through the machinery of the meeting of Commonwealth and State Attorneys-General. 1 hope that some day the Attorney-General will adopt a realistic approach to these meetings and publish some of theirfindings.It seems odd to me that when you have a uniform company law that can exist only by cooperation between the States and the Commonwealth, we in this House never have anything to do with it. The Attorneys General are brought together for the purpose of getting uniformity in the Commonwealth, but this Commonwealth Parliament has nothing to do with the matter. This seems strange. This Parliament has no opportunity, except through our Attorney General, to make suggestions about the form of the uniform legislation. I suggest to the Attorney-General that he look into this matter. We support the Bill, with reservations. We regret that it does not go further but we hope that it will be passed and will be allowed to operate reasonably effectively in combating what in our view are real evils in the economic life of Australia. to anyone who has listened to the speeches made last night and this morning, particularly the speech of the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Whittorn), that any objection to the introduction of restrictive practices legislation comes from this side of the House. I am aware that quite a number of my colleagues hold the view that legislation of this nature is in conflict with the principles for which the Government parties stand. I do not support this view and I propose to say why I do not support it. I am not a legal man so I do not intend to become involved in legal argument with lawyers on either side of the House. The Bill will be analysed fully in the Committee stage. The general principles of the Bill have been explained on numerous occasions by the Attorney-General( Mr Snedden). I believe that those principles have been analysed and commented upon at length over a considerable period of time in newspapers and magazines. I wish to give my views, as a layman, of the reasons for the introduction of the Bill. I wish to give also my views on whether the Bill is in conflict with Liberal principles and whether certain sections of the business community are justified in opposing its introduction. The long title of the Bill states that its purpose is: ""To preserve Competition in Australian Trade and Commerce to the extent required by the Public Interest."" Does that purpose conflict with the principles for which the Liberal Party of Australia stands and on which it has been consistently returned to office over the past 16 years? This was referred to by the honourable member for Balaclava, who said that the Liberal Party was returned to office on the principle of setting the sails for private enterprise. The official platform of the Liberal Party includes the following planks26. The preservation of a competitive free enterprise economy. 65. The prevention of injury to Australian industries through unfair trading methods. 76. The encouragement, fostering and protection of small businessmen. Those principles have been embodied in the platform of the Liberal Party since its foundation just over 21 years ago, and for the last 16 of those 21 years the Liberal Party has been elected to office on those very principles. The Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies), in the policy speech that he delivered prior to the last general election, saidIt is of the essence of competitive enterprise that there should be real competition, and that the road to advancement in any business should be open lo all. This system we wish to protect. Privately imposed restraints which are against the public interest or submit the small trader to oppressive limitations should be eliminated. On that policy speech, this Government was returned to office with a greatly increased majority. Why should circumstances today be any different from what they were when that policy speech was delivered approximately two years ago? Why should circumstances today be any different from what they were",29,Trade Practices Bill 1965
77,Mr Fox (Henty) [11.18],"It is obvious21 years ago when the platform of the Liberal Party was drawn up? Why should circumstances today be any different from what they have been over the past 16 years during which the Liberal Party has been in government? If the business community objects to those planks in the platform of the Liberal Party, why has it consistently voted for that Party? The first objective of the Liberal Party, as set out in its Federal Constitution, is that it is dedicated to the political liberty, freedom and dignity of man. Nothing in this Bill conflicts with those principles. Why some sections of the business community object to this Bill, I do not know. Let us see what has to be done by proprietors, investors and, no doubt, many businesses from the time they are established. other people. The trouble is that each First, whether a business is a firm or a comsection of the community is self-centred and pany, it has to be registered. Secondly, a selfish in its outlook.

If it is handling food, it has to comply advantages of competition. with the health regulations laid down by the various State Governments. It must take out third party insurance with respect to any vehicle that it operates. It must register the vehicles that it operates. Finally, the drivers of those vehicles and all the directors, vate employees, shareholders and customers of that business, if they drive cars, are compelled to observe the traffic laws. All of those things must be observed in the public interest. Why then should some sections of sands of workers and making profits of the the business community object to having to order of millions of pounds. I have heard conform to a code of business ethics in the opponents of the Bill say: "" Why give all of public interest? That is all that this Bill the protection to the consumers? What isa code of business ethics. The fact that the Government has introcomponents or processes of other manufacduced this Bill does not mean, as one memturers. It is a well known fact in indusber of the Government parties suggested, try that many retail prices have been forced that the Government regards Australian businessmen as rogues. But, if these laws did not exist, many businessmen would not do many of the things that the various State and Federal laws compel them to do -no t because they are rogues, but because of laxity and thoughtlessness. Only the firm or company that does not act in the public interest has anything to fear from this legislation. Just what is the public interest? I realise that it is not easy to define, but it affects a great many groups of people. It affectsnot necessarily in the order in which I now name them-consumers , employees, producers, distributors, importers, exporters, It is quite unreal to expect private interests to huge sums of nioney without some reasonmany agreements, against the ambitions of This Bill is not an attack on orderly marketing, as suggested by another member of the Government parties. My colleagues boast that the Liberal Party stands for prienterprise. That is true. But as fax as I am concerned, "" private enterprise "" means the shopkeeper or the factory with only five or six employees just as much as it means the industry employing hundreds or thouabout the manufacturers? "" I point out that many manufacturers are consumers of the up unnecessarily by the operation of agreements that react to the detriment of some manufacturers who have to use components that they do not manufacture themselves. I have heard many people say that this Bill will retard the flow of overseas capital which is very badly needed for the development of Australia. In answer to that, I say that most of the major Western countries have similar legislation which is much tougher than the provisions of this Bill. A substantial proportion of our capital inflow comes from the United States of America, where businessmen have been living with the Sherman anti-trust legislation for a long time. They accept the particularly tough provisions of that legislation as part of their way of life. In my opinion, they are not likely to be deterred by the comparatively tame provisions of this Bill. In spite of the tough provisions of the Sherman anti-trust legislation, the United States is regarded as exemplifying the spirit goods at prices less than the competitor's of private enterprise. Far from being forced out of business, trade associations flourish in that atmosphere in the United States. The honourable member for Balaclava lation to deal with restrictive trade pracquoted figures which were produced by the Act can be invoked only after a restrictive Institute of Public Affairs and which showed trade practice has been in operation, and in the number of hours that a person has to many cases this is too late.

Some people ask why we need this Bill. I hope that people will not delude themselves with the thought that restrictive trade practices are not carried on in Australia. As the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) has said, a royal commission was appointed recently in Tasmania to inquire into the activities of 70 trade associations. It found that in fact 59 of them were operating restrictive trade agreements. I believe that another royal commission appointed by the Government of Western Australia arrived at a similar conclusion. Some people who would not approve of a businessman getting rid of a competitor by burning down his premises apparently regard it as legitimate for him to put that competitor out of business by withholding his supplies or boycotting him or selling cost price or by any one of the many other restrictive devices that are being used by unscrupulous people and organisations at the present time. We have no effective legistices.

I believe there is a real need for the kind of legislation which will foster effective competition in the Australian economy and for this reason and the others I have given I support the Bill. ter for Social Services) [11.33] I find myself in complete agreement with, what was said by my colleague, the honourable member for Henty( Mr Fox), a few minutes ago. In a developing country and an economy which is gradually beginning to feel its strength it is necessary that there should be some controls lest in the first blush of young adulthood there should by an excessive straining at the helm. With the legislation that the Parliament is now considering the development of the Australian nation is advancing to another stage. To my mind this country virtually is past the first blush of youth, but it is certainly not at the advanced, mature level that many of the older countries of the Western civilisation have attained. For that reason it seems to me that legislation of this kind must endeavour to do two things. It must endeavour, first, to place some restraint on unnecessary concentration of financial and commercial power in the hands of a few individuals. Secondly, it must permit the continuation of individual initiative, individual enterprise. It must enable the individual, as an individual, to foster his particular source of production. It must enable him to develop so that with him the country can develop. Those of us in primary industry know that basic objective in mind that the Governfor many years primary producers have had ment is introducing this legislation. It is the feeling that they are subject to pressures endeavouring to walk the tight rope, as it over which they have no control. It is still were, or to strike a balance or arrive at a true that about 75 per cent, of our export compromise between, on the one hand, income is derived from the sale of primary reducing an unduly high level of costs and products. To a considerable extent these the concentration of industrial power in a products are sold on a free world market. few hands, resulting in a high level of costs Much has been said since the return to Ausof commodities necessary for production, tralia of the Minister for Trade and Industry and, on the other hand, maintaining financial ducted while overseas in an effort to secure for the continual development of our greater access to overseas markets for our large proportion of our primary products is sold on a free world market where it is not possible to pass on to purchasers the costs of production. It is not possible to pass on many of the factors which influence the economics of the primary producer's way of life. The primary producer in an expanding economy finds his costs continually increasing and in order to offset this he looks for new means of increasing production. He is trying all the time to maintain production at a level sufficient to afford him a return slightly greater than his costs of production. Unfortunately, however, because he is forced to sell so many of his commodities on a free world market he finds it very difficult to determine for himself the return that he will obtain. In this situation the commodity agreements that have been entered into and the arrangements for joint marketing of primary products have provided a more forceful means of disposal of those products. But the fact remains that when the primary producer comes to purchase the machinery, the drencher, the weedicides and the very many other things that are essential to his operation he finds himself in a position over which he has no control. It is because of this that primary producers for many years have felt that it was essential that some legislative means be devised to restrain unduly restrictive trade practices. The preamble to the terms of reference of the Vernon Committee stated the objectives of the Government. It said that the Government's economic policy was primarily to achieve a high rate of economic and population growth, with full employment, increasing productivity, rising standards of living, external viability and stability of costs and prices. It is with this",33,Trade Practices Bill 1965
82,Mr Sinclair (New England,Minis,34,Trade Practices Bill 1965
83,( Mr Mcewen) Of The Negotiations He Congrowth. The Government Realises The Need,"economy, for more industries, more production and more Australian prosperity. Therefore the legislation that is being considered today has for its purpose, as is stated in the preamble to the Bill, the preservation of competition in Australian trade and commerce to the extent required by the public interest. Indeed, Mr Deputy Speaker, I think the leading article in one of our newspapers this morning gave point to the objects of this legislation when it saidThe effectiveness of the legislation must not be judged on whether it stimulates competition; it must be evaluated rather, by the extent to which it contributes to industrial and commercial efficiency; and keeps prices to the consumer as low as is consistent with a reasonable level of industrial efficiency. To me, this is the problem, as far as introducing legislation in Australia today is concerned. It is all very well to compare the legislation with the Sherman anti trust law of the United States of America, or with various restrictive trade practices, whatever their name might be, in other more mature countries of the western world. But those countries are at a different stage of development compared with Australia. Their needs are different and their economies are different. Consequently, this legislation is in the position of trying to strike a harmonious equilibrium between the conflicting forces in our economy. It is because of this situation, I believe, that the legislation, which we have before us today, will achieve the best of both possible worlds with, perhaps, some limitations for each. I do not think that any honourable member claims the Bill will do all that one might like it to do in restricting some trade practices. At the same time. I think that it will not act as too great an inhibiting force to the commercial and industrial forces of this country, which we so much need in order to continue to grow and develop. It is with this background in mind that I think a critical appreciation of the legislation must bear out this necessity to permit growth and yet to maintain, as far as possible, the advantages of restricting excessive concentration of this growth within a few hands. The legislation itself is divided basically into, shall we say, three categories. The first relates to the legal procedures. The legal procedures of the legislation envisage, first of all, the appointment of a Commissioner. The Commissioner, in the terms of his appointment under Part III of the legislation, will be an individual to whom will be given the actual responsibility in each instance of initiating action under the Act. In Australia we have been extremely fortunate in the high standard of public servants that we have been able to obtain. Their service to the community has, I believe, been of an exceptionally high order. For that reason, while there is no doubt that the individual appointee to this office will have tremendous responsibility, I believe that we can expect him to perform this duty with a fairness and a responsibility which will enable the legislation to achieve those factors for which it has been designed. The Commissioner, having examined a practice-whethe r it be on submission from the Attorney-General or in some other way-and having made his determination, will then have to enter into consultation with those parties against whom the complaint has been lodged. To me, this is a valuable aspect of the legislation. So frequently the attitude of an individual is prejudiced by those factors within his immediate knowledge. Consequently, at the time of a complaint being lodged, it may well be that an individual is of the opinion that a particular type of practice or agreement is contrary to his interests and yet it may not be contrary to the public interest. Because of this, the opportunity for consultation that is provided for in clause 48 of the Bill will give an opportunity to the Commissioner to make his own assessment of the situation; to make for himself a preliminary estimate as to whether or not he believes the practice is such that it should go to the further stage of determination by the Tribunal. I believe that the protection that is contained in clause 48 is one of the notable instances where this position of balance between the interests of all sections of the Australian community is being preserved. I think it is through this necessity to consult with the parties to proceedings that those matters that are taken to the Tribunal are more certain to be taken there in an impartial manner than might otherwise be the case. The Commissioner, having considered at the preliminary stage the agreement or practice, will then submit it for consideration to the Tribunal itself. The constitution of the Tribunal has been changed since the original legislation was suggested some four years ago. To me the advantage of having not only a judicial or presidential member of the Tribunal but also representatives of commerce and industry is that once again an opportunity will be afforded to industry to appreciate the facts of whatever the particular practice might be from a position of knowledge. The fact of having a judicial president will give to the presiding officer of this Tribunal a greater ability to provide an impartial assessment of the situation, the practice or the agreement. I believe that in this way the matter might be more fairly determined than, perhaps, it would be if it were determined only within a professional or judicial court. The presence of members of industry and persons who are in constant contact with the stresses and strains of industry will be one way in which the Tribunal will be able to assess fairly the needs for concentration of power and the needs for greater economic size. The people who are on the Tribunal will be able in this way to contribute from their own knowledge and experience an impartial determination as to whether or not the practice is contrary to the public interest. The next phase, as far as the contents of the Bill are concerned, are the practices. A suggestion has been made that individual resale price maintenance and exclusive dealing, whether it be by way of sole agencies or in some other form, should have been included in this Bill. I believe that these particular types of agreements are entered into by individual traders knowing the situation themselves. They go into them in the same way as a purchaser goes into a shop. Just as in a circumstance a trader is given the opportunity individually to assess the pros and cons of a situation, so to me an individual trader who enters into agreements in this form should not be inhibited in any way. For that reason I believe it is well that such a provision should have been excluded. The actual examinable agreements and clause 4, sub-clause (2.) there is a preservapractices that are included in clauses 35 and tion of rights of action under the Australian 36 have been confined to those practices Industries Preservation Act in respect of any which at this stage are, or would appear to cause that might have occurred up to the be, contrary to public interest. To my mind, the extension of clause 37, in the amendment that my colleague, the Attorney General( Mr Snedden), will be introducing, will certainly be some improvement to the Bill as originally framed. But monopolisation is something which, like public interest, is extremely difficult to define in words alone. It is for that reason that I believe it preferable to see whether or not, by defining it to this degree and then leaving it "" quasi-judicial"" interpretation of the Tribunal, the extent and implications of monopolistic practices will be definitely determined. The actual implications of monopolisation in some circumstances can, of course, be in the public interest. It is because of this that the exemptions are included in clause 38 of the Bill. There are in many circumstances advantages for the consumer or the purchaser as well as for the manufacturer in some forms of monopolisation. For various reasons monopolisation need not be harmful to the Australian community and it is because of this that it is essential that the procedure that has been laid down be followed in this instance. It is essential that monopolisation be not regarded as being completely illegal as are collusive tendering and collusive bidding. Monopolisation in some circumstances can be to the advantage of the Australian community. Objection certainly can be taken, in terms of future growth, to the continual concentration of production or distribution in the hands of one or a few individuals; but monopolisation extends beyond just this and it is because it extends beyond this that it can, in some instances, be in the public interest. One matter that has been mentioned privately to me is the extent to which civil remedies are provided in the Bill. Some people are concerned that whereas under the Australian Industries Preservation Aot there was an opportunity for an individual to secure not only the actual amount of damage he felt he had suffered because of the operation of a particular practice, but in some instances, up to triple damages. The suggestion is that the omission of this provision from this Bill is a disadvantage. First of all I point out that in proposed new date when this Bill becomes an Act. There are, of course, other reservations about the carriage of goods by sea after the commencement of this Act. The Attorney General has announced that legislation in this regard will be introduced, possibly in the next session. However, proposed new clause 4 preserves to the ordinary person in commerce or industry the remedies that have been available up to this point of time under the Australian Industries Preservation Act. As far as civil remedies are concerned, PartX of the proposed legislation provides further opportunities for action to be taken. In fact, PartX covers the rights of an individual to civil remedies. This is in addition to the statutory restrictions or prohibitions that may be invoked by the Trade Practices Tribunal. I believe, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there is no cause for concern on the part of those people who have been worried about the repeal of the Australian Industries Preservation Act. Individuals who have been protected in the past will still have the same certainly come within the ambit of the conrights of action and the same opportunity for civil remedies. For those offences that occur after the introduction of the Bill, I personally believe that the extension of rights believe that this legislation will certainly for civil remedies under PartX will suffice. 1 The other matter to which I want to refer is the extent of the operation of the Bill. Some suggestion has been made that the constitutional limitations of the Commonwealth are such that the Bill might not be able to achieve all that is desired. It is suggested that, within a State, individualswhether they be individual companies, individual industries or trade associationswill be able to continue certain practices because the new Act will not cover the things that they are doing. As to the extent of the constitutional power of the Commonwealth, there is no doubt that there would be advantages if complementary State legislation were passed and it is towards this end that within clause 8 of the Bill there is provision for inclusion within the Act of measures wbich are referred to as complementary laws of the States. Therefore, it is possible for individual State Governments to look at the Commonwealth legislation and say in effect: "" We feel that the passing of a complementary law will truly close the loopholes and consequently we intend to do that"". There is no doubt Minister for Social Services( Mr Sinclair), F.13691/65 -R -[U9 ] that if this is done there will be a greater opportunity for the implementation of restraints on trade practices than would be the case if no such complementary legislation existed. However, even if no such complementary legislation is introduced the teeth will not be drawn from this measure. There are many practices being carried on in the Australian community which this legislation, when it becomes law, will cover. I believe that it is because of the overriding Commonwealth extent of so many of these practices that they are, in fact, harmful. In other words, where practices are concentrated in a relatively isolated area they do not tend so much to be to the disadvantage of the community. It is rather where practices are on a national scale, where they cover a number of States or a number of major centres, that they can be most harmful and injurious. It is those wider practices that this legislation is primarily designed to cover and they will stitutional power of the Commonwealth. Representing as we do country electorates, we of the Australian Country Party ensure a greater degree of protection to primary producers from the inflationary spiral of costs that can occur as a result of an undue concentration of power in the hands of a few manufacturers whose products are so necessary to production by the man on the land. However, at the same dme we appreciate the necessity for individual members of industry, manufacturers and distributors, to endeavour to ensure that they, too, keep their costs down. It is in ensuring a balance between these two sections of our economic society-thes e two units of economic production-that this Bill will achieve the most effect. It is just as essential for producers as for manufacturers and distributors for costs to be stabilised. I believe, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this Bill will most effectively strike that balance. I believe that from the point of view of the producer of primary products, it will provide a restraint on the unnecessary concentration of power that was not present before. For that reason I completely support the measure.",34,Trade Practices Bill 1965
84,Mr James (Hunter) [11.59],"Th elike most members on the Government side, spoke with no degree of vigour or enthusiasm about this legislation which will not attain the results that the overwhelming majority of the Australian people would like to see it attain. I appreciate his use of the word ""racket"" because if ever there was a need for strong legislation to bust rackets in this country it is today. But this legislation will not achieve that purpose. This Government is afraid to introduce measures to curb restrictive trade practices because it does not want to offend, or to take money out of the pockets of the wealthy monopolists who support it. That is the reason why the Opposition vigorously protests at the inadequate provisions of the Bill. The Opposition is strongly opposed to the legislation, which has been described outside the House as a rubber toothed lion; it may bite-bu t for sure it will never hurt -the monopolists who have become a law unto themselves in this country. We know that Australia imposes no legal restraint on restrictive agreements. These agreements are effective because if there is a relevant statute to deal with them-as in New South Wales-n o action is taken to enforce its conditions, and there is no de facto limitation. The prevailing commercial and social climate of opinion favours restrictive arrangements, although the views of many businessmen may now be undergoing a change in this respect. Consequently although publicity is not looked for, there is no strong facturers themselves as original equipment effort to conceal the operation of agreements. Indeed, it is a common experience on approaching tbe appropriate trade association officer to have the character of an agreement discussed openly and justified from the point of view of the industry concerned. Let me refer to some existing arrangements in the retailing of pharmaceutical products. The various pharmaceutical guilds governed by an agreement. There is no in the States negotiate with the manufacformal manufacturers' association, but, as turers, singly or in groups, the prices and we read frequently in the Press, a "" spokesretail margins of all pharmaceutical goods. man "" for the industry-that is a good A retail price is then fixed and it is made phrase when it is designed to hide the known to members through the distribution identity of the person making the statement of price lists. There is practically a 100 per -announce s price arrangements from time cent, membership in each State and examples to time. If one cares to look at the Melof price cutting are almost unknown. Every bourne ""Age"" of 20th April 1960, he wiH member of the House will, if he is honest, see that the retailers' price lists for the concede me this point. Also, the prices of various makes of tyres are identical within some of the "" chemist only"" lines which are covered by what is referred to as exclusive dealing in branded goods, are negotiated with manufacturers of toilet preparations, patent medicines, tooth paste and so on. In chocolate and confectionery, the 10 main manufacturers have agreements on the prices of most proprietary lines, which cover about 95 per cent, of chocolate products and 55 per cent, of sugar products sold in Australia. Price lists are distributed for each make. The manufacturers, in addition, give, assistance to the various State associations in their efforts to eliminate price cutting at the retail level, to the extent of providing occasionally a boycott of supplies. In the tobacco and cigarette trade, State retail associations set retail prices, presumably after consulting the manufacturers. They also succeed in persuading the manufacturers to withhold supplies from price cutters-mainl y selfservice stores and supermarkets, which are the expanding sector of the food and tobacco trade. This factor is well known to honourable members and to most intelligent people in Australia. I should like to comment now on automotive parts, having been myself a victim shortly before entering the Parliament. The detail I might refer to later on in my speech. Automotive parts, other than electrical equipment or parts produced by car manuare the subject of agreement-manufacturer s and wholesalers fixing the wholesale prices, discounts and retail prices of most components. This code of understanding-if I may so put it-o r collusion, is enforced by boycotts of supplies and the possibility of legal proceedings based on invoiced conditions of sale. The sale of tyres and tubes is evidently a penny or two. The tyre traders and reconditioners associations assist the manufacturers to arrange retail margins. Further, there is an agreement on the price of reconditioning tyres, although in some StatesNew South Wales for example-pric e cutters are presenting somewhat of a problem. In relation to petroleum products, there is apparently no formal association at the refinery wholesale level, but there is clearly some understanding amounting to an agreement amongst the six main companies on various minor restrictions. For example, the Petroleum Information Bureau, or a "" spokesman "" for the industry, has made announcements on such matters as "" giveaways "" with petrol sales and the acquisition of petrol station sites, irrespective of cost. There is evidently some collusive tendering on the supply of petroleum products to -local councils and government departments. .The report of the Western Australian royal commission in relation to petrol prices, at, I believe, page 15, mentions that the South Australian Prices Commissioner sets the wholesale price in that State. The Queensland Government appears to accept this finding, and the industry makes this price, with adjustments for transport,. the base price for Australia. This price control saves the refiners and wholesalers the necessity to make a formal price fix. However, the retail margins in each State-excep t where there is control-and therefore the retail prices are the subject of an agreement by the various State associations of service station operators. As is well known, a large proportion of service stations-probabl y about 40 per cent -ar e either owned by the refining and wholesale companies or controlled by long term contracts. Other products for which there are evidendy price arrangements throughout Australia include various paper products, rope cordage, batteries, cement, footwear, fluorescent tubes, radio valves, electric lamps and electric cables. Each State has its local trade association arrangements, and numerically at least these are more important than Commonwealth based associations. A typical list can be seen at pages 8 and 9 of the Western Australian Royal Commission Report. In Victoria, for example, the building industry is controlled as to prices by the respective trade associations for bricks, roofing tiles, quarried materials,fibrousplaster, electrical equipment, electrical contracting, glass, masonite and other equipment. A recently announced timber stabilisation scheme established the price of timber at the .sawmill, wholesale merchant and retail levels. This reorganisation was promoted as an aid to orderly marketing and seems designed to exclude building companies from undertaking their own merchant wholesaler activities as well as to control price cutting among distributors. But if this legislation rectifies the savage tie up of essential goods in Australia it will be beneficial to the great majority of Australian people who hunger for legislation that will be effective. The Opposition claims that this Bill will not be effective. Again, in Victoria, bread, flour, milk; plumbers' goods, fencing and netting, toys, glass and pottery, tools, floor and wall tiles and a wide range of hardware goods are fixed in price by the respective associations and their distribution is controlled in most cases through recognised outlets. The trade associations for hairdressing, newspaper distribution, driving schools, dry cleaning, insurance and assurance appear to have a firm hold over prices in these service industries. Tied contracts occur in certain industries where manufacture is highly concentrated. In the supply of fine papers one firm is predominant in Australia. In anticipation of the removal of import restrictions in 1960 it circularised its customers with a request to undertake to purchase in future at least 90 per cent, of their total requirements from this one Australian manufacturer. Firms which did not agree could not be guaranteed supplies. This is the sort of wicked thing that has been going on in this country and which will continue to go on, I believe, despite this legislation which, to use the Chinese term, is virtually a paper tiger. In certain sections of the steel industry, to qualify as a merchant distributor earning predetermined rates of discount a firm must be prepared to accept certain minimum tonnages per month, confine its rates to assigned territories, carry a full and representative stock of products and offer adequate storage, competent staff and an efficient delivery service. Finally, it may sell only at the named metropolitan price plus transport cost. Whether or not a firm is qualified to meet these conditions is a matter entirely for the discretion of the manufacturer. Disqualification entails forfeiture of the right to purchase at merchant discount rates. Some of these conditions are clearly legitimate elements of a requirement contract to ensure efficient distribution; but, equally, some go beyond this concept and encourage, indeed enforce, a regulative, non-competing pattern on the distribution of steel. The petroleum industry operates a variant of the tied contract through its rapidly developing system of single brand oudets. The companies lease or have an interest in a large number of petrol stations. A further large proportion are controlled also by long term supply contracts offering special discounts. A condidon imposed on these retail outlets is that they sell not one brand of petrol, diesel oil and kerosene but also one associated brand of lubricants, tyres and tubes, batteries and certain accessories. Thus, the ability of independent companies specialising in lubricants, batteries, accessory equipment, reconditioned tyres, etc., to reach the consuming public with independently priced goods is restricted severely. Other industries in which the tied contract arrangement conceivably operates in Australia are glass and glass products and semi-manufactures of copper and other non-ferrous metals such as wire, rod and tubing. Finally, as an indication of the spirit in which restrictive practices are operated in Australia it is interesting to quote an official report of negotiations. I refer, Sir, to the ""Federated Hardware News No. 30"" of December 1959, a bulletin of the Federated Hardware Association of Australia. The report readsOn 7th December, the Federal Executive for Galvanised Iron met in Sydney, when the chairmen of the State Merchant Associations attended from all States except WA. The Executive reviewed the proposed changes in the price structure for galvanised iron, details of which were submitted by John Lysaght (Aust.) Pty. Ltd. for comment. The various proposals were subsequently discussed in conference with the following representatives from Lysaght. . . The most pleasing features of the new structure provide for the introduction of the ' nominal ton' basis of invoicthe Carlton and United Breweries, this ing, elimination of certain extras and improved margins for distributors. Interstate delegates were entertained by Lysaght to lunch at the Hotel AustraUa, and appreciation was expressed for the manufacturers' hospitality, for their co-operation, and support in the orderly and efficient marketing and his wife, displaying that Australian of galvanised iron. The success of the conference provides further evidence of the cordiality and goodwill that exists between the manufacturers and their Australian distributors and the growing understanding of each other's problems by a closer merchant manufacturer relationship. Thus do our businessmen apparently wilh a high degree of unanimity and in an atmosphere of good cheer formulate the prices and competitive conditions which they consider best suited for the Australian consuming public. So the Australian public, the housebuilder and the common wage earner have been the victims of restrictive trade practices for many years now. They were longing for the day when they would have a sincere government and a Minister of courage and forthrightness who would be strong and fearless enough to introduce legislation which would counteract the great evils to which I have referred. But they are dismayed. In the opinion of honourable members on this side of the House, this legislation will not rectify the grievous situation that exists and the legalised stealing in which the monopolists of this country have been engaging for some time. I remember not so long ago that the Press brought to the notice of the people of Australia the treatment that Carlton and United Breweries Ltd. in Melbourne was meting out to a small hotel keeper in a place called Jindera which is on the New South Wales and Victoria border. I suppose it would be fair to say that this small hotel gave just a reasonable living to the hotel keeper and his wife. They were obligated to take Carlton and United beer and when they decided to sell other things in their hotel such as soft drinks and cigarettes they were told that they were obliged to purchase these things through the Carlton and United Breweries. When they refused to do so and said they wanted to buy these goods through other channels they were told immediately by this powerful monopoly which dictates to governments that they would have to buy them through the source nominated by the brewery otherwise the brewery would cut off their liquor supplies. Despite the fact that members of Parliament and the Press, to my surprise, expressed some indignation at the action of married couple was forced eventually to leave their hotel at Jindera. Before that happened, this hotel keeper manhood which we claim has made us a great nation throughout the years and which we claim is the predominant feature in the make-up of our fighting forces-that great attribute referred to in the vernacular as a "" ton of Australian guts ""-decide d that they would purchase their liquor from another source so they approached Tooth's and Toohey's breweries in Sydney. Honourable members will recall what happened then. Tooth's and Toohey's said: "" No, we cannot supply you with beer. We have an agreement with Carlton and United Breweries in Victoria. If they refuse to serve a customer, our agreement is that we will not supply that customer either "". Displaying further Australian courage and is the bloke who has plenty of them. If one manhood and womanhood, the hotel keeper were to ask the secretary of the Joint House and his wife approached Millers Brewery Department who have the largest outstandPty. Ltd. in Sydney. For some time Millers ing accounts for meals and so on which are supplied them with beer but for some reason provided in this place one would find that or other, whether the liquor was too costly they are the richest members of Parliament. in the first place or whether they could not get the rail transport concessions that other bulk producers get, the price of the comit supports my submission that the hardest modity when it reached Jindera was so high person to get a quid off is the bloke who that it drove the customers away from the has plenty of them. He has been so obsessed little hotel and the hotel keeper and his wife with accumulating wealth that he has no had to leave. When this matter was revealed I took squabble over. In the end, the legal eagles the opportunity at question time in this take the lot, as the ring keeper in a two-up Parliament to ask the Attorney-General, school does. The ring keeper finishes up with who is now sitting at the table, whether his the lot if the game goes on long enough. proposed trade practices legislation would That is the way these vultures act. They meet a case such as the case of the hotelare responsible for the Government introkeeper at Jindera. My recollection is that ducing legislation in an attempt to curb the Attorney-General would not answer my their activities, but in my opinion and in the question, obviously because he was between opinion of the Opposition generally the legisthe devil and the deep sea as to whether the lation will be a dismal failure. legislation would correct the sadistic treatment that a powerful monopoly meted out to a publican in a small country town. ism has been defined as the right of the Of course, the Attorney-General has wilted individual to do as he likes so long as he under pressure.

There is, in our free society, a certain section of the community whose only goal in life is to accumulate wealth. These people wreck their lives over it. They get themselves into no end of social, and sometimes criminal, trouble. The more they get the more they want.

More capital is coming to Australia than to any other country. We can virtually say that today Australia is the envy of the world. Australia has made this remarkable progress without any trade practices legislation other than the Australian Industries Preservation Act. That, however, does not mean that we should simply sit by and do nothing when we see certain practices carried on that are harmful to the community. At the same time, we must be exceedingly careful that in our attempts to prevent harmful practices we do nbt put controls and restrictions upon industry that will retard progress and growth. the cure. may be that the medicine is. worse than of my representations or of representations the cure. The Government of the day has made by somebody else, because. now we the responsibility of seeing that any action find that practices do not have to be taken to stop harmful practices does not registered. However, I regret that agreeharm individuals and undertakings that are ments still have to be registered. carrying on their business to the benefit of the community as a whole. I want to examine this legislation within individual, company or firm to go to the the scope of those principles. Can we stop expense and trouble of registering an agreeharmful practices unnecessary controls and restrictions that I hope that even at this late stage the will retard the progress of industries that Attorney-General( Mr Snedden) will see are not engaging in harmful practices? fit to remove the provision requiring the When the former Attorney-General compulsory of agreements. I cannot see that delivered a statement in this House on the that would weaken the Bill in any way. The proposed legislation dealing with restrictive authorities would still have power to call trade practices, as they were then called, I for the production or registration of an had to inform him that I could not support agreement if such agreement were thought the legislation because it was too compreto be harmful to the community. My hensive. It put out a net that would have whole basis of approach to the Bill has been interfered with every trade and business in on the principle I enunciated at the beginnthis country. It was completely overall and ing of my speech. Does a practice interfere comprehensive. It would have affected with the liberty and freedom of other everybody down to the small greengrocer businesses? If we examine the legislation and the newspaper boy standing on the from that point of view, we do not see any corner. It would have retarded progress and necessity to register agreements. However, growth and would have introduced harassthe Bill has gone a long way towards reing controls and restrictions on the managemoving the objectionable features of the ment of business. At that time. I wrote to previous proposal and now only agreements the Attorney-General1 have the letter and not practices have to be registered. before me, but it is rather too long to read -and set out the reasons why I was opposed to the legislation. I said that the legislation made the Government a busybody, that it interfered with industry and that in an endeavour to catch the guilty it placed onerous restrictions on the innocent. I am delighted to see that, in the Bill now before the House, much of that interference with normal trade and industry is removed. The previous legislation required all agreements and practices to be registered. That would have meant that people who were carrying on practices that were not contrary to the public interest would have had to register those practices and people who had entered into agreements that were not contrary to the public interest would haye had to register those agreements. The result would have been that, there being so many practices, the register would have been completely cluttered. Every business in the and the growth and development of the country would have been affected. I am I cannot see the logic behind forcing an without imposing ment that is not harmful to the community.",41,Trade Practices Bill 1965
88,Mr Irwin,The medicine is worse than community would have been interfered with,42,Trade Practices Bill 1965
89,Mr Wilson,"As my friend said, it glad that some note has been, taken eitherAnother feature of the Bill that I can wholeheartedly support is the provision that nobody commits an offence until it is proved that his agreement or practice is contrary to the public interest. This is different from the very objectionable legislation in the United States of America and the United Kingdom. There a person can go to a lawyer -the best lawyer in the land-and say to him: "" This is an agreement or practice that 1 want to enter into. I believe it to be in the interests of my industry."" The lawyer can go into it and say: "" In my opinion, that is perfectly lawful"". If the company then undertakes that practice and if a court later decides that the legal advice originally given was wrong, the company will find itself subject to a heavyfineand the directors sometimes find themselves in goal. They have committed an offence purely because the law is uncertain. There should be no uncertainty in the law. Therefore, in determining whether an agreement or a trade practice is contrary to the public interest, the Bill very properly provides that an offence has not been committed until the Tribunal has held the agreement or practice to be contrary to the public interest. In other words, if the authorities think a certain practice is contrary to the public interest up with all sorts of agreements that have they will notify the person or the company concerned that the practice is considered to be contrary to the public interest. Certain negotiations will then go on. The Attorney-General has introduced a very wise procedure of conciliation. The authorities and the company will get together. The authorities will say: "" We think this practice is contrary to the public interest and we urge you to stop it"". The company might then say that, in its opinion, the practice is not harmful to the community. The two sides will confer and discuss the matter and in most cases they will be able to reach a mutual agreement. But if they cannot come to a mutual agreement, the matter will then go to the Trade Practices Tribunal. If the Tribunal, after hearing both cases and all the relevant evidence, considers the practice is contrary to the public interest, the company will then be told that it must cease carrying on the practice. Even up to that stage, no offence will have been committed. If the company continues to carry on the practice after the Tribunal has said that the practice is illegal because it is contrary to the public interest, then for the first time an offence will have been committed. The good features of this Bill are that the law will be made certain by the means I have indicated, lt will not be as it is in the United States of America and the United Kingdom where no-one knows with certainty what the law is. When the law is declared and made certain, the person concerned has already committed an offence. This Bill has many good features and for that reason I propose to support it. Subject to what 1 have said about compulsory registration, I consider that there are very few objectionable features in the Bill. I am hopeful that between now and the final passage of the Bill, the Attorney-General will see the light of day and remove the completely unnecessary proposal for the compulsory registration of agreements. The result of that provision will be that thousands and probably hundreds of thousands of agreements with companies will have to be registered. In many cases they will be agreements of such a type that it would not matter whether they were registered or not but those concerned will have to go to a lot of unnecessary and endless trouble. The registries will be cluttered no reference to harmful practices at all. What is the advantage to the community in building up a huge bureaucracy to deal with something that is not a harmful practice? Surely if it is alleged that an agreement is a harmful practice, a simple provision giving the Commissioner the right to call for the production and, if you like, registration of the agreements he considers harmful would be much more preferable to a complete dragnet direction that all agreements have to be registered if there is a possibility that they relate to restrictive trade practices. they are good or bad agreements. are good agreements or bad agreements. I wish to refer now to a few remarks which were made by the Attorney-General and which I support wholeheartedly because they express principles in which I strongly believe. In opening his second reading speech the Attorney-General saidThe purpose of this Bill is to preserve competition in Australian trade and commerce lo lhe extent required by the public interest. Sitting suspended from 12.45 to 2.15 p.m.",42,Trade Practices Bill 1965
90,Mr Haworth,Just to ascertain whether,43,Trade Practices Bill 1965
91,Mr Wilson,"Yes, to see whether theysuspension of the sitting I had pointed out that it was the duty of the Government to govern and of the trader to trade. The Government should be free to govern and the trader should be free to trade untrammelled by government interference so long as he does not interfere with other traders or act contrary to the public interest. This Bill aims at dealing with agreements and practices that are found to be contrary to the public interest. I emphasise the words "" that are found to be "", because no offence will occur until a practice or an agreement has been thoroughly investigated by a proper tribunal and held to be contrary to the public interest. Even then, there will be no offence unless the trader continues to carry on that practice contrary to the order of the Tribunal. I pointed out earlier that under the terms of this measure practices will not have to be registered. But, for some reason that I cannot understand, agreements will have to be registered. This, as I pointed out, is my objection to the Bill. I cannot see why a perfectly innocent agreement between two traders which no-one suggests is contrary to the public interest should have to be registered. That seems to me to be an unwarranted interference with normal trade and commerce. I cannot see that this provision will serve any good purpose. If a person considers that he is adversely affected by an agreement all that he will have to do will be to go to the proposed Trade Practices Tribunal or the Commissioner of Trade Practices and say: "" So and So has entered into an agreement that is acting adversely to my interests."" The Commissioner or the appropriate authority will then have the right to call on the trader concerned to produce all agreements in relation to the particular matter. They could be examined and the very fair and sensible procedure set out in this measure could then be followed. Why should all agreements be registered when only agreements that are contrary to the public interest are in question? Therefore, Sir, as I stated earlier, I hope that the Attorney-General will have another look at this aspect of the Bill. I congratulate and commend the Minister on the splendid machinery provided in this measure for the examination of practices and agreements that may or may not be contrary to the public interest. He does not propose to do as has been done in other countries. He does not propose to drag people into court and put them in the position of having to prove, often at great cost to themselves, that they are not carrying on a practice or participating in an agreement that is contrary to the public interest. As I see the machinery provided in this measure, it means that the appropriate authority will say to the trader concerned: "" I consider that there is a possibility that your agreement or practice is contrary to the public interest."" The authority and the trader will then have a conference and talk the matter over. Conciliation may even be considered. But the trader will be given every possible opportunity, without the intervention of any court and without any formal procedure, to satisfy the authority that his practice or agreement is not contrary to the public interest. Only after the resources of all that friendly machinery, if I may so describe it, are exhausted and only if the authority still believes that the practice is contrary to the public interest and the trader still maintains that it is not, will there be a hearing by the Tribunal. At that hearing each side will have the right to put all its evidence and to state its case fully. The independent Tribunal will then come to a decision. But even when it has made its decision, there will still be no offence. An offence will occur only if a trader, in defiance of the decision of the Tribunal, continues to carry on the practice or participate in the agreement. I believe that a splendid procedure has been thought out by the Attorney-General. It will provide what is lacking in other countries-certainly . The trouble in other countries is that a trader never knows for certain whether his practice is legal or illegal. He will certainly know in this country because a practice will become illegal only after the Tribunal has said: ""Your practice is illegal. You are not to continue it any longer"". If the trader continues it after that, he deserves all the punishment he gets. I now want to state the reasons why I support this Bill. The Minister, in his second reading speech, saidThe purpose of this Bill is to preserve competition in Australian trade and commerce to the",43,Trade Practices Bill 1965
92,Mr Wilson,"Mr Speaker, before theextent required by the public interest. Competition date. It limits the agreements that have to is an essential ingredient of any free enterprise be registered to what are called horizontal economy. I believe in freedom. I believe in a free enterprise economy. I believe that competition is essential to maintain a free enterprise economy. The Minister later quoted a statement made by somebody else which described the Government's philosophy in these terms. . . a free enterprise society was desirable, in that it provides for its citizens to be at liberty to partities to get at the real evils without interfercipate in the production and distribution of the nation's wealth, thus ensuring competitive conditions which tend to initiative, resourcefulness, productive efficiency, high output and fair and reasonable prices to the consumer . . . the Government believed that practices which reduce competition may endanger those benefits which we properly expect and mostly enjoy from a free enterprise society. I wholeheartedly support those views which were quoted by the Attorney-General in his second reading speech. He went on to say. . . there may well be some practices, restrictive in nature, which are in the public interest. With that, I entirely agree. That being the case, Sir, I ask the Minister: Why must agreements that are in the public interest be registered? He went on to sayThe Government's purpose has, at all times, feature of the Bill because it provides the been to produce legislation that will be effective certainty which was lacking in the previous without constituting any unnecessary interference legislation, the certainty which is lacking in to business. I believe that, with one exception, the in America. I believe that the AttorneyMinister has given effect to that purpose.

The Attorney-General proceededThe BiU will cover five types of agreement Speaker, this legislation has been talked which have certain common characteristics. For about and written about for a long time, example, they must be between persons who are and there have been many stops and starts carrying on businesses for the supply of goods or services and those businesses must be comin its progress, but now that it is with us petitive with each other. . . .

This is a very good and sensible limitation because it will enable the authoriing or meddling too much with trade and commerce. The Attorney-General also saidExcept for collusive tendering and collusive bidding I do not think any honourable member would attempt to justify collusive tendering or collusive bidding as being lawful and therefore I have no objection to those two devices being declared illegalthe principle which is maintained throughout the Bill is that no agreement or practice is made illegal until it has been examined and a determination has been made that it is contrary to the public interest. 1 think that that is the most important England and the certainty which is lacking declarations to be made that practices must Therefore, I support the Bill, but I urge the Attorney-General to give consideration to what I believe is its great weakness-the about it. The legislation has taken from three",44,Trade Practices Bill 1965
93,Mr Duthie (Wilmot) [2.28],"Mralmost toothless lion. It has been to the are in existence and have to be checked. dentist and quite a lot of its teeth have been The second reason, in my opinion, why pulled out deliberately. However, it is a the legislation is necessary is the massive miracle that under such a government as immorality of big business, as shown by this we have the kind of legislation now the recent activities of H. G. Palmer Pty. before us. The arch-supporters of capitalism Ltd., the Reid Murray group and other and of so-called private enterprise have huge enterprises in Australia. They have brought down a Bill which will restrict the broken down under the weight of dishonesty activities of private enterprise and of capiand cheating. Those are the two reasons why talism to a certain extent. To me, that is a we have this legislation before us, even in miracle. "" We of the Opposition support this legislation but we would rather have had the legislation of three or four years ago as envisaged by Sir Garfield Barwick. The main difference between this side of the House and the Government side at the moment is that we on this side want the legislation to be strengthened and those on the Government side want it to be weakened. But at least we have somethingbefore lis which I hope will be passed by both Houses of the Parliament and which, in later years, can be amended and strengthened if necessary. I think that will be necessary. Sections of big business. look upon this legislation as gross interference with what they regard as their right to carry on illegitimate business practices. They claim that the legislation is striking at the citadel of capitalism itself. Already in this House we have heard four speeches from Government members who have been vitriolic in their attacks on the legislation. I refer to the honourable members for Isaacs( Mr prise left in Australia. I see a tombstone Haworth), McMillan( Mr Buchanan), Balaclaca ( Mr Whittorn) and Sturt( Mr written: "" Here lieth free enterprise: Died a Wilson). In most of his speech the honourable member for Sturt was grossly critical of PartV of the Bill. This debate has already revealed grave differences of opinion on the Government benches about the legislation. It is no wonder that the Attorney-General( Mr Snedden) has been so long in getting this Bill into legislative form and in having it approved and brought into the Parliament for debate. One wonders how some of the honourable members opposite who have spoken already could possibly support the legislation when the vote on it takes place at about 6 p.m. on Tuesday next. Why is this legislation necessary? It is recorded that of 1,250 trade associations in Australia, at least two-thirds, or about 810, had organised restrictive agreements. That is the first reason. Restrictive practices this tame form. Who are the people who are being hit by these practices? First, there are the small investors. I think we should protect the small investor if we protect anybody. The pensioners, the workers and the farmers are also being hit by restrictive and monopolistic trade practices. It seems, Mr Speaker! that we are passing through the sunset of old fashioned free enterprise. I smile when I hear Government members like the honourable ""member for Sturt talk lovingly and tearfully about free enterprise. We used to have free enterprise, but now we must regard it as almost an event in the history of Australia. Free competition at the honest grass root level of past times is rapidly dis? appearing under the ruthless onslaught of monopolisation and takeovers. Large scale takeovers have reduced true private enterprise and true independent trading to .puny proportions. If this tendency continues, by the turn of this century there will hardly be one example of truly free enterprise, truly private enterprise or truly independent enterin the cemetery of capitalism and on it is slow death at the hands of monopolies, financial moguls, dishonest dealers, takeover merchants and restrictive trade practices."" The letters "" R.I.P."" do not appear on the tombstone because there is not peace for free enterprise, although apparently it has been buried in the way that I have mentioned. The most amazing phenomenon of recent years under this Liberal and Country Party coalition Government has been the process of nationalisation by monopolisation. Here we have had the arch opponents of government nationalisation sweeping all adherents of government nationalisation out the front door while permitting private nationalisation groups to come in the back door under the guise of monopoly. Ifi n the eyes of Liberalism one form of nationalisation is wrong so also must the other form be wrong in fact. Herein lies the Government's hypocrisy. Until now, after about 16 years in office, the Government's hypocrisy has been seen in this phenomenon. The Government condemns a suggestion of government nationalisation of activities like banking or production but it has allowed monopolies and restrictive trade to kill the business of the little man and to kill true competition between business enterprises throughout Australia. In other words, within its policy it has encouraged the creeping paralysis of nationalisation by monopolisation to go on unchecked. That is anotner reason why this Bill is before us at the moment. Monopoly enterprise is rapidly replacing private enterprise; restrictive enterprise is replacing free enterprise; and combination is replacing competition. Anyone who does not think so is either moving about with his eyes shut or just does not want to see. Some very interesting comments have been made in the course of this debate, especially by some honourable members on this side of the chamber. Last night the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) in what was in my opinion one of his best speeches, saidPrices are determined, not by competition in the market place, but by management in the board rooms. Truer words could not have been spoken. I come now to the efficacy of this Bill. Will it work? That is the 64 dollar question. We are putting tremendous power in the hands of one man by passing this measure. That is amazing from a government like the present Government. It is proposed that the Commissioner of Trade Practices will have tremendous responsibilities. He will be assaulted from all sides by business people, and his will not be an enviable job. One of the weaknesses that I see in the legislation is that the Commissioner will not be answerable to Parliament for his decisions. In this respect the Bill is unlike the British Act, a copy of which I have before me at the moment. In a booklet ""Industry in Britain: Organisation and Production "" prepared for the British Information Services, an article on monopolies and restrictive practices states at page 17 that no order can be made by the British Monopolies Commission under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1956 without the approval of Parliament. In Australia the Government is bypassing the voice of the people, which is the Parliament in a democracy. I believe that some day, if this Government does not do so, a Labour government will bring the actions and the orders of the Commissioner to the Parliament for scrutiny and ultimate approval or otherwise. Mr Goss, secretary of the Wholesale Wine and Spirits Merchants Association of Tasmania, said in a letter that he sent to all members of the Parliament that the Tribunal is apparendy intended to be an autonomous body and not answerable to Federal Parliament like other instrumentalities such as the Tariff Board. He said that he believed it was highly desirable that the Tribunal should be answerable to Parliament. Of course it is desirable. That is one of the main criticisms that I have of the Bill, in a broad sense. My next criticism is that the Bill repeals the. famous Australian Industries Preservation Act, 1906-1930. The Australian Industries Preservation Act is a piece of legislation that Liberal governments have never used; it has been allowed to gather dust on the shelves. That Act provides an excellent weapon for any government that wishes to help to preserve what may be called truly free enterprise in Australia, but it is now to go by the board as a result of this new legislation. That is a great pity. There has been little consultation between the Attorney-General( Mr Snedden) and the States on this very important legislation. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition mentioned this last night and quoted the exact words of the Victorian Minister who introduced that State's Collusive Practices Bill. That Minister said that there had been no consultation with him about the legislation. That is a great pity, because the legislation will affect everybody in every State. Even if the States do not bring in complementary legislation this measure will apply at the Federal level in all States. The Attorney General has assured us of this. At the moment Western Australia has legislation similar to this. Tasmania has done a magnificent job in bringing down in May of this year a report of a royal commission. I shall quote part of that report a little later. Apart from Victoria, all States either have or are contemplating not exactly the same legislation, but similar legislation. Actually the States are condemnatory of this Bill. Apart from the legislation to which I have referred, there is no evidence of other restrictive trade practices legislation in any State. That makes it more important that there should have been consultation between the Attorney-General and the States on every aspect of this important and pioneering legislation. Why has there been a delay of four years in producing this legislation? We know what has been going on behind the scenes. There has been tremendous pressure on the Government to pull out the teeth of the Barwickp roposals, and there has been pressure on the Government backbenchers from big business in their electorates. All this has been going on for nearly four years and that is the main reason for the delay. Honourable members on this side of the chamber did not believe that the Bill would ever hit the deck. However, finally the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) stood everybody up and decided that tbe Bill was to be introduced and would go through. We are now in the process of putting it through. This legislation does a lot of things but, interestingly enough, some of the important things are left out. I just want to mention one comment made by the honourable member for Cunningham ( Mr Connor) last night. He said of the B ill It claims to be comprehensive in covering restrictive agreements and practices, yet it contains between country councils and city councils and no proposals for the control of mergers and takeovers or for the control of individual as distinct from collective resale price maintenance. The degree of market concentration which prevails throughout the Australian economy is unusually high and particularly so in comparison with and Tender Department practically all other items the American, British and Canadian economies. There are other factors not covered by the legislation. When honourable members compare this Bill with the legislation of Great Britain and the United States-the United States legislation came into operation in about 1910 when the Sherman anti trust laws were introduced-the y will be amazed at how much has been left out of this legislation. Why should unfair, unjust and illegimate business practices receive better treatment here than in any other country. Perhaps it is because this is the first time that Australian legislation of this type has been brought in. Perhaps by the time our act has been in existence as long as the British and American acts we may provide for more stringent penalties, but at the moment our legislation is not to be compared with the acts of those two countries. We have had much evidence of collusive tendering. This is a new feature and one of the evils of big business. I should like to quote from the "" Advocate"", a newspaper which circulates within my electorate. It is published in Burnie, which is within the electorate of the honourable member for Braddon( Mr Davies), but like the "" Mercury"" which is published in Hobart and the "" Examiner"" which is published in Launceston it circulates throughout the electorate of Wilmot, which covers half the island of Tasmania. I have to read three daily newspapers to keep in touch with what is happening in my electorate. On 27th July of this year the following report appeared in the "" Advocate"" under the heading "" Oil firms' identical tenders ' restrictive practice'-Councillor s claim ""The council decided That is, the Ulverstone Councilto take up with the Commonwealth Government the question of whether the identical tendering was, in fact, a restrictive practice. Further on the report continuedThe Warden (Cr. Little) said Government departments and city councils were being supplied with petrol at 7}d. a gallon less than councils. He asked why there should be a difference Government departments. In his opinion, the identical tendering by the oil companies amounted to a restrictive trade practice. Several private organisations in the Ulverstone Municipality were buying their petrol at a lower price than the council paid. "" As the Council can buy through the Supply it requires, I feel that petrol should be handled on the same basis,"" Cr. Little added. The Council Clerk, Mr Gane, is reported as sayingAs far as practicable, all other items supplied by the Supply and Tender Department are available to the Council at the same price as that paid by Government departments. That day the Council had a very interesting discussion about collusive tendering by the oil companies for council petrol supplies and the way in which it kept prices up higher than the prices at which the Council could get petrol from other sources.",45,Trade Practices Bill 1965

Good luck to that State. I propose to quote from the report of Mr John McBain Grant, who was the Tasmanian royal commissioner. In that document, which consists of 84 pages, are many evidences of collusive tendering in our island State. At page 18 of the report, the commissioner statesMr L. G.

However, later last year they decided not to attention to a very important example of put in collusive tenders. Probably they bewhat is happening under the system of came scared about this kind of legislation collusive tendering. We have proof beyond being introduced. Evidently they have doubt in the commissioner's report. I should abandoned the practice as it affects the now like to refer to two or three paragraphs Supply and Tender Department. The comon the same subject which appear at page missioner also quoted this exampleMr S.

The agreements and arrangements which are responsible for level or collusive tendering in these cases were beyond the power of the Commission to obtain. So we see that not only the four Australian companies that were supplying multi-core control cable but also overseas companies were submitting identical tenders to the Hydro-Electric Commission. At page 19 the Commissioner reportedMr E. Poulson gave evidence of identical tenders being received for sports goods, picks, mattocks, axes, shovels, cement, nails, galvanised water pipe and fittings, steel of various classifications, plywood, plain and barbed wire, mesh wire, spanners, vices, screwdrivers, automotive parts and accessories, air compressors, tyres, rubber belting and books. For all of these products the nature of the restrictive trade practice producing level tendering is described in AppendixC under the heading of the appropriate trade association. That is a fantastic gathering in of a variety of items in relation to which there was collusive tendering.

The elimination of these restrictive trade practices would not only tend to reduce imports, but in so far as it moderated the rate of price increase it would assist exporters, particularly the primary producers, whose products are sold on competitive world markets That is an outstanding report. The findings United States connections, most companies did are there in black and white. The Tasmanian not report any interest in exports for the obvious Government will do its best to implement that those that it can. The Tasmanian royal right to export. commission has gone a long way to show us in this Parliament just what is going on at the grass roots level of business in Australia as a result of collusive tendering and the use of horizontal and vertical agreements, as they are called, and of unilateral practices. FinallyI should like to mention another matter which is not covered by the Bill. It is the Government's failure to meet the serious difficulties threatening Australia's exports, and in particular its failure to counter the licence arrangements and agreements entered into by Australian manufacturers associated with overseas companies which prevent or restrict exports. This is a serious omission from the Act. There are two types of Australian manuAustralian company which, by reason of an agreement to pay royalties or licence or company the right to manufacture in carries a well known brand name. One of the conditions of such an agreement is that article which in fact is an Australian made article. The second type is the company which have evidence from the Department of export. The evidence which I have discloses that many of the companies had agreements Of the 650 Australian companies with which ths Department of Trade corresponded This was in 1960-6171 with British connections reported that they had signed agreements to limit or to restrict exports. As was the case with the companies having reason that they did not want to disclose the fact they had signed agreements restricting their That is, to export goods made here. I have evidence relating to an amazing number of manufacturers of stoves, grillers, boilers, washing machines, and refrigerators who have signed agreements restricting the export of their products to Australian controlled territories. The Commonwealth Statistician has revealed that in the 12 months ended 30th June 1963, Australia exported 1,326 mechanical type refrigerators. Of that number, 515 went to New Guinea. Others were exported to Papua, New Zealand, Fiji and Borneo. Of the 1,326 refrigerators exported, 1,071 went to Australian controlled Territories. Only 20 per cent, of them were allowed to be exported overseas. Their export was restricted",49,Trade Practices Bill 1965

As to non-mechanical refrigerators exported, only 23 per cent, were exported to areas outside Australiancontrolled Territories. The Minister for Trade and Industry has stated that 700 Australian companies were parties to 1,100 agreements which restricted the export of their goods and that with 40 per cent, of our manufacturing industries under foreign control, these restrictions were becoming serious. Unfortunately, a way to prevent or restrict this sort of operation is not provided in the Bill. I hope that when we become the Government we will put in the Act a section to limit this type of agreement which restricts our exports of vital products to overseas countries. I support the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and hope that the Bill is agreed to by the House. [2.59] -The honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) spent a good deal of his time trying to convince the House of the evils of collusive tendering. I do not think this is something that is in dispute. At the same time, he took the Government to task for failing to make the proposed tribunal directly responsible to the Parliament, or to the Government, or to the Minister. I take it that he believes that either the Government or the Minister or the Parliament should say what should be done if, subsequent to an inquiry, it was found by the tribunal that certain agreements or practices were contrary to the public interest. The honourable member should understand that the Government has been at some pains-and with some cause-to keep the enquiries and decisions in particular cases in this field out of direct political influence and out of direct political control. That is why the tribunal should be, within the limits of the Bill, master of its own proceedings. That is why it should make its own decisions and why I believe cases that may be contrary to the public interest should not be referred to a Minister of this Government or any subsequent government for actual decision. going on? think that, in his report to Parliament, the Commissioner would devote no little space to reference to the proceedings of the tribunal which, in any case, will be public. The proceedings of the tribunal will therefore be known; surely the action taken as a result of those proceedings will also be known. I should think that these would be matters that the Commissioner would include in his annual report to the Parliament. I certainly hope they will be included. The Opposition has shown very little enthusiasm for this measure ever since it was surprised by mention of the measure in the Governor General's Speech some considerable time ago. Apart from an odd question from the Opposition, there has been no real pressure on its part to hasten the Government's deliberations with relation to this particularly difncult and pioneering field. I believe there is a specific reason for this lack of interest on the part of the Opposition, a lack of interest that has been demonstrated not only over the past few years but also by lack of participation in this debate. Only one or two honourable members opposite have taken part in the debate so far. The lack of enthusiasm of honourable members opposite is explained, I believe, because their solution to the problems the Government is trying to tackle would be diametrically opposed to the kind of solution the Government would hope to achieve. I believe it would be their intention to let abuses develop until they had an opportunity to build up a case for either nationalisation, if that were permitted by the Constitution, or a Socialist cure of one kind or another which would bring industries much more directly within government control. That is something that we certainly do not want to see and something which I believe industry should not want to see. Industry should understand and appreciate the Government's motives from this point of view. I believe that the Government's solution is to control restrictive practices that are demonstrated to be contrary to the public interest and which tend to destroy free competition. There are, of course, difficulties associated with the definition of these very general that aspect a litde later.",50,Trade Practices Bill 1965

104,Mr Malcolm Fraser,"I shouldOne of the first tasks which I think the honourable member for Parramatta ( MrI do not want to give the view that these Bowen) mentioned earlier in this debate was to demonstrate the need for this particular legislation. I think it can be shown that the degree of monopoly, or of limited competition-the economists' term is "" oligopoly ""-is much greater in Australia than in many other countries. This might, in part, be a symptom of a younger, smaller and less developed economy. In any case, it is interesting to note with relation to the degree of concentration, that in 19S7-58 the industries in which the first eight firms accounted for SO per cent, of national sales employed 60 per cent, of the manufacturing work force in Australia. In the United States of America, the comparable figure is 30 per cent. This example can be pushed even further. In the same year, the industries proper procedures. However, the Australian in which the first four firms accounted for 75 per cent, of the sales of those industries, that they should not buy at this sale because employed 25 per cent, of the work force. I have one other example. There are about 12 monopolies which account for about 9 per cent, of the value added to the gross national product in each year. These include such monopolies as steel, sugar and many others. In addition, there is concentration in Australian industry on a different basis -the y would be so subject to competition It is what has been termed the symmetrical basis of market formation, in which many small firms are dependent upon a large customer of a large supplier and therefore are largely dependent on the behaviour of this large customer or large supplier. Some of the conclusions of the royal commission in Tasmania have been quoted at length. A royal commission in Western Australia found that there were, I think, 111 trade associations, many of which have had restrictive practices. In 1961 Professor Alec Hunter showed that there were 119 practices or agreements in Victoria, and probably about 600 in Australia, including many different types of restrictive practice-agree d price fixing, retailers being advised not to stock a rival's goods because if they did they would be subjected to collective boycott, collective re-sale price maintenance, destructive price-cutting, collusive tendering or collusive bidding. Those, of course, are just a few of the types of restrictive practices or agreements that can be present in an economy. The examinations that have taken place have, I think, demonstrated the marked concentration and the remarkable number of trade associations in Australia. are necessarily of themselves evil, but I believe this concentration and this presence of trade associations do establish a case for an examination to see whether or not they behave or act in the public interest, or whether they act in the specifically narrow sectional interest of a small group of people. This view in my own case-and I admit this without prejudice-ha s been reinforced by personal experience of a restrictive practice or restrictive agreement. Without wearying the House with the details of the matter, I mention that it was a situation in which a particular wool broking company had a wool store filled with wool and it advertised the sale in accordance with Council of Wool Buyers told its members it did not want a new buying centre opened in this particular area at Portland. Some buyers turned up at the sale, but because there were so few they admitted quite frankly that they were not prepared to go in and bid at the sale. They said that if they did their livelihoods would be destroyed and practices from other buyers that they would not be able to remain in the wool buying industry. They said that the ring was complete and if they bought wool they would not be able to ship it because nobody would handle it and nobody would dump it. This particular practice prevented the establishment of wool sales at Portland for a considerable time. It was a practice broken only by the threat of legislation in the State of Victoria. Once a development in an area has been restricted by a practice or an agreement of this kind, and once a person has had experience of this kind of thing, which can and does restrict development, a person then comes down fairly firmly with the view that this thing should be subject to supervision and control. I am, therefore, more than glad that the Government is acting as it has acted in this particular matter. The result of the first few years of the United Kingdom legislation underlined again the nature of restrictive practices in the United Kingdom and the need for legislation there. In 1961 two-thirds of the agreements that had been registered concerned selling prices. Of 970 nationwide agreements, 790 contained selling price provisions, 300 contained exclusive dealing provisions, 300 had market sharing arrangements and 200 concerned product limitations. In the first three years 85 agreements were examined and 730 agreements were abandoned even though only 250 had received up to that time notice that they were to be subjected to examination. Quite obviously many of the parties to the agreement felt or knew that they had no chance of justifying the agreements in terms of the provisions of the United Kingdom Act and, therefore, they did not even try to argue their cases. It has been said that since the effect of the United Kingdom Act has been felt, competition has greatly increased in certain specific fields, notably groceries, tyres and tobacco, to mention three particular industries. If an examination of the United Kingdom experience, and what we know of our own case, leads us to believe that action is required to cover the Australian scene, our purpose must be clearly understood so that there can be no misunderstanding by any person, group or industry in the community. Our purpose can be easily expressed in general terms, but it is difficult of precise definition. This is why clause 50 is expressed in the terms in which it is expressed. As I said, our purpose is difiicult of precise definition, first, because of the conflict of interest that often arises. There may be a conflict of interest between consumers and competitors in an industry. Consumers may be better served by one large firm in the industry that may be quite capable of producing goods at a cheaper price than many smaller firms, but there may be an advantage in having many smaller firms in the industry to maintain more active competition. These are things that have to be weighed. Also, the objectives are difficult of precise definiwhich in one sense is a desirable objective, tion because few restrictions or practices are wrong and evil in all circumstances. In one sense our purpose may be defined as an attempt to prevent undue economic power held singly or in association being used unfairly in a narrow sectional interest as opposed to being used reasonably in the general interest. In clause 50 we find one definite statement it were defined as ih the interests of the -that the preservation and encouragement consumer, or equated with the interests of of competition are desirable in the public the consumer, we would find the same diffiinterest. There is an assumption, as I underculties and the same inherent contradictions, stand it, that a detriment occurs from restriction of competition or a tendency to restrict competition. Against this detriment must be weighed the specific interests of many different groups-consumers , employers, importers, exporters, investors, small businesses and new enterprises, to name some that are mentioned in this provision. It is clear that there may be a conflict of interest not only between people within these groups whose interests must be weighed against the detriment resulting from reduced competition, but also between groups that are so named, and the reduction of competition, or alleged reduction of competition itself. These are matters that will have to be judged or weighed by the tribunal. The tribunal will have to come out with some balance that will be in the public interest. It may be regrettable, but I see no alternative, that it is not possible to be more precise in the definition in clause 50, but I think the imprecision is due to the difficulties of the circumstances, because circumstances are rarely precisely the same. We will, therefore, in many instances, be subject to judgemade law in this respect, the only legal requirement, as I understand it, being to show that these relevant interests have been taken properly into account in making any broad decision. Clause 50 equates in many senses competition with public interest, but in many instances it is possible to show that unrestrained competition of certain kinds is not necessarily equal to the public interest. For example, unrestrained competition may drive out small firms and may lead to a reduction in standards and, therefore, competition needs to be restrained. The Bill takes regard of these particular matters. There is also the possibility that competition, between small firms may lead to higher prices than would obtain with a smaller number of firms in the same industry. Thus we are forced to the kind of arrangement in which it will be up to the Trade Practices Tribunal to balance all these different interests. I think we would be forced to the same kind of conclusion even if public interest were defined in any other terms. If so I do not see any alternative to clause bring down amendments in the future after SO as it is or something very much like we have seen how the legislation works, clause SO. Perhaps before discussing this aspect of put an alternative view to that which has the BillI should give some thought to how been accepted by the Government may be we should approach the general problem of borne in mind. bringing the necessary degree of supervision, control or restraint into the field by some members of the Opposition, but of restricted practice of one kind or another. again we emphasise that we do not want There is, of course, the United States apto interfere unduly with industry. We want proach, which should be well understood. merely to touch upon agreements and pracIt is an approach that certain practices or tices that in themselves unfairly penalise certain kinds of behaviour are without the people who are not parties to those agreelaw and that there can be no possible justiments or practices. I think it is worth notfication for them. There is also the approach ing that the original United Kingdom legistbat has been adopted in the United Kinglation really covered no wider field than dom; that is, of registration and possible does this legislation. Sir Garfield Barwick examination. That, of course, is largely the made a note of this in a speech he made in approach we have adopted. I have heard January 1963. I mink it is important to go some people say that there is a third approach carefully and steadily in this matter. We of proscription of the practice or agreement, do not want to cover the whole field with and of susequent appeal; but I can see no one wide dramatic sweep, because it is real difference between this and the approach necessary to see how the legislation acts of registration and examination, because if and reacts upon industry. It is better to there were a proscription of a practice or go cautiously in a matter as important as agreement, and a subsequent appeal, the this, than to attempt to achieve everything same kind of examination would be necesat one step. sary as will be necessary under present circumstances. I can see no substantial difference. I think it is generally agreed that the agreements-to be registered. I think it American approach has been shown to be should be noted that in the United Kingtoo much of a sledgehammer for our cirdom, which has a wider economy than ours, cumstances, which are quite different from only 2,700 agreements have been registered. the American circumstances. Few practices Presumably we can expect fewer. Only two or agreements are unreasonable in all ciralternatives exist to registration. One is the cumstances, although it may be that this American approach, which I believe we all kind of approach would lead to a stricter reject. The other alternative is investigation control by Parliament because we would not and prosecution.

If industry United States in its approach. In any case, really thought the matter through, it would we are forced back to registration and not want the Commissioner to be served by examination. I have strong general support for the practices in every corner of industry; asking Bill as it is, but it is possible that more questions everywhere to find out what is than one point of view can be put on certaking place. I believe that if industry extain of its aspects. These different points perienced that practice, it would wish that of view are respectable, and I hope they will tion that has been adopted by the be taken into account, not in the sense Government. that further amendments are required at the Committee stage, but in the sense that if experience of the legislation in practice register should be a secret one. As I undershows that it might be more advantageous to stand it, the decision was made for three then the points on which it is possible to The scope of the Bill has been criticised Industry has said that it is opposed to registration. It has been said that there will be too many agreementsa flood of a vast staff seeking out agreements and it had supported the approach of registraThe Government has decided that the or four reasons. I readily concede that a public register presents administrative problems. In any case, some parts of some agreements would have to be secret. In the United Kingdom, where the register is public, it is therefore necessary to have two registers. It has been said that industry will be more willing to co-operate in registering agreements if the register is secret. The purpose of the register is to provide evidence, and a secret register does that just as well as does a public register. I accept these arguments, but I think there are points of view on the other side -that should be noted. The CSmmissioner will bc a person of some power. I believe it important that a check should be placed on that power and that there should be knowledge, especially in this Parliament, of .what he is doing. Knowledge of his actions, will come from the proceedings before the Tribunal, which will be public, and from reports to Parliament. However, the reports to Parliament cannot be complete, in many respects, because they cannot provide details of the register. They might bs able to cover the broad scope of the kinds of agreement that come forward, but clearly a report cannot give intimate details of thc register, because it is a secret register. I believe that the Commissioner's reports may be more likely to develop in detail some arguments or information relating to proceedings before the Tribunal. Therefore, even though the Attorney General can see the register and Ministers of participating States can see documents from the register, I believe that the Attorney-General will not have time to go through the whole of the register. He could not be expected to do so. It seems that there is to be no check over the Commissioner's selection of cases to take before the Tribunal. I am not sure that this procedure is altogether right. The check I would like to see can be provided only by a public register. I hope that this matter will bc watched so that we can see how it works out in practice. I believe the decision of the Governto be done, and then settlement may be ment and the Minister that presidential reached by agreement before the case promembers of the Tribunal shall be people of ceeds to the Tribunal. This has happened judicial status is a wise one. However, I in the United Kingdom and is likely to am still concerned about the position of happen here. The inclusion of the Tribunal lay members of the Tribunal. I believe that of part time members should not be taken full time lay members would not be of the to indicate a lack of enthusiasm in the proquality desired. I think this argument was secution of these measures. conceded. It may be possible to obtain people of higher calibre and quality from part time lay members, but a problem still arises, because such part time members possibly will have two interests. They may have an interest in an industry. They may still be active in an industry which could, on the fringe, touch upon an agreement under examination. It may be thought that this is unlikely, but the possibility should be noted that on the fringe a part time member's interest could lie in an industry that touches upon an inquiry being undertaken, even though it was thought at the outset that that would not occur. Part time members of the Tribunal could have an interest in an industry that is quite unrelated to an inquiry but which engages in similar practices to that under inquiry. It is possible that this kind of interest would not be revealed until the inquiry was well under way. All pecuniary interests of the Commissioner must be made known to the Attorney General. I believe this kind of solution would be quite inappropriate for the lay members and that this is a matter which will have to be solved by good sense. It will be interesting to see how many cases before the Tribunal are decided, by choice of the parties, by judicial members alone. I would not be at all surprised if the parties chose to have the inquiries conducted in this manner. The criticism has been made that the Tribunal may not be kept active. It has been said that not as much work will be done as we should like to see done because the Tribunal will be composed of part time members. I think we need to know the reality of what has happened in the United Kingdom. In Australian terms, the Commissioner would conduct an inquiry. It may take a considerable time to prepare evidence to be taken before the Tribunal. A case may be scheduled to be heard by the Tribunal, but it is settled before going to the Tribunal. It may have been thought that a considerable amount of work would have The honourable member for Wilmot( Mr the economic liberties of other people. We Duthie), who preceded me in the debate, referred to export franchises. I wish to make one or two points in relation to this matter. The Bill does not specifically exclude export franchises. But exports are limited at times by reason of three factors -becaus e of patent rights from an overseas firm, because of an agreement that may not be subject to a patent right, and because of policies of overseas owners of Australian subsidiaries. Patent rights are exempt from many of the provisions of the legislation, as 1 believe they should be. Agreements not subject to patent rights could be caught by the legislation, but this would be an extremely limited field and, maybe, one we would not want to catch because the Australian firm would not get permission to produce whatever it was producing unless it formed this kind of agreement. Subsidiaries of overseas firms probably form the largest category. These also in many cases would not be caught because of the provision of related companies in which these are treated as one person. Questions of high and difficult policy are General involved in these matters. It might well be that the problems could be overcome by persuasion or tax policies more specifically that it is labour that has brought forth only then they could be overcome by legislation a mouse. The Opposition does not oppose of a restrictive practices nature. But I think the legislation and does not propose to we should note that the United States amend it in the many places where we approach has tended to try to bring within think it should be amended. We think that the ambit of that country's laws any practice the legislation is altogether too intricate or agreement that reduces or tends to -to o bureaucratic in many ways-to make reduce United States exports. There was a a constructive programme of amendment case in which the United States Timken possible. However, we propose one simple organisation, owning a fair part of the general amendment to the motion for the United Kingdom Timken organisation, second reading. I support that amendment, struck down an agreement under which which readsthere had been market sharing between the two concerns, although the ownership and view control of the two concerns were similar. "" this House notes with approval that, in response This matter needs to be kept under review. to public pressure, the Government has introduced It is a matter of the greatest importance, this limited Bill but deplores:but I do not have time properly to deal with it now. Our purpose in this measure is, I think, clear. It is not to force any change in the structure of the economy but to take advantage of changing circumstances and our rate of growth to encourage a vigorous, vital and competitive economy. We hope to remove restrictions that unduly hamper are pioneering in this field and as a consequence we need to keep an open mind. I hope that the Government will do this in relation to amendments that may prove to be necessary as a result of our experience of the legislation in practice. It would be remarkable if such amendments did not prove to be necessary. I fully support the legislation, as I have made plain, but it is idle not to recognise the authority that has been given to the tribunal and perhaps particularly to the Commissioner. We must see that the intention of the Parliament and the Government is administered not only withfirmnessbut, where necessary, also with moderation. We should hold ourselves ready to correct any defects in the law that may reveal themselves. Dr. J. F. CAIRNS (Yarra) [3.29] -Afte r expecting this legislation for five years and nine months, the Opposition at last welcomes its appearance in the Parliament. Attorneysand many other people have laboured on the legislation for that length of time, but I think it is legitimate to say That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a to inserting the following words in place thereof:(1) the Government's failure to hold a referendum, as unanimously recommended by the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review in its reports presented to the House on lst October 1958 and 26th November 1959, to give the Parliament power to make comprehensive national laws with respect to restrictive trade practices; and (2) its abandonment of a substantial part of the proposals of the former Attorney General, for legislation on restrictive trade practices and monopolies, as outnised the need for legislation of this kind lined to the House on 6th December 1962 particularly with respect to resale price maintenance, persistent price cutof the Governor General's Speech, it saidting, monopolisation and mergers."" The amendment points out a number of the significant things in relation to this BiU. This Bill is before us today because of public pressure. The Government of big husiness, the Executive of private enterprise, would not be seeking to regulate, even to the extent that it is now, the activities of private enterprise, were it not for public pressure and a belief that, having committed itself as long ago as March 1960 to the provision of legislation of this kind, it could no longer postpone the introduction of the legislation, as it has postponed it for almost five years and nine months. The amendment moved by the Opposition also points out that the Government is unwilling to seek adequate power to deal with restrictive trade practices because it does not really want effective power to deal with them or with what it calls private enterprise. If it did, it would know that, with the support of every political party in Australia, it would have an excellent chance of having carried a referendum proposal to remove all the constitutional difficulties and the legal loopholes that exist in this legislation. This is the test of the sincerity of the Government in respect of this legislation: If it were true that the Government wanted to legislate effectively in respect of restrictive trade practices, the first thing that it would have done would have been to put a proposal in a referendum, as unanimously recommended by the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review, which Committee included members of the Government parties. The Government would have had the support of every political party in Australia in this respect. The proof of its insincerity is that it does not want effective power to interfere with its own managers, the people who control it and the kind of organisations to which this relatively ineffective legislation is expected to apply. I believe that it is necessary for the House at this stage to compare the attitude of the Government on this matter with its attitude on other matters. There has been delay and prevarication on this matter. It is almost six years since the Government first announced that it would consider legislation of this kind. The Government recogin March 1960 when, through the medium The development of tendencies to monopoly and restrictive practices in commerce and industry has engaged the attention of the Government which will give consideration to legislation to protect and strengthen free enterprise against such a development. So the Government had already given attention to the matter; it had been thinking of the matter before March 1960. Now, after a period of about five years and nine months, we have before us a Bill which has been weakened considerably in that intervening time. One is entitled to compare the Government's attitude to the introduction of this piece of weakened legislation to deal with free enterprise with its attitude to the workers and trade unions. Recently we debated a bill to amend the Stevedoring Industry Act. It did not take the Government five years and nine months to bring in that amending bill. It was introduced in this House one day and we were told that we had to debate it the next day and that it had to be passed before the end of that week. We had to sit on a Friday in order to do that. The Government does not take five years and nine months to introduce legislation to deal with the workers and trade unions. The honourable member for Wannon( Mr Malcolm Fraser) has told us that this is a pioneering field. It is a field in which the Government has been pioneering for more than five years and nine months. It is a field in which the Sherman Act was passed in the United States of America in 189075 years ago. This, we are told, is a pioneering field. Does the honourable member for Wannon know these things? Does he think that a field in which there has been activity for 75 years is a fah example of a pioneering field? The honourable member for Cunningham ( Mr Connor) pointed out yesterday that legislation against such restrictive practices has been enacted in Denmark, France, Holland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, West Germany and the United Kingdom. Is this a pioneeringfield?It is a field in which there has been legislation for 75 years, and every country comparable to Australia has had legislation of this kind for a great many years. I notice that the honourable member for Wannon read his speech. So his statement that this is a pioneering field was a considered one; it was not just staff with adequate knowledge of, or experience in, a slip of the tongue. When one compares this legislation with, ceedings, . . . say, the Stevedoring Industry Act, one finds Compare that with the Stevedoring Industry a very great difference. As far as it goes Bill. Was there any provision in that Bill as a piece of legislation to combat restricthat anyone on behalf of the Government tive practices this Bill, in my opinion, conshould consult the Waterside Workers fers considerable powers.

On of legislation to combat restrictive practices the other hand, in that Stevedoring Industhis measure would pass the test. But when try Bill, which was produced one day and one bas a careful look at it one sees just required to be debated the next and passed how weak it is.

106,Mr Bowen,"The honourable member isits parliamentary members should decide what is the correct policy for a primary industry. It has always been the policy of my Party that those who produce, own and sell a product are the best judges of the way in which their own property should be treated. It is the function of my Party to see that the will of those who produce and own the product is carried into legislative and administrative effect. Let us consider the attitude of the Minister for Trade and Industry. He will not interfere with anyone who produces or sells a product, except in the way that the person who produces and sells the product wants him to do. That is what he does in respect of a primary product such as wool. He will not come away from this assumed attitude of neutrality on the wool referendum because it is a product, as he defines it, of the country. What is his attitude to this legislation? The Minister for Trade and Industry knows that there is a great deal of objection from free enterprise, as the Government calls it, to the legislation that is before the House today. He knows that the Government is imposing things upon the so-called free enterprise in this legislation. He is prepared to accept that position. Presumably, he is prepared to vote for it. Let us contrast his attitude in that regard with his attitude when the product is labour that somebody is selling. Did the Minister hesitate to support the Stevedoring Industry Bill because the Government had not consulted with the Waterside Workers Federation? Did he require prior consultation on that occasion? Did he ask for a referendum of the Waterside Workers Federation before the Government introduced the Stevedoring Industry Bill? One has only to consider the so-called principles of honourable members opposite to see how one sided the principles are. ignores the fact that there is a long history to the stevedoring industry legislation. It dates back to the Chifley Government. Dr. J. F. CAIRNS -Of course there is, and it is about time that we had a long history of legislation to regulate the people for whom the Minister for Shipping and Transport stands-the monopolies and the big businesses for which the Minister is the agent in this House. I refer to the shipping companies which dominate the export trade. They have been his responsibility for some considerable time. It is about time we had a long history in this regard. Of course, we have a long history of legislation to regulate labour, and it is a very one-sided history. The monopolies have grown in power and the Minister has applauded this. No doubt he has received his compensations from what has been going on, because he has been associated with business in his time. This is the attitude that honourable members opposite normally adopt. They want to regulate labour, and they are doing so. They claim that there is a long history of such regulation. It is clear as I think almost every honourable member who has participated in this debate has recognised that restrictive practices exist which are, in fact, most harmful. Almost everybody who has spoken in the debate has given extensive evidence of the nature and extent of restrictive practices. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam), in his speech, referred to an inquiry which had shown that about 32 industries in Australia were identified as highly concentrated. Among those industries in which only one company was producing the total Australian production were refined zinc, pig iron, ball and rubber bearings, linoleum, industrial gases, sheet glass and writing paper. Those industries in which there were only two companies producing the whole output were steel making and rolling, steel sheeting and sugar refining. Industries in which there were three companies producing the total output were matches, alkalis and chlorine, electric lamps, radio valves and television tubes and glass containers. The extent of concentration and centralisation of industry in Australia is probably greater than in any other country. The extent of concentration comes as a surprise to most people when they hear of it. It comes as a surprise to know, for instance, that in 1961 there were 57,782 factories in the whole of Australia but that of those factories only 1,813, or 3.1 per cent, of them, employed over 51 per cent, of the people employed in all factories. It is fair enough to say that if they had over 51 per cent, of the employees they also had over 50 per cent, of the income and output of all of the factories in Australia. That is to say, 3.1 per cent, of the factories had over 50 per",58,Trade Practices Bill 1965
107,Mr Freeth,"The honourable membercent, of the output, income and employees of all factories. Turning to companies we find that 1.7 per cent, of the tax paying companies possess 61.7 per cent, of the taxable income of all companies, and they probably also possess over 60 per cent, of the output and the staff of all companies as well. It is fair to say that probably fewer than 3 per cent, of all the economic units in Australia, fewer than 3 out of 100-probably some 2,000 or 3,000 of them-posses s over 60 per cent, of the income, output, staff, machinery and power to make decisions in the Australian economy. That degree of concentration is probably as great as that which exists in any country. In these circumstances there are bound to such as Dr. H. C. Coombs, Governor of be restrictive practices. The honourable the Reserve Bank, who saidmember for Wilmot( Mr Duthie), who spoke a little while ago in this debate, even quoted from the report of an inquiry that from . . . those who make decisions in had been made in Tasmania. That inquiry business. . . . revealed the extent to which there were restrictive practices in that State, and these traders. No doubt some degree of competition practices are probably greater in some of poly the mainland States than they are in Tasthat prices are determined by management rather mania. These restrictive practices should be than by the market for a wide range of goods outlawed. I think this Bill goes some of the and that within significant margins producers can way, and if it is used effectively it could decide at what prices their goods will be sold. achieve results that will be beneficial to the Australian economy. But the Bill does not This tendency for prices to be higher than go very far. It creates an intricate and they should be, this tendency for exploitation costly bureaucracy and I think the criticisms that exists significantly in a concentrated that have been made in respect of this have monopolistic type of economy, is a natural considerable validity in them. One only has and indigenous condition of an economy to refer to clause 35 and clauses 23 to 34 of that kind. There is nothing, I think, that in Part III of the Bill to see how extensive restrictive practices legislation of this kind this bureaucracy might be. It might well be better to create specific, distinguished as Dr. Coombs is in Ausdescribed conditions as clear as possible and tralia, namely, Gardner Ackerly, the Chairto allow those conditions to create offences man of the President's Committee of for which the offenders could be taken to Economic Advisers, who saysa court and tried like anyone else who breaks the law. If one cannot be sure of that the inflationary process is essentially an what the nature of the offence has to be, administrative one. . . . Whether aggregate then, of course, some kind of an inquiry demand is excessive or deficient, the problem of is justified. An example of this was the inflation Tasmanian inquiry that the honourable memas well as the wage side. ber for Wilmot mentioned. I think that we have to ask ourselves the question: What The result of this kind of examination is particular condition is it that we are enthat the overwhelming part of the price deavouring to get at and to stop in respect problem-the problem where prices are of restrictive practices? It is not that thi higher than they should be; where there is practice itself is something that can be a degree of exploitadon in prices-doe s objected to. There is very often no reason not come from restrictive practices at all. why people should not combine and act It comes from the natural state of a together. Sometimes such a combination produces a beneficial result. What is complained about-and this, I think, is of the essence of the matter-is that restrictive practices can lead to excessive prices. They can lead to exploitation. It is the excessive price aspect, the exploitation of the restrictive practices, that makes them objectionable. Once we direct our attention to the fact that we are concerned with the higher prices than otherwise should be chargedwith the exploitation-then , I think, we see the total significance of the problem that we are endeavouring to meet by legislation of this kind. I have previously cited in this Mouse the opinions of leading economists, The tendency for prices to "" creep"" upwards in periods when total demand is not excessive, and when it is mildly deficient, derives in part Consider the pricing policies of industrialists and prevails . . . but there are degrees of monoand tacitly accepted practices which mean can do to deal with that problem. In the United States we have an economist as In the above analysis I have, in effect, argued needs to be analysed in administrative, that is, essentially political terms, and on the price centralised, concentrated form of industrial structure. Recently in our own country the Vernon report dealt also with this problem in respect of tariffs, and pointed out that in the Australian economy tariffs have contributed to the creation of this kind of centralisation or monopolisation of industries. It pointed out that it would be unreasonable to go on forever giving tariff protection without some undertaking about price policy. It statedA request for an undertaking about price policy if high protection is given would not be unreasonable, especially where the product concerned is an essential raw material. I think it is apparent that while some good can come from restrictive practices legislation of this kind, it is only a very marginal matter in relation to the main problems of the economy in respect of the improper price increases with which we have to deal. In conclusion, I think that we have reached the stage in this country where there is a significant division in the governing parties. This has emerged in a number of respects in the last couple of weeks. There is a relatively progressive or liberal wing of the Government parties, those who are prepared to go as far as they are going in supporting restrictive practices legislation of the kind produced by the Attorney General, but sitting behind the Ministers who are responsible for this is a very considerable opposition. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Whittorn) said that he was totally against this legislation. It will be interesting to notice how he votes. The honourable member for Sturt( Mr Wilson) said, in effect, that he was prepared to support this legislation only because it had been weakened in such a way that it would probably not be effective. The honourable member would not have supported the legislation that was proposed in the first place by the former Attorney-General, Sir Garfield Barwick. This opposition to the relatively progressive section of the Government parties is a matter of considerable significance. Those who oppose the members of their parties who would be prepared to go as far as this Bill goes are a good deal more backward than anyone in the British Tory Party. This legislation would be accepted by almost every member of that Party. The division in the ranks of the Government parties showed up a week ago in respect of economic sanctions on Southern Rhodesia. The Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) took a stand in favour of economic sanctions. Almost every other member of the Government parties who spoke in that debate was against sanctions. It is of significance to the House and to the nation that the coming retirement of the Prime Minister will increase and strengthen the reactionary section of the Liberal Party. This will become a problem of no little significance in Australian politics in the relatively near future. One can notice the inadequate examination that has been made of this legislation by, for instance, the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Malcolm Fraser), who supports it. He spoke of the wool sales at Portland, where wool buyers got together and refused to buy wool that was to be sold there. The wool buyers did not want another wool selling centre to be established. What the honourable member for Wannon forgot to tell us-thi s is an indication of the inadequacy of his analysis of the Bill-wa s whether he thought the legislation would have any relevance to the Portland case. He told us that it was necessary to have legislation of this kind. He told us that the events at Portland had been dealt with because the Victorian Government had threatened to introduce legislation if the wool buyers continued with their boycott. But the Victorian Government has not yet introduced that legislation. So the honourable member for Wannon left us in doubt whether he thought this Bill would have any relevance to a case such as the refusal of wool buyers to buy wool at Portland. Presumably that is an intrastate matter in respect of which this legislation would not be effective. Mr Malcolm Fraser -The Australian Council of Wool Buyers is a national association of wool buyers and Dr. J. F. CAIRNS -I s it the honourable member's view that this legislation will apply to the Portland case? Mr Malcolm Fraser -Yes, certainly. Dr. J. F. CAIRNS -The honourable member forgot to mention that when he was speaking. I would have thought that he would have mentioned it. If honourable members opposite who are interjecting will look at "" Hansard"" they will find that the honourable member for Wannon did not say whether he thought this legislation would be relevant to the Portland case. The final point I want to make concerns export franchises and agreements. The Department of Trade and Industry has announced that over 700 companies are. involved in 1,100 agreements which are restricting exports from this country. What is the answer of Government supporters to this? The answer was given to us by the honourable member, for Wannon. He said that he did not think these were the kind of agreements we wanted to catch by legislation of this kind. Agreements to restrict exports are becoming more and more significant ever day. They have to be caught in some way. -Order! The honourable member's time has -expired. Mr Speaker, let me congratulate the -honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns) on an excellent exercise in Agitprop. He has learnt his lesson well. He did not .put a foot wrong. His comrades will be proud of him. Having said that, may I say that although the honourable member for Yarra may be acid, he is not always corrosive. He does not always take. But he did his best. Apparently the honourable member did not read clause 38(c) of the Bill. He expatiated on the woes of the trade unions, without realising that under this legislation as proposed the trade unions are singled out for special favourable mention. The trade unions are still allowed to maintain their monopoly in the field of labour. This is specifically provided in clause 38 (c) of the Bili. Far from trade unions being done wrong, exactly the opposite is the case. The trade unions get special benefits because they are not caught by any of the monopoly provisions. Let me leave the honourable member for Yarra with some regret and say that although I support this legislation I have grave disquiet about it. I realise, as does the Government, that something is required to be done about incipient restrictions or monopolisation in Australia. I think the objective of the legislation is good and, in fact, that the introduction of some legislation is necessary, but I am not prepared to say that I have no doubts. I am not happy about the framework or the details of the Bill, but I am afraid that I am not sufficiently informed to put forward a constructive alternative. I think the House will concede that I very seldom criticise without putting forward something constructive to replace the subject of my criticism. In this case I find myself at some loss I do not feel that I know the subject sufficiently well to put forward definite alternatives to what is proposed, although I think I can see some defects in certain of the proposals. This puts me in a dilemma. I know something has to be done. The Government has done something. As I have said, I am not altogether happy about it, but I am not in a position to put forward constructive alternatives to the things that 1 criticise. I think thc House will agree that I. do not usually find myself in this position. I hope that when the Bill reaches the Committee stage the Government will be reasonable about accepting the constructive amendments which will be advanced, not by myself but by. some of my legal friends who have been considering the matter. They perhaps suffer less than I do from thc lack of the services of a parliamentary draftsman. Such an officer-no t under the control of the Attorney-General but of the House-shoul d be available to us, particularly when we are dealing with a Bill of this nature, to draft technical amendments. Having made those generalised remarks, may I come to the Bill? There are some differences between the Australian position and the overseas position which have often been called into argument during the course of this debate. The first and most important difference, as I see it, is that we have in Australia a Constitution which divides the relevant powers between the Commonwealth and the States, so that it is not possible in Australia to legislate in thc same way as it would be in Great Britain or even in the United States. It is particularly unfortunate for this legislation that there is a division of power and that a nebulous area lies between State and Federal power. This touches most intimately the kind of questions with which this Bill must be concerned. That is the first point which I tbink distinguishes our situation from the overseas situation.",59,Trade Practices Bill 1965
108,Mr Speaker (Hon. Sir John Mcleay).,,62,Trade Practices Bill 1965
109,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar) [3.59].,"The second is that we are in a stage of rapid emergent development. Ours is a growing economy; we must put a forced draught on our growth if we are to survive. In this respect, we are perhaps under greater pressure than are most other countries. This is occurring at a time when capital plays an increasingly important part in costs because of the more sophisticated nature of industrial production. Things were easier decades ago than they are today. These capital intensive situations, as we are inclined to refer to them, are very relevant to the kind of thing we are now considering. We are also endeavouring, I think, to move in on a big field much more quickly than has been done overseas. Having said that, let me elaborate these points. I will deal first with the division of power as between the Commonwealth and the States. I shall be most interested to hear from the Attorney-General( Mr Snedden) later on the detailed history of the course of his negotiations with the State Governments. The provisions in respect of complementary legislation-the y are set out in clause 8 of the Bill-ar e quite unsatisfactory. It would be very wrong, in my opinion, to implement this Bill unless there were complementary legislation in most, perhaps all, of the States. May I explain this viewpoint? The Commonwealth has power to legislate for the kind of activity that is dealt kind of centralisation. Perhaps this, has not with in this Bill. It can provide penalties and provide for policing. But its power is confined to a very limited field which touches mainly interstate trade. In order to make the Bill effective intrastate, tbe Commonwealth is compelled to rely upon the complementary legislation that is referred to in clause 8. What will happen if one State passes complementary legislation and another does not? Let us suppose, for the sake of the argument, that New South Wales passes complementary legislation and Victoria does not. The inevitable consequence will be the drift of large scale industry from New South Wales to Victoria. Industrialists will say: "" We will go to Victoria where we will not United States of America? be harassed by this kind of legislation."" This may be a reprehensible decision on their part, but it is the kind of decision they will in the United States the division of powers make. If they are manufacturing intrastate is not critical in this particular field. I in Victoria, they will be able to trade with say ""so far as I know"" because I am not their products interstate quite free of the sufficiently a constitutional authority to impact of this legislation. I see that the answer that question completely. Attorney-General is shaking bis head, but I am clear that this can be done by way of a holding company and in other ways, lt will be possible for industry to concentrate its major operations in those States that do not pass complementary legislation. This will be very bad. It will result in a distortion of Australian industry. Already Victoria, for example, is openly saying that it does not intend to pass complementary legislation. Obviously, it will profit from this if New South Wales is foolish enough to pass complementary legislation without ensuring that Victoria has something along the same lines. I think it is very sloppy to have clause 8 in its present form. We should have had negotiations with the States for bills that are uniform in substance in the various States, and they should have been in a schedule to the Bill before we dealt with it. The measure should not go into operation until all States have passed complementary legislation. I add that if we have the position where both New South Wales and Victoria do not pass complementary legislation, manufacturing industry will tend to concentrate intrastate, using holding companies to carry out the interstate operations. We talk about decentralisation, but here we have legislation that will lead to this been sufficiently considered by the Government. I should like to see something done about clause 8. At least, I would hope that the Attorney-General will be able to give us an historical summary of his negotiations with the States and lay on the line a commitment from the States to pass the necessary complementary legislation to make this measure work. As I have said, this situation is peculiar to Australia. We have this division of powers in this particular field. This is not the kind of problem that the United Kingdom, for example, would have had to face under its legislation.",62,Trade Practices Bill 1965
