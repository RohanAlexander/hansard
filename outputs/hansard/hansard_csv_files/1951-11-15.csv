In carrying out such deportations, as it has done over many years, does the department sincerely believe that the broad principles of the White Australia policy are safeguarded by the pursuit of these individual cases? Does the department consider that the opinions of the peoples of the islands of the Pacific adjacent to Australia matter? honourable members opposite will suggest that I have made either an unreasonable or an unsympathetic approach to matters of this kind. Each case is determined on its merits according to the facts that are available to the department, which frequently are much more ample than are those that appear in the press. I propose to make a full statement in relation to the case of the person to whom the honourable member has referred. At this stage, I can say from my own recollecby the Australian Apple and Pear Board, tion that, in the first instance, the man was deported from Australia previously as a deserting seaman and that he entered Australia illegally again and has remained here illegally ever since.

It is true that there was an extension of the time limit for the lodgement of claims for additional compensation from the old apple and pear pool of the early war-time period. The entitlement will be determined in accordance with a formula laid down by the High Court in a judgment in the Zerbe case. This formula requires a very extensive investigation of the accounts of all the participants in the pools concerned which is being carried out, not by the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, but which is a separate authority.

In view of the facts that in our defence preparations food is a vital factor, and that the organization of food production in this country in time of peace is the responsibility of the -State governments, can the Minister say what steps are being taken by the State governments to organize increased food production as part of our defence preparations, and as a means of meeting our own increased food requirements ? tlie honourable member has recounted, moment, but I shall study his very with which we are all familiar, the interesting question and ascertain whether Government is concerned that there I can supply any further information. should be a planned intention to increase the amount of food produced in this country.

Eight honourable members having risen in support of the motion, raised this matter in this way for two reasons. The first of them is the time factor, which concerns generally; and the second is the fear that the Pollyanna approach of the Minister for O'Sullivan) to this matter is not giving to the people an opportunity to work out for themselves a f a i r estimate of the potential threats that are involved in the arrangement which w ill come into operation in January next. That arrangement is f u l l of complications. A t the outset, f dissociate myself from the extreme view that is held by some people that trade with Japan must necessarily result in spreading cobwebs over Australian industry. However, if the Government persist in implementing the arrangement, despite the provision of quotas, it w ill , along with the recession and the bedding down of trade and commerce which are anticipated to occur, add to the distress of the Australian nation. That is obvious because it w ill be i m possible to prevent the dumping of Japanese goods, and, consequently, some with this matter and to consider the posifro m any emotional considerations to which it may give rise. For Australians there must be something utterly sardonic in the spectacle of our having to clothe in Japanese cloth our troops in Korea (Hon. Archie and also the youngsters who are being of inflation, w ill be able to buy for his Japanese manufacture. There may be approach to this matter, but we shall exercise much common sense from a trading stand point if we determine now to I s the motion supdeal effectively with this problem of trade with Japan. The problem has a long history. The Opposition is not so stupid as to prognostiT h e Opposition has cate that we should not trade at all with Japan. We simply ask that the Government should provide a bridge, as it were, the people and to keep developments within manageable limits. The genesis of all our trouble lies in the haste in which the peace treaty Trade and Customs (Senator with Japan was conceived and drafted. That treaty leaves us in a flap in dealing with related problems, one of the most important of which is trade w i th Japan. The Government is blinded by the fact that we can obtain from Japan essential commodities that are now in desperately short supply in this country. I refer, for example, to cement, wire netting, galvanized iron, steel and other requirements. We need to obtain such commodities in order to assist our economy and to develop the country. A t the same time, however, we must remember that the wil y Japanese trader is already on the job. A population of 80,000,000 Japanese, which is increasing at a rapid rate, must be f e d ; and the softening-up process of resistance to Japanese trade has already commenced.

48,(By Mr Eric J. Harrison ) In The Long Run. Now Is The Time To Deal,"£20,000,000 worth of Japanese goods, but for such goods we shall be obliged to pay the highest possible prices. Any Australian trader will tell us that those prices will be almost prohibitive. We should not be blind to that fact simply because we require certain commodities so desperately. I have no doubt that the homebuilder, the farmer and others who require cement will be forced to pay prohibitive prices for that commodity -Congress to impose quotas in order to That is the first arm of the pincer movement that now threatens to envelop us. The second arm is that Australia will be flooded with many commodities that it does not require. Although we have a lucrative trade in wool with Japan we should not merely for that reason be prepared to take goods from that country that \v3 do not want. Neither should we believe that we must, therefore, take from Japan goods that are in short supply in this country. If we adopt that attitude we shall find that every chain store in this country will befloodedwith cheap and nasty junk such as Japanese cameras and binoculars whicU flooded this country before the last war. How should the Government deal with this problem? I am not satisfied that the Government fully realizes the serious danger of the dumping of Japanese goods In answer, to a question that I asked on this subject the Minister for Trade and Customs repliedNo foreign Government would be allowed to use Australian tariff concessions for the purpose of dumping cheap goods in Australia. There was nothing to cause fear that accordance of most-favoured-nations treatment to Japan or any other country would impose any obligation on Australia to refrain from the use of anti-dumping duties. Even if Japan were admitted as a member of the general agreement on tariffs and trade, it would still remain a matter for Australia to decide on its own account and to what extent, if any, it would extend concessions to Japan. The Government would continue to extend protection to Australian industry through tariffs or other appropriate measures on the recommendations of the Tariff Board. The essence of the whole problem is that our anti-dumping laws are not worth the paper on which they are written. The Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison), who was formerly Minister for Trade and Customs, will agree that regulations enacted under Mr Haylen. the Australian Industries Preservation Act have been invoked only seldom because of the fear that they are not legally sound. In any event the experience of the United States of America should be a -guide to us in this matter. Although that country has a 70 per cent, tariff against Japanese goods coming to the United States of America already twenty manufacturing companies recently appealed to Stop Japanese goods from flooding that country. Those companies claimed that they could not compete with Japanese .goods which they said were being sold at prices 5 per cent, below that at which the American manufacturers' wages bill would permit. Whereas the Japanese factory coolie is paid at so many cents a day, American operatives are paid in terms of dollars. I warn the Government not to accept the view that the initial dribble of Japanese goods to this country under the proposed arrangement will be the limit of that trade. The Minister said that quotas will be imposed. But the wiliness of the Japanese trader is well known. We realize that he is not fair, Some time ago the Minister for Supply( Mr Beale) told the House a most dramatic story of Australia's battle to obtain a quota of copper and copper products and said that the International Materials Conference had allocated to us a quota that was far short of our requirements. He said that his officers had fought like tiger cats, and I have no doubt that they did so, to obtain an adequate supply of materials in the copper groups, which are urgently required, not only for our defence purposes, but also for our national development. Great difficulty was encountered despite the fact that we'had lead and zinc which could have been a pay-off against our requirements of copper. A perilously low quota has been granted to this country, but we have accepted it as a part of the international set-up for the allocation of goods in short supply. But what is the position of Japan in this matter. It , too, was vetted for supplies but evaded investigation. I understand that Japanese traders have sent by cable to Sydney and Melbourne quotations for extruded brass and copper. They state that there are unlimited supplies of those metals in Japan. Yet the democratic nations have been obliged to ration those metals, because they are in short supply. The Japanese traders say that unlimited quantities of extruded brass and copper may be purchased, but I point out that the price of between £400 and £600 a ton is extraordinarily high, and, of course, is a definite breach of the fought for purely patriotic reasons. A agreement. It is the same old Jap. The leopard does not change its spots. The Jap is ""engaging again in snide trading tactics, while he is taking full advantage of the benefits of favoured nation treatment under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Despite those advantages, he engages in his old buccaneering trade practices. Before the signatures were dry upon the peace treaty, the Japs were at their old game. Poachers in sampans were appearing in the waters off Manus Island. If an investigation were made, it would probably be found that other sampans had appeared off our northern coast. A further example of the buccaneering tactics of the Jap is provided by the wholesale slaughter of whales by Japanese whaling expeditions. At present, twenty Japanese whaling ships are en route to the Antarctic. Their purpose is to obtain whale meat and oil in order to improve the food and oil supplies of Japan, but no observer is accompanying those vessels to supervise the whaling practices of the Japanese. They will have a completely open go. Immediately after World War LT., General Macarthur issued a directive to permit the Japanese to kill whales in the Antarctic in order to meet Japan's problem of feeding its own nationals, but the Japanese whalers broke every provision of the international whaling code, and were arraigned before the International Whaling Commission for having committed those offences. Australia, which is to resume trade with Japan, is led to believe that everything is perfect in this best of all possible worlds. We have no national feeling in that matter, because we have been drawn out to some degree on international agreements. I plead guilty to the fact that Labour governments have taken the greatest interest in the development of international agreements, which have been designed to lower tariff barriers. Tensions between nations cause wars, but the most prolific cause of wars arises from tensions which are brought about by tariffs, exclusions and quotas. The percentage of trade wars is considerably higher than the number that have been part of the trouble is attributable to the fact that deliberations upon international trade, and the abolition, or temporary freezing, of tariffs,' under the International Trade Organization have had some effect in regard to the emergence of Japan as a trading nation. The plans which were made by the United Nations did not envisage the fact that Japan would be hastily thrust willy-nilly into the company of the democratic nations, shriven of its sins, and allowed to trade in such company. The burden of the complaint of the Opposition is that we have been given no chance to look at the problems. We are continually being presented with faits accomplis on important matters. We should like to be informed of the Government's plans for trading with Japan. All nations must inevitably trade with one another and, Japan in particular must trade in the Pacific. We are well aware of Japan's predominant industrial strength, and of its ability to break through barriers that are raised against its manufacturers. We realize that the peace treaty is already wrecked, because the Japanese are turning to Asia and Soviet China, as it must, because it produces so many commodities that Asia needs. Australia buys an insignificant quantity of the Japanese goods that are left over, but if we do not provide safeguards against the dumping of these goods, the Japanese trading practices will break down our secondary industries. Australians are inclined to say, in effect, "" Oh well, we are admitting only a few toys and other items from Japan, and that position can well be taken care of. It does not matter. The purpose of the Defence Preparations Act is to reduce the manufacture of non-essential goods, which have sent out their little capilliaries of trade too far, and now must be cut back."". But the problem lies deeper than is implied by that thought. Manufacturers in the United States of America, are protesting against the admission into that country of Japanese> textiles, optical goods, opera and field glasses, fish in cans, crockery, electrical goods, clocks, cameras, handbags, leather goods, cutlery, scissors, shears, razors, cigarette lighters, light machinery, jewellery, blinds, fire screens, picture frames, mirrors, sewing machines and toys of all descriptions. The manner in which the American market is completely flooded by Japanese sewing machines is illustrated in a brilliant, article written by an economist and published in the Melbourne Age. It reads as follows:Already, Japanesie sewing machine makers have captured about 25 per cent, of the United States domestic market. Japan is now shipping in sewing machines at the rate of 300,000 a year, two and a half times the 1950 rate. In New York, a United States built sewing machine sells for 152.5 dollars, the. Japanese for only 89 dollars. The quality of the Japanese machines is goocT Often many of the parts are interchangeable with American-built machines. One United States' manufacturer explained the discrepancy this way:1 -'The average Japanese sewing machine worker gets 90 cents a day. His American counterpart gets 15 dollars."" One of the "" big three"" United States manufacturers of precision optical instrutnents said Japanese manufacturers had already captured a good 20 per cent, of the binocular business. able member has exhausted his time.

57,Mr Eric J. Harrison,"Th eJapan, must realize that the initiative lies with the Australian Government. The traditional policy of Australian governments, regardless of the political parties to which they have belonged, has been to protect our secondary industries. The honourable member virtually admitted that he was in favour of the lowering of tariff barriers, and he endeavoured to make an apology for his attitude to that matter a few years ago. Are we to assume that a Labour government, in the future will lower tariff barriers in order to give most-favoured-nation treatment to Japan? Of course not! The traditional policy of all political parties reprethe national economy and, therefore, sented in this House is to protect our secondary industries. Only to the degree that we give most-favoured-nation treatment to Japan will Japan accord mostfavoured nation treatment to us. Therefore, there is no incentive for us to do what the honourable gentleman has suggested we will do. The trading arrangement will obtain for four years from the date on which the treaty comes into effect, but it does not necessarily follow that we will give most-favourt-d-nation treatment to Japan. The peace treaty does not affect the position. the honourable member will be able to explain his view more fully at a later trade with Japan. stage. ""We have examined the treaty most carefully and we have found that it will not affect the situation. What is being done at present? The people who live close to our northern Government is restricting imports mainly shores. It is to our advantage, instead, to essential requirements and it proposes to improve standards of living in the to continue to maintain control over imEast. Indeed, have we not entered into ports.

Therefore, it will continue simply that we cannot obtain enough of them from any other source. It is perfectly true that licences for the importation of such commodities from Japan are given freely. The Government is takdng advantage, very properly, of the availability of such goods in other countries at a time when local supplies cannot cope with demands. It does not intend to jeopardize Australian industries and I am sure that the Labour party also would protect them, notwithstanding the averment of the honourable member for Parkes in relation to the levelling of international tariff barriers. Our secondary industries are vitally important to we shall not, endanger them by any lack of adequate protection against Japan or any other country. The treaty is designed to bring Japan back into the comity of nations. The honourable member does not disagree with that policy. In fact, he has said that it will be necessary to trade with Japan but, in effect, that our sin should be only a little sin. Honourable members recall the curate's plea that his sin was only a little one! I suggest to the honourable member that we must adopt a clear principle and not embark upon a policy of making minor concessions subject to all sorts of reservations.

The peace treaty will not affect the policy of protecting Australian industries in any way. I make that statement emphatically, and the honourable member for Parkes may challenge it on a later occasion if he The position, therefore, is that in the event wishes to do so. The treaty will of Japan being admitted to membership of impose no limit on the protection that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, can be afforded to our industries by means it will still remain entirely a matter for of tariffs or anti-dumping duties. All and honourable members know the value of concessions to Japan. Such a decision will the anti-dumping legislation and I shall naturally he made in the light of the correnot discuss it in detail. I merely point sponding advantages offered to Australia. out that there is not the slightest substance in the contention that this Government is reluctant to invoke that law. It has been used on a number of occasions, and it will be invoked again, should the necessity to do so arise, and it will be used conjointly with tariff preference in order to provide complete protection for Australian industries. Lest the honourable member should fear that the anti-dumping law is likely to be affected by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, I shall quote for his benefit an extract from a statement that was made by the Minister for Trade and Customs on the 7th November and which, incidentally, the honourable gentleman ""failed to mention. The Minister for Trade and Customs saidUnder the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, specific provision is made for the imposition of duties to offset or prevent dumping or to countervail the effect of any bounty or subsidy determined to have heen granted, directly or indirectly, on the manufacture, production or export of any products imported into the territory of any contracting party. There is, therefore, no cause to fear that the according of most-favoured-nation treatment to Japan, or to any other country, under the general agreement imposes an obligation on Australia to refrain from the use of anti-dumping duties. The general agreement attempts to set up rules to govern the conduct of international trade. It , therefore, provides for the accession probably because his conscience is of any government desiring to accept the agreement on terms to be decided' between that government and the contracting parties, acting jointly. At the same time, however, the agreement recognizes the essentially bi-lateral nature of trade agreements and trading relations by providing that the agreement, or alternatively, the concessions negotiated under the agreementshall not apply as between any contracting party and any other contracting party if(o) the two contracting parties have not entered into tariff negotiations with each other, and (6) either of the contracting parties at the time either become! a contract9 ing party, does not consent to such application. Australia to decide on its own account whether, to what extent, if any, it will extend My time is limited and I do not want to impose upon the House. Therefore, I shall conclude hy demonstrating briefly that the strictures of the honourable member for Parkes in relation to Australia's imports from Japan fall completely to the ground in the light of facts. The value of imports from Japan for 1950-51 was about £15,300,000 and the value of exports from Australia to Japan was about £61,600,000. The balance of trade in favour of Australia, therefore, was £43,600,000. 1951-52? happened when the honourable gentleman went to Japan? He will regret that incident for the rest of his life. I ask him to keep his mind on the facts of the case. The assessment of trade for 1951-52 indicates that our imports from Japan will be worth £36,500,000 and that our exports will be worth £39,000,000, leaving an estimated trade balance in favour of Australia of approximately £2,500,000. The honourable member can see, therefore, that his case falls hopelessly to the ground.

63,Mr Eric J. Harrison,"What[11.30] -Severa l points arise from the so-called assurances of the Vice President of the Executive Council( Mr not the only noble aspiration of mankind Eric J. Harrison) in relation to Australia's attitude to trade with Japan. He has said, in effect, that the Government will be guided by expert advice and that we can be assured that the secondary industries will have the full support of the Government. I shall quote extracts from an article entitled ""Australian Tariff Policy"" that was published in the August, 1951, issue of the Bank of New South Wales Review. It stated inter aliaI t is pertinent to note lieve that not all Tariff Board recommendations have been accepted by the Government. On one recent occasion, when a big new industry was involved, the Government granted protection well in excess of the assistance recommended by the board. That passage refers to the occasion on which the Tariff Board recommended a bounty in respect of rayon. The Government did not accept the advice of the board but acted contrary to it. Nor did the Government follow the advice of the board in relation to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is known nowadays as "" Gatt"". That very vexed subject is important so far as the future of Australian industry is concerned. The article went on to sayTlie Tariff Board has always been very conscious of its responsibility under the Ottawa Agreement That agreement, of course, involves the recognition in Australian tariff policy of our dependence primarily on trade with the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth nations as a basic part of our trade systemnot to grant excessive protection against imports. Recentlyi t has drawn attention to inconsistencies in Australian commitments under Ottawa and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In certain cases the board claims that it is impossible to lay down appropriate duties for some commodities conforming at the same time to the principles set out in the Ottawa Agreement, the maximum preference allowed under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and Australia's own protective requirements. In other words, arrangements under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [09] are to some degree fraught with difficulties. The agreement is a part of a splendid aspiration, and, of course, it is that has failed. Possibly it will not be the last to fail. There was an attempt, after the recent world war, to create one world. At present there are at least two worlds, and possibly three. There is division now among the great nations, and the aspirations that were born in the International Trade Organization, to which the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was originally only ancillary, have not borne fruit. The International Trade Organization has not operated, but the machinery of the agreement continues. I suggest that it cannot be evaluated alone, and that the circumstances that prompted the system of agreement on tariffs and trade have now changed. As a result there has to be perhaps some change in Australia's attitude to the matter. We of the Labour party have always maintained that one of the greatest basic forces of economic discontent in the world is the disparity in the economic strength and resources of different parts of the world, and that perhaps ultimately these economic circumstances become the greatest cause of international unrest. It was hoped, by means of the International Trade Organization and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, to establish a different working of the economic system. Unfortunately, at this stage, it is apparent that that hope has not come to fruition. Agreements on tariffs and trade are always necessary, and there must be negotiations on them. Eegard must be paid to the fact that importance is attached not only to the balance of trade, but also to the kind of trade involved. For instance, an analysis of the £61,000,000 worth of Australian exports to Japan, to which the Vice-President of the Executive Council has referred, shows that they are particularly valuable to Japan, which has a large population and small food and material resources, and so is dependent on the rest of the world for food and raw materials. Of the £61,000,000 worth of exports, £51,524,051 worth consisted of wool, £3,284,964 of barley, and",23,Adjouenment Serious Problems W I L L Confront The Nation
64,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports),"£2,712,544 of wlieat. So virtually all of it is very good material from Japan's point of view. We ask that there shall he some sort of scrutiny of and some protection in relation to the kind of goods that Australia receives from Japan in return. Some consideration must be given to the conditions under which the goods that we import from Japan are produced. We do not wish to import goods that have heen produced hy people who work under low living and labour standards. The Colombo plan envisages some attempt on the part of the democratic nations to improve standards in South-East Asian countries. A policy of importing goods produced by cheap Japanese labour will not accord with that ideal. That is why we ask that more attention be given to the nature of the goods that Australia imports from Japan. Tariff provisions in Australia must be from, the ad valorem to the fixed basis of a mystery to anybody who is uninitiated in the system, because very wide powers exist under the Trade and Customs Act whereby the Department of Trade and Customs, acting for the Minister, can, under by-law provisions, bring into this country exempt from duty goods that are supposed to be brought in under duty. More adequate information should be given to the House in future about the kind of goods Australia is importing from Japan and about the negotiations that are taking place between the Government and Japanese importers. It is true that last year we imported £2,000,000 worth of copper from Japan, and that that metal is in short supply in this country. It is also true that we imported from Japan plated sheet steel to the value of £S,000,000. But do we know under what conditions these goods were produced iu Japan? Do we know the conditions under which miners and steel-mill operatives in Japan work? Are they producing those goods under conditions that Ave would regard as decent? If they are not, then we are assisting in the continuance of the low standard of living of Japanese workers. The improvement of the standards of living of people in the Orient, must, in the long run, be the strongest, barrier to the encroachments of communism in Asia. Mr Crean. We maintain that trade is intimately linked with the standards of living of these people. We are not satisfied with the statement of the Vice-President of the Executive Council that Australia's secondary industries will he protected. Apparently secondary industry itself is not satisfied, because I have received a letter from a firm in my electorate, the Wilson Electrical Transformer Company Proprietary Limited, which protests against the possible effect of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on the industry in which it is engaged. It saysThe expectation that Japan will ultimately he considered as a mem her of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, should it remain in operation, is an even greater consideration when the pre-war dumping activities of that country are recalled. In the 1930's and 1940's, because of the tactics of Japanese traders, a change was made in the Australian tariff system duties in order to combat the dumping that was then taking place. In the present inflationary situation the difference between the fixed duty and the duty on the ad valorem basis would not be great and the protection that could be given has largely disappeared. able member's time has expired. have never heard so insubstantial an adjournment motion as that which is now before the House.

So far Opposition members have not shown that there is the slightest threat to our industries and standard of living.

66,Mr Gullett (Henty) [11.40],"Jindustries concerned has suffered in any way as a result of this trade. The Opposition's argument is a complete failure. It is a sorry reflection on honourable gentlemen opposite that they should be reduced to bowling up a hopeless proposition of this kind in order to divert a little public attention from the Government's programme. I regret that honourable members opposite have lent themselves to a particularly unscrupulous, ill-founded, biased and interested campaign against the importation of Japanese goods. Not long ago a campaign was commenced in Melbourne by the toy industry in order to try to prevent the importation of Japanese toys. Similar campaigns have been conducted by various other interested industries. It is amazing to me to find Labour members who profess to be on the side of the workers lining up with big vested interests and trying to prevent competition in the sale of toys, iron, building materials and other essential goods which we sorely require. I was astonished to hear the honourable member for Parkes( Mr can do tliat only by trading. I have not Haylen) associate himself with this very despicable attempt to mislead the public. He tried to whip up a little hate against the Japanese. His effort resembled that of the people who published the despicable pamphlet that was produced by the toy industry showing emaciated prisoners of war in an attempt to divert the attention of the public from the real facts of the case. Knowing the normal good taste of the honourable member for Parkes, it was a rude shock to me that he should be reduced to the use of argument of this type in order to make his point. I believe that all that has been said by Opposition members will leave the public cold because it is sick, of paying excessive prices for various articles, including inferior toys. He will find that the majority of people will be glad that articles of this kind will be sold in Australia at a reasonable price. The provision of toys for children at Christmas time in this country is a very real problem in working-class homes such as make up a large proportion of the honourable member's electorate and my electorate. The honourable member will receive little shrift in his electorate if he tries to defend the statement that toys produced in Australia are good value for money, because they are not. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) also submitted an extraordinary proposition. He said that it is wrong to import goods produced by people who have a low standard of living. Yet he also said that it is our duty to help people in Japan to improve their standard of living. By boycotting Japanese manufacturers we should only help to starve those people to death. It is better to have a low standard of living than none, and that is the choice with which the Japanese people are faced. The honourable member criticized the Government for having allowed the Japanese to catch whales and to take the whale oil to Japan. I do not wish to be friendly with the Japanese. I did not go to Japan after the war and make obeisance to thc Emperor, but I say that the Japanese have to live. It is to our advantage at the present time that they shall at least be able to support the population of their overcrowded islands, and they the faintest sympathy with the Japanese and have never wished to shake one by the hand, royalty or other, but they have to live. It would be a completely hopeless proposition to try to sell to Japan our wool and other commodities at the highest possible prices and to buy nothing from that country. In the long run such a practice could not favour this country. It has been alleged by the Opposition that the importation of housing materials such as iron, wire, and pipes constitutes a threat to Australian industry. That allegation is ridiculous. The price of Japanese iron is £190 a ton. How can the purchase of that iron represent a serious threat to the Australian industry? The importation of any item from Japan or any other country is subject to review by the Tariff Board and if there were any possibility of a local industry being penalized or of the workers in it being forced out of employment a report would quickly be made by the Tariff Board to which honourable members opposite would quite likely direct the attention of the House. Nothing of this kind has happened. Building materials are in short supply and it is necessary to obtain tbem wherever we can. In New anxious to trade with the Japanese Zealand, the Government has completely merely in order to improve their removed all tariffs on building materials. living conditions. As a matter, of I should be pleased if similar action fact is it not true that the same were taken in this country. I do not conservative elements that were in charge know anything about Japan.

67,Mr Wabd (East Sydney) [11.50],"Tlie reason apparently is, on the Government's argument, that to allow Japan to trade with China would be to hasten the spread of communism and to force the Japanese into the arms of the Communists. Nevertheless China is a natural Japanese market. When Japan, a country in which the workers live at starvation -level is allowed to build up great industrial power, not only Australian manufacturers but also British manufacturers will suffer. Recently British manufacturers became so conserned that they sent a representative to Japan to study the exact industrial position. Australians are to be obliged to provide £700,000,000 within the next three years for war purposes. I suggest that the country that is most likely to threaten us is Japan. That is mainly because of the allied policy of rebuilding its industrial strength which, after all, was not badly affected by the recent war. On one hand, the living standards of the Australian people are to be depressed through this tremendous war expenditure and, on the other hand, employment and living conditions are to be threatened by an influx of Japanese goods. The honourable member for Henty is an ex-serviceman. That being so, I should imagine that he would not have described as ""vested interests"" toy manufacturers who are ex-servicemen. He said that the Labour party is finding itself in line with big vested interests. Of all the industries in Australia the toy-making industry is the one most admirably suited to absorb disabled ex-servicemen. goods are allowed to enter Australia on a competitive basis Australian industry cannot compete with them. I recently ascertained that Japanese manufactured shirts have been offered for sale in London at 29s. a dozen, wholesale. One retail business concern offered men's shirts at 5s. 6d. each, and boy's shirts at 3s. 9d. Other companies have offered bicycles of the Raleigh and B.S.A. type at prices much lower than the cost of production in England. The textile industry is one of the most depressed industries in Japan. In that industry men employees are paid £3 a month and women £2 7s. a month. The Minister spoke about allowing these manufactured goods into Australia on a competitive basis. ""What sort of competitive basis could be established for goods that are produced by such cheap labour? The Minister can talk about the powers that the Government has to prevent dumping, and the rights of the Japanese under certain agreements, but the fact is that this Government is not unsympathetic to the introduction into this country of cheaply produced goods from Japan or anywhere else. Therefore, it must be evident that Australian industry is in real danger. -Consider the Japanese shipping indus^ try. Both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Labour and National Service recently used the argument that Australia's future security could be menaced only by a great maritime power. Therefore, one would have imagined that in at least one direction, that of shipbuilding, Japanese .expansion would be prevented. But the United States authorities have advanced £S,600,000 to assist the Japanese in rehabilitating their shipping industry. Other advances may have been made to Japan since that sum was paid over. Britain protested against making that money available because it recognizes that if Japan is permitted to establish again an efficient and powerful mercantile marine it may again endanger the security of Australia and other nations in this part of the world. Japan's population increases by 1,500,000 each, year, and there are certain interests in America which are If Japanese at present talking about allowing Japanese to emigrate to Australia's external territories. They suggest that that would be a good outlet for Japan's surplus population. I submit that such a thing would be a great danger to Australia because, as the Japanese nation grew in strength any group of Japanese so close to our shores would be a constant threat to our security. able member's time has expired. This matter is of grave importance to the future of Australia. Implicit in the present situation is a threat, and I have been astonished at the failure of the Opposition to recognize the nature of that threat or to disclose any practical",27,Adjouenment Serious Problems W I L L Confront The Nation

69,Mr Davidson (Dawson) [12.0],"method of dealing with it. Honourable members opposite have alleged that the Government is about to give effect to a trading arrangement with Japan that will be detrimental to our economy and our standard of living. That charge comes strangely from honourable members who were supporters of the Chifley Government, which initiated our presenttrade arrangements with Japan in 194S. This Government's proposals are simply a continuation of that arrangement. It is strange that the Opposition should attempt to saddle this Government with responsibility for doing something which they claim will be detrimental to Australia's interests. The fact that a parliamentary delegation visited Japan some years ago has been mentioned in this debate. I was a member of that delegation, and I met the Emperor of Japan in pursuance of the duty that devolved upon it. I shook hands with him, and I do not make the slightest apology for having done so. No member of that delegation did anything in the nature of obeisa.nce to the Emperor of Japan. In our approach to him we simply revealed, in circumstances which demanded the use of common courtesy, that we had not forgotten the lessons we had learned in our youth in that respect. propose to base the theme of my remarks upon the impressions that I gained during the course of my visit to Japan at that time, because I believe that those impressions have a definite bearing on the matter now before the House. Any person who seriously studies the Japanese must admit that they have definite national aspirations and possess the capacity to realize them. It matters not Japanese to buy that proportion whether we may personally detest another race, we must realize that if we attempt to smash, or to keep in subjection, another nation that attempts to rise in the circumstances in which Japan finds itself, we shall be guilty of an act that must do harm to the common cause of humanity and may contribute break of a third world war. Japan will rise again, regardless of how we may regard such a prospect. That being so, our best policy is to ensure that it shall rise in a way that will not permit it to be a threat to Australia. if r . Davidson. The second impression of the Japanese that I gained was their amazing fertility as a nation. Everywhere we went we saw hoards of children in the streets. Numerically, they reminded one of rabbits. ""We know that Japan's population is increasing at -the rate of 1,000,000 annually. That poses a problem that we must consider seriously. The third impression that I gained was that Japan is incapable of producing sufficient food to meet the requirements of its present population, let alone its future population. It is estimated that Japan cannot produce more than 75 per cent, of its requirements of foodstuffs. My final impression was that the Japanese have a definite desire to extend southward. They are casting their eyes on the islands in the South Pacific and on New Guinea -abou t which they learned much during the recent war. I am. sure that the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) will remember the "" kites"" thai, were flown for our benefit when we were in Japan in order to find out whether Australians would tolerate the movement southward of Japanese. We must recognize that the factors that I. have mentioned constitute a threat to this country. I should have thought thai I the Opposition, in raising this matter, would apply itself to a consideration of that threat. If the Japanese are prevented from extending southwardI believe that they should behow will they be able to obtain sufficient food to meet their requirements? The obvious solution of that problem is to allow Japanese trade to develop to a degree that will enable the of their food requirements that they themselves are incapable of producing. If we deny that opportunity to them how can we, at the same time, deny to them the opportunity to emigrate to islands immediately to the north of Australia? We must face up to this problem. to the outWe must allow Japanese commerce to earn sufficient funds in overseas market? to enable them to buy the foodstuffs that they require. But the problem of trading with Japan involves a threat to Australia. How can we meet the threat to onr standards of living that is inherent in that problem? We are importing from Japan, among other goods, steel, cement and galvanized iron. Those are not cheap goods. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) repeatedly alleged that we are importing cheap Japanese goods. The price of Japanese cement, landed in Australia, is over £20 a ton, whereas Australian-produced cement is available at less than £10 a ton. Whereas the price of Japanese galvanized iron, landed in this country, is from £140 to £180 a ton, that of the Australian article is approximately £40 a ton. Therefore, it cannot be said that we are encouraging the importation of cheap goods. What is the position of Australian industry? Why can we uot produce sufficient of these commodities and thus obviate the necessity to import them? The Queensland economist, Mr Colin Clark, has stated that in 1949-50 we required in Australia 35,000 tons of plain fencing ware wliereas our local production did not exceed 10,000 tons. In the same year, we required 170,000 tons of corrugated and flat iron whereas our production was 60,000 tons short of that quantity. We also required 30,000 tons of wire netting whereas our production :< mounted to only 9,500 tons. In the same year, we required 1,370,000 tons of cement whereas our production was 104,000 tons below that figure. Isi t not possible for Australian industry to meet our requirements of these commodities? I say ths.t it is. If the Government's arrangement for trading with Japan is bad, then the blame cannot be laid at the door of the Government because, whilst Japanese heavy industry was badly damaged during the recent war we built up our heavy industry in this country during that period. Why do we now find that Japan fan supply these goods whereas we cannot produce suflicient of them to meet our needs? The blame for this position must be laid at the door of the preceding Government, whicb deliberately crippled Australan industry by f a i l in g to come to grips with communism. able member's time has expired.

73,"Harrison, E. James Mr Holt (Higgins","Minister forThe Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1937 provides that registered organizations shall file with the In dustrial Registrar copies of their registers of members, which, of course, they have always been required to keep, and also quarterly lists of changes. Those provisions are not novel but are based on various State industrial arbitration acts that have been in operation for some time; The Australian Council of Trades Unions and individual unions, as well as employers'* organizations, have represented to me that literal compliance with the provisions of the act would require considerable increases of clerical staffs, and would make other heavy demand's on office requirements. Al l this, they claim, would be costly and could force an increase of union dues or of administrative 3taffs. Certain practical difficulties have also been indicated which could be overcome, but at some cost. attitude is clear. Provided the objectives that it sought to attain by the act of 1951 are achieved, it is prepared to agree to other means of compliance, which will take account of the problems that confront various organizations. The bill, therefore, proposes a more flexible method foT ensuring that adequate and accurate records shall be available for use by the Industrial Registrar in the event of an election having to be conducted officially, or a ballot taken under section 72 of the act. Under this bill, the Industrial Registrar is authorized to exempt an organization, as a whole, or a branch thereof, from compliance with the present provisions of section 91 that relate to the supply of membership records, if he is satisfied that the methods and systems of keeping and maintaining the records of membership of the organization are such as provide in a convenient form accurate particulars of the membership at the time they are needed for an officially conducted ballot or election. The Industrial Registrar is also given power to withdraw the exemption if he is not satisfied about the manner in which the records are kept. Those proposals have been discussed with the Australian Council of Trades Unions and with employers' organizations, and they appear to satisfy all points of view. I come to the second matter that is covered by the bill. Representation of the parties before the court and conciliation commissioners has been considered by the Parliament on a number of occasions. Section 46 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which was introduced by the 1947 amendments, prohibits the appearance of counsel, a solicitor or a paid agent before the court, except by leave, of the court and. with the consent of all the parties. No such representation is permissible in proceedings before a conciliation commissioner. The section does not apply to judicial proceedings before the court, and interveners, whether before the court or the conciliation commissioners, may be represented. The provisions of the act that relate to the professional representation of parties have been changed a number of times. At one stage, the consent of the parties alone The Government's was required. At another time, either the consent or the leave of the tribunal was sufficient -In 1930, the conception of requiring both leave and consent appeared. However, the Government has considered for some time that the present arrangement has not worked satisfactorily in producing the best results. I remind the House that the Chief Conciliation Commissioner, Mr Mooney, saidA majority of the Commissioners considered that this prohibition That is, the prohibition of professional representation in proceedings before conciliation commissionersdeprive them of the aid of skilled, and experienced representatives of both employers and employees. Some of ns who have occupied the position, of Conciliation Commissioner for a number of years realize the value of such help and I am ableof my own experience to say that the attendance of such representatives at conferences have conduced to the settlement of disputes and, generally speaking, have expedited rather than retarded the hearing when the dispute has come to arbitration.. From information conveyed to me I believe that a number of organizations, particularlv the smaller ones which, cannot afford to employ a person solely on this type of work or with not enough of it to enable its oflicers to obtain the necessary knowledge and experience, would welcome a change in the Act to at least provide that such representatives should be permitted to appear with the. consent of the Commissioner and a l l the parties.

The 1947 amendment established the conciliation commissioner system and provided that' both the Chief Judge and the Chief Conciliation Commissioner should make reports from time to time. According to my recollection, the late Chief Judge Drake-Brockman in the same year also expressed the view that a greater degree of representation by counsel before tribunals should be permitted. The court is faced, in these days, with problems of complexity and vast significance to the economy. I do not believe that any honourable member will question the tremendously far-reaching consequences to the economy of some of the major decisions that the court has been required to make since 1947. The commissioners are no longer subordinate authorities, but deal with matters that are of supreme importance to the economy. cannot deal with any question of law. member of the application in relation to the metal trades group that is now being considered by Conciliation Commissioner Galvin. It would not be proper for me to discuss the merits of the matter, hut I point out that the case is of far-reaching importance to the whole economy of Australia. I , for one, believe that it would be of assistance in such a case for the parties to he represented by counsel if that was their wish. They may make application for permission to engaga such representation and, under the terms of this bill, it is proposed that the commissioner shall be empowered to detergranted. The bill includes an effective safeguard. It does not provide that counsel shall have the right to appear automatically; it provides that permission may be granted by the court or a conciliation commissioner. The Government approaches this matter from no doctrinaire stand-point. It has considered the views of those who are principally conthe report cerned and has taken into account the working of the system during the last four years. It has decided that the processes of conciliation and arbitration would be facilitated if thc present provisions iu relation to representation of the parties were amended. The measure now before the House proposes that, in future, the court and the conciliation commissioners shall have fhe authority to decide whether or not the parties shall be represented by counsel, solicitor or paid agent in proceedings before them. The Government considers that this will provide sufficient safeguards, if indeed they are required, to prevent the unwarranted appearance of paid representatives. The Parliament earlier in this year enacted provisions that gave to the court complete jurisdiction in relation to annua! or other periodical leave with pay, sick leave with pay, and long service leave with pay. Employers' organizations and certain unions, supported by the Australian Council of Trades Unions, have suggested that conciliation commissioners should be permitted, when renewing existing awards, to continue existing provisions in relation to annual leave and sick lea.ve. They claim that the objectives of the Parliament as expressed in the legislation would not be prejudiced and that the processes of conciliation and arbitrntion w ould be facilitated if this were done. T The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) made representations along those lines during the budget debate. The bill will meet those suggestions. I am bound to add that cases that are pending before the court at present bear on the interpretation of sections 13 (a) and 25 (c).

Moreover, as the contributory charge is levied at the time the is now . considering the arrangements wool is sold, and as the wool tax would apply at the time wool is delivered into store, a change-over, although effected as tax at a convenient time. quickly as practicable, would have meant that the considerable quantities of wool already delivered into store would have escaped both wool tax and the contributory charge. It was estimated that the resultant loss of income to the Wool Use Promotion Fund could have been as much as £75,000. It was decided, therefore, to that the contributory charge should remain in operation for the 1951-52 season, and the rate was reduced to -J of 1 per cent., which was expected to yield approximately the same amount as the wool tax of 2s. a bale. Should a greater amount be collected, the excess will be available for use for the benefit of the wool-growing industry. The contributory charge applies to shorn wool, dead wool, skin wool, and also to the wool on sheepskins when exported. The wool tax, however, is applicable only to shorn wool. The Government desired to ensure that, pending the re-introduction of the wool tax, no wools that were exempt from the wool tax should bear the 'contributory charge. Therefore, it requested the Commissioner of Taxation to grant administrative exemption to dead wool, sskin wools, and wool on sheepskins until such time as the necessary legislative exemptions could 'be granted. The primary purpose of the three bills to which I have referred is to give legislative authority for those exemptions. purpose is to be achieved by amending the definition of wool in the Wool (Contributory Charge) Assessment Act so as to exclude such wools from the scope of the charge at its new rate, and this amendment will be operative on and from the 27th August, 1951, which was the date of commencement of the current wool season. In addition to this amendment, and in order to ensure consistency ""with the definition of ""wool"" proposed in the Wool (Contributory Charge) Assessment B ill , it is proposed to repeal section 7 of the Wool (Contributory Charge) Acts Nos. 1 and 2 of 1950, under which the levy of 7£ per cent, that is now no longer required was imposed.

The bill proposes the repeal of section 7 of the Wool (Contributory Charge) Acts 1950. That section authorized the imposition of a levy on wool sold in Australia. The levy was fixed at 7J per cent, and was for the purpose of providing funds for growers' capital in the proposed reserve price plan. I might mention that the levy yielded about £45,000,000, but as the referendum on the reserve price plan was not carried, arrangements are being madefor this This money to be repaid to the persons who paid the levy. Section7 contains a definition of "" w o o l "" which is not consistent with the definition that has heen proposed in the Wool (Contributory Charge) Assessment Bill. In view of this, and as no rate has been prescribed since the 30th June, 1951, and also as the levy is no longer required, it is proposed that the section be repealed with effect from the 27th August, 1951.",34,Second Reading

Because of housing conditions, many members of a family remain at home after they have grown up and they purchase their own radio sets. In many homes a receiver may be found in the lounge, another in the breakfast room and another in the bedroom. The people who have this number of sets are best able to pay increased licence-fee's. But it is the people who purchase a set for the first time who will be hit by the Gowhy increase the licence-fee 100 per cent, vernment's proposals and they are the people who will have to carry the increased sales tax on radio receivers and other articles required for the home. is not considering the sales tax now. considering a tax. ing a sales tax. The sales tax legislation gather the licence-fee for the second and was passed last night. to your ruling, Mr Speaker, hut this proposal is connected with Government policy. The Minister stated that age pensioners will only have to pay 25 per cent, of the rate fixed for the licences. I wonder that the Minister did not adopt the recommendation of the parliamentary committee that investigated broadcasting ' and furnished its report in 1941.. That report recommended that the pensioners should receive a free licence because of the service that they had given to the community in their lifetime. I know that the Minister will ask why the Labour Government did not implement that recommendation. My reply is that no Labour government has ever budgeted for a surplus of £114,000,000 and left the aged pensioners in the position in which this Government has left them. With this estimated surplus, surely the recommendation of the committee to which I have referred could have heen adopted. As I said before, I am satisfied that the Government has taken a blind shot at this matter. It has been suggested on behalf of the Government that the 100 per cent, increase would meet the future broadcasting. The honourable member for Paterson (Mi-. Fairhall) suggested that if another 10 per cent, of the people applied for broadcasting licences, 100 per cent, of the population would then hold licences and it might he possible to eliminate licence-fees and make broadcasting expenditure a direct charge on Consolidated Revenue. be a lot cheaper to do that. at a time when 90 per cent, of the people hold wireless licences? The honourable member knows that he was heating the air in making that statement. Government supporters have mentioned the difficulty of gathering an additional amount in respect of the second radio set in each home. It is not usual for a government to grant concessions when looking for more money. If the Government-cannot ""-ther additional in a home then it viii not be tuu'ie Co coiiect tiie fee in respect of the first in many instances. Tf the statement of honourable members opposite implies that there will be a relaxation of the procedure followed by the department in checking whether everybody who has a radio set possess a radio' licence, then those who are honest will carry the burden for those who are not quite so honest. In presenting the bill the Minister said that it was everywhere admitted that the quality of the programmes provided by the Australian Broadcasting Commission were of excellent standard. I have received complaints to the effect that some of these programmes are not all that could be desired in the interests of Australia. On Saturday, the 27th October, an overseas programme was broadcast by short-wave station VLI at 11.45 p.m. A news bulletin contained an item to America, Canada and South Asia which alleged that in Sydney people were adopting hypnotism in order to cure themselves of smoking. I spend some considerable time in Sydney but I do not know anybody who has adopted hypnotism in order to give up smoking. The second item ridiculed the Australian approach to the Olympic financial commitments of games. If there is any news item that should be played down it is Australia's",36,Anthony

The third item made a lot of play on the success of a 3oap-box derby and likened the organization behind it to that which was associated with the Olympic games. The last item related to you, Mr Speaker, and made great play on your actions in this House during the previous week. 1do not consider that that news should have been circulated throughout the world in the way that it was presented by the press of Australia. If listeners' fees are to be increased by 100 per cent, the Australian Broadcasting Commission should be able to present something better than these items in the way of propaganda for overseas ears. If the problem of obtaining finance is worrying the Government to the extent that it is necessary to increase fees 100 per cent. I should have throught that it would have examined the position of the commercial broadcasting stations. Up to the time when the parliamentary committee made its recommendation in 1941, the only licence fee paid by the commercial broadcasting stations was an amount of £25 a year. The committee recommended that a station which made a profit should pay a fee of $ per cent, on its gross earnings. That recommendation was adopted. As ten years have gone by since then I should have thought that before the Government attempted to increase listeners' licence-fees it would have broadcasting instead examined the position of the private broadcasting companies. In the year 1941-42 there were 97 commercial broadcasting stations in this country. Of those 97 stations 53 were making a profit and 44 were showing a loss. The total profit made by such stations in 1941-42 amounted only to £81,812. It can be appreciated that when the committee made its recommendation it paid due regard to the fact that 44 commercial stations were operating at a loss. There was at that time a tendency for newspaper syndicates to purchase the stations because they feared that the development of commercial wireless would affect their incomes. Of course, as the years have gone by,, that has not happened. Every year since 1941 the financial position of commercial broadcasting stations has improved.' In the financial year 1942-43 there were 96 commercial stations operating, 66 of which showed a profit and 30 a loss on the year's transactions. The total profit of all the stations was £114,003. In that year the real growth of Australian commercial stations commenced. From that time their financial position has continued to improve, and each year since then has shown a progressive increase of profit. In 1946-47 there were 101 stations broadcasting, and of those S5 showed a profit and sixteen suffered a loss. The net total profit of all stations in that year was £428,000. The last available figures in respect of commercial broadcasting stations, those for the year 1948-49, are shown in the second annual report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. In that year there were 102 broadcasting stations. 90 of which showed a profit and only twelve suffered a loss. The total revenue of all commercial broadcasting stations in 1948-49 was £3,212,253. Their expenditure totalled only £2,619,474 so that for that year the total net profit was £592,779. The profits of commercial broadcasting stations have increased from £81,812 in 1942 to £592,779 in 1949. That is a growth that is unprecedented in any other business concern in Australia. Surely from such a business, which has grown so rapidly, the Government could have arranged to obtain the amount of money that it required for of increasing listeners' fees by 100 per cent. The commercial broadcasting organization should be carefully investigated by the Government. I agree with the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) who said yesterday that the time has arrived when there should be a Minister placed in charge of broadcasting. Because of the growth and their syndication broadcasting stations, the same sort of difficulty is now facing Australia as recently faced the American Government. Certain things have happened, either behind the Minister's back or with his consent. The report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board seems to indicate that the Government should be aware of what has happened in America, and should attempt. to avoid the same thing happening here. To-day the Macquarie network is about to be sold to a press syndicate, but the Government is taking no action to prevent the growth of such monopolies. The Australian Broadcasting Control Board's second annual report showed that of the 102 broadcasting stations in operation in June, 1950, 32 were operated by persons or organizations which control one station only, ten were operated by persons or organizations who were substantially interested in two stations, and sixty were operated by persons or organizations with substantial interests in three or more stations. One organization controlled, either directly or indirectly, eight commercial broadcasting stations. Newspaper companies or those interested substantially in newspapers owned nineteen of the 102 stations and had shares or interests in 25 others. Therefore, of the 102 stations in the comneeds to commercial broadcasting station mercial network 44 were controlled either directly or indirectly by newspapers. All gigantic proportions. The Government commercial broadcasting stations take advantage of the facilities available in the Postal Department, and therefore they, rather than the listeners, should be ter's salary look like chicken-feed. If this called upon to provide the necessary funds that the Government requires. The report to which I am referring also made clear the danger of monopoly that is growing up in the commercial station network. On several occasions during the last few years the Prime Minister has made broadcasts over the radio. On each occasion there has been nation-wide hookups and practically all other entertainment has been suspended while the Prime Minister has made his statements. The Australian Broadcasting Control Board's report tells the story of hov: that has been allowed to happen. When this Government achieved office the Macquarie network comprised seven stations in New South Wales, one in Victoria, three in Queensland, one in South Australia, and two in Tasmania. That is a total of fourteen stations. That network also has an arrangement with a number of other stations under which they will co-operate, on certain terms, with the Macquarie network to broadcast its programmes. Because of the Government winking its eyes at what is going on in the commercial broadcasting indusi f r . Fl. James Harrison. try the Macquarie network has been able to tie up an additional sixteen stations in New South Wales, seven in Victoria, eleven in Queensland, six in Western Australia, and four in Tasmania. That has given the Macquarie network an additional broadcasting medium of 44 stations. In other words, it has created an organization of 58 out of 102 stations which will broadcast any matter that suits the Macquarie network. the broadcasting tie-up used in the presentation of the "" No"" case in the recenl referendum. course, the Government will use this tie-up in presenting its case for any referendum, because the Liberal party has the money to do so. This Government is following a policy of giving preference over national networks, and allowing them to reach is allowing these networks to make so much profit that they can afford to pay compere fees that make the Prime MinisGovernment wants additional money to carry on our radio system it should take the proper course to obtain it. It should get it from the commercial broadcasting networks rather than from the radio listeners. The honourable member for Paterson said that the people might get some relief when another 10 per cent, of them take out wireless licences. I suggest that that is merely playing with the matter. No commercial station can extend its activities without the Postmaster-General being aware of it. He knows that the profits of commercial stations have increased from about £87,000 to about £500,000 a year, and he knows, therefore, that the stations in the Macquarie network and in other networks are the best sources of additional revenue. interjection might have been expected from a supporter of a government that is only concerned with providing a national network of commercial stations that can be used w> a medium for telling the people",37,Anthony

The radio arrangements in Russia to-day allow only the Government's view to be presented to the people, t suggest that the Government may be bringing into existence a monster by which it may be ultimately destroyed. I am not prepared to stand idly by, as the honourable member for Paterson evidently is, and see the people forced into a position where they will be required to pay 100 per cent, increase of wireless licence-fees, while huge organizations which are using government services are allowed to pile up great profits. Why does' not the Government force the commercial broadcasting stations to recognize that the salary being paidto the Prime Minister is the maximum that should be paid to comperes who are advertising Palmolive products or any other product? Surely the Government must have some regard for the requirements of the people. The honourable member for Paterson coines from the bush. He might make a lot of money in ways not connected with his parliamentary duties, but he comes from a district where the people appreciate wireless services. I suggest that, his constituents will not be too pleased if he stands idly by and watches the Macquarie network grow and grow until it ultimately absorbs nearly all our commercial stations. Then the people will be forced to listen to the programmes arranged for them by perhaps two or three men. I suggest that honourable members on the Government side who represent country electorates have not the courage to tell the people the facts about broadcasting. It has been mentioned that country people in New South Wales have only three radio stations compared with large numbers in the city. The people should be told that those three stations are tied in with city stations and that the people get programmes which have been decided upon by a small executive. The Opposition will oppose strenuously this measure and will vote against it in the belief that the additional money required by the Government should be raised from the commercial broadcasting stations. listening to the honourable member for experience great difficulty. That is true Blaxland( Mr E. James Harrison) one can understand quite clearly that, honourable members opposite have very little, if any, reason for criticizing this measure. Therefore they have resorted to wild statements and attacks on all and sundry. The object of the measure is to increase the annual listeners' licence-fee from f l to £2, but the existing fee of 10s. that is payable by pensioners will not be increased. I understand that the Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony) intends to move an amendment in order to extend that concession to other classes of persons in special circumstances. The honourable member for Blaxland did not deal with the measure before the Chair, but devoted the whole of his speech to making an attack upon the commercial broadcasting stations. That attitude is typical of members of the Opposition who accept every opportunity both inside and outside the Parliament to make attacks upon commercial interests of all kinds although such interests are rendering great service to the community. Those honourable members are socialists in every sense of the word. They are opposed to private enterprise in any form. The honourable member for Blaxland endeavoured to lead the House and the people to believe that commercial broadcasting companies are making exorbitant profits. He said that in 1948-49, the last year for which information is available, 102 companies had made a total profit of £592,000. I point out that that profit would represent approximately a return of 5 per cent, on the total capital invested in those companies, the total revenue of which in that year amounted to approximately £3,250,000. Almost half of the profits that are made by those companies are taken by the Government in taxes. Indeed, it can be said that the Government taxes them on a basis of half-ownership. The commercial broadcasting companies are making a valuable contribution to the community as a whole. In their specific sphere, they are rendering services of a high standard. The honourable member for Blaxland referred to a number of stations that are showing an annual loss. It must be obvious to him that any commercial organization, during -Afte r the early stages of its development, must",39,Anthony
102,Mr Eggdts (Lyne) [2.45],"of commercial broadcasting organizations which, perhaps, must operate for a period of three or four years before they are able to extend their activities sufficiently to enable them to make a profit. However, the overall position of commercial broadcasting stations shows that they are earning in the form of profit only ordinary rewards for the services that they render to the community. Those companies provide a very valuable service to people in country districts. Indeed, they are an important part of the community life of the districts in which they are situated. When such disasters as bush-fires and floods occur, they make their services available in the interests of the community in broadcasting urgent messages, For that reason, consideration should be given to the establishment of broadcasting stations in more remote areas the residents of which do not yet enjoy facilities of the standard that are provided in metropolitan areas and in more densely populated country districts. The development of broadcasting generally can be described as one of the romances of the present century. At this time, when we are celebrating the jubilee of federation, it is appropriate to take stock of the contribution that broadcasting has made to the nation's development and welfare. To-day, a wireless receiving set is an essential in every home. We should be proud of the fact that in Australia there are now 50 national broadcasting stations and 102 commercial broadcasting stations. member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) urged the Government to establish an additional national station in each metropolitan area, which would make three in each of them, and he gave certain reasons why that, should be done. of additional stations depends entirely upon the number of channels that are available, and, as we know, that number is limited in every country. Instead of urging the establishment of additional stations in densely populated areas in which adequate broadcasting services are already available members of the Labour party should pay more regard to the needs of residents in sparsely populated areas who are pioneering the development of Australia. I point out Mr Eggins. that residents in many areas still find it difficult to get continuous reception. are. ber for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) prefers to see only the faults of the broadcasting system and to ignore its virtues and advantages, he indicates his outlook in this matter. Broadcasting facilities should be made available .to people resident in every part of this country. I do not need to emphasize the educational value of broadcasting. It enables the great majority of Australians to keep abreast of national and world events. The Government should concentrate upon maintaining, first, the efficiency of broadcasting services; and, secondly, the impartiality of broadcasts on controversial matters. Whilst, individually, we may be critical of certain broadcasts and of certain commentators with whose statements we may not agree, it is of paramount importance that complete impartiality and fairness shall be maintained in such broadcasts. To-day, the Australian Broadcasting Commission gives equal opportunities to leaders of all political parties to speak to the people on matters that involve vital national issues. At the same tune, the commission makes facilities available to visitors from overseas to speak to Australians as a whole and thus enables them to hear the views of authorities on all classes of subjects. The honourable The forums that the commission arranges from time to time have achieved a high standard. That class of broadcast is invaluable from an educational standpoint because it affords a vehicle for the dissemination of the views of experts on the subjects that are discussed. 'ConseHowever, the provision quently, the people are enabled to become better informed generally. I pay a tribute to the commission also for its activities in the cultural sphere, particularly in country areas. In addition to broadcasting high-class musical programmes, it arranges for first-class artists to give recitals in various districts. That is a valuable service particularly as it provides cultural relaxation for our people at a time.when we are confronted with grave national problems. During recent years, the actual annual time of broadcasting",40,Anthony
103,Mr Beazley,Ho w lucky those people,41,Anthony
104,Mr Eggins,"If the honourable memhas increased from 53,297 to 286,045 hours. As I have said, the number of national stations has been increased to 50 and additional stations are being established. Having regard to those facts, an annual listeners' licence-fee of €2 is but an infinitesimal contribution towards the maintenance of such a valuable community service. I am sure that very, few people object to the higher licence-fee. ' The honourable member for Blaxland has condemned the proposal to relieve listeners of the obligation to obtain a half-fee licence for each broadcast receiver in their possession in excess of one. Opposition members are finding great difficulty in offering sound criticism of this bill, because a Labour government, if it were in office at tbe present time, would be obliged to elevate the national broacasting organization to its proper plane, and make it possible for it to meet the national broadcasting needs. I remind the honourable member for Blaxland that the time and labour which are involved in keeping records of additional licences that are held by a person for each set in his possession in excess of one may well cost as much as the additional revenue that has been collected from the half-fee licences. The number of persons who have more than one radio receiver is not large. After all, a person is able to listen to only one set at a time. The claim which has been made by Opposition members that the abolition ofjthe half-fee licence is a concession to wealthy people who own more than one radio receiver is without foundation. I have had the privilege of examining the broadcasting services of several countries during the last two or three years, and I am satisfied that the efficiency of the Australian organization is comparable with that of any such service in other parts of the world. Opposition members are acting unwisely when they endeavour to discredit our broadcasting organization, because it has some notable achievements. I stress the need for the maintenance of impartiality in the control of broadcasting activities, because there is no other channel in which opinions may be expressed to so many people in such a subtle way. I have the greatest confidence in the present administration of the broadcasting organization, but, nevertheless, the necessity to preserve impartiality must be keenly oibserved at all times. It would be easy for persons whose views are dangerous to the welfare of Australia, to gain responsible positions in the broadcasting service, if not in the head-quarters, then in the various States. Such persons would be able to broadcast a message before their intentions were known and could be frustrated. A great responsibility rests upon this Parliament to ensure that the broadcasting system is used efficiently in the interests of the nation. I remind the House that even the leaders of the great trade union movement of Australia have admitted that well known Communists have gained control of certain industrial organizations. The federal . president of the Australian Labour party stated publicly that the Labour party was dangerously split on the issue of communism, and that nearly all the powerful trade unions, which were the backbone of the Labour party for years, were led by Communists, and no longer gave their allegiance to the Labour party. It is a well-known fact that Communists occupy key positions in the great industrial organizations, al-though the majority of the members of those bodies are loyal Australians. Mr L. .Short, who is a prominent industrial leader in New South Wales, has said that Mr E. Thornton, the former president of the Federated Iron workers Association, is now Stalin's No. 1 agent in think that the honourable member for Lyne( Mr Eggins) is broadcasting from Eadio Moscow. Will you, Mr Speaker, ask him to relate his remarks to the bill? that the scope of the bill is very wide, but T think that the honourable gentleman should confine his remarks to the subject of broadcasting. The House is considering a bill to amend the Broadcasting Act, and such a measure opens up a wide field. However.

I am confident that the people of Australia will not resent this bill, because they recognize the value of broadcasting to the community and realize that the cost of such entertainment in the home is inexpensive indeed. honourable member for Lyne( Mr Eggins) began his speech with a defence of the .commercial broadcasting stations, and told us that they were rendering an excellent service to Australia. He pointed out that commercial stations allocated a good deal of free time to worthy causes, and were invaluable in periods of emergency to broadcast warnings of bush fires and floods in country districts. But the honourable gentleman forgot to mention that a. big majority of cMi'iinei-cial stations are located in the capital cities, -and that their broadcasting range is comparatively small. Warnings of bush fires and Hoods are not broadcast 'from those stations. Incidentally, I point out that the big profits in commercial radio are made by those organizations which own stations in the capital cities. Substantial profits 'are not made by the few small operate in country districts. The honourable member for Lyne .advocated that the number of commercial stations.should be increased. He did not suggest that the commercial stations should provide services for the people who live in remote districts. He .adopted the attitude that the national broadcasting system .should supply the unprofitable .services to small .scattered communities, and that the cream of the radio business should be the prerogative of the commercial .stations. He mentioned that the commercial broadcasting stations made a profit of more than £500,000 last year, and he regarded that amount.as ismall, because those ior,ganizations were called upon to pay a considerable amount of taxation. But the fact remains that a return of £500,000 upon the capital which has been invested in commercial broadcasting stations is -handsome for. one year's operations. The honourable member for Lyne also forgot to mention a point 'which was stressed by the honourable member for Blaxland( Mr E. James Harrison) to the effect that the stage was .rapidly being reached at which a small handful of individuals, within or outside Australia, would have almost complete control of the commercial broadcasting system. That matter is so serious that the Parliament should give it careful consideration. I agree with the honourable member for Paterson( Mr Fairhall), who said that the time had nearly arrived when serious -consideration should be given to the abolition of listeners' licence-fees. Those two matters, as well as a number of other matters, require urgent consideration. I believe that the Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony) has been very remiss in his duties as the Minister in charge of broadcasting, because he has failed to reappoint the Broadcasting Committee. Mi-.

115,Mr Bryson (Wills) [3.7],"Th eon the part of the honourable gentleman. General doubtless has announced his intention not to re-appoint the Broadcasting Committee, but that fact does not improve the position. The Broadcasting Committee performed a most useful service to this Parliament and the people from 1941 to 1949. It considered many matters of great importance to the national broadcasting system, and regularly submitted reports to the Parliament for consideration. Many of those reports were adopted by the Parliament, and legislation, which was of great assistthat they are really ill and then ance to the national broadcasting service, was introduced to give effect to them. Quite a number of problems relative to broadcasting await solution at the present time, and it behoves the Postmaster General to put into effect the provisions of the Broadcasting Act by re-appointing the Broadcasting Committee. That body could consider a most important matter on which the Postmaster-General holds strong views, if we are to judge from his statements during the last week on the control of the commercial broadcasting service. He has said that he is strongly opposed to certain overseas finanand even £250,000 a year in some cases, cial interests gaining control of a number of commercial broadcasting stations. He has referred to the investment of foreign capital in those stations. I understand that it is English capital, and, to me, England is still not a foreign country, although the Postmaster-General may so regard it. man misrepresents me. I did not use the term ""foreign capital"". that the Postmaster-General used. He definitely referred to the investment of foreign capital in our commercial broadcasting system. That matter requires investigation, and serious consideration. Indeed, I believe that the whole commercial broadcasting system requires review. ing system. The Estimates of expenditure The honourable member for Lyne has for the current year include a sum of claimed that commercial broadcasting is £8.949,000 for broadcasting services. The a great boon to the people, but I consider actual expenditure on broadcasting that it is becoming a menace to them, services in 1950-51 amounted to because of the kind of material which is £3,590.780. Not all of that, money was used, and the manner in which it is expended by the Australian Broadcastingpresented to the people. It is having a very detrimental effect upon the minds of many youthful members of the community. Indirectly, it is also having an injurious effect upon the health of many listeners. Cheap patent medicines are blatantly advertised, morning, noon and night. Listeners are advised to take all sorts of remedies if their colour is not good, if their teeth are bad, or if their eyesight is troubling them. They are urged continually to buy so-and-so's menthoids, somebody else's little liver pills, and other "" quack "" medicines, with the result that many of them are talked into a state of mind in which they believe they begin to swallow various kinds of nostrums. Such potions do not improve their health in any way, and in many instances, I believe^ are actually injurious to health. Consideration should be given to the type of advertisements that are broadcast over commercial networks and also to the nature of the goods that are advertised for sale. Manufacturers claim that radio advertising enables them to sell their goods more cheaply than would be possible otherwise. I have yet to work out how the expenditure of £50,000, £100,000, on radio advertising enables the price of the articles that are advertised to be reduced. My experience of fixing prices is that profit margins are calculated not only on costs of production but alsoon advertising costs. The entire commercial broadcasting .system could be subjected to a very careful review by parliamentary broadcasting committee with great advantage to the people of Australia. I believe that a proper investigation of that character, which would lead to this Parliament taking the notice of the situation that a responsible body should take, would cause a great improvement of the standard of commercial broadcasting. I refer now to the national broadcast-",43,Anthony

120,Mr Bryson,"I heard the wordsCommission. Tlie commission's share of che estimated expenditure for the current year, for instance, is £2,906,000. The remaining sum will provide for technical und other services that are made available by the Postal Department. The annual expenditure of the Australian Broadcasting Commission has increased considerably in recent years. I shall not say that the increase has not been justified, but I point out that the activities of the commission not many years ago were financed from only a portion of the revenue from the listener's licence-fee. At one time, the commission received 10s. from every £1 fee; later its share was increased to 15s. of every £1. Now, although the number of licence-holders is greater than ever before, the total revenue from the licence-fee is insufficient to pay the expenses of the commission. We must also take into account the fact that the Postal Department incurs considerable expense in providing technical services for the commission. The magnitude of the cost of providing a national broadcasting service makes it imperative for us to consider whether we are receiving good value for the money that is expended and whether we could obtain better value. How much of the expenditure of the Australian Broadcasting Commission car) reasonably be charged to licence-holders, and how much should be charged to Consolidated Revenue? The commission must maintain transmitting stations to provide services for regions where commercial radio organizations will not operate. Stations must be operated for the benefit of large outback areas where the population is small and scattered. I do not object to that necessity. The residents of remote districts are entitled to have as many amenities as can be provided for them. But the cost of providing those amenities should not be charged against licence holders in other parts of Australia. Each licence holder pays a fee for a particular service. Until now, that fee has been £1 a year. He should not be called upon to pay an additional charge of 10s. or £1 a year in order to provide a service for people who live at Alice Springs, Tennant Creek or any other distant part of the continent. The Government is providing what is virtually a free broadcasting service for small secilr. Bryson. tions of the population. Those sections are entitled to have radio communication, but the cost of providing the service should be charged mainly to Consolidated Revenue instead of to the owners of radio sets in other parts of Australia. I object very strenuously to the proposal to increase the licence-fee from £1 to £2 a year and to discontinue the charge of 10s. for each additional set that is owned by a licence holder. It is one of those hit and miss proposals that characterize the Government's financial plan for the current year. I do not intend to debate the budget again at this stage, but I shall make passing references to some of its features as I develop my argument. A consistent pattern has been followed hy the Government in all its financial plans. In this instance, it has decided to increase the licence-fee charged to owners of single radio sets by 100 per cent, and to discontinue the charge for additional sets. Its excuse is that this procedure will simplify the collection of fees.. The Postmaster-General said, in his second-reading speech, that the additional fee for extra receivers would be abolished so that a single licence would cover any number of receivers in one family circle with the result that a factor that tended to complicate the licencing system, both for the listener and for the administration, would bc removed. I have never heard a more specious argument than that and I hope that some of the Government's supporters will enlarge upon it during the course of the debate. The only one who has attempted to justify it up to the present has been the honourable member for Lyne, who said that the new arrangements would save time and labour. However, the clear fact is that the new system will be most unfair. The licence-fee levied upon the owner of only one set will be increased by 100 per cent. But the increase will be only 50 per cent, for the owner of two sets, and the charge to the owner of three sets will remain unaltered. A person who owns four sets will benefit by a 25 per cent, reduction. The present system involves very little difficulties, and is simple to operate. The proposed alteration is .very much like the Government's income tax scheme, which imposes a 10 per cent, levy upon every taxpayer aible member's remarks are outside the scope of the bill. to income tax for the purpose of illustration. not permit me to pursue that line of arguask ment, Mr Speaker, I can only repeat that the proposal is a part of the general pattern of the Government's financial programme. As I have said before, its policy is, to him that hath much shall be given. The Postmaster-General should reconsider the proposal for the abolition of the charge for additional radio receivbroadcasting time that is devoted to popuing sets. By continuing the charge, he would be able to reduce the fee for single sets and still Obtain the same amount of revenue as is now contemplated. Persons who own two, three or four radio sets are in a better position to pay a few more shillings a year than are those who own only one set. Once again the Government intends to hit hardest the man who is least able to bear extra costs. The prices of radio receiving sets are increasing every day. The sales tax on these articles was increased last year, and it has been further increased this year. Now owners are to ,be called upon to pay twice as much as formerly for a listener's licence. The proposal is too severe and it should be reconsidered. T shall oppose it as strenuously as possible. The House should consider whether the most exciting stage of the game the AusAustralian Broadcasting Commission is tralian Broadcasting Coirmission broadproviding fair value for its expenditure on cast was cut off, and the announcer told programmes. I do not want to be unduly the listeners that they were about to hear critical of the national programmes be the weather reports and the stock excause, generally speaking, the commission change reports. gives an efficient service. However, the had to listen for five minutes to weather most expensive programmes that are renorts and. stock exchange reports that broadcast by the commission are those that they did not -'wish to hear. The test have the least appeal to the general body match broadcast was then resumed, but of listeners. I do not say that they are by that time all that was left for the not good programmes, but the fact is that announcer at the ground to say was that symphony concerts and other high-class the match was over and that Australia musical programmes are greatly apprehad won by one run and three wickets. ciated only by a very small section of the Criticism of such a proceeding is cercommunity. I believe that we are not tainly merited. The listeners would have getting full value in that direction. I been much happier if the station had am criticizing, not the quality but the continued to broadcast an account of the quantity of that particular kind of promatch, even if that had meant delaying gramme. Regard should be had to the the broadcast of the weather reports and cost of a programme that appeals to a very small section of the community. If it is known that only a few people listen to a programme that is expensive to produce, then the frequency of the occasions on which that kind of programme is broadcast should be limited and such programmes should be replaced by more popular programmes. 1 do not suggest that we should the Australian Broadcasting Commission to bring its programmes down to the level of some programmes that are broadcast by commercial stations. The Australian Broadcasting Commission would not give a moment's consideration to such a proposition. 1 sii""""est, however, an increase of the lar programmes, which are less expensive than some of the programmes now broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and appeal to a larger number of listeners. Such programmes would be of benefit to the people and would cost the commission less than programmes with a. limited appeal. The Australian Broadcasting Commission has an annoying habit of interrupting broadcasts in which thousands of listeners are interested just because thc time has arrived for another programme to go on the air. I was listening to the broadcast of the first .test match against the West Indies, at a stage near the end of the game when Australia had three wickets to fall and required three runs to win the match. At that Thousands of people",44,Anthony

124,Mr Bryson,"Of course, if you willstock exchange reports for a few minutes. I merely use that incident as an illustration of similar instances that occur. Broadcasting stations seen:, to be so worried about keeping everything to the exact minute that many good broadcasts are discontinued before they have been completed, so that the next session will not be delayed for even a minute. I hope that the commission will give consideration to instructing station managements to stop worrying about the clock and allow broadcasting service. good broadcasts to be finished. Nobody would be annoyed by having to wait a few more minutes to hear routine broadcasts such as those of weather reports and stock exchange reports. My time is almost exhausted, but, as E observe that some honourable members on the Government side are pleased that that is so, I must have made some valuable contribution to the debate. When the honourable member for Canning( Mr Hamilton) disagrees with me I realize that I must be on the right track, distortion of truth that exists in any because I have yet to hear him make any sensible statement in this House. The bill should be withdrawn and more consideration should be given to the cost of listeners' licence-fees. A new bill should be introduced to provide for a reduction of the licence-fee for the owners of one radio set, and for. the retention of the principle of an extra fee in respect of additional sets. If that were done the general body of the people would receive a fairer deal. -The honourable member for Wills( Mr There is nothing new in the criticism Bryson) was so pessimistic that I was quite sorry for him. I was interested to discover from his speech that the method that people should adopt to beat the effects of this bill is to have four radio sets in their homes. I have been prompted to speak on this measure by statements that the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) has made. He said that it would not be a bad thing to abolish the. Australian Broadcasting Commission, appoint a Minister for Broadcasting, and run the department under a permanent head. He also said that the Parliament would thereby have more direct control over expenditure on broadcasting. I consider that to be one of the most dangerous suggestions that I have ever heard. When the honourable member said that the Parliamentwhich might mean a political party or a government-woul d thereby have more control over expenditure, he did not deal with the real underlying point, which is that the adoption of such a system would introduce an extremely dangerous procedure which would give the opportunity for political control and political bias to enter into the conduct of the national The honourable member has not just had this idea. He was at one time a member of the Broadcasting Committee, and I think I am right in saying that in 1943 he wrote an addendum to the committee's report in which he recommended the nationalization of the broadcasting services of Australia. Such a proposal is, of course, in accord with the platform of the Labour party. I am sure that every sensible person must realize the terrific opportunity for gross country in which there is complete political control of broadcasting services. I am aware of the fact that the British Broadcasting Corporation is subject to a greater degree of political control than is the Australian Broadcasting Commission and I am glad to have learned that a proposal is now being considered to allow for the establishment in Britain of privately-owned radio stations to compete with the British Broadcasting Corporation, which is a monopoly that is operated under government charter. of the profits made hy commercial radio stations that has been voiced by honourable members opposite, because it seems to be a maxim that was laid down by the former Leader of the Labour party, Mr Chifley, that it is a sin to make a profit. makes 15 per cent, profit from a radio station. J bers of the Labour party do not complain of the profits of station 2HD Newcastle, because that station is a part of their party system. We believe that, rather than trying to run the commercial stations out of existence by restricting their profits and making them pay excessive licence-fees^ the Government should",46,Anthony

I was interested to hear one honourable member opposite criticize the charter and administration of the network of the Macquarie Broadcasting Service Proprietary Limited. Apparently he is oblivious of the fact that the charter of that network was approved by both the Curtin and Chifley Governments. Soi f he wishes to voice criticism of it let him not direct it to this Government. Honourable members opposite have also criticized the Australian Broadcasting Commission news service. Does any honourable member want the news services of this country to be politically controlled? honourable member would want such control. I remind honourable members opposite that the only way in which anything can be done about the Australian Broadcasting Commission news service is by the issuance of a direction of some kind from the Minister in charge of broadcasting. That would mean the introduction of political control of the news service. A great deal of criticism has been levelled at the proposed increase of the listener's licence-fee. I do not suppose that any of us likes the proposed increase, but the general average cost of a licence will still be 1-Jd. a day for each person in a family. hot. member would know more about anything red than I would.

We now have 51 national stations, including stations in the Northern Territory and New Guinea. I commend, in particular, two of the programmes that national stations -broadcast. One of them, the kindergarten of the air, is one of the finest radio programmes in the world. Another programme worthy of commendation is the rural country hour, which is extremely interesting to country people and is extensively heard in the country. I repeat, in conclusion, that the idea that has been propounded by the honourable member for Melbourne is one of the most dangerous suggestions that I have ever heard. That -the question be now put.

It has left these men high and dry for no logical reason, and we want to draw the attention of the House and the people to the inequity of this action and the churlishness of the Government in a matter where money should not enter the calculations* Ef there is any validity in the argument that these men have already benefited from basic wage rises, all the Government's statements about the cost of living and the difficulties under which people labour have no validity because these men suffer from the sarce disabilities as all the other workers who are crying to high heaven that they cannot live reasonably because of rising costs. The difficulties under which all people are living at. present certainly apply to the war pensioners as well as to everybody else. These men have lost something vital to themselves, either a limb or health, and therefore they are suffering more disability than men who have not been so afflicted. Yet it is suggested that their pensions should not be increased because they are doing all right in industry. This completely ignores the true position. That reminds me of the well-known quotation from Kipling""For it's Tommy this and Tommy that"", Chuek 'im out the brute, But it's ""Saviour of 'is country"", When, the guns, begin to shoot. During the alarms and excursions of the last six months, when we have been told that we must gird up our loins, prepare for war, and send the kids to camp; and when a famous general is being brought back from Korea to conduct our recruiting campaign, surely it is ridiculous that men who have fought our battles in past days should be so shabbily treated by the Government. The Government has been bamboozled by the Treasurer and by the Treasury. RecentlyI . have noticed representatives of returned servicemen's associations in the corridors of this building, apparently pleading for justice for the ex-servicemen. I therefore expected that the ex-servicemen's committee on the Government side would have done, something' about this matter. Apparently it has been brushed aside by the Cabinet. By not. giving percentage increases of the basic war pensions a means test, has been applied to waa* pensions. I now present to honourable members a statement which shows the fluctuation of the basic wage and its rela> tion to the basicwar pension. In 1920 the basic wage, based' on the city of Sydney, was £4 8s. 6d.. and the basic war pension was' £2 2s., which represented 47.5 per cent of the basic wage. In 1.930' the basic wage was £4 9s., the basic war pension £2 2s. and the. percentage 47.. In 1940 the basic wage was £4 5s., the basic war pension £2 2s., and the percentage 49.5. The ideal is between 47 per cent, and 49 per cent, of the basic wage. Therefore at that stage all was reasonably well. In 1943 the basic wage was £4 19Si, the war pension £2 10s., and the percentage 50.5. That was under the regime of the Chifley Government. In 1948 the basic wage was £6 2s., the war pension £2 15s. and the percentage 46-. Even that was acceptable to ex-servicemen. In 1950 the basic wage was £7 6s., the war pension £3 10s. and the percentage 48. In August 1951 the basic wage was £9 13s. the pension £3 10s., and the percentage 36. Now, in November, 1951, the basic wage is £10 7s. the basic war pension is still only £3 10s., and the percentage is only 33.5. Honourable members will therefore see that the percentage has fallen 14 points since 1920. of pension for those who are totally and permanently disabled? bute to what has been done for those people. I do not contest that a reasonably good job has not been, done for them. Unfortunately their numbers are rapidly diminishing. A visit to the cubicles at Randwick and Yaralla hospitals is indeed a depressing experience. It should be a matter for satisfaction, though not for praise, if any government looks after such men adequately. But there has been a harsh, injustice done to men on the basic war pension.

157,Mr Haylen.:,"I have paid due trilot of dissatisfaction about the Government's actions. No doubt he has been side-tracked by departmental advice or Treasury pressure into acquiescing in this legislation. Ex-servicemen round town 3uch as those employed as liftmen and in other capacities in Commonwealth buildings, who appear physically fit, are in receipt of only a small pension. Whilst they appear to be physically fit, they suffer from their disability. A small increase of pension should be made available to them not as a matter of money but from the standpoint of their prestige and as a reward to which they are entitled for having fought in defence of their country. The Government's treatment of them is churlish, horrible and unpatriotic. Whilsti t has been able to fix levels in respect of all other classes of pensions it has ignored these ex-servicemen. [ cannot understand why the Government, which preens itself on what it has done in the interests of ex-servicemen, has fallen into this trap. No valid reason can be given for its attitude. It must have been made aware of this anomaly by correspondence that Ministers have received from ex-servicemen's organizations. Eor instance, the Tuberculosis Sailors and Soldiers Association has gone on record as having saidEx-Servicemen regard tlie Budget proposals in respect to those groups of war pensions who are to receive increased pensions, as being altogether so but the only construction they can place on the decision to leave the great bulk of war pensions out of budget considerato which the honourable member refers. tion is that a means test is now operating in the matter of assessing statutory increases in war pension rates. There is no need to flog this issue because it is crystal clear. Indeed, the Government has made a dangerous mistake. I have no doubt that its supporters will defend its attitude, but such an attitude is indefensible because it is partial and represents a departure from the general view. The Government has refused to apply to this class of service pensioners the principle of percentage payments that it has applied to all other classes of pensioners. The only answer that the Government can make in this matter is that the class of service pensioner to whom I refer is not entitled to more generous treatment because he is Mr Haylen. earning income in civilian industry and is not in need of additional assistance. Such an attitude puts the 'Government out of court for all time, because the service pension is paid not in respect of the needs of recipients but as a reward for fighting in the defence of the country and being disabled in the course of such service. I i the Government intends by this method to apply a means test to this class of service pensioners, let it say so frankly instead of talk about its intention, ultimately, to eliminate the means test. One of these days the principle of percentage payments will have to be applied to all classes of social services benefits. The establishment of a minimum rate of pension will, at least, be a start. But it is tragic that on this occasion the Government has failed to remember the tubercular pensioners, who are not completely physically fit and, therefore, are entitled to receive a just reward from a grateftil country. The Repatriation Act is such a perfect piece of mechanism that it will not work. We know of instances in which that fact has been proved. It can be said that the act merely lumbers along. gentleman realize that the Government is now doing what the Chifley Government did in 1947? But, whereas the Chifley Government provided a pension at the rate of 5s. a week, this Governfairly reasonable although not ment is providing a pension at the rate of 15s. a week to pensioners in the class the Army( Mr Francis) is attempting to draw a red herring across the path. If he had been present in the chamber throughout the whole of my speech he would have known that I admitted that what the Chifley Government did in 1947 was a mistake. I pointed out that our experience in that respect was such that we should not repeat it, and that in 1948 it was rectified. Two wrongs do not make a right. The Government cannot merely hide behind the alleged inefficiencies of a Labour government. As soon as the Chifley Government realized that its departure from the system of percentage payments had caused considerable suffering) it rectified that mistake.",52,Francis
158,Mr Fbancis,Does the honourable,53,Francis
159,Mr Haylen,"The Minister forSeveral other points must be considered in relation to service pensioners. I repeat that the Government is guilty of committing a dangerous error in departing from the principle of percentage rates. The effect of such action has been to deprive the 160,000 pensioners of the class to which I have referred, and which form the largest group of service pensioners, of a just pension. In addition, the Government, under this legislation, is indirectly imposing a means test upon service pensioners. I challenge tbe Government to answer those three charges. The case against it is crystal clear and does not call for long-winded argument. Indeed, ex-servicemen's already presented the facts to the Government. They have gone on record as having saidLet us look at the position of a serving member of the A.I.F. now fighting in Korea. If he enlisted in November, 1950, he knew that, ment, is applying a means test to that in the event of his being wounded and subsequently discharged from the Forces 100 pei cent, disabled, he would receive a war pension of £3 10s. per week which represented 48 per cent, of the then basic wage. He was satisfied to join under those circumstances. But what now when the pension represents only 30 per cent, of the wage, and next month will fall to the all-time low of 33.5 per cent. <if the basic wage? '.rhe men who are serving in Korea will he affected by this legislation, because should they become entitled to receive a disability pension upon their discharge, regardless of the degree of their disability, they will be paid a. pension that is now being reduced by at least 15 per cent, compared with what the rate of pension would be if it were fixed on the basis of percentage payments. The Government has no answer to make on that point. I direct attention to the firm statement that the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) made when he was Leader of the Opposition that not only justice but also mercy would be extended to the serviceman in relation to his pension and repatriation claims. What has become of that pious platitude under this measure, which is merely a measure that has emanated from ii hard-hearted Treasury and that denies to ex-servicemen the justice to which they are entitled under established repatriation practices? This measure is a repudiation of the Government's obligation to thoan pensioners. Why has it eliminated the principle of percentage payments in respect of this class of pension? I cannot accept the reason that the Minister has given for this action on the part of the Government. In view of the fact that a previous Labour government recognized that it had fallen into a trap when it ignored the principle, surely the present Government, w-ith that experience in mind, will not fall into a similar trap. Is the Government content to defend itself merely by whining about the wonderful job that it has done in the interests of ex-servicemen? I have admitted that it has done a fair job by those men; but if this debate were to develop into a organizations have contest about how good the Government is and how wrong the Chifley Government was, I should deplore such imbecility in the treatment of service pensioners in the vulnerable group to which I have referred. Under this measure the Governclass of pensioner and is prepared to forget that their pensions are payable to them in recognition of their war service. The Government's claim is a piece of political humbug which will be dealt with on the hustings. If it does not. rectify its mistake ex-servicemen and the people generally will have much to say about its action. After screaming for troops to reinforce the Australian battalion that has done splendid work in Korea, the Government is prepared to allow those servicemen to become the victims of this machine-like measure. Whereas the Government is budgeting for a surplus of £114,500,000, an expenditure of less than £4,000,000 would be needed to meet the service pensioners' demand for an increase of their pension by £1 so that it may conform to acknowledged percentage levels. I urge the Government to have another look at this matter. I know that ex-servicemen have been pressing it. If the Government does not accede to their request, it will fail to stand up to its responsibility. It will reveal itself as a treasury-ridden Government that is prepared to forget the ex-servicemen who are still struggling in the hard world outside. The Government has accepted a solution of this problem that is not valid. I regret that the committee of ex-servicemen that has been constituted by Government isupporters has associated itself with the Government's repudiation of its responsibility. The amendment that I propose to move is simple. It has not been drafted in any savage spirit, but is clearly an attempt to rectify the mistake that the Government is making. I .urge the Government to accept it and thus obviate bitterness and despair among those men who, apparently, it is now prepared to leave in the cold. .For those reasons I move That all words after "" That"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:-""the bill be withdrawn and redrafted to provide for(a) the operation of the act from' the 1st other ground, why the 100 per cent, July, 1951; '(.&') all pension schedules to share in the proposed increases in rates; .(c) inclusion of base war pensions; and (d) increase in all categories to be at .the same percentage rate "". [4.28] -The House has just listened to a speech by the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) which turned completely upon the principle of percentage payments. Whilst he admitted that the Government has made generous provision for certain classes of pensioners, he seeks to bring all classes of service pensioners within the scope of the measure. I say without qualification that that is the most shallow humbug that the House has listened to for a long time. I have had the good fortune to have been an officer of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airment's Imperial League of Australia and to have participated in many debates within that organization on the subject of the relationship of service pension rates to the basic wage. The traditional outlook of the league is that pensions should not be tied to the basic wage. trend. "" tied to the basic wage"". That is the traditional standpoint of the league. man has not read the representations that have been made by the league on that matter. read them. The honourable member for Parkes said that this measure is a harsh piece of tyranny on 100 per cent, pensioners, and that the Government had no excuse for treating them in .such a manner. The honourable gentleman made the extra-ordinary statement that the great majority of war pensioners had not received any consideration in the budget for the current financial year. I remind him that the Chifley Labour Government, which he supported, did precisely .the same thing in 1947. adjustment was made nine months later. no reason, either because of the traditional standpoint of the league, or on any pension rate should be tied to the basic wage. In fact, the traditional standpoint of the league has heen directly contrary to that view. I propose to show that all classes of pensioners, far from being harshly treated, have been well treated by this Government; but before I do so, I shall refer briefly to those persons who are practically dependent on the pension for their maintenance. There is no need for me to cite all the increases of pension that have been granted, but I emphasize that these pensioners are treated most generously by the Government under this bill. The general interests of war pensioners have been safeguarded. I find that the expenditure on war and .service pensions in the financial year ended the 30th June, 1949, was £18,750,000. In the next financial year which ended on the 30th June. 1950, it was £20,500,000 and in the last financial year it was £27,500,000. The estimated expenditure to the 30th June, 1952, is £33,250,000 Those figures reveal the staggering increases of pension that have been granted. Are those the actions of a government which is inflicting a harsh piece of tyranny upon pensioners? Such an idea is utter nonsense. Since this Government has been in office, repatriation payments have increased by £14,500,000. I shall now refer to the increase of the general rate pension. The House should pay close attention to the facts. The total cost that would be involved by an increase of £1 a week would be £4,500,000 per annum, including sustenance .allowances.

Those members on the general rate would receive, on the basis of an increase of £1 a week, from 2s, to 5s. a week.

Would the honourable member support a greater increase? per cent, rate for a wife is £110s. 6d., and sions are not subject to income tax, and for each child under the age of sixteen years the rate is l is . 6d. a week. In addition, child endowment is payable in respect of all the children who are under the age of sixteen years. No means test of any kind is applicable to the general rate pension. The figures that I have cited disprove the statement that the 100 per cent, pensioner has been neglected by this Government. Practically all general rate pensioners, even those on or nearly on the 100 per cent, rate, are in full employment. The honourable member for Parkes has claimed that the Government proposes to impose a means test upon those persons. Nothing of the sort! I shall return to the matter of a means test a little later. As practically all the general rate pensioners are in full employment, the pension to them is not a needs pension. When I make that statement, I mean that the pension is not necessary for their maintenance. In that respect, it is not like the pension that is payable to a totally and permanently incapacitated ex-serviceman. These men are receiving a payment that has always been regarded as compensation for war injuries. The Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia has never considered that such a pension should be related to the basic wage. There is no reason to suggest that such persons are harshly treated when, in all the circumstances that exist to-day, the rate is not increased. The great majority of those 168,000 .pensioners are in full employment, and are also in receipt of benefits [70] other than the pension. Those'members on the 100 per cent, rate, for instance, receive practically a full medical cover, including hospital benefits. Other members on lower rates receive medical attention in varying and lessening degrees. But all honourable members are aware of the extraordinary generosity with which the Repatriation Department always treats the claims of ex-servicemen, and of the large number that has been accepted even on slight evidence of the disabilities being due to war canses. An ex-prisoner of war, for instance, has merely to make a claim about any illness, and it is treated by the Repatriation Department as being due to war causes. War penare free from the hazards of unemployment. They continue all the time. Other benefits are granted, such as child endowment. The claim that people who enjoy those benefits, the vast majority of whom are in full employment, are being harshly treated by this Government, is sheer nonsense. It is made for one purpose only. Opposition members are endeavouring to place on their own shoulders the mantle of champion of ex-servicemen. To such a Claim, they have no right or title whatever. There is only one other point that 1 wish to make. This budget has been framed in extraordinary times, but in spite of that fact, great' concessions and advantages have been given to all the persons in necessitous circumstances who come within the scope of the repatriation scheme. honourable member has admitted that I have stated facts to the House. The Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia is a great body that is entitled to express its views on many subjects. It is perfectly entitled to make whatever claims it wishes to make on behalf of its members. Indeed, it is entitled to do more than that. It is entitled to make plain its views on matters of national importance, and has always done so. All governments have been willing at all times to listen to its views. Those of us who have been intimately associated with the league have often concurred in those views. Yet,",55,Francis

170,Dr. Donald Cameron,"Th ewhilst all admit that the league has a perfect right to press the claims of its members, I am convinced that it is satisfied about two things. The first is that this Government, consisting as it does largely of ex-servicemen and having due regard to its overall responsibilities to the nation, has made great efforts to protect the interests of ex-servicemen. The second is that the vital interests of the league will always be sympathetically and realistically considered by this Government in the light of its responsibilities to the nation as a whole. The suggestion that any section of ex-members of the Forces has been neglected or harshly treated by this Government is contrary not only to fact and to experience, but also to the real opinion of the league itself. Strongly support the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) The honourable member for Oxley (Dr. Donald Cameron) chided the honourable member for Parkes that he had been too critical because he had said that no provision had been made in this bill for partly disabled ex-servicemen. I fail to understand how the honourable gentleman, who is an ex-servicemen, can hold such a view. We ou this side of the House believe that a grave injustice has been done in this measure to the majority of ex-servicemen who are in receipt of pensions. After all, 160,000 men in that group will not receive any benefit under this legislation. The honourable member for Oxley cannot escape the fact that a close relationship has always been preserved between repatriation pensions and the basic wage. He stated that many ex-servicemen do uot need an increase of their present rate of pension, because they are in full employment. I point out that those men were granted a pension for a specific reason of which the honourable gentleman must be aware. When troops disembarked from the transports after World WarI . , they were medically examined, and were granted compensation in the form of a pension for any disabilities from which they were suffering, because their earning capacity was reduced to that degree. A means test was not applied to the granting of that pension. A close relationship between the 100 per cent, pension and the basic wage has been maintained since the inception of the payment of repatriation benefits in 1920. I remind the House that in that year the pension for a 100 per cent, disability was £2 2s. a week, or 47.5 per cent, of the then basic wage in Sydney. That relationship was preserved until 1950, when the pension was 48 per cent, of the basic wage. To-day, however, the pension is only 33 per cent, of the base wage. Therefore, a grave injustice has been done to a large body of ex-servicemen who are in receipt of pensions. Members of the Liberal party and of the Australian Country party have always posed as the only champions of ex-servicemen. As a matter of fact, they have adopted that role deliberately, and to such effect that they have become almost professional actors in it. They claim that the Labour party has no sympathy for ex-servicemen. I have fought against that sort of propaganda for years. Now tlie supporters of the Government are to be tested. We are gravely concerned about this issue because the Government's proposal involves a grave miscarriage of justice. Whether it was framed with deliberate intent or not I cannot say, but the fact is that an increase of the rate of pension for permanently incapacitated men, the number of whom is small, would be much less costly than would be an increase for partly disabled men. I am bitterly critical of the bill because the Government has endeavoured to make a great deal of party political capital from it. The base rate of pension for partly incapacitated ex-servicemen is £3 10s. a week, but the average payment is about £1 15s. a week because the pensioners are paid according to the degree of their disability. The present Prime Minister sought to win the votes of ex-servicemen hy making this promise to themWe shall see to it that there is speedy financial and human justice and understanding in our administration of soldier problems. Where is the human justice in the Government's proposal ? It seems to me that, it has thrown justice overboard at the expense of 160,000 men in order to save a small expenditure. This sort of",56,Francis
171,Mr Mcleod (Wannon) [4.42],"Iconduct conies very ill from politicians who probably owe their positions in this Parliament to the glowing promises that they made to ex-servicemen. These supposed champions of the ex-servicemen are now trying to convince U3 that they have given a wonderful deal to partly incapacitated ex-servicemen and that, because those men are in full employment, they do not need a pension. The logical conclusion to the argument of the honourable member for Oxley is that those men should not have a pension. No other Government ever attempted to depart from the principle that was established when the base rate of pension for partially disabled servicemen was fixed in 1920. Ordinary human justice demands that the rate be increased. The Government has increased all other pension rates. Surely it has not forgotten this section of the community! It has always assured the people that it will never forget the ex-servicemen and that the Labour party is the only political party that would neglect ex-servicemen on the Government side them. These disabled men have to bear the ill effects of inflation in common with other members of the community. The Government's neglect of them is tantamount to an actual reduction of their penvernment can easily bring enough pression. The base rate should be increased by at least 15 per cent, in order to mainchange their decision. They have claimed tain n proper relationship to the cost of living. The Government claims that these men have nothing to complain about, but I shall complain very strenuously on their behalf. The Government has decided to abrogate a well-established prinman handed to me a pamphlet that had ciple. What will be its next step? Does it propose to undermine the entire foundation on which this pension system for ex-servicemen has been based for such a long time? Its neglect affects not only the 160,000 pensioners concerned, but also a large body of dependants. I agree that payments to totally incapacitated ex-servicemen should be increased to a reasonable amount in order to counteract the steadily decreasing value of the £1. However, there are relatively few such pensioners and their number is steadily diminishing. As they approach the age that you, Mr Speaker, and I have reached, they begin to fade away. Most of the partially disabled ex-servicemen are young them. men who served in World War II . 1 believe that the Government is thinking in terms of costs and has decided to sacrifice that large body of men for the sake of financial economy without regard for common justice. ' The Labour party does not want to favour any section of the community, but believes in dispensing even-handed justice. In this instance, it appears that one group has been singled out for the imposition of a penalty. Partially disabled ex-servicemen can reasonably claim that the Government has reduced their pension because the base rate now represents only 33 per cent, of the basic wage instead of 48 per cent., as it did in 1950. Even yet it is not too late for the Government to remove this anomaly. It cannot honestly argue that the economy is made necessary by any lack of funds, because it has provided for a surplus of £114,500,000 in the accounts for the currentfinancialyear, I challenge all of the chamber to honour their promise to give financial and human justice to ex-servicemen. They will be given an opportunity soon to show where they stand on this issue. The supporters of the Gosure to bear on Ministers to force them to great kudos as the only champions of ex-servicemen. I have heen disgusted by some of the propaganda of this sort that they have used. During the last general election campaign, a young ex-servicebeen prepared on behalf of the Liberal party. I warned him to be careful of the promises that it contained because I had bitter memories of similar promises that had been made formerly by the same party under another name and that had been dishonoured. The Liberal party is probably due for another change of name now, hecause it has broken so many promises that it has fallen into ill repute. The young man to whom I have referred was misled by a beautifully prepared pamphlet in which the Liberal party promised that it would do all sorts of things for ex-servicemen and declared that a Labour government would neglect I challenge every ex-serviceman on the Government side of the chamber to join with the Opposition in voting for the amendment. That is the test. They have bluffed the ex-servicemen for too long, and I want the people to learn now where they stand on this issue. The Labour Government made no distinctions between different sections of ex-servicemen. It tried to accord justice to all classes of pensioners. We now ask the Government to emulate that example. It has acknowledged the needs of age and invalid pensioners. Partially incapacitated ex-servicemen are also in need as a result of the decreased value of the £1. We merely ask for justice. The honourable member for Oxley said that they did not need help because they were in full employment, but he must know that their earning capacity is impaired by their diskeep this subject out of the field of party abilities. They would not be in receipt of a pension if that were not so. The Government, by its neglect, has virtually reduced their pension by 15 per cent, or more. Therefore, I strongly protest against its refusal to accept the amendment. outset I challenge any other honourable member to produce a record of service to ex-servicemen since World WarI . , other than lip service, that is better than my record. I am not being egotistical. I issue the challenge now because I propose to speak strongly on this bill. During all the years of my service on behalf of ex-servicemen, the sort of conduct that has disgusted and sickened me more than anything else has been that of the politicians who have attempted to "" bludge "" is unparliamentary. the actions of politicians who have sought any section of the community, and parto make the welfare of ex-servicemen a plaything of the party political football field. I have always endeavoured to remove such issues from the political arena. Certain politicians always try to gain advantage by talking loudly and insincerely about the sufferings of an untowards ex-servicemen. In fact, because fortunate section of the community. I hope that the bill and the amendment of the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) will be discussed throughout the remainder of this debate solely on their merits and not for the sake of making party political capital. I could easily discuss the misdeeds and omissions of political parties in the past, but, as I have said here before, 1 attach no value to such recriminations. It is easy to give lip service, but unfortunately very few of those who talk glibly about the needs of ex-servicemen endeavour to translate their promises into action. The purpose of this bill is to increase the rate of payment to certain war pensioners and their dependants. I shall not discuss the adequacy or inadequacy of the proposed increase. polities. Furthermore, I do not propose to debate the fact that certain sections of pensioners are not dealt with in the bill. ber does not know the meaning of honesty, I suggest that you, Mr Speaker, take him to your office one day and endeavour to teach him at least the basic principles of it. done so. unsuccessful, Mr Speaker. The Government's proposal deserves high commendation because it acknowledges the needs of those persons who have been most adversely affected by the sacrifices that have been made in the service of their country. Special and additional provision has been made for children. I consider that the basis of all the assistance that we give to ticularly to those people who have been adversely affected because of war service, should have special regard to the needs of children. This Government, composed as it is of ex-servicemen, cannot be said to be unsympathetic or ungenerous members of the Government are ex-servicemen, and not because they are members of a political party, they have been",57,Francis

His appeal was based on wrong premises and did not get him anywhere. When war pensions were originally granted they were not based on the disabilities that returned servicemen might have suffered, or on the degree to which that disability would affect their earning capacity. It has been a fundamental principle of war pensions that earning capacity is not taken into consideration when the percentage of a disability is assessed. Therefore, a means test has never been applied to war pensions, which were granted in recognition of the fact that the recipients would lose in some directions because of their disabilities. One man might suffer a loss in respect of his earning capacity, whilst another might lose in relation to his social actilishment, if possible within the next few vities. For instance, a facial disfiguremonths, of a tribunal that will assess the ment is classed as a 100 per cent, disability, although a man who suffers from such a disfigurement could earn an almost unlimited income^ The principle also gives recognition to the fact that the recipient fall automatically according to the pur^ may incur costs as a result of his disability that he would not otherwise have to incur. For instance, an amputee who, in normal circumstances, would himself be able to do certain jobs' on his property, might have to engage labour to do them. He receives a pension as an amputee although he may be able to earn an income of perhaps £5,000 a year. I could cite cases of men who are in receipt mined, although I do not wish to tie war of a full pension rate although they hold remunerative positions. But such men can justlv claim that their disabilities member will do exactly as he is told to do. cause them loss in other directions. Their disabilities can mean the denial of pleasures and of social life. Although the war pension was not originally based on need, unfortunately the basic rate honourable of assessment was left in the party political football field. 1 believe that the time has come when it should be removed from that field so that no politician will have an opportunity to attempt to ride on the backs of the ex-servicemen. The Government's proposal in this measure is in continuation of previous legislation. It accentuates the fact that there is a difference between people who receive a war pension on the basis of need and people who receive it in respect of a disability. Returned servicemen'3 organizations recognize that ex-servicemen are divided into two categories. The first is that to the members of which the pension is a means of livelihood. The second includes people to whom a pension is not a matter of need, but is in respect of a disability. It is wrong that people who require war pensions, for their livelihood should come cap-in-hand to governments to have their pensions increased in accordance with alterations of the country's economy. They should not be obliged to be the subject of party political propaganda. I submit for the consideration of the Government, and of all honourable members who are really sincere about assisting war pensioners, a proposal for the estabbase rate of a needs pension for ex-servicemen. After the base rate has been assessed and established,, the economy pension, as I shall term it, will rise and chasing power of the currency. In that way needy ex-servicemen would no longer be the subject of political wrangling. I should not mind if the same procedure were adopted in relation to age pensions. The rise and fall of war pension rates would, under my proposal, be determined by economic circumstances, just as the rise and fall of the basic wage is deterpensions to the basic wage. whatever the honourable member may say.",59,Francis

The second group of pensioners would be those in receipt of what might be termed a compensatory pension. The base rate for that pension would also be established by an independent tribunal, and alterations of the base rate would be made by the tribunal. In other words, if an ex-servicemen's organization produced evidence that the rate of the compensatory pension was insufficient, or that any reduction that was proposed was unjustified, then the tribunal would make a decision on the evidence. Organizations, or the Government, or anybody else, could submit evidence for or against the appellants.

There is an obligation on the nation to help these men. To a considerable number of pensioners their pension is an absolute necessity and it is insufficient for many of them to live on. To many others the pension represents a recognition of a job done and is compensation for losses which have no effect on their earning capacity. Their case is not in any way similar to that of people who must live on their pension. Obviously, the Government should ensure that the greatest benefit shall be given to those whose need is the greatest. That will be done under this legislation. Although ex-servicemen's associations have protested because the base pension has not been increased I list vp. yet to find the ex-serviceman who would demand that he should receive his share of the available money regardless of whether or not this would deprive his more needy comrades of the assistance that they require. Genuine ex-servicemen who are concerned for the welfare of their mates have unhesitatingly said to me that if the Government has only limited funds to distribute by way of increased pension rates, those funds should be paid to men who need them most. They have said that they would present their case because they wanted an increase of their rates, but they were not prepared to jeopardize the prospects of those who were most badly in need of the rnonoy. Whatever may be my attitude to service pensioners generally, I ammost, concerned about the welfare of those who really need an increased pension. I consider that those men should receive tli<> increase without delay, and I do not intend to vote in any way that will delay the passage of this bill. I shall do everypledge that they would serve exthing in my power to assist the needv to receive the extra pension rates as speedily as .possible. Possibly no honourable member in recent times has spoken for longer and said less than has thc honourable member for Moore( Mr Leslie), who has just resumed his seat. Quite clearly the honourable member was in the position of a man pushing a bike uphill with the wind against him. An increased pension should be Any honourable member who regards this matter from a non-party political -viewpoint must observe that the interests of 160,000 ex-servicemen have been sold out by a government from w hich they r should have received the utmost consideration. I .rise to speak on this bill because I have a persona] interest, as a citizen and a parliamentary representative in thc welfare of ex-servicemen, and their dependants and because I have received protests, as have other honourable members, against the injustice of this legislation. The honourable member for Moore( Mr Leslie) asked honourable (members to consider in a non-party-political manner, the improvement of the conditions and general amenities to which ex-servicemen are entitled. I believe that there is a great deal to be said for the adoption of such an attitude in connection with this matter. The great sacrifices that ex-servicemen have made require that we shall examine their welfare in an impartial light and, irrespective of our politics, do the utmost to ensure that they shall be fully recompensed when they require assistance. The Opposition has provided an opportunity for Government supporters to refrain from acting party politically and refuse to be dominated by the Cabinet which submitted these proposals to them without giving time to examine them. The honourable member for Moore and other Government supporters who were elected on the pledge that they would do everything possible for ex-servicemen will soon have an opportunity to support the amendment designed by the Opposition to do justice to all ex-servicemen. Seventy-five per cent, of honourable members opposite are ex-servicemen who were elected on the servicemen. Yet they have allowed the basic rate of pension to fall from approximately 50 per cent, of the basic wage to 33 per cent, of the basic wage. It has heen left to the Government parties, the interests of which are packed with ex-servicemen, to sell out the rights of ex-servicemen and substantially reduce the rates of pension in comparison",61,Francis
195,Mr Daly (Grayndler) [5.20],"with the basic wage. Opposition members have been sneered at by honourable members opposite who have alleged that we have not supported tbe interests of soldiers and their dependants. allegations are quite unjust. In 1941 a Labour Administration investigated and improved the repatriation legislation in relation to the .1914-18 war despite the failure of the non-Labour Government that had preceded it to take effective action of that nature. As the honourable member for Wannon porters, particularly those who are ex-servicemen, pledged themselves to protect the welfare of soldiers. An ironical, unfortunate and sorry picture is now presented by those honourable members in their attempts to defend this indefensible legislation which, if passed, will sell out the rights of 160,000 former members of the forces. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) was outspoken in the newspapers concerning ex-servicemen's requirements. He will soon have an opportunity to cross the floor and vote in the independent way of which we have heard so much. Government supporters have maintained that they are not bound to party decisions. They have stated that they vote as they wish on great problems. It has not been difficult to count the number of them who have voted with the; Opposition on great issues. When it is time to vote on this measure they will be seen sitting timidly by, because the whip will crack. They must consult the Cabinet before they vote because their party machine is so ruthless. The Government has budgeted for a surplus of £114,500,000, but anybody who has studied the budget will appreciate that the ultimate surplus will be approximately £300,000,000. Yet the Government proposes to deny 160,000 ex-servicemen a paltry £4,000,000 which would provide them with means with which to meet the cost of living. It is a shame to see the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull), who, when in Opposition, was as fiery as a lion in dealing with ex-servicemen's problems, acting like an old, tame, worn-out tomcat. I do not Mr Daly. criticize the 'service which the honourable member has rendered to the nation as a soldier. Those Speaker. Do you consider it fair to the tomcat to be likened to the honourable member for Mallee? warned honourable members that they must not make allusions of this type to one another.

Let us say that the honourable member for Mallee has lost his ferocity in defending the ex-servicemen. Opposition members are waiting to see him cross the floor and serve, in a practical manner, the interests of 160,000 ex-servicemen by voting with them for the amendment. I am waiting also to hear the honourable member for St. George( Mr Graham), who is the chairman of the ex-servicemen's committee of Government supporters, justify this bill, which has been condemned by ex-servicemen's organizations from one end of the continentto the other. How do Government supporters expect ex-servicemen to exist on a paltry pension when the inflationary spiral has decreased the value of the present pension rates by at least 15 per cent. ? What chance have ex-servicemen who are dependent on the base rate of pension to meet the commitments of their families without any increase of this rate? On what grounds can ex-servicemen who support the Government justify its hoarding of £300,000,000 while the Government refuses a paltry £4,000,000 to provide ex-servicemen with the wherewithal to keep body and soul together? This is one great opportunity that honourable members on the Government side will have to cross the floor and vote for this amendment which ia designed to ensure that Australian ex-servicemen shall get the justice to which they are entitled.",62,Francis

The Government back-dated, the pensions of various judges throughout the Commonwealth; therefore, why should not the ex-servicemen he given the same consideration ? It must be remembered that judges are in a far more fortunate financial position than are ex-servicemen pensioners, and have less need for the extra amount that will accrue to them in consequence of the Government's action. I should be very interested to hear-honourable members on the Government side give reasons why ex-service's pensions cannot be dated back in view of the fact that the Government is budgetingin such, a way that the actual surplus will be about £300,000,000. Already the war pension is lagging far behind the cost of living, and those who receive it are suffering financial hardships. honourable member who believes in justice can lightly cast aside the claims of 160,000 ex-servicemen and say that these men are not entitled to a greater increase of pension? All sections of our society are sharing increases of all sorts except these ex-servicemen whose pension is far below the basic wage and has not been proportionately increased. The Government is maintaining this particular pension at approximately 33 per cent, of the basic wage although 48 per cent, has been the proportion for nearly 30 years. No honourable member can justify its refusal to increase the pension, having in mind its complete failure to keep down living costs. I recently read that a leader of ao ex-servicemen's organization had said that be did not believe that any government had been so callous towards ex-servicemen as had this Government, which has refused to include all ex-servicemen pensioners in the pension increases. The bill should be redrafted to include basic war pensioners. What is the difference between refusing to give an increase to such, people aind refusing to increase age pensions Avhen invalid pensions are increased? ' I am sure that the Minister for Social Services( Mr Townley) would not discriminate between classes of pensioners under the Social Services Conredrafted to classes of war pensioners have been discriminated against in this legislation. These ex-servicemen have given the best years of their lives in the service of Australia, but they are denied the ordinary right of civilians to an increase of wages,, by the refusal to increase their pension to meet the increased cost of living. Here is an excellent opportunity for ex-servicemen on the Government side to show that; they have the interests of ex-servicemen at heart; Let them fall into line with all ex-servicemen's associations in this country and seek justice for war pensioners.

Mr Speaker, and I ask for its withdrawal. that I made. Honourable members on the Government side will have an opportunity to-day to stand up and say whether they intend to vote in the interests of ex-servicemen. For too long have they tried to pose as the only defenders in this House of the ex-servicemen but now they clearly show where they stand. The honourable member for Parkes has proposed that this bill shall provide for an increase of pensions in all categories by much the same percentage. If his amendment is Carried this biil will contain many more desirable features than it contains.at present. It will be brought more into iine with the expectations and rights of ex-servicemen in our"" present inflationary period. The opportunity has now been presented for the Government to carry on the great programme of assistance to ex-servicemen which was started by Labour governments during and after the last war. The opportunity is presented for honourable members, whose sincerity I do not doubt, but who are tied to the party machine, to participate in giving effect to the plan submitted by the honourable member for Parkes which will give justice to all our ex-servicemen. The Labour movement, and the Opposition which speaks for it in this House, submit this amendment as a constructive measure, in order to give an opportunity to the Government to do the reasonable and just thing to ensure that all ex-servicein those words, which have been read men shall be given increases similar to those outlined in the legislation for certain sections. I commend the amendment to the House and look forward with confidence to many honourable members on the Government side marching with the Opposition when the House divides on it. All honourable members should review this matter in a non-political spirit and should ensure that Australian ex-servicemen shall be given the justice that they so richly deserve. When the division bells ring we shall see whether or not honourable members on the Government side are sham fighters, as they were when they sat in Opposition. Apparently many of them are uncomfortable about this bill; that was indicated by the speeches of the honourable member for Moore( Mr Leslie) and the honourable member for Oxley (Dr. Donald Cameron). GovernI withdraw the statement ment supporters should vote as they have been requested to do by ex-servicemen's organizations, and as deputations to the Prime Minister have urged. They should vote for the amendment moved by the honourable member for Parkes, and show the people of Australia that they are not merely party hacks but are prepared to stand up for the rights of the ex-servicemen. -. 1 think that the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) contributed very little to which I need reply. Like Gratiano, in The Merchant of Venice, he spoke "" an infinite amount of nothing"". I shall now devote my remarks to the amendment before the House. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) placed much stress upon the 1949 policy speech of the present Prime Minister( Mr Menzies). The main text of his amendment directs attention to the fact that the basic rate of pension has not increased. I again direct attention to the Government parties' policy speech of 1949. Before the 1949 general election, the present Prime Minister saidRepatriation remains a great and proud responsibility. . . We shall see to it that there is speed, financial and human justice and understanding in our administration of soldier problems. I say that our policy is fully expressed twice before to-day. Moreover, our policy has been carried out. In November. 1950, very substantial increases of repatriation benefits were made. It should be remembered that that was within twelve months of assumption of office by this Government. Since then we have",64,Francis
206,Mr Speaker,That is a matter,65,Francis
207,Mr Tuenbull,"It is offensive to me,",65,Francis
208,Mr Daly,,65,Francis
209,Mr Timson (Higinbotham) [5.40].,"been constantly accused of not having fulfilled our promises. These are the facts refer to thos« who are practically entirely of the matter: The totally and permanently incapacitated ex-serviceman's pension rate was increased twelve months ago, at the first opportunity that this Government had to do so, from £10 123. a fortnight to £14 a fortnight. That wa3 an increase of £3 8s. a fortnight. The rate of the serviceman's widow's pension was increased from £6 to £7 a fortnight and domestic allowance was increased from 15s. to £1 a fortnight. The general rate, or what we mistakenly call the basic rate of pension, has been increased from £5 10s. a fortnight to £7 a fortnight since have much to say about it. That is a ihe Government parties' joint policy speech was delivered in 1949 Our promises were fulfilled when these increases were made last year. Since this Government assumed office the whole of the Eepatriation Act has' been overhauled and anomalies which had existed in it for many years have been removed. I shall refer to anomalies that have been mentioned in another place by tbe Minister for Eepatriation (Senator Cooper). I know, because I live in close proximity to two military hospitals, that ever since World WarI . some men have been practically confined to their cots or wheel chairs. If they could stumble along for 20 yards or so they were not eligible to draw the special recreational transport allowance which was given to those who were completely confined to cots or chairs. That anomaly has been removed, and the men that I have mentioned can now draw the special allowance. Moreover, provision has been made for the gift of a sedan car to ex-servicemen who have lost both their legs above the knees, and to those suffering from paraplegia from the waist down. That has not been done anywhere else in the world. In England the authorities make a car available to such men, but it remains the property of the Government. In Australia, this Government has made gifts of cars to such unforto the severity of their disability. I tunate men who fall within that category. Now, twelve months later, the Government has introduced this measure to make provision for increases of pensions that have, in fact, been favourably received by all ex-servicemen. Increases are to be made to those classes of pensioners who are in most need of additional assistance I dependent upon their pension and allowances for subsistence. It is proposed to increase the special rate pension that is payable to ex-servicemen who are totally and permanently incapacitated, to the more serious cases of tuberculosis, and to amputees. In those instances, the rate of pension will be increased by £1 15s. from £7 a week to £8 15s. a week. The honourable member for Parkes, when moving his amendment, was gracious enough to mention that he was satisfied with that increase. However, he did not very generous increase. Next, the rate of pension payable to war widows with children, widows who are over the age of 50 years and widows who are permanently unemployed, will be increased by £1 -2s. a week. That pension will be made available by way of a domestic allowance. I point out that these pensions payments are not subject to income tax. At the same time, no restriction is imposed upon the amount that war widows may earn. These benefits together with those that were granted last year and which I have already mentioned, are clear proof that the Government parties are honouring the promises that they made in their joint policy speech during the general election campaign in 1949. The genesis of the amendment is that the general, or base, rate of pension has not been increased. The honourable member for Parkes reminded us that the Labou* Government in 1947 refused to increase the base rate. The Eeturned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia has made representations to all honourable members to support an increase of service pensions by £1 a week. All ex-servicemen, who are disabled as a result of war service, receive this benefit. They receive an increased percentage of the base standard rate according shall repeat some figures that the honourable member for Oxley (Dr. Donald Cameron) cited. Approximately 168,000 pensioners are within the category of the base pension rate and their percentages of the base rate range from 5 per cent, to 100 per cent. Of that number, the disability of 95,000 is assessed at 25 per cent, or less of the base rate. That means that if the Government increased the base rate by £1 a week, the vast majority of service pensioners would receive increases that -would range from 2s. to 5s. a week. Whilst numbers of general rate pensioners are suffering disability, the fact, remains that 99.9 per cent, of them are in full employment. I am firmly of the opinion that no class of repatriation benefits should be related to the basic wage. Indeed, the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia has always contended that such benefits should be regarded solely as payments made in respect of disabilities that have resulted from war service. However, as the majority of service pensioners are in full employment they enjoy all increases of the basic wage and cost of living allowances as ordinary employees in industry. At a time when the Government has presented an austerity budget to the Parliament, it is appropriate that the most generous treatment should be given under this measure to service pensioners and war widows who are in most need of assistance. The league has always kept their interests -to the forefront. I agree with the honourable member for Oxley that the league is a wonderful organization. I am proud to be a member of it. However, I must express my regret that it chose to link benefits payable under the Repatriation Act with the basic wage. That is a complete departure from the principle :that the league has always observed in the. past. I regret that the league also chose to apply what I regard as a pressure campaign to members of the Parliament. As many honourable members are members of the league, there is no danger that the views of that organization will be overlooked in any matter that relates to its interests that may come before the Parliament. Whereas in 1950 the Labour Government expended £20,500,000 on repatriation benefits, last year this Government expended £27,500,000 under that heading; and this year it is estimated that it will expend £33,250,000 for that purpose. Thus, the Government, during the two years that it has been in office, has increased annual expenditure on repat3Ir. Timson. riation benefits by approximately £13,000,000. That is a wonderful record. I shall have nothing to do with the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Parkes, and all the coaxing in the world on the part of that honourable member and of his colleague, the honourable member for Grayndler, will not sow the slightest seed of doubt in my mind that the additional benefits to be made available under this bill bave not been distributed to the best advantage. adjourned. Sitting suspended from 5J55 to 8 p.m. MEAT. Commerce and Agriculture) -by leave I take this opportunity to thank the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), who is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, for his courtesy in agreeing to an arrangement under which I am able to make a statement in explanation of the recently concluded long-term meat agreement with the United Kingdom. On the 17th October last, the Parliament was given an outline .of the main features of the fifteen-year meat agreement that I recently signed in London on behalf of the Australian Government. Beef, veal, mutton and lamb are the meats that are covered in the agreement. There will be a separate snortterm agreement for pigmeat. When the Chifley Government was in office, an undertaking was reached with the Government of the United Kingdom that there 'should be a fifteen-year agreement for the sale of meat by Australia to that country. However, because of the time factor, no substantial progress in the development of an agreement had heen made until the present Government came to office. Australian live-stock and meat interests, through their representatives on the Australian Meat Board, have at all times, approved the principle of a fifteen-year meat agreement. This Government has brought them into consultation at all stages of the negotiations. Representatives of producers and processors on the board have been kept informed of all proposals that have been made by the United",65,Francis
210,Debate (On Motion By Mr Joshua),,67,Francis
211,Mr Mcewen (Murray,"Minister forKingdom and the Australian Government and have, themselves, advanced their own suggestions. In short, producers and processors have been parties to the negotiations. The Australian Meat Board, by a substantial majority, also approved the provisions of the agreement. I shall now refer briefly to the viewpoint of the United Kingdom. The necessity for meat rationing, the policy of the Government to reduce the cost of meat to consumers by heavy subsidy and the fact that there is a different level of prices of meat for their home producers and for meat from the Argentine, Australia and New Zealand, all are factors which, in the present circumstances, to enable rationing and equalization of prices and subsidy, necessitate that the Government shall be the purchaser of meat. That is why, apart from questions of political philosophy, the circumstances of the moment virtually force any United Kingdom government into the government-buying of meat. However, one of the most important aspects of the current agreement is that, although it provides initially for governnient-to-government selling and has a duration of fifteen years, of an alteration of the exchange rate it expressly, and in detail, embodies provisions to enable a reversion to ordinary trader-to-trader business when the United Kingdom Government wishes so to revert. The contract guarantees that, for sixprovision again introduces quite a novel teen years, we shall be assured of a buyer protection in contracts between Australia for the entire surplus production of meat, and the United Kingdom. no matter how great the surplus for export may be, and, at all times, the sale the annual prices which are to obtain for prices will be at levels which will ensure a the various kinds of meat, there is a profitable industry. The contract protremendously important provision in the vides that, even on the reversion to tradercontract by which floor or minimum to-trader selling, if the trade by chance prices are stated for six-yearly periods should not offer to buy the whole of the with new, successive floor prices agreed Australian surplus production, the British to in the middle of each six-yearly Government will be obliged under the conperiod, so that, in the result, the minitract to take the full amount. There is mum price will at all times be known for a completely novel and unprecedentedly six years ahead. That provision is advantageous provision which has the designed to enable individual producers effect that, on a reversion to trader-toor governments to plan with confidence trader selling, if the prices that are .capital expenditure for production and obtained are higher than those which developmental purposes. The value of would have been the prices under the that security both to producers, governgovernment-to-government sale provisions ments and prospective lending agencies of the contract, then Australian prowill also be recognized as highly valuable. ducers will get the benefit of such higher Prices will be declared for each year's prices. If , however, trader-to-trader selling price levels would be lower than under the price formula of the contract, then the British Government engages to make good the difference. Furthermore, in such circumstances, the price deficiency would be made good, not after sale to the United Kingdom, but by a previously announced export subsidy that would carry the advantage into the auction yard. This would establish that price level not only for meat exported to the United Kingdom, but also for all stock that was sold for slaughter in Australia. This, as I have said, is a most novel and extraordinarily advantageous provision, and is quite without precedent. The contract is written in sterling .currency. However, the formula of price determinant, to which I shall refer -shortly, is in terms of Australian costs of production, and, therefore, while the payment will be in sterling, the price adjustments will be the outcome of cost calculations made in Australian currency. This provides a safeguard to Australian producers, and there is a provision in the contract that, in the event, during the currency of a meat year for instance, there shall be an immediate review of the implications for the industry from the stand-point of the profitability of the price. The effect of that Quite separate from the provision for production. The actual price will be the outcome of movements in the cost of production. The cost-of-production price formula will include an adequate element of profit incentive. The contract is designed to provide for annual prices at a level that will be quite adequate for the continuance and expansion of our live-stock industry. The prices are not the outcome of bargaining against the prices that the United Kingdom is paying to the Argentine this year. squeezed out of the United Kingdom through the action of the Argentine in withholding all meats for months, until the United Kingdom's meat ration was reduced to an all-time low level. Neither the Government nor producers' representatives ever sought to use, as a measuringtaken, having regard to the availability stick for our price requests, a price so enforced upon the United Kingdom. Nor is the price the outcome of a comparison with that paid by the United Kingdom to its own home producers. That price disregards all ordinary economic factors and has been designed to ensure the maximum home production of meat, regardless of cost, to provide the equipment or materials. maximum safeguard against the perils of blockade, which, twice in our lifetime, has reduced the United Kingdom people to such dire straits. Nor is our price the outcome of a comparison with the price levels that are pertaining in North America. . The price level for meat there, which is approximately three times our own levels, goes with a minimum wage that is equal to from £30 to £40 a week in Australian currency. The economist can say whether the price in North America goes with the wage, or the wage goes with the price; but, inevitably, the two are associated. It has been calculated that the North American price for beef, if it were established in Australia, would produce an upward adjustment of t in basic wage of 15s. a week for beef alone. Neither the Australian producers' representatives nor the Australian Government has sought to aggravate our present inflationary problems by applying such a comparison to our price requests. As I have said, the price will be at a level that is designed to ensure a profitable and continuously expanding industry. Under the contract, irrespective of whether sales are to the British Government or trader to trader, there will be absolutely no interference with the ordinary traditional processes of livestock selling or meat processing that have always obtained in Australia. The only meat that comes under the agreement is that which meat exporters themselves choose to offer for export. The Australian Government undertakes to plan Such prices were such programmes, and do such things as are calculated to produce an increasing quantity of meat for export, but there is an acknowledgment in the contract that the Australian Government must be thc judge of the order of importance and urgency of the works that can be underof our resources of man-power, materials and equipment. The relationship between the availability of equipment of all kinds and the volume of production is acknowledged, and the United Kingdom Government, in turn, engages to use its best endeavours to increase the availability from all sources of such essential The relationship between prices, and the volume of production, or, in other words, the measure of the price incentive, is acknowledged, and the Australian Government may represent to the United Kingdom Government that a price higher than that which emerges from the ordinary formula will produce a greater quantity of meat. The United Kingdom will then be the judge of whether or not it wishes to pay such higher price in order to secure the additional quantities. The principal operative terms of the contract may be stated as follows:Prices have been agreed for this year's meat. The contract commences next year. This year's price of beef will be 3^d. per lb. sterling, which is about 4£d. per lb. in Australian currency, higher than the price a year ago. Lamb prices will be increased by 17^ per cent., and mutton prices by 15 per cent, for the higher grades, and 10 per cent, for the lower grades, above last year's prices. Tha 1950-51 prices will be the minimum for the first six years for beef, and the minimum floor for the first three years for mutton and lamb. The actual price",67,Francis
212,Mr Mcewen.,"above this floor will be the prices for this present year, plus or minus such cost movements as occur but not below the floor price. Any cost increases up to 10 per cent, will be applied in full. When cost increases exceed 10 per cent., there is provision for a small area of negotiation, either higher or lower, than the actual amount of the cost increase. The price that is so determined will be operative as representing the obligation of the United Kingdom Government in the event of reversion to trader-to-trader selling. There will be, as has been customary, sales to the colonies and other sterling areas with the approval of the Ministry of Food. Those sales will be on a traderto-trader basis, totalling about 25,000 tons of carcass meat per annum. Provision has been reserved for selling 3,000 tons, or 3 per cent, of the exportable surplus, whichever is the greater, in dollar or hard currency areas. I am confident of the success of this contract, which offers the prospect of greater quantities of meat for the British people, and of security and profit to the Australian meat industry, and which is so designed as to enable the reversion to trader-to-trader selling, without loss of advantage to the peopk and to economies of both our countries. The Australian Government earnestly hopes that advantage will he taken of this arrangement by Australian producers, individuals and companies-to embark upon a great programme of increased production, and so contribute to one of the most urgent needs of the United Kingdom. Debate resumed (vide page 2172). support the amendment of the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) and I ask all honourable members to do likewise. Some of the most glaring evils in history have been tolerated, not for short periods, but for hundreds of years. The most obvious example is that of slavery, which was practised ih the early Greek and Roman civilizations and was condoned and accepted throughout the mediaeval ages and until comparatively recent times. The human habit of accepting evil practices without protest derives from the habit of looking too much to the past instead of to the future. I consider that many honourable members who have participated in this debate have been prone to dwell too much on past events when applying their minds to repatriation problems. The honourable member for Higinbotham ( Mr Timson), for instance, appeared to accept complacently one of the greatest evils of modern Australian history. All honourable members have a special responsibility in relation to the treatment of disabled ex-servicemen and war widows. The honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) has reminded honourable members of election promises that were made to these members of our community. I believe that election promises should always be honoured. But very much greater responsibilities than were implied in those pledges rest upon honourable members. The recipients of the repatriation benefits for which the bill provides are not numerous and, therefore, do not constitute a significant voting force. Many of them have lost much of the fire of life; some of them are totally and permanently incapacitated. Their voice is not a loud one, and most of them are tolerant persons. War widows are even less numerous than are the disabled ex-servicemen and also are less articulate. Every honourable member should have regard for that weakness and do his best to ensure that they shall be treated with justice and equity. I strongly commend the honourable member for Moore( Mr Leslie) for his non-party approach to this measure. The task of providing repatriation benefits is continuous; it is passed on from government to government. Unfortunately, in my opinion it has never been tackled properly by any government. We should define a common policy for all political parties that may be pursued without interruption by succeeding governments. Even at this late stage, we should regard the enactment of repatriation legislation not as the achievement of a desired result but merely as the commencement of a programme of justice. Therefore, I appeal to honourable members to look to the future. We should look to the past only in order to",69,Francis
213,Mr Joshua (Ballarat) [8.15],"Istimulate our imagination with the object of improving, our outlook. The first principle that wo should fix firmly in our minds in dealing with this subject is that repatriation benefits are a form' of compensation, not pensions. This Souse recently considered the subject of compensation for employees of the Government. It should approach repatriation measures in the spirit in which it dealt with that subject. Our first object is to provide adequate compensation for ex-servicemen who made great sacrifices for their country. It is necessary for me to emphasize this point because there has been a great deal of confused thinking on the part of many honourable members, who appear to believe that social services benefits and repatriahonorable members from time to time in tion benefits fall in the same category. Nothing could be further from the truth. A great deal has been said in this chamquiries, we have acquired a general ber recently about various proposals for thc abolition of the means test in relation to social services. Every honourable member should be aware that, should the means test be discontinued, social services benefits will be available to every member of the ''community. But only those citizens who have suffered as a result of war service can be eligible for repatriation benefits. Should repatriation benefits and social services be confused, a peculiar situation would arise in the event of the means test being' abolished. A wrong principle would have been applied. The second principle that should be kept in mind is that repatriation benefits should be adequate. Who will dare to define adequate compensation for the loss of a leg or an arm, or the destruction of a man's health in the process of serving his country? What monetary provision could compensate a widow for the loss of her husband? Any attempt to fix cash values for suchsacrifices must inevitably lead to serious errors. There is only one way in which this difficulty can be overcome, aud it has never been properly tried. That way is to ask the citizens who are eligible for compensation to express their views on the subject. I believe that all honourable members will agree that the men and women who are entitled to this form of compensation have just as strong a claim on treasury funds as have the whea.tMr Jonhvn. farmers', for instance. Who would deny, to the wheat-farmers the right to express their views in relation to the price that they should be paid for their product? Yet the repatriation legislation contains no provision for the representation of war. 1 widows or incapacitated ex-servicemen on any assessment tribunal. Their representatives should be able to meet representatives of the Treasury and discuss the subject in detail, so that a firm policy could be recommended to the Government. They should he asked to express their wishes because it is most important that they should be satisfied. What compensation payments have the various classes of beneficiaries under the Repatriation Act sought to obtain? Various organizations that they have formed have written to all order to express their opinions. By that means and as a result of our own inidea of the benefits that they claim. They have not asked, as might have heen expected, for fantastic rewards. The sky is not the limit in their view. In fact, their requests have been extremely modest. The honourable member for Higinbotham wrongly deplored the fact that the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Impei ial League of Australia had selected the basic wage as a measure of its requirements for the compensationof repatriation beneficiaries. The league sought to fix a standard that might be used for all. time. As we are only too well aware, the value of money changes from time to time and, therefore, some variable standard is needed. I think that all honourable members will agree that the minimum rate that should be paid to totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen is the basic wage. My investigations have suggested to me that the Government has had some regard for that standard in determining the rates for which, this bill provides. An incapacitated ex-serviceman with a wife at present receives £7 a week plus £1 10s. 6d. a week for his wife. That rate has applied for the last twelve months. The average of the basic wage during the last four quartershas been exactly £9 a week. Therefore, the totally and permanently incapacitated ex-serviceman with a wife began the year with a pension and an allowance that amounted approximately to the basic wage. However, his repatriation income lagged well behind the basic wage by the end of the twelve months period. The Government now proposes to increase the pension for the man to £8 15s. a week but to leave the allowance for the wife unchanged at £1 10s. 6d. a week, which seems to me to be an extremely strange decision. The combined total of £10 5s. 6d. a week will exceed the basic wage in some States, but will be slightly less than the basic wage in New South Wales. Everybody must be aware that the basic wage will soon be increased again and, when that happens, the totally incapacitated ex-serviceman and his wife will be receiving less than the basic wage once more. The bill should include some provision that would enable the rate of pension to be increased according to basic wage increases. Various honourable members have agreed recently that the pension rate should not be less than the basic wage. The Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J*. Harrison) agreed that the policy of the former Labour Government had been that automatic increases of pensions to accord with the increases shown in the "" C "" series index was not desirable from the Treasury's point of view. He said that it was better to fix the amount at the commencement of the financial period, and to review it from time to time, as the Treasury officials knew where they stood under that system. T consider that the amount should be fixed at a higher level than is proposed. An increase of £1 a week above the increase proposed would add £1,000,000 to the war pensions bill. Based on the Minister's own calculations the total cost of the increase would then be £2,250,000 instead of £1,250,000. NowI turn to benefits for war widows. It appears to me that not only this Government but also governments in the past have feared that war widows might get too much by way of pension. I consider that a principle should be laid down whereby any mistakes in relation to this matter should be made on the right side, which is the side of the war widows. I should much prefer that war widows would receive too much than that they should, have, to rely on the pension rate they have been, receiving for far too long. I consider that war widows should also receive"" the basic wage, and I make that statement after having had a number of talks with totally and permanently incapacitated, ex-servicemen who were, unfortunately, expecting the day to come when their wives would be widows. They told me of their fears of what would happen after their deaths in relation to their commitments, such as mortgages on their homes, which they were able to meet but which their widows, who would be on reduced incomes, would find it hard to meet. Many of those incapacitated soldiers asked me to advance a proposition for the establishment of a death benefit system for them, so as to ensure some degree of security for their widows and enable them to meet any debts that their deecased husbands might have left behind. There are obvious difficulties in relation to such proposition, and it seems that the best method of dealing with the matter would be to ensure that the widows should have an adequate income after their husbands had died.. I repeat that war widows should receive the basic wage. I have consulted, a number of war widows in relation to that proposition, and have found that they are more modest than I am in that respect, and are asking for less than I have suggested. Their request is for a pension of about £8 10s. at present values, which would be equivalent to the. present basic wage minus the amount that it would cost to feed their husbands were they still alive. The. niggardly £5 2s. proposed in the measure is inadequate. The pension paid to war widows has always been inadequate and it is time there was a complete revision of ideas on the matter. War widows still have homes to maintain, and without the help of their husbands. I was astounded this afternoon, when we were debating the Broadcasting Bill, to find that war widows are not to enjoy the benefit of the special listener's licence fee that other pensioners are to enjoy. The cost of a listener's licence for war widows is to be increased from £1 to £2, whilst the cost to all other service pensioners is to be only 10s. It seems that the war widow is the object of considerable neglect in that matter. War widows should not be required to live in poverty. When I say poverty, I really mean poverty. It is a poverty that they cannot overcome, because they have no means of supplementing their incomes. What chance has a widow with three children of supplementing her income by working in industry? Honourable members opposite have spoken of young war widows who can get jobs at good wages. I remind them that 35 per cent, of war widows have remarried, and thus many young widows have been removed from the class of war widows with which this bill deals. There has been astonishing lethargy in relation to the war widows' pension and the time for review has long passed. The Government proposes to increase the expenditure on this pension by £1,250,000. I contend that it should expend £5,000,000, so as to provide war widows with this minimum amount that they seek. Partially disabled ex-servicemen were left out of consideration when the bill was drafted. soldiers and other ex-servicemen who suffer from disabilities and are, for the most part, incapable of progressing in life because of their war injuries. Everybody knows the kind of jobs they have to take. They have to work as lift attendants or newspaper vendors or in other dead-end occupations. Very few of them occupy positions in such professions as school teaching, where their war disabilities would not be a bar. Their disabilities place them at a disadvantage in every way. They use their compensation, as I prefer to call their pension, to supplement their earnings, which would otherwise be inadequate, or to provide themselves with amenities, such as motor cars, to make up for their disadvantages. The only ones who receive a 100 per cent, pension are very sick or are quite incapable of doing anything but part-time work. Because they have been ignored in this measure their standard of living will be reduced, and it will continue to be reduced as the cost of living increases. Tho Government deserves condemnation for this delihprate failure to improve the conditions of these men, who have given so much in order that our ifr. Joshua. freedom and security may be preserved. They have asked for a mere increase of £.1 a week. I believe that they should receive half the basic wage, whatever it might be at any time. An increase of £1 a week, as far as I cau make out, would involve an additional expenditure that would not exceed £2,000,000. It took me a long time to work out that figure, because the Minister did not give us any basis on which to work when he presented the bill, hut omitted the matter entirely. The total amount of the increases that should be given under the bill is approximately £8,250,000 instead of the £3,250,000 proposed. If ever there was a time when those increases should be given, it is now. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) recently attended a country show at Clare, at which he said that we are experiencing unprecedented prosperity. Prosperity for whom? For the war widows and the totally and permanently incapacitated and disabled oxservicemen? Is there any likelihood of prosperity for them under this These are limbless bill? Honourable members opposite have claimed for a long time that we are experiencing a great degree of prosperity. If we are, then it is high time that some of it was dealt out to ex-servicemen. I invite honourable members opposite to remember their obligations to the ex-servicemen and their widows, which I set out at the beginning of my speech. I wish them to consider very carefully of what use it is to begin the monthly meetings of their returned servicemen's organizations, for which they have expressed so much regard, or a garrulous beer party, with the words, "" Lest we forget"". Of what use ia it to hold dawn services and ANZAC Day parades, and to sayAt the going down of the sun and in thc morning we will remember them. It, is of no use at all, unless we remember them here and now at the Seat of Government. I ask every honourable member opposite to support the Opposition's amendment. If they will do so nobody here will be churlish enough to try to make any party political capital out of the fact. I have listened with interest to the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr on the committee was that the pensions Joshua) and was rather intrigued when I heard him say that he considered that we are living too much in the past. We can study the past and gain benefit from the study of it. As a member of the committee that was established in this House by the late John Curtin, when he was the Prime Minister, I can profess to know something about repatriation benefits. All the members of that committee had served and been wounded on the field of battle. They were able to present to this House a unanimous report which, be it said to the credit of Mr request on to the House, that pensions Curtin, was endorsed almost unanimously by the House. I agree with the honourable member for Ballarat that this matter should not be made a party one. But would anybody who had listened to the speeches in this chamber to-day say that it had not been dragged down to the party level? The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) misled the House when he submitted his amendment, although I would not go so far as to say that he did so wilfully. He quoted a statement from the policy speech of 1949 in which the present Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) said that justice would be done to ex-servicemen. The honourable member claimed that that promise had not been fulfilled, but he omitted to inform the House that only twelve months after the Government was returned tc office a larger increase of pensions than had ever been given before in the history of this country was proposed by the Government and agreed to by the Parliament. months' promise. months' promise that was fulfilled, and I say to the honourable member for Parkes that the Government that he supported had eight years in which to do such things and neglected to do them. ber has just stated that the late John Curtin did them. which is a long time ago. That committee invited evidence from every returned servicemen's organization, and the one thing that the witnesses impressed should not be related to the basic wage. honourable member take notice of the returned servicemen's organizations now? who is wiser than the honourable member for Phillip( Mr Fitzgerald) is speaking, it would be better for that honourable member to remain silent. Then he might be mistaken for a wise man. Returned servicemen's organizations asked the committee, and it specially passed their should not be related to the basic wage. What is a war pension? It is some compensation for a war disability and has nothing to do with the basic wage. As a matter of fact, after war pensions were first introduced the cost of living decreased and the pensions were not reduced. In later years, after the cost of living had increased, a review of war pensions was made, and although the cost of living had increased by only 11 per cent, according to the Commonwealth Statistician's calculations, we increased pensions generally by 20 per cent. for Corangamite should demand an apology for that interjection. unnecessary, because I have been long enough here for the House to know whether I am speaking the truth or not. The honourable member for Watson( Mr Curtin) has been in this House for only a short time but during that time he has demonstrated that he is wholly irresponsible. I have received many letters from various branches of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia and I am a member of that, league of 32 years standing. A covering note has been forwarded with some of the letters almost apologizing for sending them and stating that the writers had been told by the State branch of the league to keep in touch with their federal member. My reply to these men is that their State branch was one of the",70,Repatriation Bill 1951 Second Reading

223,Mr Timson,The honourable member,74,Repatriation Bill 1951 Second Reading
224,Mr Mcdonald,"That is quitebodies responsible for the fact that the pension was not related to the basic wage. It is proposed in the bill before the House that the totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen, war widows and the children of ex-servicemen shall receive substantially increased pension rates. The charge from the other side of the House has been that thousands of men on a part pension will receive no increase. Let us consider the case of a man such as myself on a small pension. DoI need an increase as much as does the man who is totally incapacitated or the widow who has a family to support? I believe that the great body of returned servicemen are completely satisfied with what the Government is doing. I am convinced that when this matter has been fully explained to them they will realize that the Government has granted increases to those people whom it believes to be in need of assistance. It is not true that the average ex-service pensioner for. This Government has done that to who is in full employment and who receives the increases of the basic wage requires an increased pension. member so angry? It is necessary for me to talk loudly because irresponsible members .continue to interject. I place the honourable member for Watson in that category. able member for Watson must refrain from interjecting. able member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) admitted that totally and permanently incapacitated pensioners have received good treatment under the repatriation legislation but he and other honourable members opposite made the mistake of saying that those pensioners arc gradually diminishing in number. Nothing could be further from the truth. Their number is increasing year by year as war injuries catch up with them and more of them find that they are totally unable to undertake any employment. If those men who are in receipt of a part pension have to go into a repatriation hospital as a result of war injuries they immediately receive the full pension in respect of the time during which they cannot work. I believe that this issue has been used hy several Opposition members for purely party purposes. The honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) tried to demonstrate that the tongue is mightier than the sword when as asbed Government supporters to remember those ex-servicemen whom they represent. He rightly pointed out that about 70 per cent, of honourable members on this side of the House are ex-servicemen. I venture to say that they have the complete confidence of the average ex-serviceman outside this House. I do not believe that the ex-serviceman wants anything to which he is not entitled. I believe that he recognizes his responsibility to the community. One of the main objects of the returned servicemen's league is "" that widows and their dependants shall be adequately catered an extent never before equalled by any other government. I admit that I should like a repatriation committee to be set up continually to review pension rates in the light of changing circumstances. But at the same time. I refuse to agree that men who have proved hy their war service that they recognize their obligations to the community have walked out on their fellow diggers. Tho subject before honourable members is of the utmost importance. The amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) proposes that the base war pension shall be increased from £3 10s. to £4 a week. Under the Government's proposal there will be no adjustment of the base war pension, which was fixed at £3 10s. in October, 1950, and will remain at £3 10s. until the next budget is introduced. All the hate in the world which the honourable member for Corangamite debate will not alter the fact that when making his policy speech the present Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) made a substantial reference to the value of money in connection with pensions rates. The right honourable gentleman then said that the Government would sympathetically review allowances, particularly",74,Repatriation Bill 1951 Second Reading

230,( Mr Mcdonald) May Introduce Into This,"[15 NOVEMBER, those 'that 'are related to disability or to war widowhood, in the light of all the circumstances, including any fall in the value of money. TfI were to contend that the Government had done nothing for ex-servicemen I should be a liar. If I were to ignore the very valuable amendments to the Repatriation Act which the Government introduced I should .misrepresent the facts. But it is not possible to ignore the fact that over the last fifteen months money has continued to deteriorate in purchasing power at a staggering rate. The base war pension was fixed at £3 10s. in 1950 and it is not proposed to alter it in November, 1951. The Opposition has proposed that it shall be increased by at. least 10s. a week. ""The cost of doing that would be only £2,000,000 a year, whilst a budget surplus of £114,500,000 has been estimated but will probably prove to be more than £200,000,000. The fall in the purchasing power of money is the reason why a tribunal has been set up to review parliamentary salaries. If there is a case for the adjustment of members' salaries because of the lower purchasing power of money there is a case for the adjustment of the base war pension. If there is no case for accepting the amendment of the honourable member for Parkes there is no case for a tribunal to consider an increase of members' salaries. That is an inescapable moral argument. It is pointless for ''Government supporters to direct accusations of insincerity against Opposition members. Eveni f we all are hypocrites and liars that does not absolve the Government from the responsibility of considering the amendment on its merits, irrespective of the motives of its sponsors. The Opposition amendment was drafted by a special committee of the Labour party which consisted almost entirely of ex-servicemen from the Senate and the House of Representatives, including one ex-prisoner of war. The action that has been taken by the Government in the past to adjust the various service pensions is acknowledged and not derided by the Opposition, but that action does not constitute a reason for .refusing to extend the 1951.] Repatriation BiU 1951. '218J same justice 'to the great hulk of ex-servicemen who receive the base waT pension. The returned servicemen's league has written to all honourable members, irrespective of party, or of whether or not they are ex-servicemen, and the request it has made should be seriously considered. It is useless for the honourable member for Corangamite to state that some people .have sent these requests reluctantly because their State branches have asked them to do so. Opposition members recognize that the league has not asked that war pensions be related to the basic wage. The statistics which it cited were not used as an argument in favour of relating the pension to the basic wage. It merely cited the basic wage adjustments as a measurement of the variation of the cost of living and it is .hypocritical to contend that ex-servicemen are not concerned about whether or not the pension is related to the cost of living. The statistics cited by the league are .unanswerable. They show that in 1939 the war pension of £2 2s. was more than half the basic wage, which was £319s. The pension is now £3 10s., which is less than half the basic wage of £10 10s. The accusation-of insincerity comes very badly from honourable members opposite, a committee of ex-servicemen from the ranks of whom made certain requests to the Government which were not accepted. It appears that those honourable members will now vote against the amendment, which contains similar proposals to those which they placed before the Government. Government supporters interjecting, you, I apologize. I am judging you on what the newspapers have published. able gentleman will address me. bers opposite intend to vote against their own convictions I shall not deride them for doing so. The rejection of a government's money bill is a serious matter and even if they disagreed strongly with the basic war pension rate nobody could expect them to throw their government out of office on that issue. However, I plead with them to impress on the Government",75,Repatriation Bill 1951 Second Reading

233,Mr Beazley,"If honourable memin their party meetings that it should accept these or similar provisions and introduce corresponding amendments in die .Senate, -where its defeat would not be involved. The case for war widows has been eloquently put by the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Joshua). There is also a strong case for the adjustment of Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme allowances. The honourable member for Corangamite was probably right in saying that the totally and permanently incapacitated men are increasing in number and that therefore a real monetary problem is involved in their case. But the number of Commonwealth reconstruction trainees is not increasing. It is diminishing, and a generous adjustment of their allowances would serve as a recognition of the startling way in which the State universities have increased the fees that they charge students. There is a very strong case for a more generous adjustment of these allowances than has been proposed by the Government. The honourable member for Parkes, in proposing his amendment, has demonstrated a concern for war pensioners which is completely genuine. In supporting the amendment the Labour party considers that if the salaries of honourable members should he adjusted to the cost of living the basic war pension also should be so adjusted. wish to refer to the speech which the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr member for Bradfield ( Mr Hughes) was Daly) made this afternoon in which he paid special attention to me. The honourable member paid me a great compliment when he said that while the present Government parties were in Opposition I fought viciously for the returned servicemen and had voiced their case in no uncertain manner at every opportunity. I appreciate that compliment from the honourable member. what he said that I did, but. I was not able to obtain any worthwhile result. When the last Labour Government was in office it turned a deaf ear to my entreaties on behalf of the permanently and totally incapacitated soldiers and of ex-servicemen generally. not consider ex-servicemen except on one or two occasions when it made increases of 5s. a week. AlthoughI fought hard for ex-servicemen the results of my efforts were practically nil. The Labour Government seemed to have no sympathy with ex-servicemen. The honourable member for Grayndler adopted rather an abusive attitude to-day. He said, "" The honourable member for Mallee is like a tame tomcat"". able member withdrew that remark. say that one of the characteristics of tomcats, is that they fight at night, and that, although I listened quietly to him this afternoon, I am full of fight at present. Since this Government came to power I have not had reason to fight for the ex-servicemen as before because I have been satisfied that the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Cooper) has shown a sympathetic appreciation of the problems of ex-servicemen. In order to appreciate what this Government has done for ex-servicemen, it is well to remember that in June, 1939, the cost of war pensions was £7,750,000. In June, 1949, it was £18,750,000; in June, 1950, it was £20,500,000; and in June, 1951, it was £27,500,000. The estimated expenditure on war pensions from September to the 30th June, 1952, which will not be a complete financial year, is £33,250,000. The totally . and permanently incapacitated ex-serviceman's pension was first instituted in 1920. It was then £4 a week. The present right honourable Prime Minister at the time of its introduction. In 1943 that pension was increased to £4 16s. a week. In 1947 it became £5 Is. a week and in 1948 £5 6s. a week. Therefore, from 1943 to the 10th December, 1949, successive Labour governments raised it by only 10s. a week. This Government has been in power since the 10th December, 1949, and I certainly did in less than two years it has raised that pension by £3 9s. a week. That is a complete answer to the charge of the honourable member for Grayndler that, T have not been pressing the case of the e\-servifennn. In 1920, the base pension was £2 2s. a week. In 1.939 it was It did £2 2s.: in 1943 it WPS £2 10s.; and in 1948 it was £2 15s. Therefore, from 1943 to",76,Repatriation Bill 1951 Second Reading

236,Mr Turnbull,"I only want to the 10th December, 1949, during a period when prices were rising, goods were scarce and there was a strong blackmarket in this country, successive Labour governments raised this pension by only 5s. a week, [n 1950 this Government increased it by 15s. a week after having been in office for less than one year. To-day the basic pension is £3 10s. a week. The -Government has stated that it has increased pensions in accordance with the plan that it has laid down for its present budget. It has also said that it will review the ex-servicemen's pension should circumstances arise which in its opinion make such action necessary. The basic pension remained static for four years under the regime of a Labour government. It is less than twelve months since this Government increased that pension. I have discussed this matter with the Minister for Eepatriation, and I say that at this time, while people are talking about the privileges enjoyed by members of the Parliament, one of my greatest privileges is to be associated with the honourable senator who is Minister for Eepatriation. RecentlyI was responsible for his visiting Mildura, where there are more ex-servicemen engaged in primary production in a small area than is the case anywhere else in Australia. He went there to open the local agricultural show. While tives of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, the local Legacy Club and the local repatriation authorities. Senator Cooper spoke to them in his quiet, convincing way for nearly three-quarters of an hour. There was not one interjection during his speech and when he had completed it they said to him, "" We can understand the position now. what you have said into writing and send it to us so that we can read it to our branches, we shall be satisfied "". I have not received one letter of protest from, a returned serviceman Honourable members interjecting, that a deliberate attempt is being made to interrupt the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull). There have certainly been too many interjections and they must cease. I shall not warn honourable members 'again, but shall put into effect Standing Order 303. letters from branches of ex-servicemen's organizations in my electorate which have admitted that they have written under instructions from their head offices. I am sure that that has been the experience also of other honourable members. I say that well knowing that members of those branches are listening to the broadcast of the proceedings of this House to-day. able member shall not refer to listeners. service men and women should get the best possible deal, and I am pleased to associate myself with the honourable memin his advocacy of the appointment of an all-party committee to watch closely increases of the cost of living so that ex-servicemen may get immediate benefits by means of pension, increases and thus avoid financial embarrassment. This bill does not need much debate once we understand its fundamentals. Perhaps the main fact about it is that although an increase of the 100 per cent, basic pension and a rise in the total and permanently incapacitated pension have not always been associated they there he met representaare not associated now. It should be remembered that the Chifley Government did not associate them. That government increased the totally and permanently incapacited ex-servicemen's pension without increasing the basic pension, and this Government is doing exactly the same thing. There was no hubbub about the Chifley Government's action, and the bill to effect the If you _ will put alteration went through the House on non-party lines. But because the Opposition believes that it will get some petty party political advantage it has moved the amendment. Honourable members opposite know that there is no chance of its being carried. If I voted with the Opposition I should be one of the most despicable persons in Australia for the simple reason that I know that the amendment cannot possibly be carried and that some paltry advantage that I might get by",77,Repatriation Bill 1951 Second Reading

241,Ber For Corangamite ( Mr Mcdonald),"making a show of voting for it would not do my conscience any good. The honourable member for Grayndler paid tribute to honourable members on this side of the House when he said that 75 per cent, of them are ex-servicemen. That is quite correct I have been invited to vote with the Opposition. Do honourable members opposite think that I would leave this illustrious company of ex-servicemen and cross to their side of the House where a returned soldier is a novelty? [9.10] -Unlik e the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull), I do not approach this matter hopping mad, like a tomcat or otherwise. The passage of the bill may have very serious consequences, not so much for the honourable member McDonald), who because of his lucrative salary may feel that his pension is sufficient, hut for the ex-servicemen who have lost their jobs as a result of this Government's policy. In the future they will have to depend more and more on the war pension that they receive I am concerned because I have not yet heard a Government supporter offer any real opposition to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen). Let honourable members on the Government side get to their feet and speak about the several parts of the amendment one by one and tell the people and the ex-servicemen the real reason why they are opposed to them. I suggest that the real reason for their opposition is that they are under the whiplash of the party. Let them say why they believe that war pensioners of all types should not share in the proposed increase. Let them say that they object to the inclusion of the basic war pension in the list of pensions that will be increased. It cannot be said that the pension cannot be increased because of lack of money, because the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) is budgeting for a surplus. The honourable member for Corangamite referred to a committee of ex-servicemen that was appointed by the late John Curtin to bring down a report which was later adopted by the Government. Why does not this Government do the same sort of thing? The reason is that despite the fact that 75 .per cent, of Government supporters may be ex-servicemen, threy are not worried about pensioners outside this House. I had hoped that when the honourable member for Corangamite rose-to his feet he would give a lead to the Government. He knows that an all-party committee recommended an all-round 20 per cent, increase of pensions. He must also know something of the beginnings of repatriation in .this country. When a repatriation system was first introduced into Australia there was no pattern in any other country of the world to guide the pioneers. The men who initiated repatriation in 1915 were not ex-servicemen, but they had the interests of those men at heart. Mr Denison Miller and Mr Samuel for Corangamite ( Mr HoTdern, both of whom were later knighted, were two of the pioneers. Men like that formed an organization ahd initiated the first repatriation benefits. In 1916, it was found that they could not do enough to help the returned men, and so a government organization was established. In 1916, representatives of the Australian Government and of the State governments met to form what ultimately became the first repatriation fund committee. Subsequently in 1916 an act was passed in order to finance benefits to ex-servicemen of World WarI . That was done because it was found that the system under which funds for repatriation purposes had previously been distributed from a central source to the States, did not achieve uniformity in respect of the benefits that were payable in the various States. Consequently, the Commonwealth took over absolute control of repatriation matters. That reform was hastened as a result of a meeting of the special committee that was held in Melbourne. It is significant that the Commonwealth had implemented its scheme, which marked the initiation of repatriation benefits as we know them to-day, twelve months before hostilities in World WarI . had ceased. As that scheme was introduced primarily in order to establish equality of treatment of ex-service personnel throughout Australia, I challenge supporters of the Government to give one valid reason why the",78,Repatriation Bill 1951 Second Reading
242,Mr E. James Habbison (Blaxland),"Government should not accept the amendment to this measure that has heen sponsored by the Opposition. There is no need for honourable members opposite to extol the Government for what it has done in the interests of ex-servicemen. Every honourable member is prepared to give it due praise in that respect. It may be all right for the honourable member for Corangamite to say that service pensions should not be related to the basic wage. I challenge him and his colleagues to say that they do not believe that service pensions should not be related to the existing standard of living in this country. It must be clear that unless such a relationship is established, pensioners will not receive equitable treatment and their pension will lose much of it3 value.. In 1920 pension was payable to a totally and permanently incapacitated ex-serviceman at the rate of £4 a week and. bejdso received ISs. a week in respect of his wife, making their combined income £4 18s. a week. Is not that figure significant when we remember that the basic wage at that time was£4 8s. 6d. a week? Furthermore, there was every indication that that wage would remain static. In that year the government of the day expended £7,500,000 for repatriation purposes, or an increase of £1,500,000 on the expenditure that had been incurred under that heading in the preceding year. Thus, when supporters of this Government boast about the huge amount that it is making available for repatriation purposes, they forget that the-Government is budgeting for a surplus of £114,500,000 for the current financial year. I repeat that in 1920 a totally and permanently incapacitated ex-serviceman and his wife received a combined pension that was 9s. 6d. a week in excess of the basic wage at that time. le t us examine the claim of supservice pension as a means of enabling porters of the present Government that them to maintain themselves in a reasonit is doing a marvellous job under this able state of health. measure. A totally and permanently incapacitated ex-serviceman and his wife will receive a combined pension the day in 1920 meted out to ex-serviceof £10 5s. a week, which is 2s. a week men brought about a better understanding less than the present basic wage in New between ex-servicemen and other sections South Wales. Those facts justify me in of the community. However, it is clear recalling the position that existed in 1920. that one effect of the paltry treatment I was astonished when the honourable of ex-servicemen under this measure member for Corangamite said that ex-servicemen display no^ loyalty to the ! leadership of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia. That observation is not true in respect of the league in New South Wales. Unfortunately, we are now faced with the fact that for the first time in 31 years the ex-servicemen of Australia are being sold out by their national Government, which isdenying to them repatriation benefits to which they are justly entitled. I agree with the honourable member for Corangamite that repatriation benefits are made available to ex-servicemen solely in recognition of their war service. If anything, the amendment now before the Chair does not go nearly far enough. Indeed, ex-servicemen's organizations have been pressing the Government for more generous increases of benefits. However, the Government is penny-minded. That is why the Opposition has proposed this amendment; and I cannot understand why supporters of the Government, 75 per cent, of whom, it is claimed, are ex-servicemen, oppose it. In effect, those honourable members contend that ex-servicemen who have suffered disability as a result of Avar serviceare not now entitled to a pension that would give to them, a just proportion of the cost of living, their right to Avhich has always been recognized in the past. That is the purpose of the amendment. Furthermore, I can. see no reason for the objection of honourable members opposite to making increases of benefits, even at the levels proposed by the Government, retrospective to the 1st July last. It is all very well for the honourable member for Corangamite to say that he is satisfied with the rate of pension that he receives as an ex-serviceman. I inform him that there are many ex-servicemen of World WarI . in my electorate who depend upon their The treatment that the government of will be a falling off of enlistments for tbe armed services. I am astonished that supporters of the Government should adopt the attitude that, because they are in receipt of a salary of £1,500 a year, they do not want their service pension to be increased. Unless the Government is prepared to accept the amendment or to emulate the example that was set by a Labour Government by appointing an all-party committee of ex-servicemen to make recommendations with respect to this measure, it will not fulfil the promises that it made to the people. Surely, that is little enough to ask the Government to do in the interests of ex-servicemen. Indeed, could a government do less? Some honourable members opposite have also claimed that Labour governments had really done nothing in the interests of ex-servicemen. honourable member for Corangamite boasted about the fact that he was a member of the all-party committee of ex-servicemen that the Curtin Government appointed to advise it in respect of repatriation matters as a whole. And he also took pleasure in the fact that that Government adopted all the recommendations, including those for increases of pensions, that that committee made. The reason why pension rates were not related at that time specifically to the basic wage was that it was the policy of that government to maintain a decent standard of living in the community. Furthermore, it was generally believed that the basic wage would remain practically static. Thus, ex-servicemen were practically guaranteed protection against a possible recession in the post-war years. This Government should have the decency and courage to appoint a similar committee to advise it in respect of the proposals embodied in this measure. Would any honourable member suggest that if such a committee were appointed it would not recommend that the rates of service pensions should be related to the actual cost of living? members opposite should cease quibbling about what the Government has done for ex-servicemen. Let them tell the Parliament and the people why they refuse to accept the amendment that we are now considering. servicemen that they are not entitled to Mr E. James Harrison. increases of their pension rates or to have such increases as have been granted made retrospective to the 1st July last. I rise to speak on this measure in order to correct certain statements that were made by the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) with respect to the Government parties ex-servicemen's committee of which I have the privilege to be secretary. The honourable member for Blaxland( Mr E. James Harrison) has just issued to supporters of the Government a stirring challenge which I deem it to be my duty to accept. In the present circumstances, the Government is unable to increase the base rate service pension. One has only to examine the budget proposals to find the justification for that statement. However, Yet, the this is a matter not of entitlement of the ex-servicemen to increases of pensions, hut of the Government's capacity under present conditions to finance such increases. I listened with great interest to the speech of the honourable member for Blaxland, because I know that he brings to this House a wealth of knowledge about the industrial affairs of this country, and that he believes that Australia has a bright future. But his statement that enlistments in our Services will decline because the Government has not been able to increase the base rate pension is, to my mind, tantamount to accusing the average Australian of being a person whose support can be bought. I have said before on this issue that 1 believe that the onus of defence rests mos't properly upon the shoulders of every man, woman and child. Until we find the courage to face that fact, we shall be guilty of maintaining, in effect, an immoral practice. My belief in that respect can he sustained very simply. There is no difference between the feelings of a mother in Arkansas, in the United States of America, and in Birmingham, in England, and those of an Australian mother. We may as well Honourable realize that fact as a team, because it is the truth; and if it be proper for a man from Arkansas or Birmingham to be conscripted for service with the United Nations forces anywhere in the world, then it is most proper for AusLet them also tell extralians, man for man, to share the same",79,Repatriation Bill 1951 Second Reading
243,Mr Ghaham (St. George) [9.28],"onus in direct ratio. Any honourable member who denies that principle is, in my opinion, guilty of an immoral practice. The honourable member for Blaxland made a number of trenchant attacks on the honourable member for Corangamite this House as a man who served his country well in World WarI . , and has represented ex-servicemen very effectively onus of governing the country rests most in this Parliament. ber for Blaxland did not attack the honourable member for Corangamite. ber for Blaxland implied that the honourable member for Corangamite was guilty of "" begging the word"", so to speak, when he said that ex-servicemen's organizations did not wish to relate pensions to tive of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and the basic wage. I can only say that those organizations have repeatedly considered that problem, and have expressed the view that a period of low living standards and low wages is the time in which an ex-serviceman has the greatest need of his pension. That is why, during the years of the great economic depression from 1930 to 1934, ex-servicemen's organizations refor his decision. The man who controls frained' from' attempting to have the base rate pension related to the basic wage. The statements that have heen made in this debate by the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen), the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly), the Joshua), the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) and the honourable member for Blaxland would have been equally true in 1932, 1933 and 1934. Therefore, I consider that there is no need for .me to pursue that matter further. Obviously, the approach to this issue must be based upon the interpretation of the word "" compensation "". The committee of which I have the privilege to be the secretary made representations to the Government on behalf of the base rate pensioner. We considered then, and we still believe, that a case could be argued for the base rate pensioner. The Government replied, "" We are budgeting for a surplus. We are increasing taxation. The base rate pensioner is not in dire necessity, and, in fact, is not in necessitous circumstances."" Therefore the Cabinet, in its wisdom, decided not to accept our submission for an increase of the base rate pension. Confronted with that decision, we can either support our leaders, or indulge in some gross form of desertion. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Tom Burke), who is interjecting, knows as well as I do that the properly upon the shoulders of those who are administering it. in the past of criticizing decisions of the former Prime Minister, the late Mr J. B. Chifley. I accused him in 1949 of having let the soldiers down. A telegram was sent to him from the federal execuAirmen's Imperial League of Australia asking him whether or not the Government would grant an increase of pension for totally and permanently incapacitated members, widows, or base rate pensioners. The answer that the executive received was "" No"". I believed that the then Prime Minister had every justification the destiny of the country carries upon his shoulders a great and terrible responsibility. We must admit that fact. not reside in the Cabinet. all the wisdom resides in the Cabinet, and I do not imply that wisdom may, in a great measure, reside between one pair of shoulders. But I believe that responsibility rests with the Cabinet, whether or. not all the wisdom does. Prom that point, we come to the facts. The Cabinet has announced that it . will not agree to increase the base rate pension, and has given for that decision certain reasons, all of which are associated with Government policy. The attempt by the Opposition to persuade ex-servicemen on this side of the chamber to desert the Government, and cross the floor of the House, is sheer humbug and hypocrisy. Of course, ex-servicemen who are members of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party issued a similar challenge to ex-servicemen who . are. of. the Labour party",81,Repatriation Bill 1951 Second Reading

House. 1 can give all the details' of the career of every ex-serviceman who sits behind the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies). Thc statements by Opposition members that we lack courage is utter nonsense. The honourable member for' Blaxland, when he attacked, by implication, the honourable member for Corangamite, did an injustice, not only to that honourable gentleman, but also to himself. He also referred to the establishment of the Repatriation Department about 30 years ago, and recalled the lack of uniformity of administration that was evident in those early days, and, in doing so, he was basically right;, but he overlooked the fact that ex-servicemen's pensions origiments of the honourable member for nally were related, not to the basic wage, Blaxland, and I believe that the honorbut to their rate of pay. All honourable gentlemen are familiar with the fact that the Australian soldier was paid 5s. a day in World WarI . a member of one of the forces in those days. The Australian soldier in World WarI . was substantially better off than was the soldier in the Imperial Forces. a day. tralian soldier in World WarI . received £2 2s. a week and, in addition,, free medition is paid to an ex-member of the cal and dental, treatment, his uniform, and forces for the loss of an eye, an arm, or all the other good things that were associated with his service career. All those factors were considered when the rate of the original pension was calculated. The government of the day said, in effect, "" We shall relate the pension not to the basic wage, but to the serviceman's do things that cost money, let us provide pay. We shall grant a pensioner £2 2s. a week."" The totally and permanently incapacitated members and the sufferer from tuberculosis are in a vastly different ment has budgeted for a surplus of position from tliat of many other pensioners because they are dependent upon the pension that they receive for their maintenance. The pension that is payable to other groups is compensation for their efforts and sufferings on behalf of this country. While I am discussing that particular point, I should mention that I . cannot believe that, the honourable member for Ballarat. and the honourable member, for Parkes really consider that some people relate compensation, to their capacity to fight. Such a view simply does not make sense. I . am sure that I misunderstood those honourable gentlemen when they dealt with that matter. The average Australian will fight in this country, because he is a part of it. We. do not accept for one moment, theidea that the average Australian thinks of the reward that he will get in return for what he does. gentleman's responsibility to see that those servicemen shall get it. to the best of my ability, with the stateable member for Ballarat is reasonable enough in saying that it is my responsibility to see that ex-servicemen shall get a just and proper return. Therefore, I shall move on to the point that was made by the honourable member fbr Parkes, when he referred to the application of the means test. Of course, the honourable gentleman is a journalist by profession. He is a man of some acumen, and is facile in the use of words. I believe, that when he dealt with the application of the means test to pensions, he did not state the truth. No means test is applicable to the pension of an ex-serviceman.

The implication that the surplus of £114,500,000 will be tucked away as a nest egg is sheer political humbug. The honourable member for ' Ballarat made particular reference to war widows and totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen. PerhapsI misunderstood the honourable gentleman, but I considered that his reference to the prayer that is recited at 9 o'clock in most sub-branches of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia was most unfortunate. The rate of pension is a money problem, a governmental problem, and a decision to be made by the Government, which abides by its decisions. When the honourable member infused emotion into a matter of that description, I thought that the situation became almost Gilbertian. A very sacred minute was almost reduced to the atmosphere of the stage. I thought that it would be said, "" Look, here is something that can be put on the stage. It is most effective "". honourable gentleman would not like it. ber for Ballarat is justified in making that statement, but I wonder whether he, in his heart, really meant it. I can only say to him, with respect, that, in my opinion it came very close to sacrilege. will change so that it will be able to reThe honourable member for Fremantle mentioned the salaries of members of this Parliament and the advice that the Prime Minister had tendered to the House. Ho said that we should pursue the same trend of thought in relation to war pensions as we had adopted in relation to our own salaries. There is no relationship between the two subjects, and I am sure that the honourable member for Fremantle does not think otherwise. On the one hand, we have in this chamber 123 membersfine men and true-and , on the other hand, we have 168,000 disabled war pensioners, thousands of war widows and a number of totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen. There is no relationship between the two categories, and the argument of the honourable mema defeatist ber for Fremantle was merely another demonstration of the use of words by an expert in order to cloud the issue. Honourable members on this side of the House are unhappy about the fact that the Government has not been able to find the additional sum of £4,000,000 that would be necessary in order to give effect to the Opposition's proposal. However, we believe in the inherent right of the Government to decide what shall be done. The onus rests entirely upon it. Members of the Opposition solidly supported their late leader in 1949 when, as Prime Minister and Treasurer, he announced an exactly similar decision' without giving any explanation. No honourable member is justified in attacking the decision of the Government without having full knowledge of the facts associated with its budgetary problems. To deny to it the right to make decisions in such matters is to resort to political humbug. I am grateful for the fact that, even though the ranks of Tuscany opposite continue to be vocal, the young ex-servicemen on this side of the House, whose record will bear comparison with that of any body of ex-servicemen in the world, as I am able to testify, have been able to withstand the attacks of the Opposition and have realized that they must do their duty. I remind the honourable member for Parkes that less than three years hence there will be a general election. I hope that, in the interim, some of the adverse factors that now affect the Government view the situation of the base rate war pensioner and compensate him more adequately, than he is compensated at present for his disabilities. We cannot escape from the fact that, of the 168,000 war pensioners, 125,000 are classified as being less than 50 per cent., unfit. That means that they receive not more than 50 per cent, of the base rate pension. man must not argue in that way.

262,Mr Graham,"I do not argue that the Government has decided to do the best that it can do in present circumstances. The Opposition cannot make out a valid case on moral grounds for any furthei improvement on the pretext that we are experiencing a condition of great prosperity. It is astonishing to hear honourable members opposite speaking in this debate of the high degree of prosperity that the country is enjoying. During the last fifteen months, we ha vie become wearily familiar with their ""chattering, Spandau"" screaming about the reduced value of the £1. But in the last few hours they have changed the tune in order to assert that Australia is now experiencing conditions of unparalleled prosperity. Minister says. remind the honourable member that the Premier of New South Wales, Mr James McGirr, made a similar declaration last Christmas. Therefore, we are justified in treating with scepticism the parrot-cries that the Opposition has repeated over and over again during the last eighteen months about the reduced purchasing power of the £1. Repatriation benefits cannot be assessed able member for Corangamite ( Mr merely in terms of money. The gauge must be the capacity of the country to pay, and the decision in that respect must rest solely with the government of the country. Everybody acknowledges that no country can pay to its ex-servicemen the full benefits to which they are entitled. I have a close association with blinded and tubercular ex-servicemen, to whom I am greatly devoted. I am acquainted with their senior officers, a.nd T admit that the honourable member foT Parkes spoke truthfully when he said that it caused me pain to acknowledge that, under present conditions, nothing could be done to improve their circumstances. The Opposition has failed from the outset to realize that the Government made the only proper decision when it resolved to pay all the extra money availvarious ex-service organizations had no able for war pensions to totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen and war widows with children. I do not know of any ex-servicemen who would not say, in the circumstances, "" Give them the lot"". I commit every member of the ex-servicemen's committee of the Government parties to f u l l support of the bill. ment supporters are obviously making eery heavy weather of their attempts to excuse the failure of the Government to make adequate provision for war pensioners. The promises that were made by the present Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) in 1949 have tumbled one by one about the ears of his followers. Therefore, it is not astonishing that they appear to be distressed when they try to defend the indefensible decision of the Government in relation to war pensions. Various allegations have been made about the conduct of the Labour party on this issue in former years, and I shall deal with them. Repatriation benefits were instituted in 1920. The original rates were not increased until 1943, when the late John Curtin, as the Prime Minister of the day, took action to meet the just claims of ex-servicemen. AntiLabour governments had been in power for nineteen of the twenty-three years that had elapsed since the introduction of repatriation benefits. They neglected plenty of opportunities to help ex-servicemen during those years. Yet the honorMcDonald) had the audacity to ask, ""What did the Labour party do during its eight years of office ?"" posal is too brief to enable me to relate the full record of the Labour party's achievements on behalf of ex-servicemen. The information would fill a book. The Labour party is proud of the legislation that was enacted for the benefit of war pensioners and ex-servicemen generally when it was in power. It re-established over 500,000 ex-servicemen in excellent positions in civil life after the cessation of hostilities in World War IT. The honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) declared that the officers of right to speak on behalf of the ex-servicemen of Australia as a whole. I have here various communications of a legitimate character that demonstrate clearly that the claims made by such officials are well justified.

266,Mr Kekwick,What did it do?,85,Repatriation Bill 1951 Second Reading
267,Mr Costa,"The time at my disGeorge( Mr Graham) said that tha amount of compensation paid to disabled ex-servicemen should be determined according to the capacity of the nation to pay. If ever a nation was in a position to pay generous benefits to ex-servicemen, Australia is in that position now! The Prime Minister has admitted that we are experiencing a condition of unexcelled prosperity. Details of the national income that were announced by the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Padden) recently support that claim. Therefore, justice demands that we shall be liberal in our treatment of the men who made it possible for us to experience that prosperity. The income dividend of the nation in 1949 was £2,267,000,000,000. In 1950 it increased to £2,724,000,000,000, and this year it has increased further to £3,593,000,000,000. Thus, it has increased by over £1,000,000,000,000 sincthis Government .came into power. The Prime Minister boasted of these facts when he went for a jaun't through Victoria recently. Let him now fulfil the promises that he made to ex-servicemen before he was elected to office so that they men, an opportunity to prove their sinmay share in the general prosperity. One of the communications that I have received from organizations of ex-servicemen was addressed to me from the ANZAC Memorial, Hyde Park, Sydney, and bear the signatures of prominent officials of the Eeturned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia. It points out that the relationship of the war pension to the basic wage to-day is lower than it has been at any other time. In 1920, the base rate pension represented 47.5 per cent, of the basic wage. In 1930, the ratio was 47 per cent., and in 1940 it was 49 per cent. When the Labour party increased the rate of war pension in 1943, the ratio increased to 50 per cent. In 1948 it had again declined, because of inflationary tendencies, to 46 per cent. In 1950, after this Government had granted an inadequate increase, the ratio was 48 per cent. In August of this year, due to the failure of the Government to carry out its promises to halt inflation and to put value back into the £1, the ratio had declined to 36 per cent. By this month it had declined to 33 per cent, of the basic wage. So the war pension to-day from the point of view of purchasing power is at the lowest ebb that it has ever been at. Yet the Prime Minister boasts of our great prosperity. He is failing to share that prosperity among the people who made it possible for us to enjoy it. The communication that I have mentioned was signed by the following important officials:Mr A. J. Chambers, federal president and New South Wales State president of the T.B. Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Association; Mr J. Harris, federal and New South Wales president of the Limbless Soldiers Association; and Mr P. J. Quinnane, federal and New South Wales president of the Partially Blinded Soldiers Association. These men stated in their letterSurely it is not too much to ask Parliament to intervene on behalf of the disabled ex-service personnel of our country. We earnestly invite you to do so. The Opposition's amendment will give to Government supporters, who claim that they. wish to do much for ex-servicecerity. Another communication that I have received came to me over the signatures of Mr G. W. Holland, the federal president and Mr J. C. Neagle, the general secretary of the Eeturned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia. Accompanying it was a chart which indicates the relationship of the war pension to other benefits and the basic wage. It shows that the age pension has risen by 200 per cent, since 1939, that the basic wage has risen by 153 per cent, in the same period, but that the basic war pension has risen by only 67 per cent. The officials who sent that communication to me have been described by the honourable member for Higinbotham ( Mr Timson) as pressure groups. In effect, he has referred to the federal executive of the Eeturned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia and the State executive of that association by that epithet pressure groups.

271,Mr Costa,"I say that they are notFederation, honourable members opposite, like the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden), would respond to it quickly, as they are responding to such pressure day after day. Those men have asked me to do something in this House on behalf of the members of their association and that is what I intend to do. The letter statedWe regret the necessity for the attached pamphlet. Having failed in our endeavours to secure the Government's recognition of the case for a general increase in the basic war pension rate after exhausting all reasonable methods of approach, we now submit the matter to the judgment of all members of the Commonwealth Parliament All members! I know that Government supporters have had similar communications, but it suits them at the moment to ignore them. The Labour party will not do so. The letter continuedThe claim is based upon the falling value of sioners after that basic wage increase, the f 1 and its effect upon all war pensioners. I have related the decline of the pension to the fall of the value of the £1, which is receding at such a rate that it will soon reach zero. The Prime Minister intimated in his policy speech in 1951, that his Government would review repatriation benefits and allowances, especially in the case of war pensioners who, because of their very severe incapacities, are more or less dependent on their pension as a means of livelihood. reviewed them. very good job of it. Most of these people are dependent on their pension as a means of livelihood. Many such pensioners in my electorate are in that position. The Government has done something for totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen, but not so much as its boasts would lead one to believe it had done. In 1948, when the Labour party was in office the pension was £5 6s. a week, and the basic wage was £6 2s. a week. The £1 then was the Chifley £1, which could buy more than can be bought for the Menzies £1 now. The difference between the pension and the basic wage was then 16s., and the pension represented 86 per cent, of that wage. Before the 1948 increase was made it represented only 73 per cent, of the basic wage. In 1950, when the rate of pension was increased to £7, the basic wage was £7 6s., so the pension was 96 per cent, of the basic wage. Before that increase was given it had fallen to 70 per cent. The rate now is to be £8 15s. compared with a basic wage of £10 7s., so it will be 85 per cent, of the basic wage. Due to the failure of the Government to honour its promise to put value back into the £1, the amount of the proposed pension increase has already been rendered nugatory, and the pensioner will be no better off, because the value of the increase must be determined in relation to its purchasing power. At the present rate of decline the £1 will buy less for a pensioner in future than it has bought hitherto. Experts have predicted that the next quarterly adjustment of the basic wage will raise it by 25s. a week. ""What will be the predicament of those penparticularly when the effects of the tragic budget have become a part of the prices structure. Pensioners will find that they have never been worse off in their lives. I commend the Labour party's amendment to the. House. It provides that the proposed increases shall operate retrospectively from the 1st July and that all pensions schedules shall participate in the proposed increases. A principle that is applied to all industrial awards is that relativity shall be maintained. It is right that that principle should be followed in this instance. The amendment also provides for the inclusion of the base war pension in the schedules and for the increase in all categories to be at the same percentage rate. I appeal to Government supporters to show their sincerity in relation to the claims of ex-servicemen by voting for the amendment. I rise to support the bill and to oppose the amendment; and because the honourable member for Blaxland( Mr E. James Harrison) challenged us to do so, to state our reasons for opposing the amendmentI propose to state my reasons. As I have said before in this House, I hate very much to have to criticize a man because he is not a returned serviceman.

We have been told by the honourable member for Blaxland that for the first time in 31 years the returned servicemen have been sold out by their fellows in this Parliament ment is again repeated. I propose to prove that there is no sell-out of returned servicemen under this' bill. They have been sold out in this Parliament by honourable members who to-day are very critical of ex-service members of the Government. sold out everybody in this country. about interjections, particularly from persons like the honourable member for Watson( Mr Curtin) who are to me as babes lost in the woods. The honourable member for Blaxland said that the pension of £1.0 5s-. that totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen uow receive is not adequate, yet he has the colossal effrontery to support the amendment, and to ask Government supporters'why they too do not support it. Paragraph (d-) of the amendment seeks to insert in the bill a provision for the increase in all categories to be at the same percentage rate. The pension for totally and permanently incapacitated pensioners is to be increased by 25 per cent., and if that proposal were adopted it would have to be reduced so as to enable provision to be made for the base rate pensioners. The Opposition has mentioned two other figures to-night. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) suggested that an increase of 10s. should be made in the base rate. Honourable members of. the Opposition apparently wish to reduce the amount payable to the totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen in. order to distribute more to others. For. that reason I will not support the amendment and I am astonished that it has been submitted. The history of some bonorable members opposite would not bear very much investigation. I claim that the application of the means test to [71] a war pension would do a more beastly injustice than would failure to increase one category of war pensions. It is arrant political humbug for the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen), in view o£ his attitude in the past, to introduce this amendment. In 1947, this House debated the Social Services Consolidation Bill 1947 to which an amendment had been moved by a colleague of mine who was' then a member of the Opposition, the purpose of which was to remove the means test from war pensions. At. page 3187 of Hansard of 1947 the honourable member for Parkes is reported as having saidGovernment has I think that tlie Minister ought to make a statement' on this point. It is not a matter of"" party politics but of coming to a decision. Some tune ago an assurance was given in respect of the matter now at issue. I stake I do not worry my position on this issue and I feel that an adjustment ought, in all decency, to be made. Concessions have been granted in other directions, but not to ex-servicemen. The then Opposition strongly supported the amendment proposed on that occasion. I maintain that a man's actions are what count. Although the honourable member for Parkes had said that it. was not decent to have the means test applied in connection with the war pension, when the then Opposition forced the matter to a division, he voted against the amendment. that an amendment would, be introduced in the Senate. honourable member voted against the amendment that was proposed by the then Opposition. The honourable criticized the. returned servicemen on this side' of the House. Yet he cast hi? vote against the amendment proposed in 1947 after having spoken in favour of it. The honourable member for Parkes has stated that the then Government"" intended to introduce an amendment in the Senate.

297,Mr Hamilton,"Honorabl e memthe honourable member for Fremantle suggested that it should be 10s.; and the amendment implies that it should be 25 per cent. There are 168,000 ex-servicemen in receipt of the base rate pension, whilst 98,000 receive a pension of from 10 per cent, to 25 per cent. An increase of the base rate pension by £1 would result in an increase of from 2s. to 5s. a week to pensioners who receive from 10 per cent, to 25 per cent. If the base rate pension were increased by the 10s. suggested by the honourable member for Fremantle, those pensioners would receive an increase of from Is. to 2s. 6d. a week. It would be a good idea if Opposition members reconciled their conflicting ideas before proposing an amendment. That is the advice which they tendered to members of the present Government parties when they occupied the Opposition benches. Do they not realize that the majority of ex-servicemen who are in receipt of the base rate pension are working? Those men do not wish their pensions to be classed as a "" needs "" pension. They regard it as compensation for their disabilities. Returned servicemen's organizations have always been opposed to having war pensions regulated by reference to the basic wage. Opposition members have gone haywire in the arguments they have advanced concerning the relationship of the pension to the basic wage because the determinations of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court have been based not on the needs of the family group but on the capacity of industry to pay. That has thrown the matter out of proper perspective and the general rate seems to be relatively lower than it actually is. The On-position is trying to make party political capital out of this amendment because the percentage of men who receive a 100 per cent, pension is very small. If their disabilities become worse they can immediately receive the rate of pension prescribed for those who are totally and permanently incapacitated. Honourable members opposite should be ashamed of themselves for trying to relate the general pension rate to the basic wage. During this debate they have repeatedly said that the Government has done nothing for ex-servicemen. Since this Government assumed office on the 10th December, 1949, it has done things the doing of which Labour governments would not entertain during their eight 1 years of office. For instance, it has removed the pension bar in respect of a wife or child of an ex-serviceman of the 1914-18 war who married after the 1st July, 1938. Any incapacitated ex-serviceman of that war who did not want to become a burden on any woman and therefore postponed his marriage until after the 1st July, 193S, was denied by the Labour Government a pension for his wife or children. This Government has removed that disqualification. It has also removed anomalies in the application of the means test to ex-servicemen when they sought sickness and unemployment benefits under the Social Services Consolidation Act. It granted to war widows, upon re-marriage, a gratuity equal to one year's pension. The previous. Labour Government refused to do that. The Opposition has accused the Government of having done nothing when the only thing it has not done is increase the base rate pension. The Labour Government refused to grant a pension to the wife or children of a permanently unemployable ex-serviceman, or one suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, who had married after the 2nd October, 1931. Last year this Government granted the pension to the wives and children of such ex-servicemen. Tin1 Labour Government refused to provide motor cars for ex-servicemen who had had both legs amputated above the knees or who were paralysed from the waist down. This Government gave them motor cars. During the three years that I was in opposition the Labour Government talked a lot but did little. Less than twelve months ago this Government granted an increase of the general rate of pension by 15s. a week. In 1941 and 1948 no increase was granted by the Labour Government. To-day, ex-servicemen still enjoy that increase of 15s. a week. The special claim put to me and to other honourable members by the general president of the returned servicemen's league was for an increase of the general pension rate for aged ex-servicemen of the 1914-18 war. We tried' to ascertain now many men wero in that category. can now get a 100 per cent, war pension plus a 10 per cent, service pension, or a 50 per cent, war pension and a service pension of £2 os. a week. That means that the aged ex-servicemen of the 1914-18 war have already had their pensions increased. Because of the increase granted last year it has heen decided that there need not be an increase' this year.. This Government will never lose sight of the claims a>nd interests of ex-servicemen. 1 regard it as incumbent upon me to refute some of the allegations made by the Opposition during this debate. It has been said that this should not be a party political matter. I remind the Opposition of the pamphlet produced by the Labour Government in OctobeT, 1949, ju^t two months before the general election of that year. That publication was full of party political propaganda. I am glad to be able to say to-day that the present Ministei"" for Eepatriation, who receives a pension in respect of service in the 1914-18 war, issued a new pamphlet, which did not contain any party political propaganda. 1 oppose the amendment because it is based upon political humbug and is really designed to reduce the totally and permanently man's pension. Theincrease granted to the totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen is £1 15s., which will raise his pension to £8 15s. The pension in respect of his wife will be £1 10s. 6d. and lis. 6d. will be paid for one child, plus child endowment. Therefore, the total amount that such an ex-serviceman will receive will be £11 2s. If such a pensioner has a wife and two children he will be paid £12 12s. 6d. War widows with children, or more than 50 years of age, will receive an increase of £1 2s. a week. children aged ten, thirteen and fifteen years, will receive £10 Is. there is no means test applied to those pensions. I do not say that that is sufficient, but it is a lot more than waa ever given by a Labour Government. This Government has awarded the greatest increases that have over been given to ex-servicemen and their dependants, and it ill becomes the Opposition Mr Hamilton. to submit an amendment of this natureSuch men which is really designed to reduce thepensions of war widows and"" totally and: permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen.

303,Motion (By Mr Townley) Proposed,"direct attention to a matter that concerns both the Department of Social Services and the Department of Repatriation. Hundreds of persons throughout Australia suffer from deformities that have resulted from accidents. I have in mind particularly persons who have been crippled and who are having great difficulty in obtaining surgical boots. I shall refer to two cases to which my attention has been directed. The first is that of a lady, one of whose legs is from 6 inches to 9 inches shorter than the other. She has been carrying on her work as a housewife under that handicap for the last sixteen years. I have endeavoured to obtain a surgical boot for her in Tasmania, but in the course of making exhaustive inquiries I was informed by a boot manufacturer that in that State there is only one craftsman who is engaged in making surgical boots. He also informed me that he did not think that throughout Australia there would be more than ten craftsmen who are now engaged in making surgical boots. The work is highly skilled and technical, and involves infinite patience. It is a tragedy that no apprentices are entering the trade because higher wages are offering in more interesting callings. The Minister for Social Services( Mr Townley) should examine this serious problem. I am glad to be able to say that the Department of Repatriation is doing a magnificent job on behalf of many crippled civilians. However, the number of such civilians is becoming too great for that department to cope with. The department has a factory in each of the capital cities which is engaged in the making of artificial arms and legs, surgical boots, splints and appliances for limbs and also in effecting repairs to such artificial requisites. In the four years from 1947 to 1950 inclusive, those factories made a total of 128,753 items within this category, of which 5,646 of all types have been for civilians. I am concerned particularly with surgical boots. In four years, the factories of the Repatriation Department made 27,915 surgical boots for ex-servicemen, but only 368 for civilians. It is not the fault of the Repatriation Department that the number of surgical boots thai have been made in its factories in that period for civilians is so low. Many civilians require surgical boots of various kinds, and an average production of 90 a year is completely inadequate to meet their needs. The number of employees in the six departmental factories at the 31s1 December, 1946, was 150, and four year* later, it had increased to 184. Australia will need increasing numbers of surgical appliances and artificial limbs, because of its growing population and the dreadful toll of road accidents. It is not possible for the six factories which are controlled by the Repatriation Department to supply the Australian demand for surgical appliances. I urge the Minister to investigate the possibility of new craftsmen being trained by the Department of Social Services for this technical work Perhaps annexes to the departmental factories-can be constructed in which men can be trained to make surgical appliances of all types for our injured, crippled and deformed people. It is a heart-rending spectacle to see. as I have seen, a mother trying to do her housework when one of her legs is nearly 9 inches shorter than the other. I have been endeavouring, so far without success, to obtain a surgical boot for her. Some time ago, I referred to her plight in a broadcast that I made, and a gentleman in Melbourne sent me a cheque for £10 with which to purchase a boot. I have not asked the Repatriation Department to supply that article of footwear, because the cost is'beyond the means of the woman and myself. Honourable members may not be aware that the six factories which are controlled by the Repatriation Department charge civilians for the appliances that they order. Manv civilians cannot afford to purchase artificial limbs. The supply of such appliances should be the responsibility of the Department of Social Services. The factories winch are controlled by tbe Repatr'ation Department should not be overloaded with work for civilians. They are intended primarily to mpet the reoniremp^ts of ex-servicemen. I know that the Minister is sympathetic, and that there are ""11 kinds of almost insurmountable difficulties. If there, are no craftsmen, surgical boots cannot be made. At the present",92,Migration Mr Clyde Cameron
304,Mr Duthie (Wilmot) [10.55],"Itime, the number of craftsmen is insufficient because more attractive jobs are to extend those factories than estaboffering.

310,Mr Swartz (Darling Downs) [11.6j.,"The systematic and scientific methods employed to-day are a different matter from the "" wild-cat"" activities of earlier years. The search has been intensified in the last few years. There are good prospects, for instance, in Papua and New Guinea, where the presence of conditions essential for the occurrence of oil in commercial quantities has been established. On the Australian mainland, the evidence is rather more circumstantial, in that there is almost a complete absence of surface indibeen found in the Lakes Entrance area in cations in the form of distinct seepages to Victoria. The Commonwealth is beginmark the oil-bearing areas. The laborious and slow procedures of geological examination and geophysical testing that show where suitable conditions exist, must precede any drilling operations. Although the absence of any surface oil makes the search more difficult in Australia, it does not rule out the existence of oil. Oil has been found in other countries in areas far removed from seepages. The geological conditions necessary for the formation and accumulation of oil are well known and can be identified and tested by proven methods. These favorable conditions undoubtedly exist in several areas in Australia. There are sedimentary basins in this country which are counterparts of geological formations in oil-producing regions of the United States. Science has evolved methods of "" looking "" below the surface of the ground siderable rate. This is inevitable in a and of recording the strata for thousands of feet by means which can generally be described as geophysical. The sequence is, geological survey, geophysical examinaoil in commercial quantities will be tion and drilling. Promising results have been obtained recently in the north-west basin, 600 miles north of Perth, in Western Australia. After geological surveys extending over about three years,' geophysical methods will he employed to test the structures. The basin contains a thick sequence of marine sedimentary strata from which oil may be formed, together with suitable reservoir rocks and dome structures necessary to imoound and retain oil. Conditions similar to those in the north-west basin also exist in the Kimberley district of Western Australia, approximately 1,000 miles north of Labour Perth. "" Nearly 50 years ago, natural gas was House might, in other circumstances, struck at Roma, in Queensland. A gasoappear so trivial that I should apologize Mr Stoartz. meter was built and the town was lit by natural gas. But the gas suddenly petered out after ten days. Subsequent flows ot gas yielding small quantities of petrol have also cut out, but they have shown that some high quality petroleum occurs in the area. Since the war a two-years' geophysical survey in the Roma area has been conducted. To the north of Roma, at Rollston, a deep drilling test was abandoned recently without result. Lowgrade crude oil in small quantities has ning a geophysical survey of the district at the request of the Victorian Government, while some interest is being taken in Nelson, Victoria, near the South Australian border. So far, about 270 test bores have been put down throughout the Commonwealth and its territories in the search for oil. But the majority were "" wildcat"" schemes. However, even in countries where surface indications are found, the search for oil in commercial quantities is a long and difficult business with usually a high percentage of failures. The finding of oil in Australia is so important to us that we must pursue the search. Our dependence, in peace and in war, on a long and vulnerable tanker lifeline is clear, and is a danger to our defence system. Consumption of petrol and all petroleum products is rising at a concountry of continental size in which primary and secondary industry have rapidly expanded. I feel confident that located in Australia or Australian territory. I recommend to the Government that efforts be made to establish a central authority to co-ordinate the search for oil in Australia with representatives of the Commonwealth and State governments and private enterprise, to speed' up the exploration work.

311,Mr Holt (Higgins,"Minister forto honourable members for it, but it has a -greater significance and importance outside than inside Australia. I shall try to dispose once and for all of certain allegations in the hope that they will not be revived. The subject to which I refer is that of the quality of the food which this Government is providing for immigrants, particularly British immigrants, at the hostels that come under the supervision of the Department of Immigration and the Department of Lahour and National Service. vernment facing a challenge in the High Court on that matter? those allegations. I am not surprised that the honourable member for HindMarsh( Mr Clyde Cameron) does uot desire to hear my reply. However, before I turn to certain allegations which he has made, I recommend to any honourable member who has any doubts about the matter an excellent article which appeared in the Sydney Daily Mirror on Thursday, the 1st November last. A most appreciative article was written by an observer after an exhaustive survey of a number of hostels in Sydney. I shall read only the opening paragraph of it in order to indicate to honourable members the position that has been revealed by an independent examination. The article is published under the heading, "" Women's Interest"", and the sub-heading is, ""Worry Level is Low for Migrant Hostel Women Women in British migrant hostels in Sydney have practically no housekeeping or shopping worries. Families live hetter and more cheaply food around, regarded it as a frame-up. than many Australian ones and have food which has almost disappeared from some local tables. The article goes on to describe conditions at the hostels. I shall not weary the House by reading the remainder of it, but anybody who is interested may read it. The honourable member for Hindmarsh did a little clowning with a couple of pieces of food that he produced in this chamber on the 30th October. I had no intention of replying to what appeared to me to be thoroughly irresponsible charges, which revealed the honourable member at his clowning worse in this chamber. However, I took the precaution of ascertaining the facts in order to satisfy myself. I did not intend to use them in this House, although they completely refuted the charges that the honourable member had made and showed how utterly irresponsible his conduct had been, but he returned to the attack last night. As he is apparently determined to persist until he hears something from me about the matter, I am happy to supply the facta to the House in the hope that they will dispose of the matter for good and. all. When other charges were made in relation to immigrant hostels in this House previously, I issued an open invitation to any honourable member to call unannounced at any time at any immigrant hostel in the electorate that he represents and sample the meal being served there at the time. Several members of tbe Parliament took advantage of the invitation, and I have not since heard a word of complaint from any of them. In fact, I have received appreciative comments from all parts of the House. The honourable member for Hindmarsh came into the chamber on'the 30th October with two pieces of food that he alleged had been provided for a meal at the immigrant hostel at Eosewater on the previous Friday. I had inquiries made, and they revealed various interesting circumstances. The two pieces of food in question had been handed round the Adelaide Trades Hall for several days beforehand. It was alleged at the Trades Hall that they had come from the immigrant hostel at Finsbury, but some of tbe more It reads as follows :level-headed men at the Trades Hall, being acquainted with the background of the individuals who were handing the We know something of the activities of certain Communist elements in relation to our hostels. We have plenty of evidence on that subject. At any rate, there were some level-headed fellows at the Trades HaU who regarded the affair as a fram» j up. They were told that the food had come from Finsbury, not from Eosewater. as the honourable member for Hindmarsh later said. 'The honourable gentleman alleged on the 30th October that it had been served to an immigrant on the previous Friday. In fact, meals of the type that he described, which included apple fritters, were not served at Eosewater or Finsbury on that Friday.",95,Migration Mr Clyde Cameron

313,Mr Holt,"No. I shall deal withThe honourable member's performance was so irresponsible and trivial, in fact, that ordinarily I should not have troubled to reply to it. However, I arranged for the Controller of the Food Services Branch, Dr. Hutchinson, to make a number of surprise visits to hostels in Adelaide. The honourable member for Hindmarsh last night referred to those visits. They were conducted in such a way that not even the driver of the motor car in which Dr. Hutchinson travelled knew in advance which hostels would be visited. Hostels in Adelaide likewise was kept iu ignorance. At this stage, I point out that the Regional Director is a Mr tion ( Mr Holt) marred his defence Chambers, who is the brother of thc honourable member for Adelaide. That fact should be sufficient to convince most honourable members that he is a man to .be respected who will do a conscientious job. For some reason best known to himself, the honourable member for Hindmarsh is conducting a vendetta against the Chambers family. Dr. Hutchinson made surprise visits to seven hostels. Limitation of time will not permit me to read his report in full, hut it will be made available for examination by any bonorable member who wishes to study it. I shall read only the following extract from it : AH the components of the various menus were carefully examined and, in most instances, tasted. In two hostels the soup may have been a little thin, and in another, the peas may have been a little dark, but, on. the whole the meals were of excellent quality and better than those provided at the first class hotel at which I was staying, and, in fact, much better than those that can be obtained in most Australian restaurants and hotels. They were all properly prepared, well cooked, neatly plated and their appearance was colourfor Immigration, I was responsible for f u l and attractive. In many instances, the serves of meat were large and, had they been reduced to one half their size, would have still been adequate. That is the report of a responsible official. will be treated on its merits. The honourable member for Watson( Mr Curtin) places himself on much the same level in these matters as the honourable member for Hindmarsh. They both give about as low a performance as this chamber has ever witnessed. If the honorabltmember for Hindmarsh wants to gain a little cheap publicity by stunting, at the expense of national interest, in a waj that will discourage British immigrants from coming to Australia, although we badly need them, I hope that he will have the courage to take full responsibility for his actions. At least I want other honourable members to realize how much weight should be attached to his charges. -T h Minister for Labour and National Service and the Minister for Immigraof his department by making personal attacks upon the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde. Cameron) and the honourable member for Watson( Mr Curtin). We can decide whether the case that has been presented by the honourable member for Hindmarsh is good or bad on its merits. I consider that the Minister has cleared hi3 departments of any charge of general neglect that anybody may have madeand I am not sure that such a charge has been made, in fact. I was not present when the honourable member for Hindmarsh produced the specimens of what was said to be food that had been served on a particular occasion in a particular hostel. I believe that the persons who are living in hostels conducted by the Department of Immigration and the Department of Labour and National Service are being well fed. I have not the slightest doubt about that as far as the Department of Immigration is concerned, because, as the former Minister arranging for the accommodation of such individuals, and for the provision of all essential services at reception depots, holding depots and other immigrant camps. The Department of Labour and National Service has also always conducted the hostels very well. There is undoubtedly a certain degree of nervous tension on the part of British immigrants who reside at various hostels throughout Australia. This may be a result of their war-time experiences, or it may be a result of being required to live in camps after having come from",96,Migration Mr Clyde Cameron

Originally I intended that those hostels should be occupied by the unfortunate victims of various forms of religious and political persecution who came to Australia from Europe. They, too, had lived in good homes once, but the conditions to which they came in Australia were better than those under which they had been living in Europe immediately prior to their departure. The situation of British immigrants is somewhat different from that of the continental Europeans. Therefore, I ask the Minister to expedite their evacuation from camps as quickly as possible so that they may be assimilated into the Australian community by being placed in new homes. They will settle into the Australian way of life very much more quickly and will he much happier when that can be done. t know that many complaints have been made about the food that is served at hostels. I went with the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) to a meeting at a hostel at Braybrook in the electorate for Lalor only a few months ago. There was a great deal of discussion at that meeting about conditions in the hostel. Much of it was unfair, and motions proposing that the residents refuse to pay board were submitted to the meeting. The honourable member for Lalor and I were present in company with officers of the Department of Labour and National Service and we told the immigrants that, although accommodation conditions at the hostel were not so good as we should like them to be, they were still eating better food than was served in many Australian homes, and that it was up to them to tolerate their conditions and bear with the government a little longer. At the same time. I ask the Minister not to test the patience themselves. of these immigrants for too long. Many of them have experienced uncomfortable conditions during the last severe winter, and I believe they have a legitimate cause for complaint when heating facilities are not provided and when some of the Nissen and Quonsel huts in which they are obliged to live are not protected against wind and rain. On Sunday last, I visited Yallourn, where T addressed a large meeting that condemned the Government's budget. Later, I was asked to inspect the British immigrant quarters there. I saw nothing lo complain about in the dining-room, although the manager, Mr Ford, ia carrying on under great difficulties. As the honourable member for McMillan( Mr Brown) well knows, a great deal of discontent has arisen at the camp because immigrants are required to live in that part of Victoria under what they consider to be unsatisfactory conditions. The husbands have employment, but wives cannot get work there and there is no immediate prospect of obtaining homes. I saw letters that had been addressed to residents at the hostel which promised that improvements would be made months ago, but those improvements have not yet been made. I do not attach blame to anybody for these failings. However, I know that the neglect ia having a disturbing affect on the morale of the immigrants, most of whom have young families that we are glad to have in Australia. We should encourage other such families to come here. I met Mr Beaumont, who has started an action in the High Court against the Commonwealth of Australia for alleged misrepresentation that enticed him to come to Australia. The Minister need not take this comment as a personal affront. Mr Beaumont is not a bad fellow agree with that. many immigrants at the hostel feel much as he does. Therefore, I hope that we shall be able to remove British immigrants from camps and hostels as quickly as possible and establish them in homes of some sort. I hope that we shall be able to initiate a big housing programme or allow them to help to build homes for The charge that the honourable member for Hindmarsh is conducting a vendetta against the Chambers family is not true. I am aware of that from my own knowledge, notwithstanding anything that the press may report. The truth is that a press vendetta is being conducted against the honourable member for Hindmarsh. It is altogether unfair and most improper, and I am glad that the remarks of the Minister have given me a",97,Migration Mr Clyde Cameron

318,Mr Calwell,"Perhaps not, butchance to clear the air on this issue. Adelaide( Mr Chambers) has a brother who is doing a very good job. I have never heard previously of anybody carrying on a vendetta against that gentleman. The honourable member for Adelaide himself is completely satisfied that the honourable member for Hindmarsh is not conducting any vendetta against him, and the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) can substantiate that assurance. He ""was present when the honourable member for Adelaide made that fact clear. A vendetta is being prosecuted by somebody against those gentlemen for the purpose of causing trouble between them. But the effort will fail. AgainI say that the officers of the Department of Labour and National Service and of the Department of Immigration are doing a very good job under difficult circumstances^ The people under their care are, in the main, appreciative of what is being done for them. I know that the Minister intends to establish one controlling authority under the name "" Commonwealth Hostels Limited "". I hope that he does not make the mistake of putting the present Director-General of the Department of Labour and National Service, Mr No one who made such a statement should Funnell, in charge of the general scheme. It would be a retrograde step to do so, and I hope that no effort will be made to put Mr Funnell into such a job, which might continue for four or five years. before he retires. might hope that he will continue to work for three or four years after he has reached retiring age. I consider that it would be very wrong for anybody to create a situation of that sort. Mr Funnell has a very big job. Keeping our immigrants contented is important, and I consider that the main way to keep them contented is to get them out of camps as quickly a3 possible. [11.31] I wish to reply to the remarks of the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt). Anybody would have thought, from the Minister's introductory remarks, that he was going to drop a terrific bombshell on me, and that The honourable member fcr I had brought forward something that, would expose me as being a person who was completely irresponsible. The Minister used those words in relation to me. I waited in vain until he sat down to hear one word to justify the lowdown attack that he made on me and the honourable member for Watson( Mr Curtin). He made the statement in his usual guttersnipe manner. able gentleman will withdraw that word. draw it. He made an attack on the honourable member for Watson and me, and accused us of stooping to the lowest, depths. I sling it back in his face and say that he has done likewise. The Minister described the secretary of the Adelaide Trades and Labour Council as a Communist. In doing so, he stooped to the lowest possible depths, because he did so under parliamentary privilege. He described a man of the highest integrity in the trade union movement of South Australia as a Communist because he happened to be the gentleman who gave me the two pieces of food that I produced in the House on the 30th October. tell other people that they have stooped to the lowest depths. A person who will come here, and under parliamentary privilege, describe another person as being a Communist, when that person is no more a Communist than I am, ought to be thoroughly ashamed of himself and is not fit to occupy a position in the Parliament. The Minister has not answered any of the charges that I have made. I levelled a charge against the Department of Immigration in regard to the cost of the food that it was serving up to certain people. [ said that it was charging £11 8s. a week for a family consisting of a man, his wife and three children. The Minister did not say anything in reply to that charge, nor has he satisfied me, at any rate, that the food that I produced was not typical of the food that was served up to these people at the charges that I mentioned. The fact that the Minister has seen fit to send a medical officer to investigate the hostel shows that there is some justification in",98,Migration Mr Clyde Cameron

323,Mr Clyde Cameron,"I with the reports that I have received. Incidentally, since I first raised this matter in Sydney. What is the use of mentioning the Parliament I have had communication with the officer in charge of the hostel in question, who has spoken to me about it. going to tell you, because you are vindictive. I know what you would do. You would have the man dismissed. able gentleman will address me. me that inquiries were being made, and I know for a positive fact that the standard of the food that was being supplied, in spite of the cheap, cynical remarks that the Minister made here a moment ago, has improved considerably since the matter was raised. I like the cheek of the Minister in taking umbrage at any honourable member bringing to the notice of the Government a complaint that a taxpayer, citizen or voter decides to bring under an honourable member's notice. I have a perfect right to bring before the Government, on the adjournment, any complaint that has been brought to my notice. That is the very essence of our democracy. If this Parliament does not give to honourable members the right that, T have exercised, then it should close up now, because honourable members have no cither way of ventilating the just grievances of the people. When any such question is raised here, the Minister rises and, in a bitter, cynical manner, castigates the honourable member who has dared to bring it forward. any assertions about the food that I produced. I merely said that I had received certain complaints and I produced food that had heen supplied to me by the secretary of the Adelaide Trades and Labour Council, who requested me to bring the matter before the Parliament. As a member of the Labour party, I shall always bring before the Parliament any matters that the secretary of the Adelaide Trades and Labour Council asks me to bring before it. It ill becomes the Minister, speaking under parliamentary privilege, to call this man, who has done so much for his country, a Communist, and to try to smudge over every other complaint that is made to him as the outcome of a Communist plot. The Minister referred to hostels in what happens in Sydney, when the fact is that not all of the hostels in Adelaide are bad. I did not say at any stage that every hostel was bad. I said that there was one that was bad, and I merely asked the Minister to investigate the conditions there. BecauseI had the audacity to ask the Minister to investigate a complaint that had been given me by a trade union authority, he rose and, in a vindictive, cynical manner, took umbrage. I tell the Minister, in conclusion, thai whenever I have any matters to bring forward in this HouseI shall ventilate them here whether he likes it or not. The Minister can take it from me thai none of his abuse and filthy insults will stop me from bringing such matters forward. able gentleman should moderate his language. Question resolved in the affirmative. lToii.se adjourned at 11.37 p.m. The following answers to question.* were circulated:ter, upon notice1. Has his attention heen drawn to a statement, by the Liberal party member for Clayfield in the Queensland Parliament to the I did not make effect that the intelligence of the average Australian serviceman is that of a twelveyear-old child? 2. Isi t not a fact that the averasre Australian serviceman is as brave and as intelligent as the servicemen of any other nation in the world ? 3. Will he take action to protect the reputation of Australian servicemen from such unjustified and damaging attacks? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. I have not seen the statement referred to by the honourable member. 2 and 3. The bravery and intelligence of Australian Military Forces has been irrefutably demonstrated on numerous ofcasions. There is little likelihood that any statement can damage a reputation so firmly established by past and current actions.",99,Migration Mr Clyde Cameron

Was the increase of the net profits of the Prestige company from £0,515 in 1940 to £21.504 irr 1950-51 due to the increase in the volume of Greige cloth imported from Japan and the United Kingdom which was printed by the company in Australia and sold on the Australian market as Australian rayon and not to any increase in the volume of cloth woven in Australia? 5.

The local rayon printing and finishing industry has increased at a more rapid ratt than the weavintr industry since the time of the Tariff. Board's inquiry. 2 and 3. The present weaving production i not as great as that anticipated by tbe industry at the time of the Tariff Board inquiry bin the temporary by-laws which were arranged tn ease the impost of the Government's protective legislation have contributed towards this. Whilst the local industry's present annunl rate of production is short by approximately 4.000,000 squnre ynrds of the figure of answers to the 21,900,000 square yards mentioned in the board's report for the year 1951, that position cannot be said to be due to thc lack of capacity on the part of the industry. 4 and 5. I do not propose to comment on the balance-sheets of the Prestige company. 6. No evidence of exploitation of the Government's protective legislation has come under my notice. 7. 'i'hc position will continue to be closelv watched after the concessions are withdrawn at the end of the year.

Each of the three matters raised in that letter, namely (a) development of tbe port of Newcastle; (6) rehabilitation of the Hunter Valley; and (c) conservation of the coal-fields, is a matter in which the Commonwealth has a vital interest but, at the same time, such matters are primarily within the sphere of the Government of Hew South Wales. If and when the State Government would like to confer with the Commonwealth on the subject the Commonwealth will give every consideration to that request. There are at present Commonwealth State consultative committees who are looking into the coal and transport problems, and I have no doubt that they are giving considerable attention to the Newcastle area in connection with their investigations. The New South Wales Government earlier this year appointed a committee to investigate and report upon coal conservation, heating and methods of extraction of coal. The committee, which is known as the Coal Conservation Committee, has presented its report to theNew South Wales Parliament, and this report is now being printed. In connection with this report, the New South Wales Minister for Mines stated in the New South Wales Parliament on the 28th September that he would do everything possible to help preserve our coal resources. The New South Wales Government is also carrying out extensive works to eonserve and rehabilitate the land resources of the Hunter Valley. The honourable member will therefore see that there is already a considerable amount of investigation and Commonwealth-Stato cooperation into the matters to which his question refers, and a formal conference with the Newcastle unions would be unl'ikelv to yield any further information which is not in the possession of the State and Commonwealth authorities mensure, would be only too glad to have the information. The allocation of loan moneys is determined by the decision of the Loan Council on which the States have a majority representation. Once the .loan allocation has .been made the distribution of the available, moneys among the various projects, such as the rehabilitation of. the Hunter Valley and the development of the port of Newcastle is a matter exclusively for the State Government.",102,Inotjstbiat Development
