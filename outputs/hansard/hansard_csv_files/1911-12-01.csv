BILL. In Committee (Consideration of Governor General's message): That is is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a Bill for an Act relating to the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration and the public service of the Commonwealth. Resolution reported and adopted. torney-General) [10.37] I move That this Bill be now read a second time. The measure affords an opportunity to the employees of the public to appeal to the Arbitration Court for the settlement of differences and the adjustment of anomalies. Its provisions are. in many respects, similar to those of the principal Act. Obviously, it would be impossible for the Court to deal with individual cases, but the members of any class or grade, numbering Commonwealth and of any vice are organization, pation, rates may cipal repetition Court andinthe claim set Public or where claim register. division, of any form Act. shall employment out the or ..within employees, the employees employee's or as Act pay, may in ofin 100, if ansubmit and it calling, avocation three-fifths relating meaning themselves Service class, The there 1904-11. thereupon Under similar or any clause may appeal industry terms were service, class of of to clause in 6, provisions of to grade, powers of are its an or the or the An into the have it, which within the to The Court is empowered to make a common rule, which can be extended to persons outside, the organization represented before it. The Public Service Commissioner and the Minister of any Department affected by a claim may be represented, either jointly or separtely, in its hearing and determination, but neither party to a case can be represented by counsel or solicitor. The employer is the people of the country, of whom the Public Service Commissioner is the agent. He will represent the employer's case, the organization will represent the employees' case, and an impartial chairman, hearing what the two parties have to say, will make such award as he may think just. Clause7 enables the Court to refer any claim or matter arising out of a claim to a Judge of a State Court, a police, stipendiary, or special magistrate, or other person authorized by the Governor General in that behalf, to whom, it may delegate.such of its powers as it deems desirable. In such an event, for example, as a dispute arising in connection with the construction of the transcontinental railway, the employees affected could not come to the Court, nor the Court go to them, and in all cases of die kind the matter will be referred in the manner provided for, but there would be an appeal to the Court from ""the decision of the person to whom the hearing of the case was delegated. Under no circumstances, however, will there be an appeal from the decision of the Court itself. In clause 8 we have the necessary provision The Public Service Commissioner, and the Permanent Heads and chief officers of the several Departments of State, and aU persons in the Public Service of the Commonwealth, shall comply with the provisions of any award or order of the Court made in pursuance of this Act. That will place the employer of the public servants of the Commonwealth, or his agent, in exactly the same position as is an employer in private enterprise. In other words, they must obey the orders of the Court. The Court, under clause 9, may exercise any of its powers under the Act of its own volition in certain circumstances, or on the application of a claimant organization, or of a Minister of State, or the Public Service Commissioner. That provision is in keeping with the terms of the principal Act. Under clause 10, the Court in making an award will not be restricted to the matters set forth in the plaint.

15,Mr Hughes (West Sydney,"Atorder that it thinks necessary in the interests of the public or of the Public Service, This is a very proper provision to make, since it frequently happens that men, while knowing that they are dissatisfied, do not always recognise the precise cause for their dissatisfaction or the precise remedy that is called for. It is a very trite aphorism that the onlooker sees more of the game than do the players, and the power proposed to be conferred upon the Court under this clause has already been granted to it in dealing with private employers and employees. Clause II declares .that no costs shall be allowed on either side; and clause 12 provides that neither party is to be represented by counsel or solicitor. I come now to clause 13, which repeats the amending section introduced in the principal Act by the Bill passed earlier in the session, providing, really, .that the decision of the Court shall be final. This clause, however, will have a wider scope than has that in the amending Bill passed earlier in the session, to which I have just referred, inasmuch as our powers are, in regard to the public servants of the Commonwealth, plenary. We are subject in this regard only to those restrictions in the Constitution which deal witli the rights of public servants. Those rights cannot be taken from them by this or any other measure; but, subject to that condition, this Parliament can do whatever it elects .to do in respect of the Commonwealth Public Service, and can, therefore, delegate to the Court the same power. Under the Constitution, officers transferred from the States ,to the Commonwealth have certain rights, and those rights cannot be taken from them by the Court. Subject to'the Constitution generally, however, the decision of the Court is to be final. would be for a grant of further powers or advantages; no appeals are made to reduce, limit, or take away constitutional powers. need not, be any appeal on a matter clearly within the jurisdiction of the Court. If we are to have finality, we might as well have it here as well as anywhere else. I come now to a matter in connection witli which considerable difficulty naturally arises out of the circumstances of the case. Clause 14 provides that(1.) Every award made under this Act shall be expressed not to come into operation until a future date, not earlier than after the expiration of thirty days after the award has been laid before both Houses of the Parliament. (2.) When an award has been made under this Act, the President of the Court shall forthwith send to the Prime Minister and to the Attorney General a certified copy of the award. (3.) The Prime Minister shall, within fourteen days after its receipt, if the Parliament is then sitting, or if not then within fourteen days after the next meeting of the Parliament, cause the award to be laid before both Houses of the Parliament. Unless the scope of the Court's authority in regard to matters brought before it by public servants was to be limited to the powers that could be exercised by the Public Service Commissioner under the Public Service Act, it is obvious that, if the Court thought proper to make such awards as were or might not be limited by the scope of the Act, those awards should come before Parliament. We have, therefore, provided, under clauses 14 and 15, for an award to be made by the Court which may, in effect, be or amount to, when adopted, an amendment of existing legislation. Whatever Statutes now govern the relation between the Commonwealth and its public servants necessarily impose upon the Public Service Commissioner certain restrictions. Whether he is desirous or not of going outside those restrictions he cannot do so. There is only one authority at present that is able to do so, and that is Parliament itself. For example, in the third schedule of the Public Service Act it is prescribed that in the clerical division fifth class officers shall begin at £40, £ 5 0 . and £ 6 0 a year, and that their salaries shall increase until they receive, in the sixth subdivision, £ 1 6 0 per annum. If the Public Service Commissioner desired to pay the men in that subdivision .£180 per annum he could not do so, although he might make such an increase in the case of public servants whose maximum salary was set down, not in the Act. but under some regulation under the Act. It is, therefore, perfectly clear, and. of course, there are many other cases of the kind, that unless the functions of the Court are to be so severely confined as to practically make it a mere censor of regulations under the Act, it must have power to make such awards as it thinks fits, regardless of whether or not those awards come within an Act of Parliament. And here we come to the most important point. It would obviously be most andesirable that any",16,Second Reading

The total in 1910 was ,£2,516,000. Since this Government came into office the Commonwealth permanent public servants have received increments totalling some .£200,000 per annum, and the temporary officers about ,£50,000. result of the action of the Fisher Government, the public servants now receive ,£250,000 per annum more than previously.

There will be absolutely the best possible guarantee that any employees, either public or private, could, or ought to, desire. Any matters of detail to which I have not referred I shall deal with in Committee, and simply content myself now with moving that the Bill be read a second time. should have liked a little more time to look at the Bill. I recognise, however, that the Government are desirous of getting on quickly with the business, and, as some professional engagement may prevent my being here next Wednesday, I should like to say at once how the measure strikes me. I do not know why the Bill has been introduced except to get over some difficulty in connection with the claims of transferred officers. I cannot understand why, as a matter of policy, we should supersede the Public Service Act, and, to some extent, upset our power of fixing salaries by Act -of Parliament. were deputations to the Postmaster-General and other Ministers in connection with what are called the accrued rights of some of the transferred officers. Eventually a way out of fhe difficulty was suggested by one Minister, who thought that the matter might be referred to the Arbitration Court. Apparently, therefore, the genesis of this Bill is the difficulty in connection with some of the transferred officers as to -their accrued rights under section 84 of the Constitution. I may, of course, be wrong in this supposition j but one Postmaster 'General-the present Minister of External .Affairs, I think-wa s reported in the press to have made the suggestion I have indicated. Is .this Bill the result of that promise? If so, it seems to me very unwise to upset all our agreements, and the parlia* mentary control over the public servants, in order to surmount a difficulty which we have not attempted to face by a special Aot. There are some transferred officers This means that, as a who consider that, under section 84 of the Constitution, they have been deprived of certain annual increments they were entitled to under the Acts of the States. They also complain in regard to certain allowances down. There are these and some other rights of which, according to their contention, they have been deprived. I am not now, of course, dealing with the merits of their contention. Personally, I think that the Public Service Commissioner did what he was perfectly entitled to do under the Public Service Act. I do not say that the transferred officers have been fairly treated by Parliament-that is another matter. AVe have invested the Public Service Commissioner with certain powers and responsibilities either directly or .by necessary implication in the terms of the Act; and this, at all events, has been his legal justification for not classifying all the officers in a special way under the Act, 50 as to give them the full rights in all cases that they enjoyed under the Acts of the States. But whatever may have been the restraint which prevented the Publie Service Commissioner, perhaps, fromrecognising the full claims of these officers, there is no doubt that we could have amended the Public Sevrice Act so as to have granted what was fair and reasonable in the demands of those officers. If the officers have any very strong claim, it is in relation I remember that there to the policy of the Government rather than in connection with the administration of the Act by the Public Service Commissioner; at any rate, that is how the matter strikes me. The ofiicers ask, for instance, that their salaries shall be at a higher rate than is possible under the Public Service Act as it stands. It is said that some men who were receiving .£250 under .the State Acts at the time of the transfer lose, perhaps, £,5° o r £ 6 ° by the gradation that is necessary under the Public Service Act; and what we ought to have done was tp amend the Act. Six or seven years ago, Sir George Turner, when Treasurer, informed us that .the total amount involved in the claims of the transferred officers was about",17,Second Reading
18,Mr Glynn (Angas) [11.15],"I,£44,000 a year. In the State of South Australia, which has been most exigent in the matter, because the salaries there were cut down to a greater extent than in any other of the States, the amount necessary to settle all the claims was only £4,000 a year, in addition to the expenditure under the Public Service Act. Time after .time, the claims of these transferred officers have only until some competent legislature had been pressed on Ministers, and half-hearted and halting promises of redress have been made.

We should be justified, as a matter of policy, in providing certain conditions as applicable to transferred officers in order to get over the of the day, including, for instance, the dedifficulties of the transition period. As I have said, the total amount involved was, some years ago, estimated to be about £44,000. My point is that this question has never really been tackled by any Government by means of an amendment of the Public Service Act. It seems to me that the Government now propose to get over the difficulties raised by the demands of these transferred officers by saying, "" We will refer the claims of the whole service to the Court of Arbitration."" ber suggest that a claim arising out of constitutional rights should be referred to the Court of Arbitration? ferred officers claimed certain constitutional rights under section 84. The High Court has said that section 84 does not extend to all their cases-that was decided in the cases of Bond against the Commonwealth and Cousins against the Commonwealthbut the officers say that on the merits, apart altogether from the law, they are entitled to have their claims recognised. The High Court said that with regard to some of them, the rights to salaries were preserved dealt with the matter,, that they enjoyed those rights under the Civil Service Acts of the States, but that those Acts could have been amended by Parliament at any time, arid that, therefore, it was competent for this Legislature, which now deals with these officers, to do what the States could have done by amending the Act. Apart, however, from the question of law, the merits are for Parliament to deal with, and it seems to me a well-founded complaint on the part of the transferred officers that there has never been an attempt by Parliament to deal with their claims. What, however, was hinted at on one or two occasions was that possibly the whole matter might be referred to the Court of Arbitration, excluding, of course, the question of law as to whether or not their claims were preserved as accrued rights under section 84. time that a friendly case should be stated on the matter. If there are any to say that the Government rather blocked because, when action was taken in that direction by the transferred officers in South Australia, every technical defence open under the Act was put in by the Government fence that, as Parliament had not made the necessary appropriation, the salaries could not have been paid. officers came to see me, and I advised them that they would not gain from such a hearing, and they took my advice. General is quite right in offering the opinion that, on the law, it was exceedingly doubtful whether they could establish their claim.

States affected to any extent-South Australia and Queensland, and the merits of the claims of the officers in each State could be dealt with. It is not necessary to deal with each particular officer, because their case is that they have been affected as classes, and of course the individual has suffered to the extent to which his salary has been reduced by classification. I would even now ask the Government whether it would not be wiser to bring in an amendment of the Public Service Act to deal with that matter, which seems to be the origin of the whole of this B ill , and let the House, on hearing the merits of the claims, once for all decide upon diem by passing or rejecting that B ill , instead of having a Bill of this sort brought in. gestion that these claims should be submitted to the Court,. and that whatever decision was arrived at should be laid on the table of the House.

If that is so, of course, the wind is knocked out of the officers' sails, so far as the law is concerned. I regret that, apparently to get over the difficulty raised by the importunity of these officers, there has been introduced an amendment of the Public Service Act to hand over to the Court of Arbitration the power to refix the wages or salaries of any class of officers. Is this expedient? I do not think there is a Government in the world that allows the salaries of its servants to be handed over to any lay tribunal.

I know of no fairer method by \vhich this can be secured than the proposal to empower the Conciliation and Arbitration Court to consider all these questions, and give an impartial judgment on the matters submitted to it. The Court should be able to say, for instance, what, for three or four years, should be the wages of a letter-carrier. tion it would consider the duties of a letter-carrier. It would take into consideration the fact that he had to attend at an early hour in the morning, assist in sorting letters, and then deliver them; that he would have an hour or two off in the middle of the day, and then return to duty, ancl be employed for a certain number of hours. It would consider, further, whether he had I admit that they are, and to carry heavy loads, whether he had to be constantly climbing upstairs, or whether his I know that the duties required him to be out in all sorts of weather. his bag would be taken into consideration.

I know of men in the Public Service who are very anxious to have an opportunity to place their case before the CourL, because at present they have not the right of appeal; and I believe the ultimate effect of this Bill will be to bring about far more contentment in the Public Service than at present prevails. I have heard the AUorney-General make some excellent speeches in introducing Bills relating to conciliation and arbitration^ but his speech to-day seemed to lack the old ring. son no doubt was that, although this Bill purports to be an extension of the principle of arbitration, he was not able to marshal any substantial arguments in support of it. There is no public demand, or any demand even within the service, for a Bill of this kind. I admit that in times past and, in fact, within recent years, there have been numerous complaints of grievances and inequalities; but most of these have been ventilated and made the subject of the evidence before the Postal Commission, and the bulk really touch legislation rather than the administration of the existing law. If this Bill be passed, the bulk of these grievfications ? ances will remain unredressed or undealt with unless there is an amendment of the Public Service Act. It has been said that this is a Bill for the extension of the printor. cipal of arbitration. The honourable member for South Sydney has told us that the public approve of this principle as applied to disputes between private employers and employees, and that, therefore, it may fairly be applied to controversies between the Commonwealth Government and its employees. gether ignores the fundamental principle of the Public Service Act, which is that the Public Service Commissioner shall be the arbitrator for the determination of the rights position is the head of a series of legal deand privileges, as well as the duties, of the public servants.

As I say, the Public Service Commissioner is really an arbitrator. trator, and he has been invested with powers and functions of a very important and far-reaching character. He is appointed on the assumption that he has special qualifications as a judge, and that he has an inside knowledge of the working of the various Departments. dispute ?

If the Ministry regard any laws Of regulations as unfair, it is their duty to submit proposals to Parliament-for their rectification rather than to shunt the complaints, as it were, into a side track with a dead-end, where nothing further can be -done. I have said that there is no demand, within or without the service, for this legislation ; and I should like to refer to the petition presented to this House in October last, signed by over 5,000 public servants of the Commonwealth. In that petition they say that they have been informed of the contemplated alteration of the law providing for an appeal to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and they protest against the proposed alteration. The signatures include those of representatives of the Public Service in every State, and the petition may be regarded as a representative expression of the views of the service. The petition contains the following :That the Prime Minister has stated that it is the intention of the Government early in next session of Parliament to amend the Commonwealth Public Service Act 1902, so as to allow the officers of the Commonwealth Service to avail themselves of the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act. That from time immemorial Parliament has been the final Court of Appeal for servants of the Crown. That the introduction of the Federal Arbitration Court into the administration of the service would rob Parliament of its prerogative of exercizing final jurisdiction over the servants of the 'Crown. That from the statement of the Hon. the Prime Minister, it would appear that the responsibility for the welfare of the officers of the service which, devolves on Parliament is to be delegated to a tribunal outside its jurisdiction. That investigations under the Arbitration Court would be lengthy, costly, and burdensome. That by effective administration based upon the report of the Royal Commission on Postal Services, and subject to revision by Parliament, all grievances in the service could be thereby adjusted.

First, there is already a method of arbitration for the determination of wages and conditions within the service. We have now a method of Public Service arbitration, which is apparently the best that Parliament has been able to devise. If it is imperfect, either as regards the constitution or the powers of the tribunal, it should be capable of being improved, and ought to be improved.

That board was actually recommended by the Postal Commission to deal with the internal management of the Postal Department, and, therefore, to deal with the employees of the Department. The development of one Commissioner into a board of three might give greater satisfaction and efficiency. My point, however, is that one Commissioner or a board of three Commissioners, constituted by the authority of Parliament and directly authorized to deal with these Public Service questionsconsisting also of men with an expert and special knowledge of the Public Servicegives greater security for the rectification of Service Board or Commission. grievances and the settlement of complaints consistent with the rights of the sersuggestion is to have an independent set of vice as well as the rights of the public, than would be the case in the proposed reference to a Conciliation and Arbitration Court outside of the service.

110,Mr Hughes,"-That is the reason thenot to be allowed to go to the Court unless he becomes a part o i a wide trade organization within the service. That, of course, merely goes to show the imperfection of the scheme. ' When the complaint or claim is formulated, it may relate to such questions as salaries, wages, rates of pay, or terms or conditions of service ov employment. Att the present time, under the Public Service Act, most of those functions have been delegated to the Public Service Commissioner, so that, apparently, that provision gives the right of appeal from the Public Service Commissioner to the Court. It is proposed also to drag the Public Service Commissioner before the Court. sent he is charged with semi-judicial functions, and judicial prerogatives, and yet he is to be called upon by this Bill to appear as an advocate in an appeal before the Court. That is subjecting him to an unnecessary indignity, because it assumes that he is a partisan, whereas he is not interested in sustaining his own recommendations or determinatioiis. claims are not to be investigated alone before Mr Justice Higgins, the ideal Judge, and the ideal arbitrator according to the views of some people, but he is to be authorized to refer any claim to a Judge of a Supreme Court, or a police stipendiary, or special magistrate, or other person authorized by the Governor General to investigate, and report. cally gives a right of appeal, not to the Arbitration Court, but to the persons to whom the Court may delegate its functions. There is no provision as to the place where these references are to take place. It may be assumed from the scheme of the Bill that the central Federal Arbitration Court is now, as it were, to be broken up and disintegrated into a number of branches, or delegated authorities, in different parts of the Commonwealth. These may possibly lay down lines of policy inconsistent with one another for the settlement of disputes, and we mav, .therefore, have a variety of decisions relating to Public Service matters in different parts of the country, varying according to the different views or idiosyncrncies of the various persons to whom the references have been made. Therefore, we shall have nothing like uniformity, consistency, or harmony within the service. At present there are comparatively uniform rates of pay and conditions of employment in it, with certain exceptions in the tropical regions. My strongest objection to the proposed delegation is that it gives to functionaries, whose qualifications may be unknown, jurisdiction over delicate technical questions relating to the internal administration of the Government Departments. Some of these Judges, magistrates, or other authorized persons may have no knowledge or means of obtaining knowledge of the inside workings of the various Departments. have that central commanding knowledge founded upon a long line of communications and a network of organizations such as is at the disposal of the Public Service Commissioner, who, although he At premay be sitting at the Seat of Government, has special knowledge and means for obtaining information relating to conditions of labour and employment which would not be available to those isolated functionaries in various parts of the country. your side when the last Bill was before us was that uniformity could not possibly be These complaints or established throughout Australia. Sir JOHN QUICK I am dealing now, not with a multiplicity of trades and organizations varying throughout the Commonwealth, but with the Public Service of the Commonwealth, which at present is integrated service. In any integrated service you must have consistency and harmony of design and execution in the carrying out This Bill, therefore, practiof its work, and in the appointment of its awards and emoluments. An inherent weakness and infirmity of this scheme, which will help to make it break down, is the variety of officers sitting independently whom it is proposed to call into existence. One may fairly call attention to the position that may arise upon a determination by any Arbitration Court or delegated authority. It is probable than many of the complaints of the public servants are due to the state of the law, and for that reason the Commissioner cannot redress, some of the grievances that are brought before him. The Bill indeed contemplates the possibility of awards being made contrary to the law of the Commonwealth. Such awards, however, could not have force, and in those cases, therefore, no redress would be gained from an appeal to the Court. Where grievances are due to the existing law they cannot be remedied except by the amendment of that law, to secure which an appeal must be made to the Ministry and' to Parliament.

It is practically impossible for any one man to make himself thoroughly familiar with the workings of a service extending from the Gulf of Carpentaria to the southernmost parts of Tasmania on the one side and from Perth to Sydney on the other. Even allowing that he is influenced by the best of intentions, we have to remember that his decisions depend upon information that filters to him through what has a tendency, I am afraid, to become a small Conservative inner circle immediately surrounding the Commissioner. Such a state of affairs is inevitable under the existing system ; but we are now going to create a still more powerful autocrat. A man who will not have the slightest knowledge of the conditions of the services will sit in judgment on the service, and his decisions will depend on the evidence submitted to him, which must be biased on both sides. No Judge, unless he were an angel from Heaven, could enter into a consideration of the legitimate grievances of public servants as fairly and f u l ly as can the Minister at the head of the Department concerned, and who is responsible all the time to Parliament. hear and deal with all individual grievances ? MrM c WILLIAMS much better chance of doing so than the. President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court will have. Honourable members opposite have said that Commonwealth public servants, if dissatisfied with an award of the Court, will be able to appeal to the Parliament. The Bill does not provide for anything of the kind. The decision of the Court in all cases will be absolutely final, unless the award made fails to come within the four corners of the existing law. To illustrate the position, let us take the case of the Sydney telegraphists. If the Court decided to-morrow that the time worked by those men should be extended in common with that of men in various industries to eight hours a clay, there could be no appeal from that award to this Parliament. The award could be upset only by the passing of another Act of Parliament.

Again, the chief officers, formerly called the permanent heads, are charged with the duty of reporting upon the efficiency and capacity ancl the value of the work of every servant under them. Each chief officer, therefore, is charged with the responsibility through his own officers-no t the officers of the Public Service Commissioner-of ascertaining and assessing the value of the services of every officer under him. Then the Public Service Commissioner comes in as the arbitrator as to whether that been correctly made or not, and up to now, at any rate, the Public Service Commissioner has been the man upon whom Parliament has relied to guard the interests of the Government and of the service. Today, therefore, we have the chief officer valuing the services of every man under him, and we have tlie Public ServiceI n spectors, who are supposed to be capable, and who are alleged by themselves and their chief to be capable, also assessing the value of the work. Now, still another tribunal is being created by the Postal Department, which is advertising for two officers, one to take charge of the clerical and professional branches and the other to take charge of the general division. pointed to the Central Office. one who has taken notice of the conflict between the Central Office and the Public Service Commissioner all through the years of Federation must know what has resulted from Central Office control. The other day, I asked the Minister what the duties of these two new officers were to be, and received the usual evasive reply. The Department has been characteristic lately for not giving the replies which straight questions demand. It evades and equivocates in a way that is not creditable to any Department that should deal straightforwardly with members of this House. If the two new officers are to be of* any use to the service, and not simply to encumber the Central Office further, they will have to travel throughout Australia, because the divisions with which they will deal extend throughout Australia. Any man who has to see that there is no malingering, that the work is properly done, and the service in each branch efficient, must travel from one end of the Commonwealth to the other. If those officers are to do jthat', it should be so stated; if not, I fai l to see what is to be gained by interposing them at the very time when the Government are bringing in some other machinery. So far, then, I have shown that the Public Service is subject, as it were, to the decisions of three tribunals. the. Central Office or in the Public Service Commissioner's Office? master-General tells me, they are to be appointed to the Central Office. That is an anomaly I cannot understand, because I am also told that they are to be there in order to report to the Minister anything they assessment has deem wise with regard to the administration of the different divisions I have mentioned. The chief officer in each State ought to know the value of the work of those under him, and if he does not he is not fit for his position. is the honourable member referring? present position of the service, in order to show exactly what will happen when the Bill is passed.

Any proposal of that kind must come into conflict with the powers given to the Public Service Commissioner under the Act. So far, then, we have three tribunals, and now this Bill is brought in to superimpose a fourth. Under it , the Court will arbitrate on the merits or danerits of the decisions of the three tribunals already in existence in the Department. I could understand an Arbitration Court having power to review wages and conditions even in a Public Service, provided they had been fixed by one authority. As it is, we have a number of authorities who may differ materially, as they have done in the past, and who, when their evidence comes before the Arbitration Court, will undoubtedly make confusion worse confounded than it is to-day.

As to the right of the Public Service Commissioner to be represented before the Court, I take it that he will not have the right to employ legal or expert assistance, but merely to appoint some one to take his place should he be unable to attend in person Paragraph c of clause 6 allows the Court to fix maximum penalties, not exceeding ^10, for any breach or non-cbservance of an award. In another part of the Bill it is provided that every award made by the Court under this Act must be laid on, the table of both Houses of Parliament, and that either House may, by resolution, refuse to endorse an award. In the case of private employers, both the employer and the employee can be fined for breach of an award of the Court, but under this Bill, whilst the employ6 will be liable to a penalty of £ r o for non-observance of an award, no penalty can be enforced against the other side for breach of an award. The position is illogical. member to read clause 8. the Public Service Commissioner and the permanent heads and chief officers, in common with all Commonwealth servants, are required to comply with the provisions of an award or order of the Court. But if Parliament vetoes an award, of what use will such a provision be? My contention is that the Parliament of the Commonwealth in this connection occupies the position of an employer, and that the law that requires private employers, as well as employees, to obey an award of the Court will not apply to the Parliament as the employers of the public servants of the Commonwealth under this measure. It is a one-sided proposal that declares that employees must comply with an award of the Court, but leaves it free to the Parliament, which stands in the position of the employer, to refuse to comply with an award. far into this matter as can the Attorney General. I repeat that either House of Parliament may veto an award, or, in other words, set it aside, whereas an employ^ will be liable to a fine of £ 1 0 for breach of an order of the Court. Herein we see the difficulty of applying to the Public Service the principle of arbitration. No employer can be brought before the Court in this case, save the officials who are acting under an Act of Parliament for which this Legislature is responsible. There is, therefore, grave reason for doubt whether this Bill will bring about the improvement that we desire. According to Mr Justice Heydon, the Court may make an award decreasing a payment, but an award granting a payment in excess of that provided by Act of Parliament must go before the Parliament ; so that if this Parliament considered in any case that the extra payment for which an award provided should not be made, it would refuse to vote the necessary funds. Under paragraph e, of clause 6, power is given to the Court to make an award a common rule of the Public Service. This provision has apparently been taken from the Conciliation and Arbitration Act without any thought of its applicability to the case with which this measure is designed to deal. I could understand a common rule being declared in regard to all men engaged in bricklaying, stonecutting, or in carrying out any mechanical work, but one has only to enter any branch office of the Public Service in the Union-the accountancy, correspondence, miscellaneous, or any other branch of the service-to realize how impossible it would be to make a common rule applying to all officers of any division of the service throughout Australia. The Chief Clerk of the Post and Telegraph Department in New South Wales, for instance, has an enormous volume of work to deal with, and is frequently called upon to relieve the Deputy Postmaster-General. He is, therefore, entitled to a high rate of remuneration, but are we go'.ng to say that there should be a common rule declaring that the Chief Clerk of the Department in every State should receive the same salary.",36,Second Reading

Then, again, how would it be possible for the President of the Court to do what Mr Justice Higgins did when he desired to obtain an insight into the work of the shearers ? How would it be possible for him to personally inspect the operations and work of all the officers of the service? Another provision to which I desire to draw attention is that the Court shall have power to remit claims or matters for reference to a Judge of a State Court, or a police stipendiary, or special magistrate of the Commonwealth, or of a State, for investigation and report. It is in this respect that we see the fallacy of the statement made by my honourable friend the Attorney-General that we are going to appoint an expert who will be able to form an expert judgment on all these matters. stood the honourable member.

If we could wipe the nor effective for the work it will have to do.

In other words, the Court will have power to determine a claim on the report of any one of these persons without hearing any evidence. That is a danI t could gerous power, and I am afraid that it must lead to trouble and discontent. There is another provision that, wherever an award clashes with the Public Service Act, or any other Act, or any regulation under an Act, the award cannot stand. In the name of Providence, what sort of a position is this? Much embarrassment must be caused to men who have to present their case without legal assistance. With that condition in the Arbitration CourtI do not disagree; but it is difficult to understand how the public servants are to know when they are not going to come into conflict with some Commonwealth law or regulation. They may present their case to the best of their ability, only to be told that the award cannot hold; and, candidly, I cannot see how the public servants are going to get any redress under this measuie. I see no reason for the introduction of the Bill under present conditions. Of course, such a measure would be all right if there were no Public Service Act, and if the management were in No award, order, or direction of the Court under this Act shall be challenged, apquestion, or be subject to prohibition or man-",37,Second Reading

What is likeiy to be the lot of public servants who for the general have to run the gauntlet of all these authorities before the award for his services can I am not speaking of be fixed ? No similar position can be found in any other part of the world. Why should the tribunals not be confined to two-namely , a board of control, The Attorney-General, therefore, with staff committees, and then the Arbitration Court to decide in cases where the public servants are not satisfied ? Why not remove the intermediate confusing and duplicating instrumentalities, and have something tangible, logical, and effective? We should then get better results for the public, and the civil servants would know where they were. We are starting to legislate in this matter in too much of a hurry, and without stopping to reflect upon what is necessary to make our legislation effective.

The article in the Argus places me before the public in an invidious light. In self-defence I think I am' entitled to tell the House that yesterday afternoon, at 3 o'clock, the honourable member for Maranoa came to me and said, "" I come to you with an olive branch. I have been asked to see you, and to ask you to mond. If you do, I have a guarantee from two of the pressmen that you will be fully reported in the Argus in future."" I replied, "" What clo they think of me ? Do they think I have descended so low as to withdraw a statement which I believe to be true? I believe Redmond did write the article."" Maranoa replied, "" I believe so, too;"" but he put it to me that Mr Redmond would lose his position if I did not withdraw my statement, and that his wife and family would suffer. That appealed to me, and I consulted some of my friends on this side of the House, and asked if they thought that I should withdraw the statement, putting the case before them as I have just put it. Their reply was, "" In writing widely. those articles he did not think of our wives and families."" I had to agree that than Mr Higgs. that was so. The men who slander this party have no consideration for the wives and families of those for whom we are fighting, the workers of the community. Nor have they consideration for our wives and friends, whom they slander by declaring that we have borrowed money from our opponents. Honourable members may draw their own conclusions. I tell the House mond wrote the article was the common report in this House. It is my belief that there are honourable members who can give information that will show whether or not Mr Redmond is telling the truth when he says that he is not a contributor to Punch. Are honourable ^members prepared to do their duty by stating what they know, or clo they propose to remain silent ? I have deemed it my duty to defend this party against accusations made against it of the character of that referred to in the I was not asked £5 for die pubparagraph which I quoted yesterday, and which the honourable member for Balaclava, as every one believed he would, promptly denied. I refer to the accusation that members of the Labour party in this Parliament were borrowing money from honourable members opposite. You, Mr Speaker, thing that the wage earners and the Labour party outside would forgive is the borrowing of money by a Labour member from one of his political opponents. They recognise that immediately a man borrows from his opponents those opponents have him in their power. Knowing that we receive a salary of £,$00 a year, they naturally expect us not to place ourselves under any obligation to political opponents. The statement to which I took exception was a shocking one to make concerning this party. Do honourable members opposite think that it is fair that pressmen, occupying seats in the galleries, wlio are placed on an equality with us, and who meet us apparently as friends, should resort to such, tactics ? Is it fair that men who, as repreThe honourable member for sentatives of the big daily newspapers, are licensed by this House to meet us and to discuss matters with us, should use information that they gather in the lobbies as material for paragraphs in Melbourne Punch, and like newspapers, with which the general public have no idea that they are coimected ? the honourable member thinks.
