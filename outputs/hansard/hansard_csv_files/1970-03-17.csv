It refers to the telerecord and about 150 million bushels more vision station being placed on Bellenden Ker. What is the present position? Is construction proceeding according to plan? What is the estimated time of completion? Were tenders for the cableway within the estimated cost? Has the Postmaster-General any other information to give about the construction of this project? will know that I keep in close touch with this operation, because over the years there has been some delay in relation to it. Neveris a very serious step that has been taken. theless, the delay to some extent was overcome by temporary installations for use by commercial and national stations at. Cairns. I understand that the roadway to the base of the cableway at Bellenden Ker has been completed, that the clearing of the cableway area has been done, that within the next few weeks a contract for the cableway and associated buildings will be let, that during this year tenders will be called for the antenna and the necessary equipment and that the station should be in operation by the end of next year. When I say that, the honourable member, knowing the weather conditions in north Queensland from time to time, will understand that there could be problems over which there could be no control. the Minister for Primary Industry.

If unlike the Opposition his Government they are, is his Department looking at the would not interfere with insurance comCanadian proposal? statement that wheat is to be destroyed in he is recanting and repents this decision Canada and thus my officers will not be in respect of that company? looking at such a proposal. I think it is unfortunate that publicity was given to this member for Eden-Monaro displays very suggestion and I have had various newsconsiderable lack of knowedge of what he papers correct it. What was announced was is talking about. In the case of the MLC, that the Canadian Government would try to reduce the very heavy stockpiles in that country. In fact the extent of the problem of the wheat industry in Canada almost dwarfs the very serious problem in Australia. The latest estimate for July of this year puts Canada's stock holdings at about 950 million bushels, which is an all time than that held by even the United States of America. The Canadian Government proposes to offer an inducement to farmers to leave their wheat land fallow by paying them $6 an acre for land that is not used. In addition anybody who diversifies and uses his wheat land as permanent pasture for grazing purposes will receive $10 an acre. When one considers these new measures against what was operating in Canada to try to curb production one realises that it In Canada they have a system whereby every grain grower is given a permit book which entitles him to a basic quota of 100 units, the equivalent of 400 bushels of wheat or a corresponding amount of barley, oats and rye. But on top of that the permit also enables every wheat grower to deliver so many bushels per acre. For the year 1968-69 the figure was 6 bushels per acre. I believe it is to be reduced in 1969-70 to 4 bushels per acre. That does not mean that that will be the actual area of wheat grown, but it is certainly the number of crop acres that applies to a farm.

The position at the present is that under the new National Water Resources. Development Programme that was announced by the Prime Minister last October flood mitigation is now included. Tbere was a grant made to the State of New South Wales to assist in the previous programme for flood mitigation principally in the northern rivers Party? As my investigations have shown area. I understand that practically all the works there have been completed up to the present time. The New South Wales Government resubmitted a further programme for consideration during last year. As flood mitigation now comes under the new proposal by the Prime Minister, this was incorporated in it. As some additional information under the scheme is required, the Prime Minister wrote to the Premier of New South Wales a couple of months ago indicating that this matter would be considered under the new scheme and later requesting the additional information required. That information has been partly provided. I understand that in the very near future we shall have all the details that we require. In the meantime some discussions have been taking place between the officers of my Department and of the two departments concerned in New South Wales. In fact it was only today that I had some discussions with the State Minister for Works in New South Wales on the subject and we are arranging for the final discussions to take place in the near future. author has identified himself as a member It is hoped that it will not be too long now before we are able to have the matter finalised to tbe degree where we can bring a proposal before the Government for consideration. If the Commonwealth agrees the scheme will be financed, as was the previous scheme, partly by the Commonwealth, partly by the State concerned and partly by local government authorities. The present proposal involves a little more than the $20m previously mentioned. The new figure recently submitted is a little more than $22m. If the Commonwealth agrees in the scheme, its share will amount to about $8.9m. Dr PATTERSONI direct to the Minister for Trade and Industry a question about a series of articles published in the 'Financial Review' above the name of 'A Modest Member of Parliament'. Has the Minister noticed that the author of the article is opposed to tariffs and to primary industries? Has he noticed also that the articles are in effect a direct attack on the policies of the Australian Country Party and the fundamental policies of the Labor that this modest member of Parliament is not a member of the Labor Party and as I assume he is not a member of the Country Party, does the Minister know his identity? this question comes within the Minister's responsibility. Unless the honourable member can relate the question to the Minister's portfolio it will be out of order. of Parliament is attacking tariffs and primary industries. Does the Minister know his identity? outside the Minister's ministerial responsibility, although he may care to answer it.

Since the of Parliament and since he writes generally about things that are the concern of the Commonwealth Parliament, I presume that he is a member of the Commonwealth Parliament.

Did the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia advise him when the bank rate was to be increased by i % to 8i% before he made the announcement recently?

Was this procedure adopted in order to throw the responsibility for such an unpopular decision on the bank rather than have the Treasurer accept the responsibility and the public odium attached to it by making the announcement himself? upon the Reserve Bank power to make regulations, with the approval of the Treasurer, governing interest rates in the trading banktime. A progress report was then presented ing system. This move is normally recommended by the Board of the Reserve Bank and announced by the Governor. If the honourable member cares to consult precedents over many years he will see that this has long been the position. cation and Science agree that the standards in many areas of the State education systems are well below the desirable standards? Accepting that it is necessary to have the facts before taking action, can the Minister say when the co-ordinated inquiry into educational needs being conducted by the States ping and Transport will recall his visit to will be completed? Mr N. H.

In view of the importance ence in education in countries which are of this matter in providing for a possible moving and are not static shows this, so that at any given point of time it is always possible to say that in particular areas of education in the community the standards are not as high as would be desired. I think this is the position in some areas in Australia. HoweverI do not think we should forget the speed of progress over the last 10 years or less. Just to take one instance, in New South Wales, in 1960 there were 166 State high schools. This was the achievement after 100 years. There are now 278, or 112 more in the short period since 1960. This picture is repeated in Victoria and in other parts of Australia and should not be forgotten. Both the Commonwealth and State governments are conscious of the need to determine and identify areas where improvesurvey to which the honourable member referred has been conducted. This survey, conducted by the States, is to determine the needs for the next 5 years in primary and secondard education and in teacher training. Mr N. H. BOWEN-Not in pre-school. This was not part of the terms of reference. The Australian Education Council met on 23rd and 24th February in Perth. I was invited to attend the meeting for part of the about the needs for the next 5 years. What was done was that a working party, which now includes my officers as well as State officers, was appointed to go further into this matter, particularly with reference to uniformity of interpretation in applying the terms of reference to the needs of the various States and questions of priority, and to report again to the Ministers, including myself, towards the end of May.

It was because of the continual incidence of the subsidy that the Commonwealth involved itself with the Tasmanian Government in an effort to see whether a long term solution to the problem could be determined by the construction of a port. The objective was to overcome being involved in a subsidy on freight in the future. The consultants, in fact, reported to the two Governments and as a result of that report favour appeared to be given to some modifications of the existing main port on the island. But this report of course did not take into account the very substantial increase in the minerals that are being extracted on the other side of King Island. As a result of that increase, the mining company involved also had an investigation made of an alternative site for the port, and discussions on that further report by the consultants were then carried on with the Governments and the consultants employed by the two Governments to determine a probable site and the extent to which such a site would provide a reliable and adequate service for the people of King Island. These discussions have not yet been finalised, but the two Governments have been in constant contact with each other and with the company concerned to determine whether a satisfactory port can be built on a site adjacent to the mine on the island. There are difficulties because of the swell of the sea and other difficulties that would seem to prevent the operation of the port at that site throughout the whole course of the year, yet obviously the company will have very real disabilities if it does not have adequate it he is, to the fact that I gave an unqualified opportunity not only to move out the minerals extracted from the mine but also to move into the site the very large capital items that are necessary for mining on the Island. I hope that this problem will be resolved before long, but the main concern of the Commonwealth and the State has been to ensure that there will be an adequate service available to the residents of King Island and that if possible the Commonwealth subsidy ott freight can be eliminated. remember that both the honourable member for Angas and I made representations to him in February on behalf of thc Lord Mayor of Adelaide, who asked if one of Captain Cook's cannon could be sent lo Adelaide for exhibition in April.

The honourable gentlemen on the front bench of the Opposition, who are interjecting, seem to be very toey this afternoon. 1 can understand that they have good reason for being toey, because the Leader of the Opposition has chosen not to deny making allegations which I have no hesitation in characterising as utterly untruthful. The Leader of the Opposition should know that the answer I gave to tbe question earlier this afternoon had the unqualified support and corroboration of my colleague, thc Minister for External Territories.

It is patterned on the jet that many honourable members more fortunate than I have seen at Geneva. The cost of the operation of the jet depends on the number of hours it is functioning, but the cost per hour, when using full power, is approximately $15.

( Mr Beazley) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The handling of entry permits for Indian members of the staff of the University of Papua and New Guinea. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. (More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places) Opposition is mystified at the events surrounding the renewal of the appointment of Mr Idris as a member of the staff of the University of Papua and New Guinea and the appointment of DrI .

We do not ritories ( Mr Barnes) in the explanations he has offered has been correctly reported, but if he has been he has deepened the mystery as far as the Opposition is concerned. Mr Mahommed Idris has been on the staff of the University of Papua and New Guinea for 3 years and apparently he wished to leave the Territory on, leave. He could not get clear whether he would have a permit to re-enter the country. He waited for 7 weeks for the permit, which I imagine upset his personal affairs very considerably, and ultimately the permit came. However, the Minister is reported to have made a statement in relation to these 2 appointments, or rather in relation to the permit for Mr Idris and Dr Khan to enter the Territory, in these terms: The immigration policy for Papua and New Guinea was a long standing one based on the need to avoid the sort of problem which has arisen in other developing countries over the admission of alien racial groups. Australia as a trustee has a special obligation to ensure that an independent Papua and New Guinea was not saddled with a problem of Australia's making.

There are a number of racial problems in emerging countries around the world. For instance, planters for their convenience brought Indian workers into Fiji and Indians now outnumber Fijians. Planters for their convenience brought 46,000 Kanakas into Queensland. Planters for their convenience brought some millions of negroes into the United States of America and into Latin America and for their convenience brought many thousands into the West Indies, so that in consequence the original Indian population has completely disappeared. Then we have the example of the Tamils in Ceylon and the Indians in Natal and up the east coast of Africa. The only force bringing in people on this in the University-that is, the Council of the scale has always been the force of planters. University. The Commonwealth Government If we look at the movement of population and the Administration of Papua and New within Papua and New Guinea, such as the Guinea have been at some pains to make the movement of the Sepiks to Gazelle, which Council of the University both thoroughly has caused some resentment, we see that representative and thoroughly responsible. It the movement has always been for the has made appointments after examining apconvenience of the planters.

What baffles us is his to enter the Territory, such as in the cases application of this idea to the appointment of Gluckman and Worsley, have been stared of two lecturers. Surely it is not seriously straight out to be security questions. So thought that the University of Papua and there is now an implication that any man New Guinea proposes to bring in thousands who is refused permission to enter has some of Indian lecturers. Two men are involved grave security objection against him. and we cannot see the application of an immigration policy to their appointment. case of Mr Idris. He had already been in The second explanation that the Minister any security objection to him, presumably has given since Mr Idris has had his permit his entry permit would not have been to reside in Papua and New Guinea renewed at all.

He waited 4 and apparently was given his permit on months for approval to enter the Territory. 16th March-giv e a day one way or the other. This is a period of 4 months. A delay of this nature can be extremely damaging to a man. I do not know what effect it had on Dr Khan's salary, since he could not be regarded as a member of the Staff of the University of Papua and New Guinea if he had no permit to enter the Territory and since he had resigned from his post in India. But this seems an extremely insensitive way to deal with tbe matter. Then to issue a statement that a immigration policy applied to the man. as if he were a menace who would swamp the country by his own presence, seems a rather tactless handling of the whole situation by the Government. Tbese appointments are made on the recommendation of an academic board withThis would be quite unintelligible in the the Territory for 3 years. If there had been The other case of Dr Khan has never I do not know whether it takes all that long to check up on a man. The United States of America had no objection to him. He was in the United States over a period of time in connection with peace corps work. There is no explanation as to why, in view of the positions he had held in the United States, such a long time was taken in checking up on him-if it was a security check that was being taken. No explanation has ever been offered. As for the two explanations offered by all there were unfortunate circumstances the Minister, the one relating to procedure associated with these delays. I point but is inexplicable because the procedures were that Mr Idris was at liberty to go on leave so slow.

68,Mr Bryant (Wills) [3.38],"There wereSecond Reading Debate resumed from 4 March (vide page 71), on motion by Mr Wentworth: That the Bill be now read a second time. dulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation? Before the debate is resumed on this BillI would like to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the Repatriation Bill as they are associated measures. Separate questions may, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. Mr Deputy Speaker, I suggest that you permit the subject matters of both Bills to be discussed in this debate. speak to that motion? There is no motion before the Chair. It is merely a suggestion made by the Minister to the House. debate earlier is now asking the House for leave to do something else. I will concur on this occasion but I hope it is in the record to show what has happened. no objection, I will allow the course suggested by the Minister to be followed. Bills under consideration propose amendments to the Social Services Act and the Repatriation Act in two essential respects. In the first instance they propose amendments to cover the case of a married couple who, because of illness, infirmity or some similar reason, find themselves forced to part and unable to live in the matrimonial home and the separation is likely to be indefinite. The amendment proposes that in such circumstances the couple who previously obtained the married rate of pension will be entitled to a rate of pension, at the standard rate-that is the single rate. The married rate, of course, for each partner is $13.25 per week and the standard rate is $15 per week. The second aspect covered by the amendments to these Acts is where one of the matrimonial partners dies after the separation. In this instance the surviving partner will be entitled to payment at the married rate, for 12 weekly payments or 6 consecutive fortnightly payments. I ought to mention at this stage that all that this Act proposes to do in the case of the former standard rate of pension where people are separated because of ill health is to formalise a practice which has been upheld for some time by the Department of Social Services and the Repatriation Department. In regard to the latter proposal, the amendment rectifies what has been a rather grave injustice for many years. Many honourable members have had brought to their notice a case where a separation has occurred and a spouse has been committed to a nursing home for care and attention which obviously would be of a permanent nature and, shortly after admission to such an institution, has died. The surviving spouse, being for a very short period on a single rate of pension, has been expected to meet all the costs which arise as a result of the death of the partner. These costs can be quite enormous. This was clearly inequitable for a party in this situation because, as in the outstanding example of a separation of only a few weeks-and this has happened on many occasions-the economic situation of the surviving partner who had had the benefit of a single rate of pension for a very short period alone is hardly improved. I repeat that in respect of this latter proposal the amendment rectifies what has been a grave injustice for many people. BeforeI pass on to a discussion about the anomalies and the deficiencies of the major proposal, I think it appropriate to mention to the Minister for Social Services( Mr Wentworth) that this could have been an occasion on which we could have amended the Social Services Act so as to provide a greater funeral benefit. The present rate for such a social service pensioner recipient is $40. This is scarcely enough to meet the costs of an average sort of funeral. Funeral costs can be a crushing burden for people in the lower income groups, such as recipients of social service pensions or repatriation pensions.",26,Pairs

74,Mr Hayden (Oxiey) [3.45],"The twoThe next point that I want to make before dealing at some length witb tbe proposal is that while we on the Opposition side of the House do not oppose the amendments, this should in no way be interpreted as an indication that we wholeheartedly endorse what has been proposed. The improvement involved in the amendments is only minuscule in comparison with the needs for major overhaul in social service and social welfare provisions in the community. This is especially so if the structure of the social welfare cally mentioned the case of a spouse comprogramme is to penetrate into the heart of what is called the poverty environment and overcome want and deficiency, and to help people to lift themselves up and participate at a level in the economy which will give them self respect and adequacy. The rigidity of the present system of is far from being provided with a sufficency social services and the discontinuities in the of funds through social service payments to various forms of social welfare facilities allow him to maintain what we would regard available only consolidate people in the area as a minimal or respectable standard of of poverty and in the marginal area near that living. threshold. The Opposition would have welcomed the opportunity to move a meaningful amendment to the Social Services Bill, rate paid to single pensioners, stood at 24% but the Government has very cleverly drawn of average earnings. The Government always the Bill in such a way that no meaningful cites average earnings as a marker to show amendment can be moved. So wefindourhow prosperity is moving in the community selves not only restricted in that respect but and allegedly, how well off wage earners also restricted in the area in which we can are in the Australian econonmy. It is fair debate the proposals before the House. The enough to point out that in 1949 the single major proposition, which is to provide a rate of pension was 24% of average earnstandard rate of pension for married couples ings. In the December quarter of 1969 the separated because of illness or infirmity standard rate had deteriorated to 19.4% of where the separation is likely to be of a peraverage earnings, the average earnings then manent nature and takes one partner away being $77.50 a week. For anyone with a from the matrimonial home, merely formalsense of moral commitment for the welfare ises an established practice. It is hard to of one's fellow beings in the community who understand why the Minister was seemingly are in an area of want, we have what should so excited about the proposal when he delivbe an intolerable situation. The Government ered his second reading speech. It was novel is indifferent about this development where only in that the Minister was proposing to the standard rate pension is 19.4% of averenact what was a long standing practice on age weekly earnings, the lowest proportionthe part of the Department of Social ate relationship to average weekly earnings Services. J feel that I ought to commend whoever was responsibleI expect it was the Ministhe House one of the areas which he should ter-for theflexibilitythat was displayed in first have explored was how to provide this instance, of allowing the provision of adequate income for the person on the the standard rate of pension for people standard rate of pension. In fact that would separated in the circumstances mentioned have been insufficient. We are involved when apparently legislative action in the past with more than the case of a person on was not available to legalise this procedure. the standard rate pension; we are involved I want to make it quite clear that we on with all people on pensions generally. The this side of the House do not believe that this proposal will provide an adequacy, or even a sufficiency at a minimal standard, for the people who will benefit from the provisions of the standard rate in the circumstances of separation through ill health and so on. The case where one spouse goes into a nursing home is clearly what is envisaged by the Minister, because he quoted the Prime Minister's policy speech at the last election in which the Prime Minister specifimitted to a nursing home. Clearly, in the case where a spouse is committed to a nursing home and the other one finds himself or herself in receipt of the standard rate of pension, that person in receipt of the standard rate of pension who is outside the nursing home is not in a happy position and In 1949 the standard rate pension, or the in any year since 1949. When the Minister brought the Bill into situation goes beyond this when we discuss the problems of people in poverty. It goes to the low income earner with a large family; it goes into certain migrant groups and reaches into homes where the head of the family is a female on low income. All these things should be looked at. It is quite inadequate for the Minister and the Government to expect when they propose a restricted measure such as this-restricte d in its benefits-that the public should accept at the time of that poverty survey. In 1969 it as some sort of major reform and some sort of major overhaul in the provision of social services in the community. In a community with rising affluence and rising expectations where, most people enjoy the benefits of the rising affluence and therefore satisfy their rising expectations, it is intolerable that a substantial group of people are not enjoying these improving benefits. A Melbourne survey indicated that 7% of the population is in poverty. The level at which that survey was drawn was a rather austere one. What honourable members, used to the standard of living that they shall have to ask him to resume his seat. enjoy, would regard as poverty would be much higher than the level at which the survey was drawn. Order! I would point out to the honourable member for Oxley that he himself has commented on the restrictive circumstances of the Bill before the House and I suggest that he also debate along those lines. indicate that what I have said dovetails very neatly with the Melbourne poverty survey, and I shall relate it to the case of the age pensioners. The survey showed that a little over 21% of aged people were poor. That means that every fifth person in retirement in Melbourne was poor, and the pattern in other cities is as bad. In some cities it probably is worse. On the figures that I have been able to extract fbr Queensland the situation there is probabjy considerably worse than it is in Victoria. The survey showed that nearly half of the people who live in the poverty group and more than half of the people who live in the marginal poverty group were aged people. The poverty level was struck at about persons suffering illness .or infirmity. The 40% of what was regarded as a reasonable honourable member, has referred to the standard of income. On the basis that I have indicated, that the largest proportion of people in the poverty area are aged and most of them are pensioners, it is quite inappropriate for the Minister to come into this House and ignore the needs of these people for the provision of a decent standard of living which will allow them self respect in their retirement. The 1966 standard rate age pension was 21.1% of average earnings it had fallen to 20.3% of average earnings. In a so-called magnificent gesture of generosity the Government, in the last Budget, proposed an increase in the standard rate of age pension. already pointed out to the honourable member that this Bill does not permit a general debate upon social service benefits. The honourable member has been in this House long enough to know the lines along which he should direct his remarks towards the Bill. If he persists in extending his remarks into the wider sphere of social services I shall have to ask you for guidance, and I ask this quite genuinely. The amendments proposed by the Bill relate to standard rates of pension. If you look at the Minister's speech you will find, with respect, that he includes a table and discusses at some length the relative relationship between standard rates of pension and rates for married couples, and compares these with the overall situation. At another stage in his speech the Minister was allowed to include this point, which is germane to my argument: One of Ihe Government's social service aims has been to seek out areas of special need and to bring to this House measures to meet those needs. I find that proposal provocative because I disagree with it completely, but does it not give me the opportunity to debate the correctness of the Minister's assertion that the proposed amendment will improve the lot of these people?

I have allowed the honourable member to use this argument as an illustration but I have said that I will not allow the debate to develop into a general debate about social services. The Bill is related to a special need. Whether the honourable member or the Opposition agrees with that special need is another matter. relates to certain married persons suffering illness or infirmity. The Chair allowed the Minister to say that the Bill related only to persons suffering illness or infirmity and proposed improvements for those people in areas of special need. My case is that there is no improvement for these people. They still have a serious problem. Mr Les Johnson-That is valid. respectI seek your guidance-that my argument is germane to the pattern of the debate set by thc Minister in his second reading speech. once again that the Bill does not open the way to a general debate on social service benefits. The honourable member was developing a wider argument than that allowed by the Bill. I have pointed out that he is not to engage in a general debate on social service benefits. Speaker. I will omit certain notes which, had I been allowed to use them, would have been devastating. It is just as well for the physical and mental welfare of the Minister that I proceed beyond these notes. I move on to discuss the income level proposed for a person committed to a nursing home. The Minister dealt specifically with this point. He said that such a person would be entitled to the standard rate of pension of $15 a week, plus supplementary assistance of $2 a week, making a total of $17 a week. To this we should add $2 a day Commonwealth subsidy. This makes a total of $31 a week. The Minister might like to argue that this person would get $5 a day subsidy if receiving intensive care. The Minister for Health (Dr Forbes) has told us that only one-third of people committed to nursing homes will obtain this benefit; two-thirds will be in receipt of the subsidy of S2 a day. 1 ask the Minister to see whether something can be done to improve the lot of people in these circumstances. A person committed to a nursing home and in receipt of the standard rate of pension will get $31 a week or $4.40 a day. This is totally inadequate for his needs. I know of no nursing home-ther e may be some but they would be relatively few-whic h will provide treatment and accommodation for $4.40 a day. To support my claim I refer the House to statements made by Mrs Murray Coleman, Director of the Victorian Council of Social Services in an address on 21st October 1969 to the Geriatric Conference at Mount Royal Special Hospital for the Aged. She established in her paper that the daily cost of the Mount Alexander Home for the Aged was $6.48; at Greenvale Village it was $9.86. These figures are more than twice the daily allowance paid to a standard rate pensioner admitted to a nursing home-the person to whom, according to the Minister, so much benefit would be directed. Mount Alexander you will know that almost all cases there are intensive. Mount Alexander. Cheltenham Home and Hospital charges $5.13 a day, which is still substantially more than the allowance. Mount Royal charges $6.44 a day. The Minister might be interested in a statement made on 17th May last year by the Victorian Minister for Health, who said: Nearly 18% of patients in nursing home units in all special hospitals for the aged do not receive a supplementary nursing home benefit. They are in fact receiving $2 a day, not the intensive rate of $5 a day. I stress again that the allowance proposed by this Bill will be $4.40 a day or $31 a week, made up of $15 a week standard rate pension, $2 a week supplementary assistance and Commonwealth subsidy of $14 a week. Clearly the Government is jettisoning some of its responsibilities in the field of social services and asking ithe States, which already face grave problems in trying to provide funds to meet their responsibilities, to bear a greater burden. What makes it all the more reprehensible is the fact that the Commonwealth is jettisoning a clear",29,Social Services Bill 1970

85,Mr Hayden,"Al l right, we will omitresponsibility under placitum 51(xxiiiA) of the Constitution, which clearly commits the Commonwealth to providing social services for the Australian community. Admittedly the Constitution does not say that tbe benefits must be at an adequate standard to guarantee a reasonable living to those receiving them, but surely this is a moral obligation which no government should seek to avoid. Clearly many people are not able to afford nursing home care. The lowest figure I have for a nursing home is $5.13 a day, which is 73c a day or $5.11 a week more than the total Commonwealth remuneration for a person admitted to a nursing home. Obviously these people are in dire straits. Where patients are admitted to a State nursing home the Commonwealth is evading its responsibilities and casting them which seems to be the average rental for a on to the States. But the situation is not as Housing Commission tenant in Victoria. simple as that; it is somewhat more critical because almost 50% of nursing home beds in Victoria are privately conducted. In New South Wales about two-thirds of nursing home beds are conducted privately for profit. The people providing those beds will seek a greater return than will be sought by the annexes of public hospitals provided for nursing the aged. Clearly it is irresponsible that mate is proceeding and how that mate's of the Government to shelve its responsibilities in this manner. The Government should accept the provision of nursing home care as a public responsibility, not something to be operated for profit. When one sees nursing home organisations listed on the stock exchange one experiences a sense of alarm at the way in which public money is being allocated for this purpose, particularly when the waiting time for admission into some nursing homes is anything from 9 months to indefinite. I turn now to the situation of the other party in the matrimonial home-the one not admitted to the nursing home. He or she will receive $15 a week plus $2 a week supplementary assistance. I point out to honourable members and to those who may be listening to the debate that the $2 a week are now discussing who is living down the supplementary assistance is payable to persons in very straitened circumstances. To receive this one must have means assessed of less than $52 a year, and this is an extremely low level. Keeping in mind thefindingsof the Marrickville survey of a few years ago that people on a standard rate pension without a home of their own and depending on the supplementary assistance of $2 a week which was then worth more than it is today are in the direst position of all people in the property group, I ask the Minister how a person totally dependent on $15 a week plus the $2 a week supplementary assistance, can gain any real relief from these measures. How does the Minister expect any real relief to be provided by these measures? Quite clearly we needed a more comprehensive, more imaginative, and indeed more adventurous, approach to the needs of people who are dependent on social service payments for their sustenance. Let us take the case of a person who is paying rent and who is not committed to a home-the spouse who is outside thc home. That person is paying $8.80 a week rent, Tbis leaves only $8.20 a week, but out of this we must extract $5.11. a week which covers the nursing cost mentioned earlier. This leaves only $3.09 a week for food, clothing and travel, including travel to the nursing home, because obviously one spouse, who is not committed to an institution, will want to visit his or her mate to see how welfare stands. Imagine, $3.09 a week. This is all we leave these people for the extras in life, including food, which apparently must be a luxury for such a miserable standard to be struck. I ask the Minister: Is this the true measure of the generosity of our society as reflected by his Government? All that is happening here is that a very slight modification of a grave problem of poverty is being proposed when something much better than this should have been achieved. We are living cheek by jowl with poverty in this affluent society, whether this is in large aggregates such as in the slums, or small pockets such as the deserted wives, or the standard rate pensioner in the situation we street. This makes it all the more difficult to understand how the Minister can seriously state in his second reading speech -and 1 have quoted this before, but it bears quoting again: One of the Government's social services aims has been to seek out areas of special need and to bring to this House measures to meet tbese needs. What sort of measure is this that provides S3.09 a week for a spouse who is trying to retain his own health and not be committed to a nursing home? Again, there is the case of a husband who is hospitalised and whose wife is under 60 years of age and is supporting young children. For the purposes of this example we assume that she has two young children. I suppose she can go out to work, but this is not always as simple as it is sometimes claimed. She may have nowhere to leave her children. Only1 child in 13 in Australia is able to attend a child welfare centre which is up to government standards. According to a recent report from the Department of Labour and National Service there are only two child minding centres in Australia operated by employers, and they are in Melbourne. So unless this woman has relatives or friends she will not be able to farm her children out during the day in working hours. Even if she can, this will represent further expense on a slender budget. She has no entitlement to a wife's allowance because this is not provided for all the wives of age pensioners. In the example I am giving I am speaking of a woman who is considerably younger than her husband. There are many such cases. She would not have an entitlement to the wife's allowance once her husband was committed to the nursing home. All she would have would be child endowment of $6.50 a week plus a pension allowance for her children making a total of about $7.50 a week. This is a gravely deficient standard of income for this woman. Frankly, I do not know how people exist in this situation, yet somehow they do and I daresay that this is a testimonial to the endurance and perseverance of people who are in this plight. But we should not impose this sort of grossly unfair endurance and perserverance-thi s sort of self denial and, indeed, discrimination-upo n people in this area. Assume that she has to pay rent of $12 a week and $17 a week for food for herself and her children. This is an extremely austere budget for food and makes no allowance for little extras such as coffee and milk. I am basing this calculation on a New South Wales Health Department estimate. Assume also that she has to pay the extra nursing home cost of $5.11 a week for her husband, and I am basing that cost on the cheapestfiguresavailable. It will be seen that she has a total debt per week of S34.ll. This is considerably higher than her income of S7.50. This does not allow for hire purchase, clothing or travel, and already her weekly deficit is about S26 or $27. Can the Minister genuinely claim that the Government seeks out areas of special need and responds according to the need? On the sort of evidence that I am putting before the House the Government has failed dismally, yet it had a golden opportunity to grapple with this problem in this specific area and to act. It would not have taken a great deal of imagination. Indeed, the Opposition would have given wholehearted support to the Government if it had broadened out the debate by proposing to restructure completely thc pattern of social welfare provided under the Social Services Act. A restructuring is gravely needed. I would stress at this stage that everything I have said about social services applies to the case of a Service pensioner. The same means test and the same rate of pension apply. When I speak about the poverty of the wife under 60 years of age of an age pensioner the same applies in the case of a Service pensioner's wife. Let us move on to the case of invalid pensioners because these, too, are covered by these proposals. Let us consider invalid pensioners where both spouses are in receipt of the pension. The wives of just over 17% of married male invalid pensioners in New South Wales and Victoria also are in receipt of the invalid pension. As two-thirds of the pensioners in Australia live in those two States it is fair to assume that this would be the general pattern for the rest of Australia. According to statistics, 38.6% of married male invalid pensioners in New South Wales and Victoria do not have homes of their own. So here we are dealing with a specific area of grave need which is covered by the amendments which are before the House-o r should be covered, I ought to add, because it is abundantly obvious that what the Minister has proposed is not going to respond to a critical area of need. Let us take the case of a wife who is on an invalid pension and whose husband, also on an invalid pension, is committed to a nursing home. She will have a total income of $24.50 a week. This is made up of the standard rate pension, supplementary assistance, child endowment and pension allowances. I am assuming that she has 2 children. This, of course, is a moderate assumption because the tendency is-and 1 am basing this on my own subjective impressions from dealing with these people-for people in this group to have large families. One probably would find in most cases that families are far larger than 2 and, accordingly, the problem of need is much graver. She has a total income of $24.50 a week. If we allow $12 for rent, $17 for food and the extra nursing cost of $5.11, her total costs are $34.11 a week. This exceeds her income by about $10 a week. The anomaly of this is that she is in exactly the same position as a widow or deserted wife, that is in terms of need as recognised by the Government for social service purposes. She is not in the same position in terms of personal loss through either of those 2 causes. She is in the situation where she is not only devoid of nnancial support from her husband but is having to contribute financially to his welfare. She has at least as much need as an A class widow, but her environmental situation physically and financially is such that her total income is $24.50 a week. If she were in receipt of the A class widow's pension she would receive an extra $10 a week because of the guardian's allowance. Will the Minister be kind enough to exThe level of $2 was struck in 1958. As at plain why this anomaly arises and why he the 1961 census the average weekly private thinks that the wife of an invalid pensioner, dwelling tenancy rate in Australia was herself in receipt of the invalid pension, with $7.87, so the supplementary assistance rate young children, should be receiving an inwas roughly one-quarter of the going rate come $10 a week less than that provided for housing rent at that juncture, which as an A class widow's pension? It seems was altogether too inadequate for the needs difficult to justify this. I cannot justify it of the people. Today, if one is lucky, one myself, but perhaps the Government can. pays an average rental of $12 a week, But it does indicate to me the anomalous which is one-sixth of the supplementary arrangement and total rigidity of the social assistance. Again, here is a case in need of service structure. We ought to throw the overhaul. I have mentioned the deficiency whole lot out the window because of these in the funeral allowance, the gross inadanomalies, this rigidity and the gaps in the equencies and anomalies in pension rates provision which it offers the community. We ought to identify the minimum living pay their rent. Let me repeat once again, standard for adults, either married or single, because it deserves stressing, that not every with dependants and make the necessary pensioner is entitled to this $2 a week supadjustments for the difference between costs plementary assistance. It is only for those of living in different areas. For instance, it pensioners whose total needs as assessed do is dearer to live in Victoria than it is to live not exceed $52 a year. By anyone's in Queensland. Accordingly, we should measurement, given the low rate of pension, establish this threshold wherever it exists and that is not a prosperous standard in this provide for a minimum living standard modern age. which we, as a civilised community in this affluent and prosperous age, are prepared to tolerate. We will not have anyone, adult or child, being forced to live on less than the minimum. Accordingly, this Bill before us never should have come here. The approach of the Minister to the needs of the community should have been as I mentioned. 1 would like to hearken back to the case of the poor pensioner whose wife is under 60 years of age and ineligible for an age pension. Because of this, when her husband, an age pensioner, is comitted to a nursing home and is therefore receiving a little over $7 a week income from the Department of Social Services, in literal fact she would be better off if she were driven mad because of her condition and committed to a mental institution. I feel no pleasure or satisfaction in saying this, but I am quoting a literal case. She would be financially better off, because in all likelihood under the amendments to the Social Services Act last year or thc year before she would have a good chance of becoming entitled to an invalid pension at the standard rate of $15 a week and having her children committed to State care and looked after at the expense of the State. This is a terrible contrast and to me seems to be another anomaly. I come back to the matter of supplementary assistance that I discussed earlier. and, lastly, the failure of the supplementary assistance to help low income pensioners to I conclude on one point. I have already mentioned the need for a new approach to social services. I have a feeling that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, might not allow me to develop that argument, although I feel that there is a need for more discussion on this approach. The other point that I want to mention is germaine to the proposition we have before us. The Minister specifically dealt with nursing home services in his second reading speech. I suggest to him that this too would have been an appropriate occasion to have developed some discussion on domiciliary services, because if we can develop these things we can help in a large measure to keep people out of these nursing homes as we can help to keep them out of hospital-no t that we begrudge them the opportunity of going into hospital. If people need to go into hospital they ought to be admitted. It is pretty grim really that ance with a promise made in the Governorit is so difficult for people to get public ward treatment in Australia, but this is another topic for debate. But in any event many people would ""do better at home and would prefer to be at home, but because of problems at home they have to go to hospital. The expansion of domiciliary services would greatly help to overcome this problem. I am aware that we have domiciliary services available, but they are developed on a spasmodic, ad hoc basis. They are largely dependent on the initiative of local charitable bodies, whether they are churches or benevolent organisations. So their pattern of development is patchy. It is more likely that know that there are many areas of need they are not developing in the areas of greatest need because these are the areas in which there are the biggest concentrations of low income earners and the greatest collection of people, not only pensioners but stated that the poor will always be with us. also low income earners, in need. There are all sorts of social and cultural problems which prevent these people from developing the sort of initiative necessary to establish these services. My final point on very wide sense in regard to social services these matters which I have mentioned is that the approach of the Government is too narrowly conceived compared to the needs of the people in the community. We agree that it is an improvement on the situation which existed before. When I say 'before' I mean before the Government commenced the practice of providing the standard rate of pension for married couples separated because of ill health or some other form of infirmity. In fact, all the proposal does is to formalise a fairly long-established practice. to confine my remarks to the actual Bill. I marvelled at the leniency which you, Mr Deputy Speaker, extended to the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Hayden). He wandered all over the place and talked about everything else but the Bill. He tried to turn a debate on a very simple Bill into an attack on the Government and the Minister for Social Services( Mr Wentworth). Let me read what the Bill says, lt is a Bill to amend the Social Services Act 1947-1969 in relation to certain married persons suffering illness or infirmity. This is a very simple Bill to amend the Social Services Act in compliGeneral's Speech and in the policy speech of the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton). The Prime Minister said: We shall pay pensions at standard rates instead of at married rates to aged couples who lose the economies of living together by reason of failing health, for example, if one or both of them enter a nursing home. This Bill simply amends the legislation so that this can be done.. It is in pursuance of the Government's policy and the Minister's policy to seek out areas of special need and to amend legislation in the interests of those who mpst urgently need assistance. I commend the Minister for this thoughtful amendment to the Act. There is nothing very difficult about the Bill. We in the matter of social services. We know that a great many of these needs have already been provided for, but there will always be areas of need. The scriptures This is true. There will always be areas which it is almost impossible to legislate for. I deprecate an attack on the Minister and an attack on the Government in a when the Minister is trying to amend and improve the Act. I suggest that 95% of the speech of the honourable member for Oxley had nothing whatever to do with the Bill. It is as simple as this: The Bill provides assistance for married couples who are not able to enjoy the benefits and savings, if they are insured, of living together because one partner goes",30,Social Services Bill 1970
86,Mr Pettitt (Hume) [4.21],"I proposeinto hospital. Throughout the world the principle has been adopted that a married couple can live more reasonably than a single pensioner. All the Bill has done is to provide that these people who are living alone because one partner is in hospital shall get the same benefits as single pensioners. It is as simple and as straight forward as that. It is quite a change from the pattern in Australia and overseas. I commend the work that has been done in the nursing homes, and I commend the Minister for the assistance he has given to these people so that they will have a better opportunity. Of course, the Bill will raise the property limit and affect the supplementary assistance eligibility of a married pensioner who is separated from a spouse for health reasons. He or she will be treated as a single pensioner. Without going into any great detail, I give my wholehearted support to the Bill. I Commend the Minister for his diligence' and sincerity in bis difficult lead to a hospital stay of this length. This office as Minister for Social Services. I deprecate petty attacks on him in a debate on a straightforward Bill. I have very much pleasure in supporting the Bill. Dr JENKINS (Scullin) [4.30]Mr generous when we consider these circumDeputy Speaker, I have no desire to delay the passage of these Bills hut having been a medical practitioner and parliamentarian for some years I feel that there are certain matters which require comment and which probably apply to both of these Bills. In themselves, they do appear to correct an anomaly which concerns many honourable members. However, unlike the honourable member for Hume( Mr Pettitt) I despair at the discretion which exists in this proposition that the single pension will be paid to each partner where they are unable to live together through illness or infirmity and so lose the economics of that state and where the inability is likely to continue indefinitely, and I despair too at the very narrowness of the subject matter. One would think that the pension is a generous allowance rather than for many a bare survival allowance below the poverty line. For many couples, a short stay in hospital for one of them can upset the financial balance. I realise that in any public hospital pensioners are treated free. However one partner in that hospital increases expenses. The small amenities that a hospital patient needs, the extra cost of fares for hospital visits, the added costs of food, particularly if it is the male partner left at home to fend for himself, upset the economic balance. I believe that with this term 'indefinitely' we are making it too much for the couple to bear. I believe that this extra allowance should be paid for all but the briefest stay in hospital, if it is to have any meaningful use for the pensioner couple. I come now to an intermediate group of people who may be' affected by this term 'indefinitely'. There are a large number of conditions, some degenerative in their nature such as coronary occlusions, cerebrp vascular accident, trauma resulting in fractured limbs, head injuries or surgical conditions, where one can be. pretty sure that the patient will require 3 months or 4 months hospitalisation. Or, there may be complications following on surgical procedures or medical conditions which may certainly does not fulfil the requirements of 'indefinitely', yet it completely shatters the finely balanced economics of the pensioner couple. Is this amendment to the Act so stances? The statement by the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) in his policy speech prior to the last election, as adverted to by the Minister for Social Services( Mr Wentworth) was: We shall pay pensions at standard rates or at married rates to aged couples who lose the economics of living together by reason of failing health-for example, if one or both of them is in a nursing home. In other words, it should apply to loss of the economics of living together. This may occur and does occur at an earlier stage than what I would feel the plain and ordinary meaning of the word 'indefinitely' conveys. Is the Government merely correcting an anomaly as to matter of degree and leaving a large part of the problem still festering? Surely once the requirement of loss of economics of living together is satisfied, any discretion should only be exercised as to the time such method of payment continues, if and when the loss of economics of living together no longer applies. Surely this would allow this underprivileged group in our community some sort of help. Then, there is the final group which is covered by both criteria. I refer to the loss of economics of living together and such loss being likely to continue indefinitely. Is excess of S60 per week. The payment of the this situation going to be so clear cut? One can consider analogies in otherfieldswhich raise one's doubts as to whether this is so. One of these analogies in the past has been in thefieldof hospital benefits. Many elderly people unable to retain a bed in an acute or public hospital must be accommodated in an approved nursing home and many, for this reason, have held hospital insurance. The benefits here were paid only in special cases where the treatment provided was equivalent to hospital treatment. Now, the discretion here as to whether the service was equivalent to hospital treatment was at thc discretion of the Commonwealth Director-General of Health, just as the interreferring to Alexander Hospital at Castlepretation of the word 'indefinitely' will be at the discretion of the Commonwealth Director-General of Social Services and, in the same way, there is little hope of reversal patients up to intensive care patients or appeal. One elderly couple, who are constituents of mine, will give rise to a claim under this legislation, although they will still be embarrassed by nursing home charges. A geriatrician of Greenvale Village, where the wife was an inpatient, stated that she was suffering from a severe left, hemiplegia and was in need of further treatment. But because of a severe bed shortage this woman was discharged to a private hospital where equivalent hospital treatment could be given. However, despite this statement of a highly qualified specialist geriatrician, the private such social services to the real needs of hospital was considered an approved nursing home and .referral of the claim by the hospital benefits association to the Commonwealth Director of Health led to the determination that she was not entitled to receive the benefit. So, here we have a conflict of opinion between a competent geriatrician and an officer of the Commonwealth Department of Health. May we not get the same situation with this social services legislation as far as the word 'indefithis amendment to our social services nitely' is concerned? It seems to me that the situation could arise where a patient's medical adviser may believe that the aged person should be retained in hospital indefinitely while, in the view of the Department, the aged person is fit to live with his or her partner in the matrimonial home. The case that I have cited has meant depletion of the savings of the couple concerned in meeting heavy hospital fees far in single rate of pension will not make much difference to their case although I am happy to say, as mentioned by the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Hayden), that the Department of Social Services is considering exercising its discretion in this case with regard to the rate of pension even before this legislation is passed. The honourable member for Oxley pointed out the amount which such an aged couple would receive under the circumstances and how it would not cover such hospital, expenses. He quoted thefiguresfrom Mrs Coleman for the Alexander Hospital. I think that the Minister was mistaken here. Mrs Coleman would be maine where the patients certainly in the majority are not intensive care patients but where the grading ranges from ambulatory throughout that institution. So, I think a valid point exists in the claim by the honourable member for Oxley that the amount is $9 per day, if I am correct in my assumption on the institution. I am concerned at the narrow field to which this legislation has been restricted. I believe that it touches one end of the problem only. It raises many doubts in my mind as to its efficacy. It shows a glimmer of knowledge of the problems that face pensioner couples. It serves to highlight other problems that exist. Only when we relate individuals in terms of the dignity, self respect and values that they deserve in their lives can we be satisfied. Earlier, I ajl -a question with regard to the establishment of a chair of gerontology in Australia. I believe that the work that would be carried out in this sort of area might well have given much more informed opinion of the circumstances that surround legislation. While the Minister claims that this is a further step in the Government's concerted, programme of assisting those with special needs, I see it as no more than lip service to such a problem, serving only as an escape for the Government to reassure those of its supporters who are clear headed enough to see this as an anomaly and, in fact, letting the Government get away with as little as the traffic can bear. heard two harangues in regard to this legisservices when all we want to do is to enable lation which is quite simple and was introthe Government to honour its promise to duced as a result of a promise made in the pay tbese people their extra pensions, to get speech of the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) the Royal Assent and let the people conbefore the last election when he said: We shall pay pensions at standard rates instead job.

88,Mr Les Johnson (Hughes) [4.44],"Ioutlined. We say that the Government is niggardly and that the legislation is petty even though we concede that it has some value. I presume that this legislation will benefit couples whose separation by way of admission to a hospital or nursing home is of a permanent and long term nature, which is likely to be the general circumstance of tbe couples concerned. There has been no prediction as to the number of people who may benefit, but I think it is fairly safe to say that the vast predominance of pensioners are not likely to benefit from these provisions for reasons which I hope to be able to outline. In other words, this is not major legislation at all. But it could be the most significant legislation under the social welfare heading which the Parliament is to deal with in 1970. If that is the case-and 1 think it is-it is very difficult to see the intent of the Government in restricting the scope of this debate. I have taken the opportunity. Mr Deputy ""Speaker, as no doubt you have yourself, to look over the Governor General's Speech, which outlined the legislative intentions of the Government for the current year and I detected that nothing of a substantial nature in regard to social services Senate election and that it will not be of a was indicated in that Speech at all. The Speech was silent on very important matters affecting the welfare of aged people in our community and, indeed, invalids as well. There was no mention of any government plan to alleviate the means test. -Order! I would suggest that the honourable member for Hughes has had enough experience in this Parliament to know that he is getting a little wide of the Bill. The honourable member mentions certain things that are not dealt with in the Bill, but he cannot make a' speech on those. I would suggest that he take note of the provisions of the Bill. amend the Social Services Act in relation to certain married pensioners suffering illness or infirmity. Now, I do not want to develop any matters at all in connection with the means test, though I think it is fair to contend that if the means test had been alleviated it would have had an important and relevant bearing on the title of this Bill, lt is enough in the way of a generality to say that there are many matters excluded and the foremost among them is the means test. Other things, of course, would include automatic pension increases and the need for an all round pension increase. One would have thought that in the early stages of this Parliament we may have had, instead of this restricted style of legislation, something in the nature of a blueprint to take Australia's welfare programme into the 1970s. After all, for 60 long years our basic approach to social services has remained unchanged and we have walked the treadmill of the status quo. It seems that we will go on doing so, except for some very petty and fairy ineffective amendments. Retirement in Australia is still synonymous with charity and often with poverty. Tbis Bill will not do much to alleviate the poverty that afflicts people who are suffering from illness and infirmity. Here in this legislation is the time honoured connotation of the dollar complex and the inevitable and mercenary relationship of social welfare legislation to a forthcoming election. I predict that we will have some other legislation between now and the serious nature. If we look at the history of social service legislation we see usually that some benefit is given not in the period following an election but in the period preceding an election. Usually nothing substantial is done in the 2 years immediately following an election. Apparently just enough will be done this year to prepare for the forthcoming Senate election. It is pretty unhappy for pensioners to recognise that they must wait until 1972 before something further will be done. Order! 1 pointed out to the honourable member for Hughes only a few moments ago that this Bill does not give rise to a general debate on social service matters. account that this legislation deals with 705,000 age pensioners and another 121,000 invalid pensioners, or a total of 627,000 pensioners and 20,000 dependents, it is important to speculate as to the number who may be affected by the precise provisions of it.

92,Mr Les Johnson,"When we take intothe principal purpose of the Bill is to assist those people who are going into nursing homes. 1 should have thought that it would have been a bona fide action for an honourable member to look at the cost of nursing homes and so gauge the extent to which this legislation will meet the requirements for which it is intended. If the Minister does not agree with that point of view, I would regard the proceedings today as a farce. This would prevent any reasonable opportunity to talk sensibly about anything relating to the Bill. In my view the principle of Commonwealth support should now be extended to the provision of public nursing home services and especially to hospitalisation. The Bill provides an extra $1.75 a week to married pensioners who separate through the need to enter nursing and rest homes. Through its cohtisrued indifference, the Government has allowed these services to fall outside its control. They have come to be regarded as the responsibility of private rather than public enterprise. This industry is so lucrative that in New South Wales alone the number of nursing homes increased by 1,700 in 1966 and 1,100 in 1967. Order! As I have already pointed out to the honourable member for Hughes, this legislation does not allow a general debate on social services nor does it provide for a debate especially on nursing homes.

The reason for this is that, and the supplementary pension in aggregate as soon as the pensioner's home is vacated, would have provided sufficient income to its value is taken into account in assessing enable a pensioner to go into a nursing the rate of pension payable. In other words, home. The only way this can be shown is to ascertain the cost of a nursing home. Surely the Parliament is entitled to know the extent to which the legislation meets its intended purpose. If it is not entitled to know that, all I can say is that I have never before seen such an incredibly narrow restriction placed on the debate of a Bill. 1 do not know why the Minister would seek this protection, if he has in fact sought it. If he has not sought it and does not require it, if he believes that a case can be made out to show that the Government is providing adequately to meet the needs of pensioners who go into nursing homes, we should be allowed to debate these matters in a more effective way. However, I can see, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you are not inclined to exercise much tolerance in that direction. Order! This is not a matter of tolerance from the Chair. It is a matter of the subject that is before the House. The honourable member for Hughes should remind himself of that, also. Deputy Speaker. In my analysis of nursing home care, I intend to show that the provisions of the Bill are hopelessly inadequate and that pensioners who go into nursing homes and lose the economies of living together are being given an infinitesimal and inadequate amount of assistance. But I am unable to continue with that line. Heaven knows when anyone would be able to engage in such a debate. However, I will The effect of the means test on the proister during this debate.

96,Mr Les Johnson,"Thank you, Mrthe value of the home would be regarded in precisely the same way as if it were money in the bank. It seems to be implied in what the Minister has said and in the general theme of this debate that, because couples are required to separate through illness and therefore lose the economies of living together, they will be emancipated and assisted by this legislation. However, the fact is that in many instances when a pensioner couple leave their borne because of sickness their pension will be substantially cut or eliminated altogether. They will lose every consolation and comfort to which they may have been entitled for many years. 1 think this is a pertinent matter to raise when debating this legislation. As I understand it, if a couple with an income from superannuation of $20 a week had to leave a modest bouse valued at about $27,000, they would lose all their pension entitlement. Similarly a widowed pensioner with no incomeI do not mean a lady who is receiving a widow's pension but a widowed age or invalid pensioner-woul d lose all pension entitlement if forced to vacate a home valued at about $25,000. These are not exceptional circumstances. Lots of people are in that situation. Together with other honourable members. I have encountered that kind of case on many occasions. I believe that in cases like this, where the home is abandoned because of medical reasons or through tbe inability of a pensioner to care for himself or herself, the value of the vacated property should be disregarded altogether. But under the provisions of the Social Services Act there will be no amelioration at all of the plight of the pensioners. In fact the likelihood is that ( Mr Hayden) and then the honourable memtheir plight will be aggravated. I ask the Minister for Social Services( Mr Wentworth): Has he ever thought of the great benefit that would accrue to Australian pensioners who are separated because of sickness and who lose the economies of living together, if the Department of Social Services did not, as at present, take the value of their home into account so that it adversely affects their pension? Has this been considered in a compassionate and enlightened way so as to give these people exemption from these inhuman and stringent measures which, from my experience, cause difficulty, hardship and tremendous anxiety to large numbers of pensioners? The Government consistently has declined to eliminate the means test and that is one of the reasons why this problem emerges. If the means test had been eliminated, as proposed by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) during the last election campaign, the matter to which I have just referred would not be a problem today for aged people. The iniquitous means test currently is excluding 500,000 people of pensionable age from the pensions scheme. It has an effect on people who leave their homes because of sickness. This Bill will not bring any substantial alleviation to the problems of age married pensioners who are separated because of illness and inability to care for themselves. They may get an extra $1.75 a week through the provisions of this Bill but this will not enable them to meet the rising costs of nursing home care. In my view the Minister and the Government should look again at this matter. More importantly, the Government should recast Australia's social welfare provisions to lay a basis for the remaining years of the 20th century. Its aim should be that all our citizens may enjoy the security and peace of life that stems from the knowledge that in every eventuality the rights, well being and dignity of the frail, the sick and the aged will be upheld and properly safeguarded. Speaker, I was rather amazed to hear, firstly, the honourable member for Oxley ber for Hughes( Mr Les Johnson) take the line that they took this afternoon in attempting to debate the broad issues of social services. Both honourable members have had ample experience in this House to know that there are plenty of opportunities for them to raise questions of a general nature relating to social services. They can do so in the Address-in-Reply debate. They can do so during the debate on the Estimates. In fact there are all sorts of opportunities-eve n when i:L..:>ns the motion for the adjournment of the House-for them to do so. I am amazed that they should have taken that line this afternoon.",39,Social Services Bill 1970
97,Mr King (Wimmera) [4.3],"Mr DeputyIn brief, the two Bills we are discussing are aimed at amending the Social Services Act and the Repatriation Act. It is intended to increase the married rate pension to that of a single rate in cases where married couples are separated and do not have the financial advantage of living together, or, in the words of the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Holten), to provide 'increased pensions for married means test pensioners who lose the economies of living together because of failing health'. The honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins) referred to people being hospitalised. I think the honourable member should have another look at the Social Services Bill because clause 3 (c) refers to: (a) the living expenses of a married person and the husband or wife of that person are, or are likely to be, greater than they would otherwise be by reason that those persons are unable, as a result of the illness or infirmity of either or both of them, to live together in a matrimonial home; and (b) the inability is likely to continue indefito eligible married couples from $26.50 to nitely, . . . I believe that the honourable member for Mitchell( Mr Irwin) answered this doubt in the mind of the honourable member for Scullin and did so quite satisfactorily. After all, as the honourable member for Mitchell said, when a person is in a home the situation is different from that which exists when a person is in a hospital. These Bills are very limited in scope. I do not intend to traverse all angles of social service or repatriation problems. 1 want to raise the question of chronic cases. I believe such cases are covered by the preamble to the Bill because it uses the words 'illness' and 'infirmity*. Under the repatriation provisions, all pensioners receiving pensions of 100% or above are entitled to free medical treatment but this does not necessarily apply so far as a chronic case is concerned. The only time that a chronic case can receive free medical treatment, following upon declaration that the case is chronic, is when the person concerned can qualify under the means test for ordinary social service assistance. In other words, to cut this down to brief terms, one can say that the phrase 'a person with means' really means that one must first spend one's own money before becoming entitled to assistance. I think most people would agree that the they will be implemented in a very short people in real need are those with the worse period of time. types of illness-in other words the chronic cases. These patients should receive more consideration than persons with temporary illnesses. If a person stubs his toe and loses a day's work it is not a terrible tragedy. It is the people who are bedridden or hospitalised because of chronic illness that we should look at very closely. I know that the new Minister for Repatriation is very sympathetic to this class of people and I know he is looking closely into their circumstances. I am sure the Government also agrees that we must endeavour to do something along these lines to help those people because they are the people in most need. It does not matter whether this aid takes the form of hospital and benefit fund assistance or whether it is dealt with in our social service legislation or by some other means; we have to do something about these people. These Bills will increase the rate payable $30 per week. The increase relates to those married couples who virtually are living apart and thus come within its scope. We must not overlook the fact that such people are also entitled to a supplementary allowance of $2 each, making a total of $4 a week, if they have income of not more than $3 a week each, or $6 for the married couple. I have noted that under the means test being implemented this would be the highest rate of earning that one could have and become a pensioner. Under the ordinary means test a married couple may earn $70 a week whereas it is proposed to increase that sum to $77. This is very important. If one looks at the means test relating to property the figure is being increased to $40,840. This is a very substantial increase and, of course, will help a lot of people in this category. I do not wish to speak at any length this afternoon because these Bills are self explanatory. I do not think there is any need to go into details. I commend the Minister for Social Services( Mr Wentworth) and the Minister for Repatriation for bringing forward legislation to deal with a situation which most people regarded in the past as anomalous. I hope the Bills will have speedy passage through this House and that say only a few words on this Bill this afternoon and with my knowledge of the standing orders of the Parliament you may be assured, Mr Deputy Speaker, that as usual I will stay within the scope of the Bill. I support the Bill because one has to be grateful for the morsels that fall from the rich man's table, and that applies particularly to social services where the Government in bits and pieces, by a method of stop and go and by a patching up system occasionally gives some benefit to this most deserving secrion of the community. The legislation under discussion today gives benefits to a very deserving section of people who are suffering in poverty in many cases because of their low incomes and the high cost of living. But it is significant that only the very minimum is given to the most deserving, as exemplified in this Bill. Why, the Minister for Social Services( Mr better off than if they were to go through Wentworth) did not even tell us in his second reading speech how many persons were involved in a given year-ho w many would be covered by the legislation. Generally the first thing he says when he introduces legislation in the Parliament is: This will cover 10,000 or 20,000 families or something like that. The Minister well knows that, deserving as the legislation is, it covers only a tiny number of that deserving section of pensioners in the community. Why did he not tell us the cost involved in this measure? It must be very small or the Minister would have skited about it. The fact: of the matter is that so small is this benefit to this deserving section that the Minister will not tell us how many are involved; he will not tell us the cost involved in a full year. Therefore, I would like to hear the Minister express his views on this point because it is terribly important to all concerned. The Government always talks big and acts small. I make passing reference ried rate and 1 suppose there are the sick, to the fact that the Government introthe dead, the weakening and the nearly duced a measure for a subsidy on meals. dead. The Government is categorising a It said that it would give $1 for every 10 section of society instead of having a wide meals. That sounded a lot better than 10c and extensive scheme to cover all aged and a meal. In other words, the Government sick people, to give them all benefits, whatmisleads, misconstrues and at the same ever category it might say they are in. But time gives the impression that it is doing in the most mean and contemptible way a major task but is doing practically the Government has put them into sections nothing at all. When legislation was introduced for a married and single rate pension I moved an amendment on behalf of the Opposition that said it was discrimination of the worse type and that there should have been a base rate for all pensioners with people most deserving receiving special assistance. Because of the discrimination between married and single pensioners that this Bill deals with today, the anomaly the Government is trying to remove is one of the many that exist in tbe legislation. Discrimination of the worse kind, anomalies by the thousand and injustices that are multiplied many times have come from this change in making married and single rates. All rates should have been increased to a substantial base amount and benefits then given to the most needy and not in this piecemeal way. J wonder whether the Minister realises that people living in sin today would be the sacrament of marriage. In other words, it has become a penalty to be a decent citizen if one is a married pensioner and carries out one's matrimonial obligations. The Government has now found that this discrimination occasionally has to be relieved. I had a case covered by this legislation some years ago where a married couple were in a home and tbeir pensions were accordingly reduced because of that. The Bill before the House will overcome this situation; but the anomalous situation arises out of the Government's own legislation. Therefore we find today that the Government has had to introduce an amendment. Is it not amazing that even in the second reading speech the Minister told us that the legislation is to 'seek out areas of special need and to bring to this House measures to meet those needs'. Why does tbe Government categorise these poor people? We have the aged and the frail aged: the ill and the very ill; the care and the intensive care. We have standard rate and marand categorised them simply because of",40,Social Services Bill 1970
98,Mr Daly (Grayndler) [5.10],"I wish to their disabilities, their want and their need. Yet we are now living in the 1970s and men have landed on the moon. The Minister boasted what he would do for people who wanted social services. He was going to abolish the means test and give to the needy and others all those benefits so necessary. He now brings down legislation in a boastful way but gives no costs, no facts and no numbers of those involved. This piecemeal legislation gives the very minimum to a very deserving section. The Minister, in his second reading speech, gives the record of the Government. He points out: The House may be interested in comparative been introduced. figures showing the Australian position in this regard as compared with the position in certain other countries. He referred to pensionsThis can be measured by expressing the single pension as a percentage of the pensions received by a married couple. This is set out in the followwe get from this Government be it great ing table . .' . The Minister said that Australia's single rate as a percentage of the married couple rate is 56.6%. or 64.2% if you like to take in the supplementary assistance. The figure for France is 66.6%. Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think that France would head us off in the field of social services. Italy is 90.9%. This is a country that was crushed in a great world conflict and which has arisen from the ashes, as it were. Italy now leads us by roughly 30% in the field of social welfare. We find that the figure for the Netherlands is 70.3%. which is well above the maximum the Government allows of 64.2% in Australia. New Zealand is the only country that has dropped behind us and it has a good excuse --it has a Liberal government, so we cannot expect much to happen there. The figures show that New Zealand is going backwards just as we are going backwards. In Sweden, where the people have had a Labour government for many years, they have a figure of 63% which is above the base amount here without the supplementary assistance. The United Kingdom figure of 58.8% is still above the Australian level. The United States, with due respect to it, was one of the few countries, until the Kennedys came to light which never thought much of social welfare, heads Australia by 12% at 66.6%. That is a damning indictment of the Government's policy-the slip in social welfare in this country after 20 years of administration by it is shown by the fact that we have dropped behind countries that never thought of having a social welfare scheme in days gone by. That is why today I condemn to some extent the Minister for his failure to see that we lead other countries, as we did when Labor was in office, in the field of social welfare and that the needy and the deserving get the assistance to which they are entitled. That is why I would like to see the Minister explain why these piecemeal bits of legislation have been introduced and no effective and extensive scheme has We took a backward step for years when we discriminated between pensioners. That is why today 1 add my voice of protest, though not so much about what is in the Bill because we should be grateful for what or small, because we will never get anything great in this human field. At the same time. I think we have an obligation to pensioners from one end of this country to the other to get up and condemn the Government that spends unlimited funds on everything one can think of except social welfare. 1 Why, if the Government spent in this field alone a fraction of what it has spent on the great plane that will not fly it would be looked upon as the greatest government of our time. TodayI heard in this Parliament that we are to spend $20,000 a year to spout some water into Canberra's lake to celebrate the discovery of this country some 200 years ago. I bet this Bill does not cover a fraction of the $20,000 that the Government is to spend on a jet or water spout to celebrate Captain Cook's arrival. These things cry to high heaven for some people to wake the Government up about them. TonightI place on record my condemnation of a government that spends money on all kinds of things but the very minimum on those that really need it. I hope the Minister will have a revival of that rebellious spirit he displayed when he was fighting his way to the front line where he sits today. I would like to see him dc for the people under his control what he promised to do if and when he was in government. But I look somewhat sadly at him. I think the old rebel has died, you know. He is a very tame member today. Consequently those great ideals he expressed have now passed into oblivion. He just goes along the track hoping that a little morsel here and there will please these people and at tbe same time honour the Government's minimum obligations to the aged and invalid pensioners in this country. 1 know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you realise that not once have I digressed and made remarks outside the scope of this legislation. I thank you. Mr Deputy Speaker, for the understanding way in which you bave interpreted the Standing Orders. Having said so much, let me again express my support for the measure so far as it goes, although I condemn it for the limits placed upon it. ] express the hope that if the Government can find $20,000 a year to spout water into Ihe air to honour Captain Cook it will put some money into pensions. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Motion (by Mr Wentworth) proposed: That the Bill be now read a third time. like to ask the Minister for Social Services( Mr Wentworth) a question in relation to the amending Bill. Clause3 (c) refers to a couple who are forced to part and who are unable to live together in a matrimonial home. It has been suggested to me, although I have no personal experience of a constituent in such circumstances, that there have been cases where both partners to the marriage have been forced out of the matrimonial home and have gone into nursing homes. In some cases they have been in the same nursing home but in separate wards. I have been asked to inquire from the Minister whether in this situation they would both be entitled to the standard rate of pension. ister for Social Services) [5.22]-in replyI am grateful for the question from the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Bill read a third time. Hayden). I am happy to give him the assurance that under this Bill the standard rate of pension will be paid even though both partners to the marriage are in the same nursing home, and if otherwise entitled they will both have the rights to supplementary assistance. I think there has been a certain amount of misunderstanding in this regard. Under the present practices of the Department of Social Services, which have been in vogue for a couple of years, we had created the fiction of considering a couple as not being married. This Bill will make it unnecessary to continue that fiction. table. will also have some good side effects for them. If they are considered to be unmarried they lose the benefit of the halving provisions of the Act and this in its turn may also affect their rights to supplementary assistance. The Bill will restore that. The Bill is not negligible. The honourable member is perfectly right that under that existing practice as it stands at the moment married rates of pension are paid only to a married couple living under separate circumstances in the same nursing home. The Bill will correct that situation. Therefore it is not a negligible Bill. As I said in my second reading speech some married couples will receive as much as $7.50 extra a week because of this Bill. 1 wonder whether the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) would allow me to correct a misapprehension which is in his mind. He referred to a table in my second reading speech. Unfortunately he misread the table and drew exactly the wrong conclusion from it. Those countries which have the higher proportions have the greater differentiations between married and single rates. If the policy of the Opposition were brought into operation Australia would then be on 50%, and that would be very bad by his own reckoning. \ am afraid that the honourable member for Grayndler misunderstood the table and got it upside down.

This Bill is concerned with the first grant to be made under the new national water resources development programme which State of Queensland for a grant under the programme of up to $ 12.8m for specified works in the Bundaberg region.

This new programme follows the original national water programme which provided over $50m in grants to the States. Under the division of constitutional on rural water development works. The demand for assistance with these works indicated the need for an extension and accordingy the new programme was commenced.

At the same time, a was foreshadowed. The Kolan-Burnett",44,Social Services Bill 1970

104,Mr Swartz (Darling Downs,"Minister further submission dealing with the Burnettproposal was examined by the Commonwealth but was not included in the short list of projects for detailed examination in the programme. In March 1969 the State submitted a new proposal embracing in the one project most of the Bundaberg cane growing region and superseding the earlier proposals, but at that stage the final move towards closer collaboration between allocations in the national water programme were being determined. In September 1969 the Queensland Government announced the allocation of S8.3m for works which were considered particularly urgent in view of the increasing seriousness of the position with regard to underground supplies in the coastal area. Following the announcement by the Prime Minister in October 1969 that the national water programme would be extended by the provision of $100m over the next 5 years for water resources development in the States, the Queensland Premier submitted a request for $12.8m, being the estimated cost of the Monduran Dam and pumping station and inter-river connecting channel. Because the project had been under study for some time and the need for remedial measures was apparent the Queensland request received early consideration. Details of the scheme are contained in the explanatory memorandum distributed with the Bill. I turn now to the Bill itself, which generally follows the pattern of measures granting financial assistance to the State and stability and prosperity of the region. I Acts previously passed by the Parliament for particular projects assisted under the first programme. The works themselves, in respect of which a Commonwealth grant is payable, are described in the Schedule to the Bill, and provision is made in clause 5 for the Schedule to be varied if this appears desirable in terms of the objectives of the legislation. Provisions for non-repayable grants is made in clause 4 of the Bill. Clauses6 and 7 set out requirements in connection with the implementation of the project and cover the provision of information requested by the Minister, ministerial approval of the works, action by the State to provide the other works which make up the total project, and approval by the Minister of contracts in excess of $500,000. Requirements for information in respect of 10722/70-R-[20 1 expenditure are set out in clause 8, and the usual provision for the Treasurer to make advance payments and for repayment of over-payments are made in clauses 9 and 10. The national water resources development programme represents a very important the State and Commonwealth governments in the development of Australia's water resources. The present legislation will give effect to the first decision of the Government in connection with the extension of this important programme and will provide support for a project of national significance. The Bundaberg region is at present suffering from two severe disabilities. The dry farmed canelands are subject to wide fluctuation in yield and under present marketing conditions farmers cannot compensate for poor years with production much above peaks in good years. The resultant inefficiency, added to the widely fluctuating income, when set against continually rising costs is producing serious economic problems in the district. On the other hand the bulk of the irrigation is dependent on supplies which are likely to fail if withdrawals continue at the present rate. In spite of recent rains underground water levels in the vicinity of Bundaberg are the lowest ever recorded. On both counts therefore remedial measures aimed at providing an assured water supply are urgently required in order to maintain the have much pleasure in commending the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Patterson) adjourned. Bill presented by Mr Swartz, and read a first time. Second Reading for National Development) [5.37]I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to ratify the sixth further amending agreement to the River Murray Waters Agreement. The principal purpose of the amending agreement is to provide for the construction of a major storage near Dartmouth on the",45,Queensland Grant Bundaberg Irrigation Works Bill 1970
105,Mr Swartz (Darling Downs,"Ministe rMitta Mitta River, a tributary of the Murray upstream of Hume Reservoir, as the next major development of the River Murray system. At the same time a number of amendments have been made in relation to the functions and operations of the River Murray Commission and some minor amendments have been incorporated to delete obsolete provisions in the principal Agreement and to effect a few other minor amendments of a textual nature. The background to this development, involving suspension of work on the Chowilla storage and its replacement by the Dartmouth storage as the next major development, has been given in a number of documents published by the River Murray Commission and in statements made to this House by the previous President of the River Murray Commission, my predecessor as the Minister for National Development. I do not therefore propose to go into this whole matter in detail once again but would be happy to answer any questions that may arise in the discussion of this measure. It will' suffice at this stage to say that at appointed by the River Murray Commission the time of its authorisation by the four contracting governments, the Chowilla storage was estimated to cost $28m. In March 1966 as a result of more detailed design studies prior to the calling of tenders the estimated cost was revised to $43m. When tenders were considered in April 1967 the most favourable tender received resulted in a further upward revision of the cost to $68m. Obviously, an increase of about 250% in the estimated cost over a period of 4 years raised doubts as to whether the early basis for selection of Chowilla as the most favourable development for the next stage was still valid. Accordingly it was agreed that work on the Chowilla storage should be suspended to enable a new comparison to be made between it and other possible developments in the upper Murray catchment, which had been considered in the earlier studies. These investigations, taking into consideration also the changing operational requirements along the river to control salinity, showed that for a similar capital expenditure the Dartmouth storage can be expected to provide over 1 million acre feet per annum of additional water in the River Murray system compared with an increase of between about 190,000 and 380,000 feet per annum in the case of Chowilla, depending upon operating criteria. Furthermore, the studies showed that with Dartmouth storage South Australia's increased entitlement will be provided with even less restriction than would have applied to the smaller entitlement with the Chowilla storage. Over the period since 1906 on which the studies were based there would have been only a very minor restriction in 1 year. The recent studies involved a substantial revision of the early assessment of the benefits that can beexpected from Chowilla. Tbis revision was related not only to changing operational requirements on the river but also to revised assessments of other factors such as evaporation losses from the Chowilla storage which, in the light of more recent data, were substantially increased. In addition, in the recent study the whole operational programme was simulated on an electronic computer by means of which it was possible to examine alternative proposals in much greater detail than hitherto. At the same time, consultants to advise on all aspects of salinity advised that the Dartmouth storage would have very little affect on salinity in the lower river, and that although Chowilla would reduce the short term peaks in salinity which occur from time to time in most seasons, and would affect a small reduction in the average salinity, it would also significantly increase the salinity during severe droughts when conditions are generally at their worse. Accordingly, it was considered that the effects of these 2 storages on salinity were not sufficiently different to be an important factor in the selection of the next major development. Against the above background the 4 contracting governments have agreed to proceed with the Dartmouth storage, subject to a number of important conditions. The first of these is that taking into consideration the additional quantity of water provided by the Dartmouth storage, compared with the Chowilla storage, South Australia's entitlement to water should be increased from 1,254,000 acre feet of water per annum to 1,500.000 acre feet. I would stress here that the figure of 1,254,000 acre feet was to have applied after the completion of Chowilla and this remained unchanged from when the Agreement was first signed in 1915. The significance of this increase of nearly 250,000 acre feet in the South Australian entitlement is, however, greater than thefigureswould suggest. The total entitlement includes an allowance at present assessed at 564,000 acre feet per annum, for losses such as seepage and evaporation. Hence the net divertible component of the entitlement is only 690,000 acre feet. Another important condition of the States' acceptance of the Dartmouth storage was that the Commonwealth should provide some financial assistance. I am pleased to say that agreement was also reached on this point and in conjunction with this Bill, my colleague the Minister assisting the Treasurer ( Mr Lynch) will be introducing a Bill dealing with financial agreements with the States on this matter. It was also agreed that in order to ensure the availability of adequate supplies of water in the lower river, the Menindee Lakes Storage Agreement which had been regarded as a temporary measure pending completion of Chowilla, should be continued indefinitely. There were some other conditions associated with Dartmouth including an adjustment in the sharing of water between New South Wales and Victoria whereby Victoria cedes to New South Wales thc right to use certain quantities of inflow to the Murray from Victorian tributaries below Albury. Also certain procedures were laid down for regulation of the river with a view to controlling salinity in the lower reaches. Earlier studies had led to the belief that following the construction of Chowilla the 2 upstream States would each receive substantial additional supplies after providing that South Australia would receive its entitlement of 1,254,000 acre feet per annum without restriction in all but a very few years of severe drought. The upstream States entered into commitments for the use of water from the Murray system in anticipation of the availability of additional supplies. Severe curtailment of deliveries in the 2 upstream States can be"" expected in the event of the recurrence of some of the earlier severe droughts, until the Dartmouth storage comes into operation. It is therefore a matter of considerable urgency that the additional storage be provided in order to avoid the widespread disruption that would occur In the whole of the Murray Valley in the event of a severe drought. Detailed economic studies of the benefits from this storage would be a very difficult and complex exercise, but I would point out that the capital cost of the storage per acre foot of additional water supplied per annum, which is only slightly over $50 per acre foot is exceptionally low by present day Australian standards and indicates the economic justification for the proposal. Turning now to the Dartmouth Reservoir itself, the dam will consist of a central earth core flanked on either side by material increasing in coarseness with an outer shell of quarried rock. The embankment will be approximately 590 feet high above foundation, the crest length 2,300 feet, and the volume of fill about 20 million cubic yards. A spillway with fixed crest 300 feet long is proposed on the left bank of the dam site, discharging through a short length of concrete lined chute into the rock quarry, where the energy of the water will be dissipated over a series of cascades. Final investigations and designs may lead to some modification of the general arrangement at present proposed. Investigations are proceeding to determine whether power generation facilities should be included with the dam, but any such works would be financed by the Electricity Commission of Victoria and would not affect the functioning of the storage for water supply purposes. It is proposed that the constructing authority, the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission of Victoria, will retain the Snowy Mountains Authority as consultants to carry out the detailed design and preparation of contract documents for the project. I should perhaps say a word or two about the operation of the storage, since it has from time to time been questioned whether it is possible for it to provide an additional supply of over 1 million acre feet per annum in the system, when the mean annual discharge at the dam site is only about 700,000 acre feet per annum. At present, water is released from Hume storage only when inflows downstream are insufficient to meet requirements along the river. Bv an extension of this same principle, water would be released from Dartmouth storage when the Hume storage, which is further downstream, has been emptied, or when it is apparent that the storage will fail unless unexpected inflows occur. Thus the 3 million acre feet storage in Dartmouth will be available for release during periods in which shortages would otherwise occur, and the net result of this is that the inflow to the system, including inflow from tributaries below Hume, can be used more efficiently. 1 will now refer to the main provisions of the Agreement. The construction of Dartmouth Reservoir is provided for in clause 10(b) which inserts a new paragraph in clause 20 of the principal Agreement. In view of. the size and cost of this work it has been considered desirable to include in its description the estimated cost, in preference to the earlier procedure of amending clause 32 of the principal Agreement which previously gave the sum of the total costs of the completed works, and the estimated cost of the proposed new work. As a result of the inclusion of the Dartwouth Reservoir in the Agreement a number of consequential changes have been made to other clauses, many of which are of a purely routine nature and will not be mentioned further. Since the Agreement did not allocate responsibility for construction of works on tributaries above Hume Reservoir, this has now been added in terms of clause 11. Clause 13 provides for ithe deferment of construction of the Chowilla Reservoir as agreed by the four governments. The Lake Victoria storage is of great importance to South Australia as a source of water close at hand, particularly for the purposes of salinity control. Its effectiveness is determined partly by the size of the inlet and outlet works, and studies in this connection are at present in progress. For this reason, clause 10 (a) provides for an amendment to the description of the Lake Victoria works which will permit additional work to proceed on the basis of agreement by the 4 governments. The other major change resulting from the Dartmouth project is the agreement to continue the Menindee Lakes Storage Agreement indefinitely. As1 bave mentioned, this Agreement was earlier visualised as a temporary measure pending the completion of the Chowilla project, but in terms of clause 29, the Menindee Lakes Storage Agreement is incorporated into the River Murray Waters Agreement. This includes a small adjustment in the New South Wales entitlement to water from the Menindee Lakes storage, as agreed between representatives of the 4 governments. Clauses 22 and 26(h) give details of an adjustment in allocation of tributary inflow in Victoria whereby the right to . use a small quantity of this flow is ceded to New South Wales, as also agreed between representatives of the governments. At that time it was also agreed to adopt an operational procedure for salinity control in the river which has been found effective in recent years, and this is dealt with in clause 22. I might mention that while this clause refers only to control of salinity upstream of South Australia, this is on the basis of control below that point being handled by releases from Lake Victoria, and if necessary from the Menindee Lakes storages. I refer now to matters more of a machinery nature. Clauses 12, 13 and 16 provide for the contracting governments to be kept in closer touch with the main steps in implementing major works, and this seems desirable when we are dealing with projects of the magnitude of the Dartmouth Reservoir. Clause9 gives the Commission the power of delegation which is usual for bodies of this type, but which had not previously been provided for. Clause5 makes provision for indemnity for the officers and servants of the Commission in respect of any claims against them arising out of the bona fide execution of their duties. This indemnity has hitherto been available only for the commissioners and it was considered desirable to take advantage of this opportunity to provide similar protection for the officers and servants of the Commission. I do not believe the other matters are worthy of special mention and ( will not take further time to deal with them now. in summary, this Bill provides the machinery for implementing a major project which is of the utmost importance to the whole of the Murray Valley development. For South Australia, its importance extends far beyond the Murray Valley in the provision of pumped water supplies to Adelaide, to other industrial areas, and to very large areas of wheat and sheep country. Completion of the project will greatly increase the water supply available to the 3 States which are signatory to the Agreement, and I feel that the Commonwealth can be proud of the part it has played in bringing this project to the point where, after ratification of the Agreement by the 4 parliaments, work can be put in hand immediately.

The purpose of this Bill is to obtain the States' shares of a cost up to S62.7m, that approval of Parliament to an agreement is, 10% above the present estimate.

Speaker, the recent elections produced a situation in which we heard about this brilliant new party, the alternative government for Australia. Some of us were curious to know about the defence policy of this brilliant new party. Those who ignore the lessons of history become its victims. One remembers that during the 1939-1945 War the Labor Party opposed the defence of Australia man. One remembers the Labor Party opposing the defence of Australia until the Germans suddenly attacked Russia. Immediately, Labor came in hot foot to the last man and to the last shilling. [Quorum formed.] sition did not like my reference to the fact that the Labor Party was opposed to our defence effort in 1939-1945 until Hitler attacked Russia on 22nd June 1941. Honourable members opposite who are seeking to interject would not remember what happened. But the Hansards of that time many interjections. I suggest to honourable members that they restrain themselves. 1 remind all honourable members on both sides of the House that interjections are out of order and they will be dealt with accordingly. to say a few words in reply to the interjections from the Labor Party. What happened in the 1939-1945 War? The pride of the Labor Party in prosecuting that war did not develop until after Hitler attacked Russia on 22nd June 1941. We were in Cyprus and we were in trouble until Hitler diverted his attention from the Middle East and sent his troops into Russia. Immediately, the Labor Party became enthusiastic against Hitler. This was because its friends, supporters or organisers in the Communist out against the threat posed to Russia. I wish to read a comment on what hapat the convention held in Canberra in 1963. I think that it was over the North West Cape Naval Communication Station. What did happen there? The students of politics reported that: A remarkably high proportion of the Conference delegates consisted of ALP members who believe, possibly mistakenly but nevertheless unquestioningly, that tbey owe their positions in the industrial movement to Communist support, and that they must never do anything to estrange this support. Whether fhis belief is justified does not matter. The important thing is that tbese delegates hold it. Because they hold it the less dangerous element will not do anything to bring on their heads Communist disapproval while the more dangerous element-the 'activists'-alway s make clear by their attitude within Labor's policy making bodies that they can 'see the viewpoint' of the Communist Party which is the patron for their jobs in the trade union movement. If honourable members wish to be given any proof of this, I ask them to look at the analysis by the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant) who, earlier this evening, called for a quorum by drawing the attention of Mr Speaker to the state of the House. The honourable member made an analysis of a Labor Party conference in Victoria and practically everybody there was from a trade union and only a few were from Australian Labor Party branches because that conference was boycotted by ALP branches.

This kind of approach is the one that scares off the decent bloke in the once great Australian Labor Party. I am glad that the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) is here listening to this. Let me refer to the great sell out in 1963 over the North West Cape Naval Communication Station. The voting at the meeting of the Federal Executive was 13 all.

A Government that was bound to act in accordance with the directions of an outside body would not be a Government at all. Indeed, the Premier and his Ministers would be false to their oath of office, with no real power to act or make decisions of their own. Let us hear what this great victorious crowd on the other side of the House say about this. Honourable members have heard what Mr Holding said. He stated that such a government would not be a government at all. I refer now to what the present Leader of the Opposition said,, some time in February 1969: Many members of the Party and its affiliated unions have been angered at the public attaclc I made on some decisions and members of the Federal Executive. I have already given an unreserved apology in writing to the Executive for the personal reference I made. I am glad a Special Federal Conference has been called.

Do you realise 4 of these people live on the Labor movement, batten on tbe Labor movement, as paid Stale Secretaries. Two of them. MJ Chamberlain and Mr Hartley, of whom you would never have beard, produce many more resolutions every Conference and Executive meeting than they ever do members at elections. Four others are members of unions, not of Trades and Labour Councils of the ACTU but of individual unions and 4 are members of Parliament, and only 1 of them, Harry Webb, has ever made the grade or ever will make the grade in the Federal Parliament, the only one who'd ever be a Minister. by the honourable member is not related I think the Chamberlains will be superannuated and others will be retired before their time from the Federal Executive. These were excepts from the transcript of the 'Seven Days' programme on ATN7 on 15th February 1966 as presented to a special conference of the Labor Party. The Leader of the Opposition also said: I can only say we've just got rid of the 36 faceless men stigma to be faced with the 12 witless men. Opposition said: The only people who are out of line are the Federal Executive who are incompetent and irresponsible. of the Labor Parly.

We have seen this happen during the past 3 weeks. They came in marching along with flags flying and bayonets flashing in the sun, and today we had only 52. They have gone home, fed up with it. The Leader of the Opposition went on to say: The public will never support the attitude of any faction in the Labor Party and the Federal Executive is a faction. Let us go back to what he said in the letter after he was brought into line. Mr Armitage1 rise lo order. Mr Speaker, can you advise me whether the honourable member is in order, because I do not recollect any of the material which he has discussed in the point of order.

130,Mr Jeff Batei Can Well Understand,"to Australia than is the enemy himself. This was stated by the Minister for Information in Great Britain in 1940. He said that anybody who helped the enemy by his expressions was a greater danger than the enemy. In this case Hanoi is fighting for the minds of the American people and Burchett helped Hanoi. Burchett did more damage to Australian troops-the people who are fighting for the security of Australia and South Vietnam-in a day than a division of North Vietnamese troops could do in a month. Mr Kevin Cairns-Who helped Burchett? here? This is the important part of what 1 am saying. No country can protect itself if it is white-anted and its resolution to defend itself is broken down. This is why the Labor Party lost the election. Some Opposition members are agreeing with me. 1 can tell by the expressions on their faces. Let us take the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) and the statement he made in his pamphlet., which I suppose some honourable members have read. He stated that the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam could be more disastrous than what is going on now. That is right, because South Korea, Taiwan and South Vietnam would be put to the knife immediately their defences were withdrawn. The Leader of the Opposition talked about, sending civil aid teams over there-mainl y doctors and engineers. What a great time they would have when the ALP withdrew the troops. Honourable members should look at what the Vietcong were like 2 years ago. They are not the same today because 90% of them are gone. The war has been brought to a state where the Vietcong have lost their sting. They have gone down and they cannot get recruits and so on. But when that statement was made the civil aid team would have been butchered. Therefore that was an irresponsible statement. Labor's defence policy is amateurish. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Barnard) wrote something which I tried to read. 1 must say that it was like an essay by a high school student because it had no bearing at all on the normal problems of defence. I must say that it was well written. Thc words were good. . But the defence policy of the ALP does not exist. Another candidate for the electorate of Lowe. Major Peter Young, has just written a very nice article which was published in 'Nation'. He talks professionally about the war in Vietnam because he has been there. He has no illusions about what would happen if we withdrew the troops. But the Labor Party would be bound by the Federal Executive, just as it was in 1953 and at every other Conference. Do honourable members opposite remember the red Hobart conference? The honourable member sitting over there on the front bench will. I think 17 walked out. It was about the withdrawal of troops from Malaya in 1955. the Executive deals with you, you will know. It will make you withdraw the troops from Asia and break our treaties with America. The Federal platform of the Australian Labor Party a few years ago, when it was a good Labor Party, said: 'We will uphold our treaties with our allies. We will keep our promises and our treaties.' But this Executive removed that clause. We all remember what Sam Benson said about this. I think he left the Labor Party over it. He has had a place of great honour here because of his courage and because of the way he dealt with Labor when' it showed its lack of awareness of the need to provide security for Australia. The magnificent organisers in the Communist Party have captured the trade union leadership. We have to pay a tribute to them at least for the way they have done that. But now Labor must dance to the tune of the heads of the unions and the Executive. The Leader of the Opposition must say to these people: T will carry out your instructions.' Clyde Holding says: 'We could not submit to the day to clay direction of parliamentary members and of a parliamentary government. It would be no government at all.' Mr Clyde Cameron-Tel l us about the Friesian calf. member for Hindmarsh was mixed up with something in Mount Isa and it was a bit tough for him.

It will bring home the conscripted men, but it does not worry about our flank being exposed to the Vietcong. That is an amateurish approach. Members of the Parliament are said by the Press to be cowardly. It was not cowardly to introduce conscription in Australia. Our action was supported by the people and after conscripment'. As there is no alternative tion was brought in we had the biggest majority here that we have ever had.

They come back with immense experience and with a knowledge of what it is like to serve Australia. The members of this Opposition Party, Speaker, with deference to your ruling, we are told by their friends in the Press honourable members on this side of the gallery, are brilliant. But look at these House cannot accept a statement made by brainy chaps.

I do not think that many honourable members in this House would be prepared to support the honourable member for Macarthur inside the House or outside when he makes accusations of this kind against honourable members on this side of the House. Mr Speaker, this is a very serious charge. I do not want to repeat it. You are well aware of what the honourable member has said. You have ruled against us. In fact the honourable member for Macarthur has said that honourable members on this side of the House are traitors to this country. Surely no responsible person in this Parliament is prepared to support the honourable member for Macarthur in this kind of accusation. He knows that it is not true. If he is man enough he will stand up in this House and withdraw rhe remark. 1, like many other honourable members, am prepared at all times to give and to take in debate. I do not mind the references to myself that the honourable member for Macarthur made tonight. I accept them, when they refer to what I have said previously in a debate, as part of the debate. But when tbe honourable member lays a charge against honourable members on this side of the House without being man enough to stand up and name those honourable members who he believes are traitors to this country and who would betray this country, then J think the Parliament has the right to demand that the honourable member be man enough to stand up and make his charges against those who he believes are in this position. Sir, I. believe the honourable member for Macarthur wanted to create the impression that all honourable members on this side of the House are in the category I have described. It was the kind of attack for which the honourable member for Macarthur and some honourable members who sit with him on that side of the House are notorious, under the privilege of Parliament. would describe the honourable member for Macarthur. I challenge him to make the statement outside the House. Mr Katter1 raise a point of order.

Mr Clyde CameronI raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I heard someone say that the honourable member for Macarthur was a coward. Is that in order? If the honourable member for Hindmarsh is attributing that word to the honourable member for Macarthur he will withdraw it. Mr Clyde Cameron-No. I heard somebody else say it, over on that side. coward was used by way of interjection. I merely said that that word probably would fit the honourable member for Macarthur. I think it would be a reasonable description. Leader of the Opposition to withdraw the statement that the honourable member for Macarthur is a coward. ruling, Mr Speaker, I withdraw the statement that the honourable member for Macarthur is a coward. Having said that I want to say that I resent the imputation that the honourable member for Macarthur has made against honourable members on this side of the House. I can only repeat that it is a malicious statement meant to damage all members of the Opposition. In my opinion it is an unparliamentary statement made under the privilege of this House. As I said when I moved the motion of dissent from your ruling, I think the honourable member for Macarthur ought to be made to withdraw his charge and the statement.

I pose the question: If the alternative government is not the Australian Labor Party, to whom was the honourable member for Macarthur referring? In effect, Mr Speaker, your ruling means that 1 cannot say, for instance, that the Treasurer is an embezzler but I can say that all those on the Government side are-ever y one of them-and be completely within the Standing Orders.

158,Mr Keogh (Bowman) [8.52],"This isrepresented by the Australian Labor Party. The electorate has been named after David Bowman, one time leader of the Labor Opposition in the Queensland Parliament. David Bowman entered Parliament in 1899, the year the Parliament of the colony of Queensland debated the Federation Enabling Bill. He remained in the Parliament to become a Cabinet Minister in the Government of T. J. Ryan, and on his death in 1916 there was universal lament that, after a long period of doubtful health, his passing had left a blank in the first strong Labor Government which Queensland had produced. It is also significant that I mention that this year we celebrate the bi-centenary of the 1770 visit of Captain James Cook who explored and charted our east coast. A few moments ago I referred to my electorate encompassing the islands of Moreton Bay. The largest, both on a geographical and a population basis, is North Stradbroke Island. hear of and reflect on the past, save from The history books record that on 17th May 1770 the 'Endeavour' was 5 miles out to sea from the point of land which Cook named Point Lookout. It is recorded that he climbed to the masthead where he could make out the sweep of the land which seemed to form a wide open bay. He believed Point Lookout to be on the mainland. It was his first land sighting after leaving Point Danger. Today Point Lookout is perhaps one of the less known resorts, but surely the equal in many ways of the better known island tourist resorts off the Queensland coast. My electorate of Bowman is inseparably linked with the history of our nation. Significant again is the fact that a large part of the electorate takes in the area originally known as the Moreton Bay Settlement. Cleveland, a beautiful town in a semi-residential rural setting on the shores of the Bay and the recognised capital of the Redlands area, at one time strongly rivalled Brisbane as the choice for the colony's port. But Cleveland, despite its many advantages for development both as a port and as a city, was fated not to be the chief town. Perhaps the decision may have been somewhat influenced by the misfortune of Governor Gipps who in 1842 is reported to have fallen in the mud at low tide as he disembarked at Cleveland to carry out an inspection prior to a decision being made on the siting of the port. May1 suggest in passing that in this historic year the Federal Government should take the lead in financially sponsoring the more detailed historic recording of life and events in the days of the early suburban development of our cities and towns. The major events of history are certainly recorded, but at this local level very little is recorded. Much can never be done in this regard. That which can, should be carried out while those who have played a part in that history are still living. But so much for history. Almost three-quarters of a century has passed since the debate, to which I have referred, on the adoption of the Constitution and the resulting federation of the 6 independent colonies. More than a century and a half has passed since the early settlement of Queensland, and we have now reached the third century since the discovery and possession of our east coast took place. In this place, while it may be interesting to ensuring that it is recorded in the annals of our development we can do nothing to alter its facts and accomplishments. Our role is for the present and for the future. Today in accepting that role I ask honourable members to reflect for a few moments on the years since David Bowman, his colleagues in the Queensland Parliament and their counterparts in the parliaments of the other colonies debated the proposed federation. I ask honourable members to reflect and consider whether that transformation of the colonies, that marriage of the States, has been the complete success for which our founding fathers hoped. It is undeniable that we have seen developed a young, virile and wealthy nation, but have we really developed a national spirit, a national outlook and a national pride? Too often people regard themselves as Victorians or Queenslanders. Often their interests and utterances and those of their State governments clearly indicate that federation is still a partially unacceptable concept. Surely it is high time that the marriage was consummated. This tired, complacent coalition which cannot handle the current national problems except by attempting to adapt Labor policy to its own systems will certainly not face the problems of the future. Under this Government centralism has become a fearful word. The Labor Party-united , alert, vigorous and active, poised to become the next Government of our nation under the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr detail of them and work untiringly to Whitlam) as our next Prime Minister-wil l show how efficiently and effectively that cenmy constituents who live on the bayside area tral government can work with, work for and work through out State governments. Labour will give the sincere, dedicated, enlightened leadership so urgently needed to face and solve our current and future national problems. One of the most important problems of the future is in regard to the Constitution under which we live. This Constitution which suited the federation of 6 independent colonies 70 years ago, which suited the growth and development of those colonies into States of the Commonwealth, no longer adequately suits the new visions and new concepts which we must adopt to permit our nation to face the next century, to provide for our future generations and for the role we must fill in this south east Asian section of our globe. With due respect to you personally, Mr faded to a feasibility study. I say here and Speaker, may 1 make brief reference to something which perhaps typifies the lack of initiative on the part of our present decaying Government. To some degree before coming to this House, and to a much greater degree since coming here, two matters have amazed me. Firstly, the procedures of the House do not operate understanding orders which in my opinion are anywhere near suitable for the conducting of the business of government in our nation as we enter the third quarter of the 20th century. Secondly, in this so-called enlightened age you, Mr Speaker, and the Clerks at the table are bewigged. Surely this is an antiquated tradition of bygone years. As officers of the Parliament performing a particular function the Clerks may be excused for wearing gowns, which are in fact a type of uniform, but I cannot accept that wigs are necessary. Surely it cannot be argued that a wig on one's head adds anything to the dignity or decorum of this House. I wish now to mention several matters was denying Queensland hospitals many which I believe are of major concern to and Medical Costs, which had drawn attenthe people of my electorate and upon which tion to the fact that the Commonwealth I am sure they would like me to comment millions of dollars. In Queensland a large on this occasion. Time will not permit more or the Senate Select Committee on Health than a passing reference to these matters todaya brief outline of them. However, they are problems of real concern and I serve notice that I will speak again in more achieve their solution. Many thousands of streUhing from the Brisbane River south to the Logan River live outside the area conveniently serviced by Brisbane public hospitals. In time of family crisis, faced with the worry of sudden illness or injury, they face the added burden of knowing that they must encounter a long trip to a city hospital. For some years as each State election came along the Queensland Governmenta government of the same political persuasion as this Government-ha s blatantly resurrected the possibility of a hospital construction programme in the Wynnum area. At the last election in 1969. knowing that the Wynnum State electorate was continuing to vote solidly Labor, Mount Gravattt suddenly became the suggested site for a hospital. The election successfully over, the Mount Gravatt hospital and now that the Queensland Government does not intend and probably cannot finance in the near future the building of any periphery hospital in the Brisbane metropolitan area. Let me remind honourable members opposite of the cruel, contemptible propaganda which this Government waged during the last election campaign against Labor's free health scheme. The false assertion that Labor would destroy Queensland's free hospital system was cruel and contemptible because it drove fear into the minds of many aged and infirm electors in Queensland. The Queensland free hospital system, proudly introduced by Labor, has been slowly strangled by the present State Government and is under threat of complete destruction by this Commonwealth Government. Even as late as the recent statement to the House by the Minister for Health (Dr Forbes) there was no mention of the Government's intention to comply with the recommendations of the Nimmo Committee percentage of people choose not to pay into a hospital benefit insurance fund. As a result when they are in hospital the hospital be enrolled from this year. is not eligible for the full Commonwealth benefit of §2 a day but instead receives only 80c a day in respect of such patients. This piracy of Queensland's rightful revenue, amounting to more than $14m since 1952, is accepted meekly by the present State Government. Faced with such shoestring Federal aid, Queensland's free hospitals cannot expand and must continue to slip towards complete destruction. Labor's plan to provide a scheme whereby medical and hospital services would be financed by a levy of H % on taxable incomes would protect Queensland's free hospitals. It would permit them to develop their present inadequate service and equipment. Finally it would provide the finance so vitally necessary for the construction of periphery hospitals on the outskirts of Brisexceed 50% of the Brisbane total. When bane at such places as Wynnum and Mount Gravatt. I challenge the Prime Minister, if he has one atom of sincerity or one degree of concern for the problems 1 have dealt with, to incorporate in the legislation travel to study at St Lucia. Students and soon to come before this House provision for the full Commonwealth subsidy of $2 per head to be paid to all Queensland public hospitals irrespective of whether the patient is insured. Honourable members will recall that 1966 was an election year. In Queensland both State and Federal elections were held that year. It is perhaps coincidental that in 1965 nium. While there is no open admission that the establishment of a second Brisbane university at Mount Gravatt was mooted. It was to be known as the Griffith University. One might expect that such an essential project would at least be at the bricks and mortar stage after 4 years, but no. After some road and fence building activity before the 1966 elections, when a large sign was erected announcing that the great project was in progress, work has ceased, the sign has become weather beaten and the roadworks have deteriorated through lack of maintenance. Last year this Government announced that the minimal amount of $250,000 had been allocated to the Griffith University during the next 2 years. This sum is earmarked for development work, so no building work is yet envisaged. Such treatment is not good enough when the original intention was that students would In his 1969 Budget speech the State Treasurer announced: 'Queensland might have difficulty meeting tertiary education needs in the 1970-72 triennium'. This disclosure, followed closely by the announcement that the Federal Government had money available for Griffith University but was not prepared to use it because the State Government could not match it on a $1 for $1 basis, highlights this Government's disinterest and neglect of the problems associated with Queensland's development. It now appears that at least 6 years must pass before Griffith University can commence to relieve the already strained facilities at St Lucia. In the meantime high school enrolments in the areas from which Griffith would draw the bulk of its students already areas such as the Gold Coast are added it is obvious that the university must be commenced now, if for no other reason than the inconvenience and financial burden to families and students facing long hours of staff members must support this demand that the Government review the programme of the Universities Commission on which the decision to go slow on the Griffith project is based. The present student to staff ratio at St Lucia is the worse in Australia, yet the former Acting Vice-Chancellor, Professor Teakle, stated in his 1969 report that the ratio would rise during this triena quota system exists it is generally accepted that certain faculties have unofficially adopted a selective admission policy. Over the next few years a severe quota system will develop and unless the Griffith building programme is put into operation immediately many young Queenslanders who matriculate will be denied the benefits of a university education. In his report Professor Teakle said that the university must stimulate community awareness of the need for further university expansion. He said also: Although smaller sites than St Lucia cope with enrolments of 10,000 to 20,000 students, it is short sighted to ignore the imminent justification for a second university in Brisbane or the fact that serious overcrowding at St Lucia will occur unless Mount Gravatt is operating before 1973. The dilemma is that until the campus approaches saturation, the same amount of money will be more productively spent at 'St Lucia where basic services are already available than at Mount Gravatt. In the initial years (he returns on investPoint for the future establishment of a ment at Mount Gravatt in terms of student capacity will be low; but it is imperative that a start be made at least in the 1973-75 triennium on a building programme, the recruitment of staff and the provision of library services. There is no doubt in my mind that the adequate mooring facilities; and the present university situation in Brisbane ruination of the near river bayside beaches demands an immediate special nonby pollution and mud from years of governmatching grant from this Government to ment carelessness. These are all matters enable the Griffith building programme to which are nevertheless important but must commence without delay. Another area of education which continues to receive the blind eye treatment from this Government is the State primary I remind the Government that time is also system. I do admit that limited assistance running out on it. While not completely has been granted by the Government to victorious at the last election, we of Labor the private primary system and the have shown the electors that we alone of secondary systems in Queensland.

A Labor government has been been mishandled because it has neglected temporarily denied them, but we have firmly to apply the fundamental principle of first set our feet on the pathway to government determining the needs of the whole of our and, as a united Party enjoying the majority education system and applying the finance support of Australian electors, nothing can in a strict order of priorities on a wellpossibly halt the realisation of the new known overall plan of requirements.

161,Sir John Cramer,"That would haveever the occasion existed when we needed some good ability in the national Parliament it is now. TonightI propose to discuss only one subject. of federation which the honourable member for Bowman mentioned. It is an undeniable fact that the most important matter which is concerning all thinking Australians today is federation and the relationship between tbe Commonwealth Government and the States. Many people think of federation as one thing and the governments of the Commonwealth and the States as another thing. They seem to forget, of course, that federation is a union of the States. Very few people, including politicians and leaders of governments, have given much thought to the establishment and growth of federation, where it has led us and what should be done about it in the future. Altogether too many people have arbitrary and fixed ideas on this subject. The present position is undeniably chaotic throughout Australia. The whole nation is being divided and confused by the propaganda of the States and the charges of centralism against the Federal Government. I believe that the people throughout Australia are sick to death of the wrangle that takes place, in this chamber no doubt, year after year over money-merel y over money. I believe, too, that the people are looking to leadership on this subject emanating both from the Federal sphere and from the State sphere. Therefore, I propose to say a few words on this subject. Let us in retrospect go back over our history briefly and look at what we have done and plan a federal system that leads us to our destiny as a nation. We are celebrating, as was said by the last speaker, our bi-centenary. It is 200 years since Captain Cook placed the Union Jack upon our soil and we became a penal colony of Great Britain. The position remained this way for many years under the administrative control of a governor directed from the Home Office in Britain. The colony was called New South Wales on 26th January 1788. I would remind the House that the colony of New South Wales-and people do not think of this-covere d the whole of the east coast of Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand. Of course, it was only sparsely populated at that time. It was not until 1823 that advisory councils to the governor were established-no t elected, but appointed. Then in 1842 partly elected legislative councils were set up with limited power. It was not until 1856 that New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania had responsible government. Queensland was granted responsible government in 1859 and Western Australia in 1890, of course with certain limitations of power. So for a period of less than 45 years the States were on their own without a Commonwealth. People do not think of this. In the 112 years from the foundation of New South Wales, as 1 have described it, to the establishment of the Commonwealth, the population rose from a mere 859 to 3,765,339. In the next 70 years it rose within our Commonwealth to just under 13 million people at the present time. able member should keep quiet and listen to it. It must be remembered that because of the great distances and lack of transportation and communication it suited the purpose of Great Britain to give separate identity to the States, all of which operated as colonies largely under the direction of the mother country. Of course, the fact that we are a continent made a great difference in this determination. school? member should act his age. It is of interest to note that the settlements of Tasmania and Western Australia were set up because of the fear at that time that France may attempt to take possession of these areas. I think that a little thought on the development of federation is appropriate at this time. One of the enduring advantages of the way in which the States were established-and this is of tremendous importance in the scheme of things-is the fact that the people are basically the same kind of people, speak the same language and have adopted the same British way of life. This could well have been different, but this is one of the great advantages of the way in which the States were set up. But as I have said, it suited Great Britain to",62,Governor General S Speech

167,Sir John Cramer,"The honourablekeep the States separately controlled because this was the era of colonialisma word which has developed into a dirty word. There is a great fundamental difference between the establishment of Australia in this way and the establishment of Canada, one of our sister dominions. There the French had already established settlements and the fear always existed that Canada would be absorbed into the United States of America, so a federal body was set up with legislative control over the Provinces, which is entirely different to the setup in Australia. This is because Canada is not a continent whereas Australia is. By the very nature of the separate and individual powers given to the States in Australia it was inevitable that jealousies would arise and that conflict in ideas of development would occur. Some were free traders, other protectionists, and so on, and enmity grew to an alarming degree, particularly between New South Wales and Victoria, the 2 fast developing States. Some of this enmity persists to this day. We hope it is not very much, but this competition does continue to exist between States. It was in this atmosphere that the great leaders of political thought realised that we must create a federation of States if we were ever to reach our destiny as a great nation. Otherwise our future would have been one of 6 independent countries torn asunder by jealousies and economic instability. We ail know of the turmoil and the difficulties experienced in bringing about federation, and it is interesting for everybody to read of those difficulties. We remember Sir Henry Parkes, known as the Father of Federation, who tried desperately to establish what he at that time called a 'federal council' to deal with matters of common concern to all the colonies. He never achieved this objective, but finally a compromise was arrived at, resulting in the Commonwealth Constitution Act being passed. Can anyone imagine what the position would be in this country today without federation? It would be appalling to think what might happen with 6 independent countries as was referred to by the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr irresponsibility. I am not charging the Turner) a day or 2 ago. It was inevitable that we had to have a federation; otherwise it would have been impossible for this country to carry on in ihe way that it has. Indeed, it is possible to conceive that we could have had civil war in Australia as happened in America. This would have been quite possible. As we all know, the Constitution was approved by Her Majesty the Queen on 9th July 1900 and was limited to certain powers, which have been added to in several ways since then. But by far the greatest change has taken place because of the financial agreement in 1942 whereby the Commonwealth was created the sole taxing authority in the income tax field and the States were given money on an agreed formula. Let me make it perfectly clear, particularly to the Opposition, that I am not a centralist. The honourable member for Bowman, who spoke last, acknowledged that he was a centralist and that he stood with a party who were centralists. I believe in the freedom of the individual and the preservation of his sacred right to liberty and justice. I believe, too, in the partnership of the States and the Commonwealth in a democratic federation with a common objective of maintaining and developing the Australian nation. I was very glad indeed-becaus e I believe what I have just said-whe n the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) gave an emphatic no to a request by the States at their recent conference to levy income tax for their own purposes. I know that there are people who disagree with this. I know that there are people who believe that the authority which spends the money should have the onus of collecting the tax. I know there are people who believe that, but in my opinion it would have been a retrograde step to give this power to the States and would have been inimical to the best interests of federation. I believe it would have been resented by the taxpayers of every State in Australia. The people realise, even if the State governments do not, that our progress and development, our standards of living and our prosperity depend on the stability of our economy. You cannot have that stability if individual States have the right to run off on their own tangent of financial States with being irresponsible. Do not misunderstand me. But they are not responsible for economic stability and seem oblivious to what it means on many occasions. This is the Federal Government's responsibility, and of course it is not a popular function. This is a very vital factor in our setup at the present time. It would appear to me from recent State government propaganda that their idea of being federalists means that each State should exercise its sovereignty in an absolute fashion and do as it likes within its own State boundaries, uninhibited by the effect of these actions. This attitude in my opinion , is State centralism in the extreme and will, if allowed to continue, destroy any possibility of an effective federal system. It cerand they must be given ample funds within tainly destroys the federal concept of 'one people, one nation'. This is the most dangerous and damaging political and economic movement being fostered in Australia today. It has already inflicted great damage and will undoubtedly bring about a political overall examination of, firstly, all things situation which will inevitably end in the that should be left exclusively to the States, destruction of a free enterprise democracy secondly, those things that must of necesand impose on the people of Australia a sity be left exclusively to the CommonSocialist economy with rabid centralism. In wealth-anyon e could determine them other words, it is political suicide to go on easily-and , thirdly, those matters which, in the way that we were going. This is though to be administered by either the exactly what the Opposition would want States or the Commonwealth, have a because the Australian Labor Party stands national implication. This is a wide field. It for rabid centralism in the full sense of the is in this last field of policy and activity that term. I am not defending the Commonwealth there are people who will charge me with Government in its treatment of the States. being a centralist for saying this, but it is my Perhaps it has not made sufficient money firm .opinion that this is the only basis available for their essential needs. I hope upon, which federalism can be achieved that this will be rectified. But, on . the and the resources.of the nation properly broader issues, I feel that the time has come and efficiently applied for the benefit of for a closer partnership, association and the people as a whole. appreciation of the respective roles of the Commonwealth and the States to create and to maintain one nation. It almost seems matters-highl y controversial, I knowto me that the old fight of the 1890s is on that have national implications and about again with the States taking the role of tbe many of which there is at present costly anti-federalists. If we must go back, let duplication. This is by no means a complete us adopt now Sir Henry Parkes's suggestion list, but just a few of the most important. and set up 'a federal council to deal with matters of common concern to all the I mention first of all education. The facilities colonies', meaning, of course, the 'States' and opportunity for education in all aspects instead of the 'colonies'. That was the should be available on a basis of equality original concept of federation. It is becoming increasingly clear as we I am not saying that the States should develop into nationhood that the bonds of relinquish education, but a need exists partnership between the States and Federal for that close collaboration to bring about Government must be strengthened and the the desired result throughout the length and spirit of national identity encouraged to breadth of Australia. look beyond State boundaries. To bring this about in the field of development, tbe resources of the nation must be applied with priority to the national good, and what is best for the nation as a whole. The States themselves must be parties to these determinations. It is very difficult to get the States even to consider this aspect. But it is of vital importance. Priorities must apply without being hidebound to the State affected. The functions of the States are all important for the effective and efficient carrying into effect of our national growth our capacity to do this, not essentially only on a State basis but on a national basis. However, a great need exists for an the bonds of true federation must be exerted in the national interest. I know that 1 venture to suggest some of the for all children and adults too in all parts of Australia irrespective of State boundaries. I turn to health and hospitalisation. The same basis should apply here also. Why should there be any difference in the facilities available, whether a person lives in Timbuctoo, Longreach or Melbourne? The need arises for close collaboration also in the field of transport. This needs rationalising in the national interest. But in our hands now. All we require is leaderall its aspects it has a tremendous bearing on the orderly growth of the nation. I am not referring to local transport and the type of thing that we hear a lot about, but the wider aspects of national transport which are of tremendous importance to the growth of the nation. I turn now to urban development. Whilst wealth and all the States to work out all the States look upon this as being their the details of one common objective-on e exclusive responsibility, it cannot be people, one nation. divorced from our planned national growth.

169,Mr Hurford (Adelaide) [9.40],"On etbis as an introduction to giving notice that I intend to number myself among those who believe that it is time that we have a hard look or perhaps an examination in depth of our parliamentary system, our forms and procedures. Some reforms are, in my view, required. Particularly must we look at the role of the back bencher to make sure that that role is more meaningful. More help is required with the research work each of us should be doing and this is no reflection on what is being offered in the parliamentary Library. Individual assistance is required in this sphere. 1 hope I can speak for the diligent city member already when I submit that he certainly needs social work assistance with the thousands of individual problems which are brought to his attention if he is to look after our opponents in the process of decision this function properly. If he did this then indeed the rest of his work would suffer. I cannot speak for the country member in this sphere. In addition to this, we must not continue to bring this Parliament into disrepute by fixing our own salaries. We must take the necessary steps to gear our remuneration to a level in the Commonwealth Public Service. I do not intend to pursue this matter further in detail now. I hope to have the opportunity to do so on future occasions. I merely give notice that the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant) on my side of the House and the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner) on the other side of the House, and others, have in me an ally in this matter of parliamentary reform. I am proud to be the honourable member for Adelaide here in this place. I am extremely grateful to hundreds who have given me great help and encouragement, and indeed thousands who have given me wonderful support in getting here. I do not intend to waste this help and support by dissipating my time on meaningless activity, and I say this as someone who has been given a special privilege by being elected immediately on reaching this Parliament as Vice-Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts. I take this opportunity of expressing by gratitude to my colleagues for this. However, the privilege does not deteT me from striving for the Parliament to undertake more of this type of activity. Parliamentary reform rates so high in my priorities not because it is an end in itself but because it is a means to an end. 1 deplore the fact that when my own political party, the Australian Labor Party, is kept out of power for so long by a government coalition of so-called Liberal Party, Australian Country Party aud Australian Democratic Labor Party interests using, let us admit it, so often fear and smear tactics, imputing a lack of patriotism and engaging, as we saw tonight, in other untruthful methods to gain their ends, the needs of the people suffer so. In the Australian Labor Party we have our own inbuilt mechanism to prevent this from happening. Not only is there our tradition of a stronger caucus system with leadership involving the ordinary member far more than with making, but also ours is a mass party which is built on democratic principles. When policy items find their way from the rank and file in unions and sub-branches through our State conventions and Federal Conferences into the platforms of our Party, woe betide those of us who are the elected representatives in this Parliament if we ignore those policy items. And this is the way it ought to be. This is participatory democracy at work. There are too many in our community who have been hoodwinked by the emotionalism of such false phrases as 'faceless men* and do not understand the great value of this structure. Certainly at times it is difficult to administer but I , for one, am not going to ignore one of the main causes of student unrest, a feeling of removal from decision making. Although there will always be room for improvement, and although we shall ever strive for this improvement, I believe that in my political party we do make an honest attempt to involve the ordinary citizen in the decision making processes. This is democracy at work, and I am proud of it. I emphasise the need to improve the processes of our democratic system because I recognise the present dangerous gulf between a relatively small and unrepresentative Cabinet which wields almost total power and the rest of the Parliament-and indeed the people. The great needs of the people which are either not touched or hardly touched at all in the Governor General's Speech at the opening of this session of Parliament are, in my view, a testimony to this. The first great need is some evidence of planning for steady economic growth. Instead we find the same old formula of an ad hoc and usually inefficient approach to these important matters. Our great primary industries are suffering badly from inflation and, in some cases, from inefficient subsidies. The workers in the secondary and tertiary spheres of our economy are not enjoying the increases in their standard of living which they deserve. Wages are not only lagging behind rises in prices in money terms but also-and this is more important-eve n after judgments of the Commonwealth Industrial and Conciliation Commission, they are lagging in real terms. Early in May it will be 5 years since the Vernon Committee reported and in 4 days' time it will be 4 i years since that report was presented to this Parliament-the report of the Committee of Economic Inquiry. On 26th November last, the day after our rather farcical 1-day mini session, the tenth anniversary of the presenMr Speaker, was intuitive. Only3 days later tation by command to this Parliament of the report from the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review was celebrated. Both of these reports should have been of great economic value to our nation. They hold Ihe key to our economic planning for orderly growth. They have been almost totally ignored. The Vernon Committee report outlined the sort of decisions which must be made for a proper allocation of our economic resources. The report of the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review told us what powers are required to make these proper allocations-for instance, control over fringe banking activity and over capital issues. I say with all the conviction I can command that it is totally absurd to live in the sort of situation that we do now where this democracy has not got control over the economic side of its life. We suffer from a distorted and inefficient use of our resources. We find all the investment capital we want for, say, hire purchase companies whilst our investments in real development projects such as water conservation and education are starved of funds. We find instead that we are living under a government which is attempting to control our economy by such means as the ineffectual use of interest rates. My concern at this impost is shown by the fact that I got the call from Mr Speaker for the fifth question of this Parliament, the third from the Opposition side after my Leader and his Deputy had taken their turns, and the first of a new member of this Parliament, and I used the occasion to draw attention to this burden of high interest rates. Let me repeat the question I put on that occasion. I asked: Has ihe Government any plans at all to alleviate the burden of high interest rates on the community? I noted none in the Governor General's Speech. Is the Treasurer aware that the crushing burden rests most cruelly on the middle and lower income groups of our country, adding to the cost of housing, local government rates and so on? Is he aware that some local government authorities are paying interest of up to 8% and more for their money, this rate deterring them from carrying out urgent community development projects? If the Government is bereft of plans in this area of great need will the Treasurer please tell the House why the Australian Labor Party solution outlined before the last federal election cannot be adopted in this sphere as it has been in so many others? My question, although I say so myself, the overdraft rate, which governs other interest rates in our economy, went up still further. Before turning to the Treasurer's answer and discussing his contribution to the debate on the matter of public importance raised by my colleague, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean), last Thursday, let me look at the needs. Incidentally, I was due to participate in the debate on the matter of public importance last Thursday but I was gagged. It must be a rare distinction to be gagged when attempting to make one's maiden speech. Let me say quite categorically that if I did not know the needs of the people in this sphere before entering this House4 i months ago, I certainly know them now. I have been appalled at the hardships that have come to my notice in the sphere of housing, as in so many other spheres. Deserving citizens by their scores cannot afford the repayments on credit foncier loans. If they already own their homes and are making instalment repayments weekly, monthly or quarterly, the increased interest rates add to their burdens and are responsible for their cutting their standards of living. If they do not already own their home, thc day of their doing so is postponed still further. One of the first criteria the adverse effects of higher interest rates examined by the lending institutions is the income of the family. This is done to ensure that the family can afford the instalment repayments. When interest rates rise, so do the demands of the lending institutions in the matter of the income requirements. I know, because 1 sat on the board of one of the largest lending institutions in South Australia, as a trustee of the Savings Bank of South Australia. I was a State Government nominee to that position. So more and more of our fellow Australians must turn to inadequate rental accommodation nnd must take their places on tbe long waiting lists of the housing trusts and housing commissions of our States. There arc 60,000 in our community who are inadequately housed. This is shown by the recent survey of the Housing Industries Association. But it is not only the roof over the head that suffers under a policy of exorbitant interest rates. The other requirements of the home, such as a sealed road outside it, kerbing and water tables, a footpath and other responsibilities of local government, which were mentioned by tbe honourable member for Bennelong ( Sir John Cramer) a little earlier, also suffer badly and depress the standard of living of those whom we represent. I make no apology for the fact that on the opening day of the session I asked a question which was prompted by representations made to me by local government authorities in my electorate of Adelaide. The aldermen and councillors in my district are gravely concerned at the needs of their people-m y people-no t being met. The average rate of interest being paid by local government authorities was 6.6% before the latest increase. I shall be very surprised if the rise in the overdraft rate does not affect this within a matter of days, if it has not already done so. 'Private affluence side by side with public poverty' was J. K. Galbraith's well known phrase. We certainly see a living example of it when considering these urgent needs of citizens. Of course, the councils are reluctant to borrow at these rates of interest. The ratepayers in this inflationary society in which we live cannot afford increased council rates to add to their other worries. And so the needs of urban and provincial citizens are postponed, to say nothing of on those who live in the country areas, too. What is all this in aid of? Why does the Government burden our people like this? It is hard to ascertain from the Treasurer's answer to my question and from subsequent statements by him. First of all he fobs off these hardships by saying that we are not really badly off because interest rates are high elsewhere in the world. He then creates a red herring by implying that it would be the policy of the Australian Labor Party to regulate interest rates by flooding the economy with money. 1 repudiate this suggestion. I have not heard this policy advocated in Labor circles anywhere in recent years when our resources have been more or less fully employed. It is unworthy of the Treasurer to suggest, without any foundation, that we would institute these policies which would, of course, compound the existence of inflationary situations. It is no good his answering me by saying: 'Well, this was the policy immediately after the war."" Of course it was, here and in the United Kingdom, and it would have been his policy, too, when resources were under-employed. Mr Deputy Speaker, the only credible excuse used by the Treasurer for higher interest rates is the dampening down of what he calls the 'overheated economy'. Let me repeat quite clearly that this is no substitute for proper monetary and fiscal measures to regulate our economy. Higher interest rates as a means of dampening the economy must be based on the proposition that the more expensive money becomes the more demand from borrowers will diminish. But borrowers who live in a fully employed economy, where the demand for what they produce will not diminish despite higher interest charges, do not behave in this way. In a fully employed economy interest charges are treated as costs and are passed on. There is tittle or no dampening down of demand. My submission and that of my colleagues on this side of the House is that the hardships are being caused by this Government in vain. What we want is a government which believes in a proper rationing of available funds st reasonable rates of interest, a government which will see that those funds are devoted to the needs of people in housing rather than in more droughts in the eastern States and in my wasteful investments as at present, and a own State and to other causes such as the government which will, as I suggested transfer of resources to deEence spending earlier, act on the report of the 1959 Joint overseas. We are only now slowly recoverCommittee on Constitutional Review, a ing from this situation with a return of the report which, incidentally, was brought out demand for our products. by members from both sides of thc Parliament and which recommends ways of loudly for sophisticated economic policy giving the necessary powers for the and for a stimulus to a State economy which necessary economic planning. With this economic mismanagement give. Instead of special treatment we already referred to, we suffer a complete received nothing but rebuffs. I raise the breakdown of Commonwealth-State relasubject on behalf of my State to record my tions, not only financial relations but also resentment at the special help not being the allocation of responsibilities between given. I am angry at this Government for governments. I do not want to repeat the this treatment, and so are the citizens I arguments already covered by my colrepresent. I am angry that the agreement to leagues, the new members for Perth( Mr build the Chowilla Dam, so vital to our Berinson) and Scullin (Dr Jenkins), in State's water resources, is being repudiated. excellent maiden speeches in this Parliament I shall have an opportunity to say more last week. I merely emphasise that in this about this in a later debate. I am angry last third of the 20th century, with our that still no funds have been allocated to greater knowledge of the policies required commence work in linking Adelaide with to maintain a high level of economic Port Pirie on the standard gauge railway activity, it is essential that economic powers network. My colleagues, the honourable rest in the hands of the Commonwealth members for Grey( Mr Wallace) and Government. At the same time it is vital Hawker( Mr Jacobi), will, 1 know, be saying that the administration of the policies more about that. T am angry that just when determined in this Parliament should, to the we needed more funds the South Australian greatest extent possible, be the responsibility share of the Commonwealth public works of State, regional or local government programme and of defence spending was authorities. With greater emphasis on declining. I am pledged to do my best to regional and local responsibilities, we shall see that this sort of idiotic treatment of be making giant strides towards the goal my State is not repeated in future. 1 give of decentralisation. I consider that this is notice also that I shall be seeking such the answer to the arguments put forward by decisions as the allocation of international the honourable member for Bcnnelong airport status to Adelaide, not for selfish tonight. Lest it be thought that a transfer of Australia is in the interests of ail some policy making from the States will Australians. weaken the position of the smaller States such as my own, South Australia, may 1 say quite bluntly that my State could not If in discussing the needs of Australians in have fared any worse than it has in recent this first year of the 1970s I have emphayears under the present system?

We have seen a little today of the patching of existing provisions. I look forward to comparing my Party's equitable health proposals with the hotchpotch being served up by the present Government in its attempts to patch its existing inequitable health scheme. I look forward to advocating more Commonwealth involvement in ail forms of education and in assisting local government bodies to provide their vital services to satisfy the great and numerous needs of our cities. I look forward to advocating leadership on the part of the Government in the important matter of price restraint. I know that price control without the rationing which necessarily goes with it in wartime, but which would not and could not be tolerated in peacetime, is no panacea in the fight against inflation. But I also know same distinction. that prices branches can play worthwhile roles in drawing attention to exorbitant prices, and thus exorbitant profits, stimulating greater efficiency and, increased productivity-in other words, in promoting that restraint which has been so sadly lacking in our country in recent years due to the total lack of Government leadership in this sphere. So far, Mr Deputy Speaker, 1 have not mentioned other particular interests such as a need for an involvement in Asia and the Pacific without the dangers of a military presence-in other words, let me say quite clearly that I stand firmly behind our policy of a military withdrawal from Vietnam. Other interests include a need for the greater education of our people concerning the lack of substance in the domino theory as it applies to the old French Indo-China; a need for a thorough overhaul of our tax system and the possibility of continuing research outside the Taxation Branch in a Canadian type tax foundation; a need to stimulate efficiency and productivity among smaller businessmen by the formation of a United States type small business administration department of the Commonwealth Government; and a need to co-ordinate the economic policy of our Commonwealth in one department rather than suffer the present confusions of this policy being determined on an ad hoc basis in many different departments. I thank the House for its courtesy. I look forward to applying myself to all these subjects and more now that I am privileged to serve as the representative of the electorate of Adelaide in this national Parliament. I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Hurford) on his speech. I do not agree with a lot the the things he said but I go along with his congratulations to Mr Speaker on his re-election to office. I would like to go further and extend my congratulations to Mr Speaker also for the high honour conferred upon him by Her Majesty the Queen. I also would like to congratulate the Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees on his re-election. Both Mr Speaker and the Chairman of Committees gave great service to the previous Parliament and 1 am sure they will serve this Parliament with the I want to make a point or two about the speech just delivered by the honourable member for Adelaide. He complained about the treatment given to South Australia. That State is quite well treated when one considers figures 1 have relating to the various States which show that per head of population per year Victoria received $103, New South Wales $104, Queensland $129 and South Australia $159. Overall South Australia has fared fairly well from the Commonwealth Government. The other point I want to make tonight concerns an observation I heard from a gentleman for whose opinion I have the very highest regard. The observation was that there was no alternative government. I believe that remark to be true. I believe that the Australian people, for the last 20 years, have thought that there really was no alternative government. That is one thing that I think is worth noting and I think it is a pity that that is the case. The fact is that there is no alternative government which would satisfy the great majority of Australians. The Speech of His Excellency the Governor General emphasised in no uncertain fashion the fast rate of development in Australia. It is now one of the most envied nations in the world. Despite the criticisms that we hear about the Government, Australia has made, and is con-",66,Governor General S Speech
170,Mr Corbett (Maranoa) [10.2],"Firstlytinuing lo make, great national progress. The Government too often is denied its fair share of credit for this progress and development. If this were not taking place the Government would be criticised. Those people who now criticise the Government are not prepared to give it the credit it deserves for the progress being made. Its policies have created a climate for investment, particularly the investment of risk capital which is unavailable in quantity in Australia, and this has resulted in unparalled progress over the past 20 years, particularly in more recent years. But this progress has not come about without some problems also developing. One of the most important problems confronting the Government at the present time is the difficulty faced by many of our primary industries due to low world prices and constantly rising costs-cost s which arc increasing and which affect us more than they otherwise would because of the very high level of national prosperity. A larger share of this prosperity is being sought constantly by almost all sections of the community and they are receiving it. In most cases, of course, costs are being passed on. But exporters, particularly exporters of primary produce, have no way of passing on rising costs. This has been said many times but 1 think it is worth repeating because it is something which should affect the policy of the Government and its policy towards exporters and primary producers in particular. Let us consider the wool industry. The position has been reached where, in my opinion, some assistance must be made available to enable wool growers to carry on for the time being until the introduction of measures to reduce costs and improve marketing to the extent necessary to enable them to operate with at least some degree of profit. I commend the wool industry and its leaders for the responsible attitude taken towards subsidy to the industry in that there has been a reluctance to ask for assistance by way of direct price support. I am firmly of the opinion, however-and at least some leaders of the wool industry agree-that with a price now well under 40c per lb wool growers no longer can carry the increasing costs without assistance in some form. To reduce this assistance to a minimum or from what it would have to be under present conditions I submit that charges levied by Government departments should be substantially reduced. In my own State of Queensland rent is one of those charges to which I refer. Land rent is much too high in relation to the prosperity or lack of prosperity of the wool industry at this time. I think the capacity of any property to produce should be one of the major factors taken into account in arriving at the rental charged. I believe urgent consideration should be given to this matter. I know that the Queensland Government is considering it at: the present time. Kail freights are another serious cost burden. In this case again there is every justification for worthwhile reductions. For a long time in Queensland rail freights from country areas were used to subsidise cheaper rail fares in the metropolitan area of Brisbane. Those freight rates could be carried when wool was bringing high prices but I believe the time has come when freight charges in our rural areas should be substantially reduced because of the present difficult conditions in primary industry. I realise that State governments would have some difficulty in finding the finance for these benefits. It naturally follows then that the Federal Government should enter the field and accept a reasonable share of the cost of compensating State governments for a fair share r>f revenue lost. Shire rates are another burden-a n ever increasing burden-o n primary producers. It falls too heavily on rural landholders. Local authorities are being asked to carry ever increasing responsibilities. They have to provide the amenities necessary to keep people in country areas. Aid from the Commonwealth, through the States, to local authorities to enable them to reduce rates in those areas where the burden is becoming too heavy, is long overdue. Because local authorities are closest to the people I contend that they can spend more effectively, in the interests of the community, the money made available than either State or Federal governments. The State and Federal governments will get very good value from any money that is made available to local authorities. I helieve that too many politicians, even those who were previously associated with local government, are apt to forget the needs of local government when they are elected to Parliament. the wool industry are taken, even if there I hope that the attitude will be taken that is some assistance required, it is quite poslocal government is now in a position where sible that the cost to the Government to it needs much more assistance from the keep the industry operating profitably Federal Government and if that money is would be much less than is often suggested channelled to them through the StatesI and the provision of that amount of money would be quite happy to see the distribuwould be fully justified. I repeat that every tion made in that way. But whatever hapsection of the community, except the pripens, I believe that local government will mary producers-mos t sections of primary have to get further assistance. I have been presenting a case for perity and are still clamouring for, and assistance to the wool industry in most of getting, a gradually increasing share of our the matters I have mentioned, although nation's prosperity. Why should the primary some of them had a wider application than producer, who cannot pass on his costs, be that. But in presenting that case I would denied a share of it? agree that the community should not be asked to support an industry if it is not in the best interest of the community that such to an organisation which is in my State of an industry should be supported. I put it to Queensland and which indeed is Australia the House, however, that there is a clear wide. I refer to the Queensland Countrycase that the wool industry deserves the women's Association. When attending n support of the community and it deserves it summer school at Dalby in my electorate not only in its own right but in the national quite recently, I heard about a proposed interest. Wool still provides some 25% of trainee teacher hostel which the Queensland Australia's export income. I ask: Without Countrywomen's Association intends to this what would be the state of our build in Brisbane. This hostel is to cost economy? Our economic stability certainly over $500,000. This is a tremendous effort would not be maintained. Another point I by an organisation of womenfolk. The want to make is that much of Australia is effort is a voluntary one. It is true that the well suited to wool production and much State Government is prepared to subsidise of the land that is used for wool production the building of this hostel up to, I underis not suited for other forms of production. stand, some $200,000. This still leaves an This is an added reason why every effort enormous amount for an organisation such should be made to keep our wool industry as the one I have mentioned to raise. This reasonably profitable. In the course of an excellent maiden with an annual cost of some $34,000 speech the honourable member for Isaacs against interest and redemption. I believe, ( Mr Hamer) said this is the only country because this is such a worthwhile project, that has a continent lo itself. That is true, because it is essential in the interests of and since it has a continent to itself the our trainee teachers, that the Commonpeople who live in this country have a wealth Government should give assistance moral responsibility to utilise every portion to it.

BeforeI leave this point I want to say that the Association will provide not oniy the buildings and the finance but also a protection for those young teachers coming into the metropolitan areaa protection that will enable many of their parents to have peace of mind which would not be available to them perhaps in other circumstances. I commend this project very strongly to the Commonwealth Government for some assistance. 1 would now like to turn to the wheat industry. Wheat grown in my electorate of Maranoa, because of its prime, hard quality with high protein content is still saleable and some orders for this type of wheat could not be filled this year, A lot has been said recently in this House about the wheat industry and a lot has been prompted, not by a desire to help the industry but in order to try to gain some political advantage from the difficulties wheat farmers are now facing. Never in the history of the wheat growing industry has there been so little justification for criticism put up by the Opposition to the Government on this issue. The Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Anthony) has been condemned on a number of occasions for not giving sufficient warning of the position that was arising. I would like to quote from a speech made by the Minister to the Victorian Farmers Union on 20th March 1968-that is some 2 years ago-and it was not long before in 19651966 that the end of season stocks were some 24 million bushels. In 1966-67 this had fallen to 16.5 million bushels. But on 20th March 1968 the Minister said: There surely are few growers who would not agree that the Wheat Board has done a magnificent job for them in finding markets for tbe bigger and bigger crops that have been produced. That does not mean there is any ground for complacency. World markets are neither unlimited in capacity nor unreservedly remunerative. In the last 8 or 9 months prices have weakened to an extent that surely must bring back to earth those is a good admission. It is an honest who have held the view that there is a ready market for all we can produce. Later on 19th September 1968 the Minister said: We have enormous problems this year in disposing of a record crop that will be coming forward. So the contention that there was no warning given by the Minister is not correct. He gave repeated warning. He had talks with the Australian Wheat growers Federation with that end in view. But it must be obvious that one cannot handle this job overnight without creating a great deal of hardship for people who are perhaps just going into the industry or have involved themselves in debt as a result of what they felt was a brighter future for the industry than it really had. This is a matter that growers' own representatives, through the Australian Wheat growers Federation, took up. It is also to be remembered that this had to be a joint Commonwealth-State scheme and the State Governments had to implement the quota system in their individual States. Thc plan to cope with the situation was put to the Minister by the growers themselves through their own organisation-the Australian Wheat growers Federation. It was that line of action that apparently the Opposition did not seem to like. If this could have been done more quickly I believe that it would have been done; but every effort was made by the Australian Wheat growers Federation to get a plan to this Government to restrict production as soon as they could when it became evident to them that there would be a need for reduction. Before this was evident any reduction would certainly not have been accepted by the Australian wbeat growers or by the Australian Wheat growers Federation. The people on the other side of the House who gazed into the crystal ball did not know anything about the position at that time any more than anyone else did. The fact is that they are only being wise after the event. It is very easy for them to say now what should have been done. Let me quote what the shadow Minister for Trade on the other side of the House, the honourable member for Lalor, had to say on 25th October 1967. He said: 'Wheat is the business of the Country Party'. This admission from the other side of the House. He also said: I have no objection, not one scrap of objection, to the way the Australian Country Party has handled Australia's wheat in recent years through its Minister for Trade and Industry find his assistant. 1 have not one word of objection to offer about it. That was said by the shadow Minister for Trade and Industry on 25th October 1967. So he knew nothing about it. He was honest in his approach and I congratulate him on his honesty on that occasion. But the Opposition, now wise after the event as it is so easy to be, is criticising the Government because it wants to gain political capital out of the situation. If honourable members opposite know anything about the wheat industry they will know that the problems of the industry were caused by an over supply on the world's markets. No-one was able to predict this with any degree of accuracy far enough ahead to be able to take remedial action. That is the problem. The governments of every major wheat exporting country with a substantial, trade in wheat were in as much difficulty as, or more tralian agriculture will surive. It will surdifficulty than, the Australian Government vive by virtue of sound limitation of prohas been. Does the Opposition say that duction in particular fields. It will survive there is no government of any wheat provided it has sympathetic government exporting country that knows how to run administration, which it is getting. But I its business? I would like to point out, too, that the others problems, it has to suffer the blight major factor which contributed to Ausof a Socialist government, the majority of tralia's wheat production on the home front whose members would have no interest in was the falling price of wool. Does the or sympathy for the primary producers of Opposition suggest that it was the fault of Australia. [Quorum formed.] the Government that world wool prices were falling to practically their lowest level on record? Despite what has been said about -Before calling the honourable member for this, I suggest that, provided there was any Blaxland1 would remind the House that this degree of profitability in wheat growing is the honourable member's maiden speech. there would have been a very large expansion in wheat production. It is problematical as to whether the expansion would not have been just as great provided there sentatives and the beginning of my first term was some profitability in wheat growing, in this place I desire sincerely to thank the because there was very little in wool pro55,000 electors of the Blaxland electorate in duction and a quick return could be New South Wales for the honour of allowobtained from the wheat industry.

Is this what the people who say campaign. they represent, or want to represent, the primary producers, including the wheat predecessor, the first Federal member for growers, of this country would do if they Blaxland, Mr Eli James Harrison who, as took office? Would they reduce the price honourable members would know, repreof wheat until there was no profit in wheal sented the Blaxland electorate from its cregrowing at all? This is the suggestion that ation in 1949 and who prior to this was a I take out of some of their criticism. I noted with interest during the election campaign that all the leading exponents of Labor's rural policy had different policies. I am inclined to think that the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson), as shadow Minister for Primary Industry, must have been relieved to some extent that Labor did not win the election, as he would have had to try to implement the opposing policies enunciated by them. It is all very well for an honourable member with rainbow-hued clothes to talk about a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. If he ever gets into the position of having some authority the primary producers of this country will realise that there is no gold at the end of the rainbow that he represents. There is no doubt in my mind that Ausbelieve that it will have the greatest difficulty in recovering if, in addition to these this is my first speech in the House of RepreI feel duty bound to pay tribute to my member of the New South Wales Legislative",71,Governor General S Speech
171,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Lucock),,75,Governor General S Speech
172,Mr Keating (Blaxland) [10.26],"A sCouncil for 7 years. He has given a lifetime of service to the Australian Labor movement, in particular to his own union, the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen of which he was general president, and to the Australian Labor Party. In his 27 years of elective office he has dedicated himself to the betterment of the people of this country. I know that my colleagues in the Labor Party share this view. For those who are not familiar with the geographical position of the Blaxland electorate I would mention that it is situated in the western suburbs of Sydney and its business and community centre is Bankstown. The electorate is comprised basically of the homes of working families and covers an area of approximately 20 square miles. Like one or two honourable members who made their maiden speeches in this House last week, I would like to be able to describe my electorate as a scenic district, as something of beauty, but unfortunately I cannot. The suburbs within the Blaxland electorate would serve as some of the best examples of chaotic development that can be seen. Unsealed roads, gutterless streets, filthy sewers Through the Loan Council the Commonand lack of adequate sanitation are reminders of the shortcomings of government generally in this country. The bulk of Australia's population, as honourable members would know, is concentrated in the capital cities and regional towns, yet there is less attention paid to the problems of these areas than there is to rural areas. The finance burden on local government bodies has become so intolerable that it is impossible for these bodies to overcome it without Commonwealth assistance. The Bankstown Municipal Council, whose area is wholly within tbe Blaxland electorate, currently has a loan debt of $5,610,000 whicb is growing continually. Payments to State authorities sap a high proportion of income from the Council, leaving the barest amount for necessary works. The standard of living that people enjoy only party that has concerned itself witb varies in accordance with what government our environment and the manner in which services are available to them. Quality roads, we live. Australians should demand that recreational facilities, public transport and governments pay more attention to their sewerage are things that become a luxury in surroundings and ensure that urban areas areas of the expanding urban sprawl of the become better and more satisfying places capital cities. My electorate is no exception. This Government knows that State governments cannot possibly cope with the problems of expanding areas without financial assistance, yet it refuses to recognise the magnitude of the problem. Local government is unable to raise adequate revenue with which to finance its obligations. It is treated in the same offhanded manner by the States as the States complain they are treated by the Commonwealth. The Labor Party takes the view that local government should be recognised as an equal partner in the structure of Australian government. The Leader of the Australian Labor Party has often been criticised for sounding like a municipal mayor or shire president, but he believes that Australians cannot enjoy a high standard of living while they have to live in a substandard environment. Only a change of attitude at State and Federal levels of government can remedy the present situation. The Commonwealth has a monopoly over direct taxation and many forms of indirect taxation. Through the Australian Loan Council the Commonwealth furnishes the States with funds to meet their obligations. wealth has a final say in deciding what amounts can be allocated for local government and what funds can be raised by local government and semi-government authorities on the loan market. For the most part, in order to raise revenue local government relies on rating, which is the most inequitable form of taxation. I say that rating is inequitable because it does not take into account a person's capacity to pay. Take the case of two families living side by side, each paying $100 a year in rates. One family might have an income of $15,000 a year while the other has an income of only $3,000 a year. Clearly this form of taxation is not discriminatory. It does not assess the capacity of each family to pay. At the last elections the people of Australia were awakened to the fact that they should and could expect a higher living standard. The Labor Party is the in which to live. The next topic which I propose to discuss is one which I feel poses a real problem for this country. I refer to the problem of prices and wages or, to put it more simply, inflation. We commonly hear the old explanations that are trotted out to explain inflation. The spiralling cost of living is one. The dog chasing its tail is another. The real explanation for the problem of inflation is that prices have outdistanced wages. It is a well known fact that a high proportion of Australian families live at or below the bread line. It is true that we are experiencing full employment but this does not mean that our families are enjoying -a standard of living which the wealth of this country should allow. The real challenge which the Government must face is how to control inflation. There is only one effective answer -contro l over prices and services. Like other honourable members. I am aware that there are constitutional impediments in relation to the control of prices, services and wages but surely if this Parliament is to have the power it should have to guide the destiny of this country it must have separate power over wages and separate power over prices and services. This is the only way to have a regulated economy. The honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Hurford) referred to the report of the Constitutional Review Committee tabled in 1959 when the Menzies Government was in power. That report was promptly forgotten by the Government The document contained various proposals for constitutional change and it dealt with the two that I have mentioned. I believe that the Commonwealth can control prices by setting up a statutory prices authority to fix prices for Our national prosperity depends on our all goods and services used by Australian people. The authority could include representatives of producers and consumers and would be responsible to Parliament. The authority should determine the requirements of an average family. It should inquire into an average family's needs in respect of clothing, food, recreation, entertainment, housing and health. From all this information it should recommend a wage adequate to provide a standard of living determined by the authority. This wage would be set by an Act of Parliament and varied from time to time. If this were done we would really have a true minimum living wage. One of our problems is that the basic wage or total wage is a joke. The whole country realises this. If we were to set a wage adequate to provide a proper standard of living we could then set pensions and other forms of remuneration as a stated proportion of that minimum living wage. Honourable members might remember that at the last general election the Labor Party advocated that we should set pensions as a high percentage of average weekly earnings. I suggest that we set them as a proportion of the minimum living wage. This would give pensioners a chance to cope with general price increases. When the decision was given in the metal trades case in 1967 wages were increased by $5.40 a week and later by a further $2. This was virtually a national wage increase. It flowed through every award in the country, including clerical awards, but what did the poor old pensioner get out of all this? Nothing. He had to wait until the 1969 elections for a handout of $1 from the Government. What can you buy these days with $1? I know that to members of the Liberal Party prices control is sacrilegious, but in their view it is not sacrilegious to control wages. The only commodity in Australia today which is under universal prices control is labour. Even with increases in wages workers suffer by inflation. By leaving the income tax schedules unchanged for 14 years this Government has inflated the lower and middle incomes and has put workers in these categories into higher tax brackets. This is another by-product of inflation. If we cannot keep wages at reasonable levels and yet maintain adequate purchasing power we will be priced out of every secondary export market in the world. taking stock of this situation now. The other basic social ill facing Australia -it is a by-product of the situation to which I have been referring-is the problem of workers having two jobs. How many men are working at two jobs? I am not sure whether such statistics are available. How many men are working 60 hours a week? Would we not all agree that the 40 hour week is a joke? The 35 hour week is an even bigger joke. It is bad enough for the working man to be dragged away from his home at night when he should be with his wife and family but it is even worse when he has to send his wife out to work in order to make ends meet. The honourable member for Adelaide referred to the exorbitant cost of housing and to the restrictions placed on young married couples seeking to buy a home. Husbands have been forced to send their wives to work in order to provide the necessaries of life. Young mothers have been forced out of their homes by economic pressure. We must not forget that this Government has been in office for 20 years. It has had the duty and the opportunity to rectify the present situation. Family life is the very basis of our nationhood. In the last couple of years the Government has boasted about the increasing number of women in the work force. Rather than something to be proud of I feel that this is something of which we should be ashamed. The short sightedness of the Government's policy was borne out by the headlines in this morning's newspapers. The number of unfilled jobs has increased by 6% while the unemployment figure has fallen by 10%. How can we have national growth without people? How can we survive without a population? Is this Government doing anything about child endowment? Is it doing anything to put the working wife back in her home? It is not. It engages in a lot of claptrap. It denigrates the Labor Party for its constructive proposals. The Government hopes to be able to offset the present population situation by immigration. It is time we considered the enormous cost of bringing migrants to this country. We must bear in mind this cost when we consider the cost of subsidising Australian families. We could have a system of subsidies paid to families on a sliding scale according to the number of childdren they have. For example, on the birth of a fourth child $1,000 might be deducted from the mortgage on a home; $1,500 on the birth of a fifth child. These figures may sound high but they are not when we compare them with the cost of bringing migrants to this country. After all, the best migrant are concerned about this travesty of elecis the infant Australian. I feel obliged to comment on another single step in maintaining a democratic topic. I have aimed to keep my topics society. I am very disappointed that there separate so that honourable members may were no references in the Governorfollow my arguments. I refer to the farGeneral's Speech to this question. But let cical situation that has developed around us not lay all of the blame solely at the 10722/70-R-{21 ] our electoral processes. At the general election in October of last year the people of this country wanted to change the government, but the system would not allow them to do so. Labor was defeated at the elections simply because of the positions its candidates held on the ballot papers. It is common knowledge that the Liberal-Country Party Government holds office by default because positions on the ballot paper are determined by the system of alphabetical order. The Democratic Labor Party, which has become the second string of the Liberal Party, manipulates this flaw in the electoral system of choosing for marginal seats candidates whose names begin with A or B, thus ensuring that those candidates are first on the ballot paper. The DLP has used this situation to its advantage and to the advantage of the present Government by giving the Government preferential support. To illustrate my point I provide the House with certain details. In the 1969 elections 108 seats were contested by DLP candidates, 50 of whom were first on Ihe ballot paper. That is, 46.3% of its candidates were at the top of the ballot paper. Let us go back through past elections. In 1966 the percentage was 41%, in 1963 it was 46%; and in 1961 it was 47%. It is not a new innovation; it has been doing this for quite a time. To further prove that the Government is party to this exercise there are other statistics to verify what I have said. In 1969 there were 40 seats where some or all preferences were distributed. After DLP preferences were distributed the Government won 28 seats and the Labor Party 3. It is even more interesting to refer to seats where first preference leads were reversed by the distribution of preferences. This is where the Labor Party had a first preference lead. Twelve seats were won by the Government after it had reversed our lead with DLP preferences. That situation obtained not only in 1969. I am quite certain that many Australians toral justice. After all, the rightful election of a government is the most important door of rhe DLP. The other party to excel are starting to realise now that they have in the field of electoral manipulation is the been taken-that they have been sold a Australian Country Party. It has a proud pup. Small wheat growers throughout Aushistory in this field. It has been doing this tralia are now on half incomes. How would since 1921. Just to let the whole country members of the Country Party in this Parknow that the Country Party members are liament like to have their incomes cut in dyed in the wool manipulators, they even half? This is what has happened to the write it into their national policy under small wheat growers whose quotas have the heading 'Electoral'. I quote it: The maintenance of not less than 20% tolerance the small grower get into this situation. It in assessing electoral quotas to enable tbe equating has never said: 'You cannot move from of the value of the vote between densely populated one commodity into wheat:' The Country electorates and those affected by sparseness of Party did not discourage them. The coalipopulation, area and disabilities of transport and tion continued to grant taxation concessions communication. What, in fact, this means is that in the equipment. Yet the Minister for Primary Country Party's view country people should Industry( Mr Anthony) has the audacity to have a greater say in the government of get up and say: 'We warned them.' For5 this country than city people.

The chickens are now coming of a person in tbe city. So far as the home to roost and I hope they come home Country Party is concerned the concept of quickly. 1 vote 1 value is strictly for the birds. It does not worry about that at all. Of course,I need not inform the House what Party subject that the Government virtually sideholds the portfolio of Minister for the stepped in His Excellency's Speech by Interior.

173,Leader Of The Country Party ( Mr Mcewen) That Stage It Was All Britain And All The,"American excesses,' and we cannot get it off that. Members opposite positively will not be and think Australian. Let us have a look at the Liberal Party's defence record, and we might start by looking at 1963. During the 1963 election, which was the election after the 1961 election when the Government had a majority of 1, the then Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, raced in on the contract for the TFX bomber, which is now called the F l 11 --and people are familiar with the F ill . We had a subsequent election in 1966, but no F ill aircraft had been delivered. We still had no F l 11 aircraft at the time of the 1969 election. In 1970 we still have no F l 11 aircraft. Yet in 1963 and 1964 we had a situation in Indonesia which could have threatened the security of Australia. Had that confrontation extended to Papua and New Guinea it is doubtful whether the Americans would have come to our assistance, yet Australia was left undefended by the Liberal Party-by this Government. Let me read an excerpt from the 'Age' of 7th March 1970. The 'Age' is an objective newspaper. The article stated: The original decision lo buy the swing-wing bomber was made by Sir Robert Menzies on the eve of the 1963 elections. It was a cynical votecatching strategy which paid little heed to Australia's long-term defence needs or to costs. The question is now whether the $207m already paid out by the Australian Government is transferable to another aircraft. Statements in the past by US defence chiefs suggested .this was not the case, and that Australia would have to pay a sizeable penalty if it was to get off thc contractual hook. One of Mr Fraser's chief tasks will be to determine to what extent this is still the official attitude. Australia must never again get itself into the position where it contracts to buy a fearfully expensive war plane, sight unseen, very largely on the claims of its manufacturers; that is all too clear now. Future defence contracts must also specify that where goods are not delivered within a reasonable period of time, or where they fail to meet specified conditions of airworthiness and reliability, the contract is null and void. Such contracts must also offer protection to the buyer against the ever-spiralling costs over which he has no control. The final lesson is that a decision to buy several squadrons of highly expensive planes is not one to be taken lightly or on the eve of an election . . . Sir Robert bought in haste; Australia is now left to repent at leisure. Let us have a look at the cost of the F l 11. The money already spent totals $207m. This is money that we have paid on the contract. At Amberley air base the cost of capital works totals $9.1m and ground support equipment $19.32m. The cost of training air crew and ground staff is estimated at $3m. So the total cost to date is approximately $240m. If we pull out completely from the F ill contracts we will be up for approximately $50m. If we can change across and accept the Phantom aircraft, which for years the Liberals have been saying is obsolete and which now should be completely obsolete in their view, then we have lost that money. I should like to make a comparison between Australia and Sweden in this regard. I quote from the publication 'Armed Forces Management' of February 1967 in which an article states: A cornerstone of the Swedish defence posture is the Swedish Air Force, currently equipped with large numbers of SAAB Draken supersonic fighters. Even before the first production Draken was delivered to the Air Force in the late 1950s, however, work was well under way to determine the next phase in the country's air defence. Let us dwell on that point. This was happening in 1950. Sweden was looking 10 years ahead, but this Government decided on a plane in 3 months. This gives an idea of this Government's stupidity. The article continued: During this period, all conceivable variations of possible aircraft were studied, including the possibilities of buying aircraft from abroad or manufacturing them under licence in Sweden. Aircraft that were looked at closely, either in the hardware form or, where this was not available, in the design study phases, included Britain's now-cancelled TSR2, and the US McDonnel Phantom II and General Dynamics GrummanF ill A. Eventually, however, it was decided that the best solution would be to design and build at home wherever possible, adopting the simplest design commensurate with the type of high-speed performance required. This resulted in the early 1960s in the specification of what has become known as 'System 37', the name given to a complete weapons system, of which the Mach 2.5 single-seat multi-purpose Viggen aircraft . . . is the heart That is a 1,750 miles an hour supersonic attack bomber being built in Sweden, which has a population of only 8 million people. It makes the Government look pretty silly. The article continues: Furthermore, fhe design calls not only for a high weapons load, mainly missiles, and a high performance in range and speed, but also lower landing speeds than normally is the case with such aircraft, to enable it to use the dispersed highway bases when necessary, while good accessability for maintenance and rapid checking of functional parts is also being built in. Time does not allow me to elaborate on this, but at another time. I would like to take up this point of comparing Sweden with Australia in the manufacture of defence equipment and the encouragement of an aircraft industry. would like to congratulate the honourable member for Blaxland( Mr Keating) on his speech, although I myself certainly cannot agree with a lot of the things he said. It is obvious that he has done his homework and that his material was well thought out. I wish him well through some of the stormy passages, especially in the realm of defence, that I can see him encountering later. I also wish to commend the Government on the manner in which it is implementing legislation to fulfil election promises and other matters referred to in the Governor General's address. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) may call it a flurry of legislation if he wishes, but I feel he would have some real cause for complaint if the Government had been lax in presenting this legislation. As it is, in the way I see it, the Government is proving to the people in the shortest time possible that it is a responsible government which will honour its election promises. Tonight there are 2 matters I wish to speak about which I feel are of vital importance to the people of Australia and which, in my opinion, should receive high priority attention. I direct my remarks to all members of the House, and in particular to the Minister for Health (Dr Forbes), the Minister for Customs and Excise( Mr Chipp) and the Attorney-General( Mr Hughes). The first matter is the possibility of an increase in drug abuse and the illegal traffic of drugs throughout our country. Within recent months I doubt whether there would be many people who have not read or beard that the use of illegal drugs has reached epidemic proportions in the United States of America and Great Britain and many other countries of the world. I feel that it would be extremely foolish of us if we failed to realise that Australia too could become equally susceptible. Even though we may enjoy the distinct advantage of geographical isolation in this matter, it is because of this and because of the diligence of our health authorities that we do not experience the problems of smallpox, yellow fever and such diseases. Yet the illegal entry of drugs into our country is another problem altogether and one which could be effected quite simply by callous, brutal and determined men. I do not think I need enlarge on the fact that our tremendous length of coastline could assist this operation. I know that our health authorities and our customs authorities have already launched a nationwide campaign against dnig abuse, but I am firmly of the opinion that, with our scattered population, it is physically impossible for our Federal authorities and our State Health and Police Departments to cover every avenue which this illegal traffic may flow through. The answer to this is not a simple one, but I feel there is' an answer which will mean a lot of patience, hard work and the co-operation of parents, teachers, our own youth and in fact all those people and organisations who have regular and close contact with our young people. The answer can' be summed up in one word and that is 'education'. In this regard, we must be prepared to learn from the mistakes that have been made overseas. Let us face it. Many mistakes have been made, and possibly one of the greatest has been a failure to recognise that no single class of people is immune to this new menace. I call it a 'Dew menace' even though the taking of drugs in some form or another has persisted throughout the ages. I cannot recall throughout my readings of history any era where tbe misuse of drugs reached such proportions as it has at the present time. While we may consider that the illegal use of drugs is not a major concern in Australia at the moment, nobody has convinced me that it could not become so in the future, and I am sure that everyone will agree that this must be prevented, no matter how much effort is involved. From all the accounts I have studied over the last 7 months, it is the youth of the nation who are most susceptible to this detrimental influence. It undermines their moral fortitude and destroys them mentally and physically. I feel that we must remember it is the youth of today who will be the leaders of this great country of ours tomorrow. I say that there is not one of us who would not like to see our Australian",79,Governor General S Speech
174,Mr Bonnett (Herbert) [10.51],"Iyouth mature into healthy, vigorous, clearthinking adults. In my opinion, no efforts should be spared to protect them from this shocking menace. There are many reasons why our young people become involved in the misuse of drugs. It could be because of an unhappy home environment, the pressure of intense study, the urge to try something different, or it could be as a reaction against authority, just to name a few reasons. As I mentioned previously, no single class is immune. Probably one of the greatest contributing factors is ready access to the illegal drug market, and this is the point of my discussion which really disturbs me. Drug abuse follows no fixed pattern. I fully realise that this makes detection and prevention extremely difficult but there must be an answer. While I know that our narcotics investigators, both State and Federal, are constantly on the alert to combat this menace, I am convinced that a great responsibility falls on the parents and teachers to assist in this matter. Unfortunately, there are a great number of parents who will not be convinced that their children could become involved in this unhealthy business but, whether the children become innocent victims or not, unfortunately it Is only grim experience that makes such parents realise that they had the wrong outlook. Unfortunately, again there are so many about. I am perfectly willing to make a people who could supply information special trip to Melbourne to gain this inforregarding this illegal traffic but who, for mation in order to clear this matter up, some reason or other, refuse to do so. if Dr Wainer desires. There are parents who think that their children would receive some notorious publicity which would be detrimental to of a fine young person who has become their future, others who think they may an addict of drugs after graduating frotr. become involved and, worse of all, the the so-called soft drugs to the bard drug:, parent who thinks that if the knowledge I am sure that they would think twice aboiu that his son or daughter had used the drug withholding even the slightest piece of informarihuana leaked out it would adversely mation which may assist the authorities to affect him socially and in business. These destroy this evil. It has been claimed in people must be made to realise that the some quarters that the so-called soft drugs knowledge they may possess would assist such as marihuana and pep pills are not all the youth in the community and that harmful or habit forming. I have no medical there is no personal publicity given to knowledge to support me when I speak of individual cases unless they wish it to be so. this matter, but I do know after reading Speaking of people withholding knowover 90% of our young people who are ledge of this evil business, I was amazed addicted now to the hard drugs such as to read quite recently that Dr Wainer of heroin, opium or morphine say that they Melbourne had claimed he had proof that started on soft drugs. There are some the drug cannabis was being grown by some Italian cane farmers in the Ingham district of north Queensland and that these same farmers were being stood over by members of some organisation and were being forced to grow this rubbish, which was eventually distributed on southern illegal drug markets. He stated that these were not just wild claims but that he could prove them. Surely the right and proper thing to do would have been to inform the authorities immediately this information became available if the doctor believed it to be fact. I fail to understand why Dr Wainer made his claims through the Press instead of first approaching the authorities, unless of course he desired the publicity that it got. The Ingham district is part of my electorate. I have known quite a number of Italian farmers for many years, and I can assure the doctor that in my book they are responsible citizens who are greatly respected throughout the district. This statement that he made has upset them considerably, and they would desire nothing better than to have his claims investigated and cleared up completely. I would say to the doctor that the right and proper thing to do, after making such a statement, would be to inform the authorities immediately. If he does not wish to become involved with the authorities, he can give me the information and I will guarantee to act upon it quickly and without any mucking If only people could see the actual result articles over the past 7 months that people, including men with medical knowledge, who state that marihuana should be legalised. Even some of our own countrymen, including two of our senators, believe that it would not be harmful to legalise this drug. What amazed me last week was that the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) gave this a passing glance during his maiden speech and said that marihuana should be legalised. This amazes me. I would say that, before they really go off half cocked on this matter, they should be reminded that there is no known authority which can state with any certainty that this drug bas no bad after effects, even though medical authorities in a number of countries have been studying this question for years. I have here a publication from the University College in London which states: Subjects with chronic cannabis psychosis conloss of money paid in fines. People thieve tinued to have vertigo and disturbance of balance because they are in need or are too lazy as well as auditory hallucinations for some weeks to work and want to make a quick dollar. after the initial hallucinations bad disappeared. Finally, these findings are given in London: . . . 95% of heroin addicts started their acquaintance of drugs witb cannabis. So, let us hear no more nonsense about legalising this rubbish, for goodness sake. Previously, I spoke about the ready access to illegal drugs. With regard to this, the people who have become addicted, whether it is by their own choice or not, have my sympathy. It is a frightful experience to see them withdrawing from a bout of drug taking. I bave not seen really hard cases. But what I have seen is enough for me. The people-or , should I say, monsters -wh o supply the drugs in the first place will never get a pat on the back from me. On the contrary, I sincerely believe that they should be punished as harshly as possible. I say that these ruthless, callous and I call them-vil e individuals who deal in human misery are the ones whom I would seek to destroy. The original sources of supply down to the lowest, meanest pedlar represent a channel of complete and utter human misery. The people who control and distribute this misery deserve the harshest penalties of the law. Let us have a look at how harsh the laws are that can deal with these characters. We read where a person was found with marihuana in his possession and, according to the evidence, was prepared to peddle this rubbish. He was fined $250. He probably paid the fine out of his fob pocket, having no need to touch his wallet to pay such a miserable fine for such a grave offence. The week before last, we read of a drug pedlar, 19 years of age, who appealed against the severity of a 4 year gaol sentence for peddling marihuana, dexamphetamine, morphine and methadome. Fortunately, he lost the appeal. God knows how many people this character had helped along the road to despair, misery and degradation, and the law can stop his activities for 4 years only. Imposing fines on these people for conducting their harmful practices is 'something-nothing'. They can afford to pay and to laugh while they are paying, knowing full well that they can leave the court and continue their deadly business to regain the Most murders are committed in moments of extreme emotion or sheer callousness. But the animals, who unfortunately have the right to be called human brings and who supply and p:ddle drugs to anyone and everyone they can, can be classed as executioners who condemn hundreds of normal healthy young people to a painful, miserable and lonely death which may take years to eventuate. Taking money from them in fines does not stop this traffic one little bit. So1 suggest that we take their freedom and their rights as citizens. I suggest that we keep them apart from the society that they seek to destroy for the sake of money and an easy life. To add to my suggestion, I would request that this Government, in conjunction with State governments, considers making the minimum sentence 10 years without the option of a fine and with no parole period for such offences. It is my firm belief that only this type of punishment will serve as a deterrent to those criminals who would endeavour to make a lucrative business by dealing in human misery. Thinking along the lines that preven'ion is better than cure. I suggest that this Government again in co-operation with the State authorities expands the present drug education scheme in order that all parents, teachers, our Australian youthin fact everybody-ar e familiar with the problems of the misuse of drugs and the shocking results that this habit can produce. Finally, I would appeal to all those people throughout the CommonweaUh who think that they may have some information to offer which would assist the authorities to prevent this menace from spreading throughout our communities to please pass on their information. There is no need for them to become involved. Any information, no matter how small, may be the means to keep this dirty business away from Australia. [Quorum formed.] Debate (on motion by Dr Gun) adjourned. House adjourned at 11.8 p.m. The following answers to questions upon notice were circulated: Electoral (Question No. 11) Mr Calwell asked, the Prime Minister, upon notice: Have the opinions of constitutional lawyers been obtained on the question of constitutional difficulties which might invalidate legislation to permit the electors of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory to elect two members each to the Senate; if so, will he table them in the House. honourable member's question is as follows: I am informed by the Attorney-General that, so far as his Department is aware, no opinions of constitutional lawyers have been obtained on the matter referred to. Governments in Exile (Question No. 28) Mr Hayden asked the Minister for External Affairs, upon notice: Further to your predecessor's answer to my question No. 1817 (Hansard, 9th September 1969, page 1019) what are tbe names of the Heads of State and tbe places of government of the Governments of Estonia,. Latvia, and Lithuania, which went into exile following the USSR.'s invasion of those States in 1940. honourable member's question is as follows: The legal position is that Australia has never withdrawn recognition from tbe Governments of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania which were forced into exile by the USSR.'s invasion and occupation of those States in 1940. Australia has not explicitly extended recognition to any particular Government which may regard itself as a successor to one of those Governments which Australia recognised in 1940. Vietnam (Question No. 32) Mr Keogh asked the Minister for External Affairs, upon notice: (1) Is the Australian Government watching closely the investigations being conducted by tbe American authorities into the allegations of a massacre by certain American officers of some hundred of Vietnamese civilians in the village of Song My.

(3) WiU such an incident influence the Government's attitude to the Viet-Nam war. honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) It is premature to consider action. (3) The Government deplores any atrocities or acts contrary to the dictates of humanity and the rules of war, regardless of who commits them. If such an act were committed by American forces, it would be an isolated incident and not an act of Government policy. The United States Government has set itself, publicly and privately, against acts contrary to the rules of war.

Public Service Board in 1966 and again in 1970 on the effect of the introduction of 4 weeks' annual leave on the number of public servants in New South Wales. The N.S.W. Board advised on each occasion that the increased leave was one factor in the representations it has received for increased staff. However, it did not have precise figures to accurately determine the effect of the increase in leave since administrative requirements and staffing conditions vary between departments. Defence Forces Retirement Benefits (Question No. 41) Mr Whitlam asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: In what way and lo what extent will the retirement benefits of members of the Defence Forces be affected by the proposals to preserve superannuation rights which he presented to the House on 25th September 1969. able member's question is as follows: The proposals for preservation of superannuation rights as announced on 25th September 1969 will be implemented for members of the Defence Forces by amendment of the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948-1969 to be introduced in this session , of Parliament.

Royal Australian Navy (Question No. 203) Mr Stewart asked the Minister for the Navy, upon notice: (1) Are pay, recreation leave and long service leave entitlements of the Royal Australian Navy based on any Federal or State award. (2) If so what is the award. able member's question is as follows: Under the group pay system for sailors, some categories are related to the award wage . payable to comparable civilian employment governed by a Federal or State award. More generally, as announced by die Minister for Defence recently, the new machinery established in the Department of Defence to deal with pay and conditions of service for the armed forces will ensure that movements which occur anywhere in ' the civilian area of employment will be considered for their relevance in the Service situation. Tbere has been a progressive extension of relating rates of pay for those in the Services to the rates of those in the community at large engaged in comparable activity. Broadcasting (Question No. 226) Mr Collard asked General, upon notice: (1) Has the Australian Broadcasting Control Board submitted a report or recommendation regarding the establishment of a radio station to serve the districts of Wyndham and Kununurra. (2) If so, what is Intended. able member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The matter has been the subject of recent consideration by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board includingfirst-handengineering observations but I have not yet received a report from the Board. As I informed the honourable member in reply to a previous question (Hansard, 25th March 1969) the area in question is one of a number having claims for unproved reception which are the subject of investigations by the Board. Following ratification in December 1969 of an agreement negotiated with New Zealand during 1969 concerning the use of frequency channels, I understand that considerable progress has been made with the investigations and tbe honourable member may be assured that consideration of possibilities of improved broadcasting may be necessary to ensure its prohibition. Ausservice in the Wyndham-Kununurra area is not being overlooked. Vietnam (Question No. 248) Mr Stewart asked the Minister for External Affairs, upon notice: (1) Have any cases of alleged black market dealings, manipulation of currency or smuggling of.arms to the Vietcong by Australian servicemen in Vietnam been brougbt to the notice of tbe Australian Ambassador by the United States Security Services.

Resolution A declared as contrary to the generally recognised rules of international law, as embodied in the Geneva Protocol of 1925, tbe use in international armed conflicts of any chemical agents of warfare and any biological agents of warfare. Voting on it was 80 countries in favour, three (Australia, Portugal and the USA) against, with 36 abstentions. The abstaining countries included Canada, France, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and the United Kingdom. Resolution B called for strict observance of the principles and objectives of the Geneva Protocol; invited all slates that bad not yet done so to become parties to the Protocol; and asked the Geneva Disarmament Committee to give urgent consideration to reaching agreement on the prohibition of chemical and biological warfare. Voting on this resolution was 120 countries (including Australia) in favour, none against, with one abstention. Australia co-sponsored this resolution. The Australian Government strongly supports efforts to negotiate, with a minimum of delay, such further effective methods of international control over chemical and biological warfare as tralia is a party to the Geneva Protocol.

The Australian Permanent Representative to the United Nations explained tbese difficulties in detail in a statement in the Genera] Assembly on 9th December 1969. There was no consensus at tbe Genera] Assembly in favour of the proposition of law asserted in resolution 2603A, and the Assembly itself has no power to make international law by resolution Tbe measure of disagreement in this case indicates that Australia's misgivings were widely shared. Further informed and serious consideration of the problem of prohibiting chemical and biological warfare will be necessary in the Geneva Disarmament Committee before an acceptable and effective solution can be devised. The Government hopes that the Committee will give this matter the highest possible priority. (2) See answer to (1) above. National Water Resources (Question No. 319) Mr Wallis asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: Has he received any request from the South Australian Government forfinancialassistance in providing a water pipeline to Kimba on Eyre Peninsula. able member's question is as follows: Yes.

These consultations are not to enable zone under United Nations jurisdiction and representatives to put views to the Government sovereignty and (f) ecology and the development on the needs and wants of their own particular decade. honourable member's question is as follows: (a), (b) and (c) Australia is not at present considering initiatives or proposals under these headings. The General Assembly of tbe United Nations will consider at Its 25 th session this year an item which was deferred from its 24th session entitled 'Need to consider suggestions regarding the review of the Charter of the United Nations'. In the brief discussion of the subject at the 24th session of the General Assembly, opinion was divided on whether there was a need for revision of the Charter. The representative of Colombia who introduced the item noted that many present members of the United Nations had not been present at the drafting of the Charter. He considered that an opportunity should now be given them for making known their views on it. Some other delegations took tbe view that the Charter in its present form offered possibilities that had not all been used, and that revision might not add to its effectiveness. (d), (e) and (f) The relationship to revision of the Charter of these items is not apparent. With regard to (d) there Is a Committee to Study the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-bed and the Ocean Floor of which Australia is currently a member. Australian delegations to sessions of this Committee receive instructions ih accordance with Government policy relating to the questions which are under consideration. Similar considerations apply to (f). Australia is represented by an observer delegation at a meeting of tbe Preparatory Committee for tbe United' Nations Conference on the Human Environment which is meeting in New York from 10th to 20th March, 1970. Australia is also currently a member of tbe United Nations Preparatory Committee for the Second Development Decade.

187,Mr Mcmahon,The answer to the,88,Answers To Questions Upon Notice
188,Mr Gorton,"The answer to the honourthe kind of meeting you suggest. However, Government Ministers bave from time to time received deputations representing pensioners in order to hear their views. In addition written submissions are received from various pensioner organisations, and indeed from a great variety of organisations, about their needs and wants. These have been and will continue to be given the utmost consideration by the Government in preparing the Budget each year. (2) It is not the Government's intention to change the practice of not providing travel expenses to and from Canberra for deputations. Taxation (Question No. 320) Mr Wallis asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Is the cost of necessary books and fees a deductible item for tax purposes for a part-time student attending a technical college or similar educational institution. (2) If not, will he take the necessary steps to make them deductible items. member's question is as follows: (1) (a) Under the concessional deduction provisions of the income tax law, deductions for education expenses, including the cost of necessary books and fees, are allowable to a tax payer where the expenses are necessarily incurred by him for or in connection with the fullupon notice: time education of a person who is less than 21 years of age and is a child of the taxpayer or is a person for whom the taxpayer is entitled to a dependant's deduction. The deduction under these provisions is subject to an upper conclusion with lasting consequences for the limit of three hundred dollars for any one student and is not available where the expenses are incurred in respect of a part-time student, (b) Where a part-time student incurs expenditure on his own education, the general provisions of the income tax law apply in determining whether a deduction is allowable. These provisions authorise deductions for expenditure incurred in producing assessable income, but specifically preclude the allowance of deductions for outgoings which are of a capital, private or domestic nature. Decisions of Taxation Boards of Review have established that expenditure incurred by a taxpayer on a course of study undertaken with a view to acquiring academic qualifications, or to enable him to take up a career, is of a private or capital nature and is not deductible for income tax purposes. Where, on the other hand, a taxpayer incurs expenditure on a course of study undertaken for the purpose of maintaining the knowledge or skills required in following his profession or employment, the expenditure would generally qualify for deduction on the ground that it is incurred in connection with the production of his assessable income. (2) lt is the practice of the Government to examine the many requests of this nature that are made for taxation concessions when it is preparing the annual Budget. The representation made by the honourable member will be considered when the 1970-71 Budget is being drawn up. Conciliation and Arbitration-Meta l Trades Case (Question No. 351) Mr Clyde Cameron asked the Treasurer, What did he mean when, following 1967 Metal Trades Case, he said that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission had sidestepped its responsibilities and that its decision to grant the union's claim in that case could be a calamitous economy. member's question is as follows: The full text of the statement referred to makes my meaning plain.",88,Answers To Questions Upon Notice
