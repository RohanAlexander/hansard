2,Mr Charlton,"I understand thatamount of uncertainty about the ratification by the States of the Main Roads Agreement. New South Wales has already decided not to ratify it, the South Australian Parliament has carried a resolution in opposition to it, and there is also strenuous opposition to it in thu Victorian Parliament, as indicated in the debate which took place yesterday in the Legislative Assembly. In these circumstances I should like to know if the Prime Minister considers it advisable to occupy the time of the House with the Federttl Aid Roads Bill before the decision of the States regarding it has been made known. Otherwise, the completion of the business already on the business paper will probably involve all-night sittings and thc passing of legislation without proper consideration? tend to make an announcement in regard to the business the Government proposes to submit for consideration this session. The honourable gentleman's question is really directed towards the Federal Aid Roads Bill. It is true that reports have appeared in the press regarding the attitude of certain States towards the agreement covered by that bill, but the Commonwealth Government has received no official communication except from New South Wales, notifying their disapproval of tha agreement. mier of Victoria stated that he had verbally agreed to the proposals made by the Commonwealth, but, as a matter of fact, he has done more than that; he has actually written to the Commonwealth Government expressing the approval of his government. orable inember that it is necessary that the attitude of all the States should be ascertained, because the arrangement proposed by the Commonwealth is dependent upon an agreement with the States, to which all but New South Wales have already indicated their willingness to assent. The Commonwealth Government intends to ascertain definitely the present attitude of the States towards its proposals. MR. MARK YOUNG. know-from the Prime Minister whether the case of a former inspector' of the Commonwealth Bank, Mr Mark Young, has been definitely closed, and, if not, whether, in view of the representations that are being made in various periodicals and in the daily press, and of the growing public opinion in favour of a thorough investigation into the matter, he will for the purpose, of allaying public anxiety, and once for all letting the full light of day into it, reopen the case and have an investigation into it made by some disinterested and competent tribunal empowered to take evidence on oath? public anxiety in regard to this matter. I remind the honourable member that the subject was fully discussed in this House on a motion that an inqniry should be held into certain matters upon which Mr Young had made representations, and it was determined that there should be no public inquiry. Therefore, so far as the Government is concerned, the case is closed. Minister said, in reply to a question, that there was no intention to duplicate the plant of the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Yesterday the Prein Yictoria or to establish refineries in other States. That being so, I should like to know what was thc object of obtaining the authority of Parliament to increase thc capital of the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited? I agree with the honmust have forgotten the explanation I gave when I introduced the bill, and the debate which took place on it. I explained that, the object of securing increased capital for the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited was to enable it to come into line with modern developments in connection'with the installation of a bulk system of distribution. know from the Prime Minister if the Government has taken into consideration the necessity of affording secondary education at Canberra, in view of the fact",14,Order Of Business

If any members of the board are connected*, Watson) asked the following questions:1. Isi t a fact that the operation of the "" Paterson Butter Scheme"" made it possible to import New Zealand butter into Australia, and that upwards of 70,000 boxes of this butter were imported during A p r i l , May, June, and July of this year? 2. Isi t a fact that while New Zealand butter was being imported, it cost"" £196 per ton, duty paid, AHistralia, while Kangaroo brand butter was shipped and sold in London at an average price of £142 per ton f.o.b.? The answers to the honourable member's questions, as supplied to me by the Victorian Section of the Australian Stabilization Committee, are as follow:1. The importations referred to were made because Australian supplies of choicest butter were not sufficient to meet the local requirements of New South! Wales and Victoria. 'The number of boxes imported into Australia during A p r i l, May, June, and July was approximately 53,000, not upwards of 70,000 as stated 2. The New Zealand butter imported intoAustralia cost £196 per ton, duty paid. SinceA p r i l last "" Kangaroo"" ibrand butter has been selling in London at prices ranging from £166to £176 per ton. On the 21st July the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) asked the following questions:1. What quantity of New Zealand butter was imported into Australia for the year ended 30th June, 1926? 2. Isi t a fact that some of this butter TO imported by three members of the Dairy Export Control Board; if so, what quantity, and under what circumstances? To which I replied^1. 1,300 tons. 2. The Dairy Produce Control Board has been asked to furnish me with a reply to this question, which) 1 w ill make available to the honourable member as soon as possible. Advice has now been received that the board is unable to supply the information because it concerns the private business of its members. I understand that it is the practice of the Department of Trade and Customs not to disclose the names of"" importers of particular commodities. On the 23rd July, the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) asked, the following questions:1. What are the names of the members of the Dairy Produce Export Control Board? 2. What remuneration do they receive? 3. What is the occupation of each member of the board, and what business enterprise is heconnected with? with business enterprises, did any of those concerns engage in the importation of butter fromNew Zealand for the year ended the 30th June, 1926, and, if so, what quantities did they i m port? 5.

29,Mr Paterson,"On the 28th JulyThe following are the replies to the honourable member's questions:1. Clivo McPherson, CBE., Conunonwealth Government representative; C. Wilson, representing sellers of dairy produce out of the Comnioiiwealth; T. F. Plunkett (chairman), H. F. Walker, C. E. D. Meares, C. H. Fraser (deputy of W. H. Clifford), H. W. Osborne, A. W.

Handbury, representing proprietary butter and cheese factories. 2. Tlie remuneration received by memhers of the board is £4 4s. per day sitting fee, and in the case of the chairman £5 5s. per day. In addition, members receive a daily allowance to cover cost of travelling wherever necessary. No allowance is paid on days when members receive a sitting fee. 3 and 4. The information asked for cannot be supplied, because it relates to the private busiFruits Export Control Bill) called on. ness of members of the board. 5. It is estimated that the quantity nf butter produced in the Commonwealth during the year ended 30th June, 1026, was 115,000 tons, the approximate value of which was £20,000,000. 6. (a) Approximately 72,000 tons; (b) 43,000 tons. 7. Tlic importations of butter into the Commonwealth have now practically ceased. On the 23 rd July, tbe honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Eorde) asked the following questions:1. How many dairy farmers are there in each State of Australia, and what is the total number of dairy farmers in Australia? -2. What were the average gross earnings of each dairy farmer during 1925-26? 3. What has been the total saving made by the Dairy Export Control Board in handling the exportable surplus of butter for 1923-26, and how has it been done? 4. How much is this saving per head of dairy farmers in Australia for the year 1925 26? 5. If figures cannot bo given for 1925-26, what are they for 1925? The following are the replies to the honourable member's questions:1. It is very difficult to even estimate the number of dairy farmers in the Commonwealth. In November, 1924, a poll was taken under the Dairy Produce Control Act, and the number of producers then enrolled was as follows:-Victoria, 51,700; New South Wales, 19,000; Queensland, 15,230; South Australia, 22,000; Tasmania, 4,232; Western Australia, 3,000; Commonwealth, 115,162. 2. No reliable data is available to enable this information to he supplied. 3. It is impossible to estimate the savings effected by the Dairy Produce Control Board during 1925-26 (the first year of its existence ). Direct results were obtained by reductions iu marine insurance, and also, for the coming season, in overseas freight on butter and cheese, the latter amounting approximately Mr I'nLemonto £53,000 per annum. By exercising supervision over sales, improving the marketing organization, bringing about co-ordination amongst wholesale distributors, and in regulating supplies during the periods of glut in the United Kingdom, and thus stabilizing prices, tlie board succeeded in obtaining substantial advantages, but the actual monetary gain cannot be estimated. 4 and 5.

The Prime Minister, if possible, should give the House, notice of his intentions. It may be that the honourable member for Wannon, glancing at tbe notice-paper, saw that the Canned Fruits Export Control Bill was listed as Order of the Day No. 3, and considered that he had plenty of time to keep some urgent appointment in the city before he would be called on to continue his remarks.

The motion that was carried by the House was that the consideration of Order of the Day No. 1 be postponed until after consideration of Orders of the Day Nos. 3 and 2. The mere fact that the Prime Minister mentioned Order of the Day No. 3 before Order of the Day No. 2 did not in itself postpone Order of the Day No. 2 after Order of the Day No. 3. There must be a resolution of this House to postpone Order of the Day No. 2 before we can proceed with Order of the Day No. 3. .

As the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) is not present, and should have the opportunity, if he wishes to do so, to continue his remarks on the Canned Fruits Bill, I am quite prepared to substitute for the motion just carried a motion to allow Order of the Day No. 2 to be proceeded with.

We have already debated 'the Pederal Aid Roads Bill, and to me tbe car of government seemed to be running along the road in a rather bumpy manner. I want to know whether there has been a puncture or a complete break-down. [ know that some of the bearings have run hot, and there are rumours of serious blow-outs. The Prime Minister sh. uld tell honourable members whether the car .has run off the road or has met with only -a temporary mishap. The debates on the -League of Nations agenda-paper and the Canned Fruits Export Control Bill were pushed aside for the Federal Aid Roads Bill, and we have assembled this morning to hear the further debate on that bill.

The Attorney-General( Mr Latham) has promised, or threatened, to proceed to the League of Nations, and I , for one, do not wish him to go until he has expressed a considered opinion on the legality of the Government's proposals relating to main roads. reconsider the subject, because the two opinions already expressed by him. are conflicting, and I should accept his third opinion as conclusive. Groom) I ask the honourable member not to discuss the merits of the Federal Aid Roads Bill until the motion for the postponement of Order of the Day No. .1 has been disposed of. avoiding any irregularity of that kind. I am merely saying that it is highly desirable that we should have the final and considered opinion of the Attorney-General regarding the bill. I grant that canned fruit3 are an important subject, and I appreciate Wentworth ( Mr Marks) is straining at the leash to give us a speech on the League of Nations; but it must be conceded that we cannot proceed to a satisfactory conclusion on any of these subjects unless the road along which we must travel has been made for us. Therefore, we should discuss main roads. Surely the Prime Minister realizes that there are still a few representative bodies in Australia who have not yet condemned his proposal to tax petrol to provide revenue for constructing main roads, and that if he postpones the question he will, instead of making his own position easier, achieve a disastrous result; for, although these few public bodies and individuals in remote places agree with him, there will be none on his side consideration until next week.

Before the public indignation against the Government's policy has further developed, the wisdom of this Parliament should be let loose; we should declare ourselves at once, definitely and finally. traditional with all governments, qf holding an ear to the ground to ascertain the nature of public opinion, is to be deprecated. We, in our wisdom-and I think most honourable members will grant our superior wisdom-shoul d direct and control public opinion, not seek to follow it . Therefore, let us, with courage and for t i tude, here and now, face this question of main roads. I am not permitted to dis cuss the merits of the question further than to say that I am opposed to the Government's policy. I have been a roaduser since I started to go to school in the bush, where I was born, and I have been interested in the development of roads; and the sources of revenue which are tapped for their maintenance, ever since. I am yearning to debate this question. For the moment, the main roads of Australia are a more pressing matter than the League of Nations or canned fruitstwo allied questions which are doutbless important in themselves, but are of less immediate importance than main roads. I regret that the terms in which the motion is couched preclude me from discussing main roads. That being so, I merely register my opposition, and, having regard to the pressure of time and other urgent business, J leave the subjeof with some regret, in the hope that what 1 have said will induce the Government to withdraw the motion. I apprehend that the notice-paper represented the conI can only reiterate sidered judgment of the Government up to midnight last night. What has happened since? Therefore, I shall not rebeen issued. something to do with it . I hope that in my opposition to this motion I shall have the support of honourable members. I realize that it is sometimes necessary for the Government to make an alteration of the notice-paper, but, in fairness to honourable members, the order of business, as set out on the notice-paper, should be adhered to as far as possible. I intend to speak on the Canned Fruits Export ControlB ill , but I am not prepared to do so now. I assumed that the order of business as set out on the business-paper would be observed, and I consequently made no attempt to prepare a speech. On the other hand, I have prepared a speech on the RoadsB ill . I knew that the honThe practice, which is no doubt orable member for Wannon had the floor on the Canned Fruits Export ControlB ill .

As somewhat of a sailor, I have always been opposed to proceeding to sea on a Friday, because as every one knows voyages commencing on that day are supposed to be attended with misfortune. And, in fact, I am somewhat at a disadvantage this morning, as I did not expect the debate on this motion to be called on, and I have not the notes which I had prepared with me. I am, therefore, indebted to the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) for making an excellent speech on a point of order in relation to the Federal Aid Roads Bill, and thus giving me the opportunity to gather together the few observations I have to make on this important subject. When this motion was before the House last week, I remained in the chamber for practically seven hours on end, because I was so interested in the speeches delivered by honourable members. I cordially endorse the remark of the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) that the speech of the honourable member for Reid( Mr other types. It will, therefore, be seen Coleman) met with his hearty commendation, though like him I do not agree with everything the honourable member for Reid said. come as a surprise to some honourable members, but it was not a surprise to me, because from many conversations with him I know that he has given a good deal of attention to foreign affairs. With one or two of his points I shall deal later. I have not attended an Assembly of the League of Nations, though during the sittings of the last Assembly, I was within a few miles of Geneva, and in close touch with many of those at the Assembly. In the course of my ten trips round the world, however, I have been in conversation with the leading diplomats of many countries, and am personally acquainted with many persons who have attended the meetings of the League, and have, therefore, been able to obtain their opinion on international matters. It ia easy to say that we believe in the League of Nations, actually is, and where it assembles? Its the Australian delegates meetings are held practically in the heart of Europe, and it functions in an atmosphere not exactly of war, but of continual preparation for war. If honourable members would study the conditions of the armies and navies of the world to-day, as revealed in publications obtainable in our Library and elsewhere, they would receive a frightful shock. Although the League of Nations is endeavouring to ensure the peace of the world by discussions around the council table, the armed forces of Europe are greater to-day than they were in 1914. From the following figures concerning a branch of defence in which I am especially interested-the Navy -honorabl e members will gain some idea of the strength of the navies of the world.

America has a population of 116,000,000 people, and is f a r removed from the turmoil of Europe. She did, however, endeavour to bring the nations together for peaceful purposes by convening the Washington Disarmament Conference, and much good work was done at the conference, although it has since been undone, to some extent, because so many war vessels, other than capital ships, are now However, I shall leave that aspect of the question for a moment, and deal with the economic question, which is causing a good deal of concern. When I was abroad eighteen months ago, I found that the dangerous subject was, as pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition, the question of supply of the world's raw material. We, in Australia, have no real idea of the importance of this question. If there is anything that is likely to cause talk of war, or actual war, it is the supply of raw materials. For the information of honourable members. I quote the following statement from to-day's Sun Pictorial:Pact Only Beginning. (Pictorial World Cables.) London.

AlthoughI entirely agree with the sentiment underlying the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. I cannot support the amendment, for certain reasons. The issue, however, cannot be sidebeing constructed. tracked ; it must be faced. We must remember that any question likely to bring about war can. be considered by the League, aud if there are any subjects which are likely to have that result they are the world's supplies of raw material and migration. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that Australia's delegates to the League should make it perfectly clear where we stand on these matters and on the White Australia policy. The subject cannot be raised by the Australian delegates at the Assembly of the League; but I think the right honourable member for Balaclava was right when he said that our delegates can voice our opinions before the other delegates of the British Empire who w ill be at the Assembly. That has a bearing upon the point raised by the honourable member for Beid, that we were not consafeguard German sulted by the British authorities about the Of course we were not. that the Leader of the Opposition had pie. That remark was applauded; but it gave me the opportunity on the following night to explain that it did not matter a rap whether Australia has its finger we should be involved equally with all other parts of the Empire five minutes afterwards. war, the whole Empire is at war. I do -not think the honourable member is foolish -enough to believe that Australia would be better out of the Empire than in it. Australia's security has depended and always Twill depend upon the might of Great Britain and her Navy; but, whatever move may be made on tbe international chessboard at Downing-street, we are bound by it. That has an important bearing on Australia's representation in London. I iliave always been of the opinion that our representative in London .should have the status of an ambassador, and the opportunity of consulting and conferring freely with thc British authorities. great compliment was paid me by the Empire Parliamentary the House of Commons, of which Lord Burnham is the chairman, when I was asked, during my stay in London, to attend its meetings when the representation of the dominions in London was being considered. Ramsay MacDonald's Government were on that committee, before which I had an opportunity of expressing my views. The members of the committee were practically unanimous that the dominions should have better representation. Australia's representative in London sliould be able to visit the Foreign -Office every morning, peruse its files, and make extracts from them of anything concerning Australia. He could then keep -our Prime Minister in close touch of what was going oil, and could convey to the Foreign Office in Loudon thc views of the Australian Government on matters of international importance affecting the CommonAvealth. That would remove a lot of the trouble referred to by the honto America banquets were tendered to me orable member for Reid. I trust that the Attorney-General will take a broad hint from the views expressed by the Leader of the Opposition, and will express to the leaders of the British delegation at Geneva Australia's views on economic questions, on ouv White Australia policy, and concerning migration and the tariff. said just now, those questions cannot be side-stepped, as any subject that might lead to war can be considered by the League. Mr Maries. migration and the supplies of raw materials, which have occupied When Great Britain is at the attention of diplomatists during recent years, can be so considered. I had the rather extraordinary experience of discussing the migration question with the Japanese Cabinet in 1923. The Japanese people respect the White Australia policy more than they do the exclusion policy of the United States of America. They recognize that we have always kept a clear line of demarcation, whereas the policy of the United States of America was changed after large numbers of Japanese had migrated to California. But, although Japan respects the White Australia policy, it is clear to any one who has visited that country that A that policy is not popular there. Questions affecting migration will necessarily Committee . of be considered from time to time by the League of Nations, and the sooner we make up our minds regarding them the better it will be for all concerned. opinion is definite regarding the White Members of Mr Australi a policy ? tion made perfectly clear by a former Prime Minister? not particularly hopeful. Conditions cannot continue as they are at present. I find myself in a somewhat difficult position in speaking on this subject this morning, because of the adverse criticism that was given by thc press to a speech which I delivered in 1920 or 1921, when I made a forecast regarding the next war. The indications are, however, that I was right rather than wrong. We must do everything possible to break down the tendency towards increased armaments; but how should we start? On my last visit at San Francisco and Vancouver, and I had the opportunity to speak to about 500 or 600 persons. During the course of my ' speeches I suggested that the nations should be taken seriatim ancl a schedule prepared showing the area of land, under their control, their populaAsI tion and its distribution, their trade routes and the value thereof, and that a decision should be arrived at as to the defensive forces necessary to safeguard Undoubtedly the subject of their respective interests.

64,Mr Marks,"The world outlook ismuch would result in billions of pounds being saved in warlike expenditure,' because it would reduce materially the existing forces of certain great powers. The question may well be asked why J apan to-day has one of the finest navies the world has ever seen. I have been on some of her war vessels, and know what they are like. Why has J apan two great battle fleets, which are maintained in a state of high efficiency? The reason is that that nation is afraid of Russia and China; and it is no secret that she has no very great affection for the United States of America, because of the exclusion law which has been in operation in that country. Japan's massive navy could be reduced considerably by an agreement along the lines that I suggest.' I do not think that the League of Nations can deal with this matter so long as Germany, the United .States of America, and Russia, are not members of the League. The time is ripe for another disarmament conference. The. United States of America is only too willing to call another disarmament conference if the nations will attend it. I speak as one possessing knowledge, because I have been behind the scenes. A conference would have been called by the United States of America had it not been for the Locarno Conference. The people of the United States of America resented greatly what took place at Locarno, because the President of that great republic had previously laid all his cards on the table and shown his willingness to call another disarmament conference. Locarno, however, upset his plans. Another conference similar to that held at Washington should be held. It would result in great savings to Britain, and in even greater savings on the part of Japan. If some understanding could be arrived at, Japan's armaments could bereduced, ancl that would help the whole world. Throughout Australia there is considerable anxiety as to the aspirations and intentions of Japan. That anxiety is unfounded; there is no cause to fear Japan. The Japanese people have a deep regard for the British Empire and for Australia, a regard which they showed during the Great War, when Japanese vessels escorted the Australian troopships and guarded the whole of the Australian coast. I urge the Prime Minister, while in Great Britain, to do what he can to arrange for another disarmament conference. When I was in Tokio, word arrived that the Australian Prime Minister had suggested that a Pacific Conference on this question should be held. That suggestion was applauded throughout Japan. I , personally, applauded it in a speech which I delivered at the Pan-Pacific Conference at Tokio. I hope that before long another disarmament conference will be held. The honourable member for Reid( Mr Coleman) referred to the necessity fer the Dominion Governments being consulted by the British Government in matters of foreign policy. It does not matter whether they are consulted or not in these matters, because, if England is at war, the Dominions are automatically at war also. In this connection I desire to read from the Melbourne Argus of the 29th July, the report of a speech which was delivered in the House of Lords by Earl BalfourLondon, July 28. Lord Parmoor, who was Lord President of the Council in the Labour Ministry, asked in the House of Lords whether the position of the Dominions, in the event of Great Britain becoming a belligerent power, would be discussed at the Imperial Conference. The President of the Council (the Earl of Balfour) said that the Prime Minister( Mr Baldwin) would make a statement upon the conference in the immediate future, and he need not anticipate it . Tliere was little doubt that the date would have to be deferred after 5th October, for bhe convenience of the dominions. '-'Regarding iLord Parmbor's Question, he said that the problem would certainly come up at the conference if the dominions desired to discuss it . "" My personal view,"" Lord Balfour said, "" is that our relations in this conglomeration of free States are necessarily those of equality. None of us can be above the other. One may have more responsibility than another, one may he closer to the centre of international complications, but all are on an equality. That is thc essence of the British Empire. (Cheers.) Little can be gained by discussing the defining degree of responsibility each has to the other. I should say that tliis country is bound to go to war to defend any part of "" the Empire. Personally, I think that the duties of other parts of the Empire to us are not less than our duties to them, but regarding ithe particular conditions under -which that great duty should be exercised, nothing can be gained by inventing hard cases beforehand. Our plain duty is to defend the Empire of which we are so important a part. That duty we shall always carry out, as well as our duty to bring the dominions, into our counsels as far as possible. ""There are mechanical difficulties in consultation-difficultie s of time and-space which no scientific discoveries will enable us to eliminate-bu t we desire to give the dominions full information regarding the motives animating our policy. We desire that the unbreakable 'bond which unites us shall carry that mutual confidence and constant exchange of ideas and harmony of aims which is the basis and strength of the Empire. How these general maxims will be dealt with by the various elements of the Empire when they come together at the end of OctoberI cannot say; but I am confident that the common political instincts will carry the Empire through all difficulties, and moreover, when the occasion arises, will carry the Empire through its perils and perplexities."" That very fine speech, which will live in our memories for a long time, answers the statements that have been made by the honourable member for Reid Coleman) the dominion sulted on matters of foreign policy. British Government is just as anxious to place before us all that it knows as we are to learn what is going on. I agree heartily with the proposal that we should -have in London an Australian sador, with the right to examine ments in the Foreign Office, and so to keep Australia well informed on matters of foreign policy. came to the conclusion that an Australian ambassador in London was most desirable, and I -informed the Prime ister to that effect.

When I visited the ""Versailles Peace Conference, I saw the honourable gentleman there, and I know that he did wonderfully good work in assisting the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes). Attorney-General knows the atmosphere of Geneva. He is acquainted with a great number of the men he will see at the Assembly of the League, and he certainly knows the outlook of Australia and of this Parliament. He is one of the heads of the bar in Victoria and in Australia, and possesses great legal knowledge, which is so essential at a gathering such as that at which he is to represent this country. In view of all his special qualifications for the position, I say that we are sending the right man to Geneva. I congratulate the honourable gentleman upon his selection, and I wish him the best of luck. do not propose to make a considered and detailed speech on the very important and far-reaching question of the League of Nations. I have been moved by some observations of the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks) to refer to one or two aspects of the matter which have emerged in clear view in the course of this interesting and important discussion. BeforeI proceed further, I join with the honourable member in the expression of good will which he uttered, at the close of his address, to the honourable the A t torney-General( Mr Latham) regarding his mission to the next meeting of the League. Having an intimate knowledge of the honourable gentleman, his attainments, and his history, and setting aside for the moment purely political considerations, may I say that there is no man whom I would prefer to see proceed upon this mission before the honourable gentleman to whom task has been entrusted. bring to bear upon the. performance of his mission ripe knowledge, partly born of his previous experience abroad, but more firmly based upon his sympathy with the objects of the League of Nations. I join wholeheartedly with those who wish him god-speed upon bis mission. I join, also, with those who, rightly, have been pleased to congratulate the honourable member for Reid( Mr Coleman) upon his excellent address. Apparently, the honourable member's speech was rather in the nature of a surprise to those who do not know him as well as I do. I should have regarded the encomiums passed upon him as somewhat patronizing were it not for the fact that, compared with many members of the House, the honourable The member has youth to his credit. We are, therefore, perhaps, justified in presuming to congratulate him upon an excellent effort, in which he displayed a broad outlook and sharp intelligence on the vexed subject of foreign affairs. I need make ho apology for venturing to say a few words on a subject which is in extricably bound up with the ideal of would peace, because when peace was an unpopular topic, and when it was barely safe to mention it , even w it h in the comparatively secure walls of this chamber, I ventured, w i th other members of my party, to make an attempt to keep alive the fires of international goodwill at a time when it appeared that they were doomed to .be extinguished for ever. W it h out flattering myself at all, I venture to say that unti l we have developed the courage to talk peace in time of war as well as in time of peace, we shall never have made up our minds definitely to proceed on the right road to the goal of international peace. I remember, some years ago, reading with great pleasure some words of an eminent English divine, D r . Salter, of the Congregational Churchi n B r it a in . I do not pretend to quote h i m exactly, but he said that the greatest sacrifice that any nation can render to the world and humanity still remains to be made, and that sacrifice is for a nation prepared for war to throw aside its armaments, and, in the interests of humanity, to immolate itself for the sake of peacefor the sake of peace to make a sacrifice at least in f a in t imitation of the great the sacrifice upon which the Christian strucHe will ture rests. We have heard something of the question whether we can have security before disarmament, or must have disarmament before security. Following on the lines of thought which I have been pursuing, I say that the greatest gesture of peace that could be made would be for a nation such as B rita in to throw off its arms in the sight of the world, and invite the world to follow its example. There",27,Dominions And War Imperial Unity Degree Of Responsibility
67,Mr Brennan (Batman) [12.17],"I would be courage and statesmanship. There would be a gesture which even the most belligerent nations of the world would not have the moral courage to refuse to emulate. I am led more particularly into this discussion by some observations that have been made on the subject of the price of Empire. The honourable member for Reid pointed out, and it is granted on all sides, that when Britain is at war we are at war, and that, says the right honorwhich challenges that right, nor is there able member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt), is the price of Empire. The right honourable gentleman said, and the honourable member for Wentworth apparently agrees with liim, that there is no price which is too high to pay for our association, as a component part, with the British Empire. If the contrary means that we should forfeit the regurd which, as kindred of one family, the people of this country naturally have for their forbears and the country from which they have come, I would Bay that that is a sentiment too deeply cherished and too vital to the better side of human nature to be set aside in any circumstances. to have regard for the claims and ties of kinship, they have thrown aside the better part of their nature. Therefore, I do not advocate that. But I poiut out to these honourable gentlemen that in all material matters but one Australia is an independent nation. We have insisted upon that. recognition of AustraUabefore the League of Nations as an independent dominion, and one of the family of British nations. in Australia to-day who would tolerate for a single moment the slightest interference with the right of this country to govern itself according to its own ideals. The purpose of the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) is to declare before the world that on all questions of purely domestic concern the right of Australia to govern herself is, and must remain, inviolate. Wentworth, although for certain technical reasons he is not supporting the amendment, admits that he is entirely in accord with the sentiment it expresses. should not misunderstand me. I am in favour of the amendment, but I believe that the Australian delegates should voice Mr Brennan. their protest in the Council of the British Empire, and not at the League of Nations. from these facts how deeply cherished is the principle of practical independence. On all practical bread-andbutter questions we insist upon our absolute right to govern ourselves. There is no school of thought in Great Britain any which insists upon the view that if war is declared by the Home Office, Australia is necessarily bound to send troops to take part in that war. The British authorities do not insist upon that as an obligation arising out of our imperial connection. That is a matter, as the honourable member for Fawkner points out, entirely within our own discretion. But there is a legal result which flows from our imperial connection which is not in our discretion at all, and is the result pointed to by the honourable member for Reid, namely, that Great Britain being at war, we are, within the view of interWhen any people cease national law, at war also. To every country with whom Great Britain is at war Australia is at war; we are a belligerent community; our territory is an enemy territory; and our citizens are enemy citizens. It becomes more than a question of law. It becomes a question of fact, having very practical and grave consequences. We have insisted upon the That is where the real difference arises between honourable members ou this side and those who sit opposite. I now make this public declaration-associate d as it There is no one is with my respect for the imperial sen.timent, so far as it rests upon kinship and goodwill-that it is a vital inroad upon Australia's independence that in time of war she may be cast into the cauldron without her consent and without even the consultation of her people. Against that international condition I strongly protest. The right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt), speaking the other day of the Imperial conThe honourable member for nexion and the price of emoire, declared himself to be an imperialist, and also said that every patriotic citizen of Australia should be an imperialist. Nobody knows better than the right honourable gentleman that a few years ago men of capacity and .undoubted patriotism publicly . supported the view that a condition of absolute independence",28,Dominions And War Imperial Unity Degree Of Responsibility

There are still on this side honourable members who are sufficiently high spirited and public spirited to express their views fearlessly on all aspects of this question. Eeal patriotism does not call popular catch cries to its aid. The right honourable gentleman is apparently assessing the virtue of patriotism in its relation to Empire rather than in its relation to Australia, which is our special responsibility and care. the disbandment of the British Empire. Australia enjoys absolute independence except in one respect. You cannot violate those ties of kinship and regard which ought to, and do, bind together people of the same race. But I declare that Australia should not be dragged at the tail of Great Britain or of any other nation into a war in which she has not expressed a willingness to join. I shall now. deal with the White Australia aspect of the question. The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr fight.

According to the arguments of honourable members opposite there is a possibility of our being attacked unpopular war in history if she attempted by a nation whose population is overcrowded, because we are selfishly holding for a handful of people a vast, unused territory of potential wealth. If we are attacked upon that ground we shall be called upon to defend an immoral position, and Great Britain's support of such a position would be ten times more immoral and untenable. able member support the White Australia policy ? showing the utter futility of expecting Great Britain to support by force of arms a policy which clashes with Imperial solidarity. If she attempted to to support such a policy, she would incur the odium and contempt of every nation which is a member of the League of Nations. They very naturally would say, "" How can you send your Navy across the seas to defend a policy which leads to the exclusion of coloured people from the vast unused spaces of that island continent, when four-fifths of the population of your own Empire consists of the members of coloured races""? I advance this argument merely to show the utterly absurd and untenable position which honourable members opposite take up when they say that we are unable to defend ourselves, but that, on the contrary, we are entirely dependent upon the British Navy. to defend Australia against an invader whatever might be the cause of that invasion; just as we should fight for Great Britain whatever might be the cause oi a war in which she engaged. member is doubtless right. But the question I would put to him is, where does his argument lead him? What position would Great Britain occupy in the eyea of the.nations that comprise the League of Nations if, as he says, she was prepared to defend Australia whatever the reason might be. If it were the maintenance of a White Australia; and if, as honourable members opposite say, Australia was not fully occupied, and was being inadequately developed whilst other nations were congested and jostling for space; the Mother Country would wage the most to unsheathe the sword in our defence. ment. If Australia were invaded it would be because one of our jealous neighbours wanted a part of our territory. would be so; but that does not square with the speeches of the honourable member's friends and supporters. Their view is that we are not developing Australia as it should be developed. ment which was advanced in favour of the Development and Migration Bill. It was said that we should flood this country with subsidized migrants, because we are send a fleet to Australia not at present fully developing its resources. ability to defend this country would bo enhanced if we had a greater population. Minister for Defence( Sir Neville Howse), who, speaking from a military point of view, said that if it came to the mere question of force of arms, it would probably cost us £100,000,000 to defend this country by land, sea, and air, and render it immune from attack from certain nations, such as our friendly neighbour, Japan. the probable cost at £50,000,000 a year. not to render us immune, but merely to enable us to defend ourselves. ture is utterly impossible for Australia, and could not for a single moment be supported. Therefore, I come to two conclusions-that if the policy of a White Australia is challenged by force of arms honourable we shall be absolutely thrown upon our own resources, and .that, from the military point of view, it would be impracticable for us to attempt to defend ourselves.

It will be whju men will go into a peace conference with their hands open and bare, saying, "" We have come here honestly and frankly, not only with a desire for peace, but also with the bereference to the honourable member for lief that peace is a practical policy, and we are ready to take. some risk for so great a prize,"" that peace will be realized in the world. one attempts to show the futility and the curse of war, and to make an appeal based on the events of the last ten or twelve years, which have brought about nothing but death and devastation in the world, honourable members like the honourable member for Eawkner( Mr my opinion is quite the contrary. I was Maxwell) interject sneeringly, and suggest that peace is but the dream of the unpractical. I would fain pay a tribute, though it be a humble one, to the late President of the TJnited States of America( Mr Woodrow Wilson), who first envisaged the possibility of a League words at the time, and as I did not fully of Nations. In many of the incidents of liis life he disappointed me; but those are forgotten in the major fact that he was a man of broad and courageous outlook, who sn.w the possibility of achieving peace upon lines of peace rather than upon lines of war. It is to his eternal credit that, during the war, he set out the bases upon which international peace might be achieved: and, when confronted with the views of the then Leader of the Australian Government (the Right Hon. William Morris Hughes), and others who spoke and thought with that gentleman, he brushed them contemptuously aside, declaring that he stood for the peace of the world rather than for the special interests of any nation which was a party to the conflict. I hope that some real good may come from the mission of the Attorney-General. I believe that he will discharge his duties upon the lines of peace with honesty and ability; and, as I said at the beginning, I say in conclusion, I wish him well. .My kind of last work is that peace will only be attained by men who realize the futility of war, and by men who go into a conference with peace in their hearts and the belief that it is worthwhile to make some real sacrifice in order to rid the world of the canker curse of war.

The League is running a grave risk of having brought before it for consideration matters that are of domestic concern to us, such as immigration aud the White Australia policy. People in Australia are prone to give lip service to the inviolability of the White Australia policy, but whether they are prepared to act in the -field of physical endeavour is another matter. member for Batman, in reply to an interjection by me, said that he would be prepared to support the White Australia policy. At the time he was talking about war, and its consequences. He implied by his answer that he would support the White Australia policy, not only verbally, but aLjo physically. In view of his subsequent remarks, I have grave doubt indeed respecting his bona fides in that ""direction. During his speech I was. persistently reminded of the reference made last Parliament by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) to certain honourable members who, he said, if an enemy landed in Australia, would immediately mount a soap-box to persuade them to leave these shores. I am afraid that the honourable member for Batman distinctly comes within that category. He represents the school of thought which preaches pacificism run mad. I suggest that when it comes to the poilnt of supporting the White Australia policy by physical force, he will take up the position that he adopted during the recent conflict. honourable member is referring to? to the honourable membei-. TfI ventured to probe the matter further, I uromise him that I should not be forced to make a personal explanation as he did respecting the honourable member for Warringah. planation entirely of my own volition, because T wished to do the right thing. Tlie honourable member is making an unpleasant innuendo, nnd has not the pluck to back it up with plain language. I ask him to try to be honest, even if he cannot be accurate. Mr E, GEEEN I am trying to be both honest and accurate-. I am sure that no honourable member misunderafternoon, gave the impression that he would support the White Australia policy by physical force if need be, but I venture to suggest that in view of his past conduct, if an enemy threatened that policy, he would be one of the first to mount the soap-box to ask it to please retire. It is possible that Ave should help to bring about peace in the world by forgoing our self-respect, and reThis morning the honourable pudiating, to some extent, our White Australia policy. If Ave say that that policy must be kept inviolate, then Ave must be prepared to back our opinion with force. During the last Parliament I had occasion to refer to the strong pacifist vieAvs of the honourable member for Batman, and although that matter concerns only himself, yet it is rather incongruous and paradoxical that he sliould make a most bellicose speech in this House when, if it came to thc poiut of supporting his opinions by physical force, he Avould be found Avanting. Throughout the ages the final test of manhood has been the capacity of a person expressing belligerent views to back them Avith force. At the recent International Labour Conference, Dr. Evatt, a member of the New South Wales Parliament, was instrumental in getting the delegates from other nations to see eye to eye with him in respect of keeping the White Australia policy inviolate. We must realize that that policy is in the forefront of international politics, and that many nations are urging a modification of it. I am convinced that Australia must at some time be prepared to give physical support to it. I speak in no sense as a ""Jingoist."" The subject is likely to be discussed at the next meeting of the League of Nations, as is evidenced by the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton). He foresees that Australia's delegation to Geneva will have to be on its guard to prevent any insidious interference with the White Australia policy, as was attempted by Japan last year. It ia doubtful whether we can rely absolutely on the League of Nations as a sufficient deterrent to prevent other nations from attempting to assail the White Australia policy.

That is sufficient to show that other nations in the Pacific must prepare for the day when there w ill inevitably be a t r i a l of strength.

If that work is not being proceeded w i th for that purpose, what object has the B r i tish Government i u view? is quite wrong. The statement to which he referred a few moments ago has been denied by the Japanese Government. is incorrect, why were there such expressions of joy in Japan when the B r it is h Government, under the leadership of Mr Ramsay MacDonald, decided to postpone the construction of the Singapore Base? For the information of honourable members, I shall quote the opinions of a few leading authorities to show our position. The late Lord Northcliffe, who was always a keen student of foreign affairs, and able to gauge the situation between the nations, stated in his publication. My Journey Round the World, that I t is quite impossible to rouse these people (the Australians) to realize the imminent danger that threatens them in the Pacific. To-day Australia is menaced almost as we were in 1914, but she has not a single arsenal. In July, 1923, the Dutch press, in discussing this matter, saidA naval war in the Pacific must be expected. The Dutch have possessions in the Pacific; Admiral Sir Percy Scott, who was op1923, said, "" The League of posed to the construction of the Singapore Naval Base, made this significant, statementThat statement should My remarks about the defence of Singapore If our safety are equally applicable to Australia; that part, of our dominions has only one prospective enemy, namely, Japan. Australia has been,, and still is, in danger of invasion by thut country. Although Admira l Sir Percy Scott was Our White Australia policy bpuosed to the construction of the Singaport Base, his statement could not have been of greater significance in support of The aim of Japan the'project. Admiral Beatty saidbeen plainly stated by the Singapore was selected because it covered the approaches to India, the trade and sea communications of the Indian Ocean, because it covers the source of oil supply in Burma and Persia,, because it flanks the line of approach to Australia and New Zealand, because labour and material are available and periodical, docking is essential to maintain the speed and endurance of the Fleet. Another authority, Sir Guy Gaunt, said, ""Singapore was an ideal strategic centre."" Admiral Slade, who enthusiastically supported the Singapore Base, saidThe advent of a formidable naval power in the EastHe was referring to Japan, rendered it imperative for Great Britain to maintain a strong naval force in the East. A base at Hong Kong was not enough. Singapore was the ideal dominating point. Apartf r o m the eminent naval and m i l i tary authorities I have quoted, I wish now to give the opinion of the Deputy Leader of the House of Lords, Lord Salisbury, who, in 1923, saidThe Singapore base is necessary. There is a Power in the East which, may not always be friendly to Great Britain. The power to which Lord Salisbury was referring was, of course, Japan. If au attack is-made upon Australia, it w ill not be from the sister Dominions of Canada or New Zealand. The South American Republics are not casting covetous eyes upon Australia.

The turbulent populace went wild with national enthusiasm, and It o became the most popular man in the empire. that had previously been the centre of conflict wore passed without a murmur, and, in consequence, the Ito Ministry remained in power for over four years-a n unusually long period in Japan. As there is a weakening in the power of authority, and the rise of what may be termed the "" serf"" class in Japan, the position becomes serious. McGovern, who knows more concerning Japan than even the honourable member for ""Wentworth ( Mr Marks) member's remarks will be deeply resented in Japan. statesThe result of the war was entirely unexpected, and may be said to have come as a severe shock to the nation. From this she has not yet recovered, and it may be that, as a result of it , she w i ll yet swing into the stream of democracy.

Budgets Preparations are in train for starting work on the Naohi, a 10,000-ton cruiser, at Yokosuka, some time before next June; and two more 10,000 ton cruisers have been authorized for building in the fiscal year 1925-26. Within tlie same period, Japan has begun or ordered 24 destroyers, averaging 1,375 tons; and 22 submarines, with an average displacement of 1,173 tons. In sum, therefore, Japanese naval construction since the Washington Conference Mr embraces 11 light cruisers, 24 destroyers, and 22 submarines-5 7 vessels of war, wibh a total displacement of 145,406 tons. Another naval authority, Mr Archibald Hurd, referring to Japan, saidWhat has happened is that naval competition has not ceased, in spite of the Washington Treaty, but has taken a new and much cheaper form. I believe that Japan would not have devoted so large a proportion of her revenue to strengthening her navy unless she intended at some period to challenge what she regards as the view held by other nations, namely, that the Japanese people are inferior to the white races. many eminent men, The White Australia policy is not the",35,Neville Howse Th E Honourable Know That Never I N Her History Has The

The children of unions of different European races are not regarded as half-castes, but the position is different in the case of the children of a union of the white and coloured races. Unfortunately the Japanese people regard the. migration policy of the United States of America and the White Australia policy as an indication that they are regarded as being inferior to the white races. That is not so. Japan less, but that we love Britain more. crease in Japan's air armaments and in her army has been enormous. Before the war, Japan's merchant shipping placed her sixth among the nations; now she has risen to the third positionThat Japan's intentions are not solely in the direction of defence, is shown by the number of highly coloured pictures and stories which have been published iu Japan during recent years. The text-books for her schools contain accounts of mimic battles, in each case tbe potential enemy being the United States of America! Many of the stories set before the Japanese children depict the United States of America being invaded by Japan, or vice versa.

To show that the White Australia policy is in danger of being undermined by Japan, I shall read an extract from the South China Morning' Post of the 10th March, 1924A .bitter speecli delivered in the House of questions predicted that the world would end Peers to-day by Dr. Eigoro Kan-atsugi, in which the Upper House legislator dwelt at length on bhe "" iniquities"" of America in denying to Japanese privileges that are accorded to other aliens. . . . Dr. Kanatsugi then went on to talk of other ( Mr Charlton) is whether we in Ausoutlets for bhe surplus population of the country, and declared that Japanese could emigrate to Australia, "" for although strong anti-Japanese agitation is prevalent there, an equally strong pro-Japanese movement counteris to become a subject-matter for discusbalances this."" Concluding, he declared that Japan must either develop abroad or perish/ That speech, which was delivered a little over two years ago in the Japanese House of Peers, is worthy of our consideration. China Morning Post published? Hong Kong. The report also stated that the Japanese Foreign Minister, Baron Matsui, looked with favour on the suggestion of Dr. Kanatsugi, which was for the peaceful penetration of Australia by Japanese in order to undermine the White. Australia policy. This question is likely to arise at the Assembly of the League of Nations. The Japanese or Chinese menace is not a new thing. For many years there has been talk of the "" yellow peril."" A recent Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Hara, the only commoner to rise to the position of Prime Minister of that country, speaking in connection with the "" yellow peril,"" raised the cry of the "" white peril,"" thus endeavouring to set nation against' nation. Professor Forel has dealt with this question in his book The Sexual Question. He concludes with these words:How is our Aryan race and its civilization to guard against the danger of being passively invaded and exterminated by the alarming fecundity of other human races? One must be bTind not to recognize this danger. To estiThe decision of mate it at its proper value, it is not enough to put all "" savages "" and "" barbarians "" into one basket and all "" civilized "" into the other. The question is far more complicated than this. . . . The Chinese, and some other Mongolian races, constitute an imminent danger for the very existence of the white races. These people eat much less than ourselves, are contented with much smaller dwellings, and, in spite of this, produce twice as many children and do twice as much work. . . . Possibly, we might make a compact with thc Mongols, and tlie Chinese in particular, whicli would allow both races to live on the earth without annihilating each other. I am ? uite convinced that we have more to fear rom their blood and their work than their arms. Some time ago experts in Far-Eastern by becoming Chinese. One of the questions raised by the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition tralia are to have the power to pass laws that we consider necessary for the preservation of the white races heres If that sion by the League of Nations, we are in grave danger of losing our birth right.

123,Mr R. Green,"It is published incommend the amendment to the House, because I believe that we-should make it clear to the League nf Nations that Australia will not allow any interference by tbe League in matters which we regard as being of domestic concern, namely, our migration policy and the White Australia policy. Those two policies are inseparable. Australia being an outpost of the white race, we, living us it were nnder the shadow of the coloured races, should jeopardize our very existence if we failed to take whatever action we considered necessary to keep Australia white. may be said that my sneech is antagonistic to Japan. If to advocate that we should look after our own interests .and maintain this country for ourselves is regarded by any other nation as un affront, I can only conclude that that nation has designs upon us. I have not visited Japan since the Great War, although I paid a couple of visits to that country prior to the outbreak o.f hostilities. I should be pleased to know that there was no. longer justification for the conclusions which were forced upon me during those visits. I point but that the opinions I havo quoted thiB afternoon are those of experts. I should welcome an oppor^ tu.nity to visit Japan, and to see, not only what would be shown to me, but also what I myself desired to see. I state definitely my opinion that, at the present time, Japan has designs on this country. stacles to thc realization of her dream of supremacy of the Pacific. I believe that the imminence of trouble in the Pacific1 nan be established, and that the menace 3f Japan is very real. I shall be'pleased to acknowledge my mistake if I am. shown to be wrong, but all the evidence I have been able to obtain, and some of which I have given' the House this afternoon, confirms my view that Japan does not look upon Australia with a very friendly eye. I sincerely hope that the Attorney-General, as leader of the Australian delegation to the . League of Nations, will not permit this question to fade into the background. I hope that he will be particularly alert to notice a movement of any description whatever that is calculated to interfere with our domestic concerns, and particularly those of such a national character as our policy of a White Australia He did not trust the good-will of the regret very much some of the references which the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green) has made to Japan. No instance can be quoted in which Japan has broken a treaty. We'cannot point to a* single' instance in which she bas behaved dishonorably, in connection with a treaty with another nation. Did not Japan, as a loyal ally, do her level best to assist us in the last terrible war? Were not our soldiers, when being transported across the' Indian Ocean, given It heart of grace when, in the darkness of night, the big grey fighting ships of Japan showed up, and they knew that they could rely upon their protection? I visited Japan during the Russo-Japanese war, and on two occasions Japanese war vessels came within a stone's throw of the ship on which I travelled, and, finding that ours was a friendly vessel, gave the signal to pass on. From that experience, I can well imagine what our Australian soldiers must havo felt when they sighted Japanese war vessels. on their journey across the IndianOcean. Japan is the only country that has ever so honoured our race as to ask one of the greatest of our philosophers, Mr Herbert Spencer, what its laws and procedure should be to enable it to avoid trouble with foreign nations, and particularly with America and England. I should ""have liked to quote the letters Australia is one of the obwritten by Herbert Spencer to the Japanese who asked for his advice. Theyare, in my opinion, the most important letters ever written by a human hand. They can be found, at page 321 of the Letters of Herbert Spencer, by David Duncan, which can be obtained in the Library, and honourable members would do well to read thom. The advici given by Herbert Spencer to the Japanese nation was that they should sell no land to a foreigner; should permit no foreigner to own shares in their banks, tramway companies, or shipping companies engaged in the Japanese coastal trade; and should keep themselves apart from other nations as far as possible. Spencer knew the ' history of foreign missions, and he was aware that missionaries and traders were believed in their own countries when they made reports of the foreign countries they visited.",37,Neville Howse Th E Honourable Know That Never I N Her History Has The

The Japanese people honorably fulfilled his request,, and it was not .until he had passed away that Herbert Spencer's Jotters were given the publicitythey how sound Spencer's judgment was, there appeared in the Times after his death one of the bitterest articles everwritten accusing him of possessing the narrow-minded personality of a Chinese mandarin of the most conservative type. He has passed away, and the greatness of his name remains in spite of the Timos or any othernewspaper. I hiwe more than once suggested in (iis House that instead of hurling insults' at a nation that is great in every sense of the word, we should approach its people with the word which is regarded as most sacred throughout the East, and that is the word "" reciprocity."" We should ask the Japanese in the sacred name of reciprocity to listen to us. We should tell them that if they desire to settle' in Australia was conducted on just and equittralia we are willing, provided they tell ns how many Australians are settled in Japan. No Australian owns a square inch of land in Japan. We should tell the Japanese that as the population of Japan is thirteen times greater than the population of Australia, they are welcome to thirteen times the quantity of land in Australia that Australians own in Japan. This is the one continent in the world throughout which the same language is talked, spoken and read, and we hold it as a sacred trust for the millions to come after. us. We should tell the Japanese that for every Australian settled in Japan we are prepared to welcome the settlement of thirteen'Japanese in Australia. In my two visits to JapanI met only some ten Australians who were settled there, and three of. them have since left that country. Using the sacred word "" reciprocity,"" .we should tell the Japanese that as they have adopted certain measures on the .advice of Herbert Spencer, to safeguard the integrity of their country,, they cannot .blame us if we follow, .their splendid, exDr. Maloney. ample. As imitation is said to' he' the sincerest form of flattery,the Japanese cannot help being pleased if we decide to follow in their footsteps.' I hope that the' Attorney-General( Mr Latham), who will represent this great white Australia at the Assembly of the League of Nations, will make it plain that Australia will in no circumstances permit deserved. To show the White Australia policy, to be' tampered with. I 'should prefer to see .every man, woman and child in Australia dead rather than lower that flag of ours. It is said that travel is the best form of instruction, and I think it is. . My travels have removed a great fear I had of China and Japan. A t one time. I entertained almost a dislike of the Chinese, but, as a result of my first contact with the teeming millions of China, I changed my view, and my change of view was confirmed by my.visit to Japan. When I returned I told a gathering of my electors that whereas they had honoured me,, by electing me as a republican, I would from that time forward never advocate that form of government so long as England's association with Aus,abie lines. When I went -through the narrow slums of the eity of Canton, I wondered, as a medical man, how people could live under such conditions as I saw there without the diseases which I expeeted to find. I came to the conclusion that, if some 400,000,000 of Asiatics could lead fairly healthy lives 'under such conditions, it needed only an organizer as great as Confucius was as a philosopher, and the whole wor^ would lie at the feet of China. I am always ready to accord my thanks to a great senator who has passed away. I refer to the late Senator Bakhap, io whom much of my knowledge of the history of C'iiina is due. Like the United States of America, China has never invaded other countries. America has never seized territory. She has never occupied the territory of another nation except by obtaining it ' by purchase. If she is delaying a little while in the Philippines, we must remember that it was at the request of England, Erance, and Holland -that she occupied those islands. I -make that statement definitely, upon the authority, of a work published by Governor Harrison, who ruled over that we had no desire to .invade another the Philippines ' for seven He holds that they should be given their League of Nations, -because I believe freedom in the same way that the resithat it will lay the foundation of a cividents of the Havanas have been given lization that' I hope I . shall live to see. theirs.

146,Mr Perkins,"The site was units facilities for beautification. We shall make a big mistake if we delay this work. At the opening of Parliament House, people will attend Canberra from all parts of Australia smd abroad, and they will form their impression of the capital from that fleeting visit. Although £70,000 is involved in this work, it seems sidered. to me that the House should have an opportunity to discuss the subject before the report is finally adopted. The other day, the Prime Minister was good enough to advise me to take the usual procedure to bring this matter before the House. I have made inquiries from different sources, and I do not seem to get any further. I appeal to the Prime Minister to allow a debate aud vote on this important subject. I compliment tlie honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Perkins) on introducing this subject. I myself have asked several questions in this House regarding tlie artificial lakes at Canberra. The Public Works Committee has presented its report. It has been ordered to be printed, and that will be the end of the matter unless the Minister decides to authorize tlie work. The House should have an opportunity to decide whether this work should be delayed. An essential feature of the plan of the Eederal city is the artificial lakes, and yet this work is to be delayed although thousands of pounds are being snent on other works there. complaint against the Government, because it has been pushing on with the work of building the Capital. It desires that Canberra shall be an ideal city.

I hope that my view, as a Victorian one, will not be disregarded when further works in the Territory are being conGroom) I wish to inform the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann), that, in conjunction with the President, I accept responsibility for the granting of permission for an exhibition of Australian timbers in the Queen's Hall. The gentleman to whom this privilege was given is well known to members of the Federal Parliament. He has strenuously advocated the use of our beautiful and decorative Australian timbers in our public buildings, and his efforts have also been directed to the general fostering and encouraging of afforestation in Australia. The exhibition is not being made for personal gain or to influence votes ou any matter to be discussed in either House. Objections have been made to the use of the Queen's. Hall with a view to influencing the votes of honourable members, and permission has, on that account, been refused at times by. those in authority.; but the practice is to permit exhibitions for the encouraging of the use of our natural products. In this instance we have folI have no lowed precedent.
