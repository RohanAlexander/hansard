Firstly, more efficient Public Service than we inherited the fact is that in 1987-88 there will be various from the previous Government. This is enabling factors bringing about reductions in the size of us to arrest the growth of the Public Service, the Public Service. One of those is the changes and to reverse it and start to achieve some in the machinery of government, that is, the reduction. changes in the number of departments and the rearranging of departments.

There are other factors which will by government and what it is appropriate for also bring about reductions in the size of the government to do. If there are cost effective Public Service.

That is an ongoing process. A number are relevant to achieving greater The efficiency dividend will be there next year and the year after, and it is something which the efficiencies. For instance, in relation to the child Government sees as an important means of ensupport scheme, we are here introducing a major change to maintenance arrangements which I suring that managers specifically put their minds think all parties would agree is an appropriate to becoming more efficient and ensuring that the Service demonstrates efficiency increases year by change to make, but it simply requires a lot of staff to introduce. The same is true also of year. Australian Taxation Office staff increases. Those We do not say that that is the only way in staff increases which have already occurred there, which efficiency can be achieved, but it is an and those which are proposed this year, in our important way. Separately from the efficiency view are highly cost effective.
