So the States of America, again, it is a matter in very arguments which may have justified which we are involved in data sharing and in French nuclear testing and which may have which much of the South Pacific would not justified a government giving the French be likely to be involved. This idea that these some solace in relation to those efforts are of matters can be put off the agenda until we get no currency today when the arguments that a steer from the South PacifiC Forum is just might have been advanced then had some one further way of demonstrating that this validity. That is the very point that needs to government has lost touch with the views of be understood. the Australian community. It brings us to the point that needs to be The other matter I want to address in this asked: why is it that Australia, represented by debate today is the historical circumstances in Senator Gareth Evans as its foreign minister, which we are discussing this issue.

Why is it that Australia now been delving back into the past to try to find has to be seen to be developing arguments on statements by opposition members upon a matter that is of such importance to Australwhich they can find some comfort for the ia and its people as well as to the people of views that they are adopting on this very the South PacifiC?
