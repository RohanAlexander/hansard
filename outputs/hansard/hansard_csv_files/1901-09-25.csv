NEW MEMBER. thab he had issued a writ for the election of a member to serve in the House of Representatives for the electoral district of Darling Downs, in place of the Honourable William HenryG room, deceased, and that the writ had been returned with a certificate of the election of Littleton Ernest Groom, Esq., endorsed thereon. MrL . E. GROOM took and subscribed the oath. made by the Honourable John See, the Premier of New South Wales, in reference to the Property for Public Pin-poses Acquisition Bill, will the Prime Minister delay the passing of that Bill until the State Governments have had an opportunity thoroughly consider what effect it will have if passed into law % Will the right honourable gentleman also provide an opportunity for the Commonwealth Treasurer to hold a consultation with the Treasurers of the various State Governments for the purpose of effecting an harmonious agreement 1 the telegram which I received last evening from the Premier of New South Wales applied specially to clause 45, and perhaps also had some sbglit reference to clause 44, of the Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Bill, and, in reply, I have informed the Premier of New South Wales that, while the Bill will be proceeded with by the House, the clauses in question will not be dealt with until there has been an opportunity for the f u l l consideration which he desires. I have also made the suggestion to him by telegram that a conference should be held in Melbourne at an early date between representatives of the Commonwealth and of the State Governments concerned. Such a conference would be of a consultative character, merely for the exchange of views, in order to endeavour to 15H establish that harmony and co-operation which we all wish to exist between us and the State Governments, and it is not proposed that it shall be the subject of distinct resolutions, or procedure of that kind, beiause, of course, the Commonwealth has a reserve power to legislate in all cases by virtue of the authority given to it by the Constitution. It is, however, earnestly desired by this Government that there shall be no occasion for complaint to be made by any State Government of our dealing inconsiderately or hastily with any matter of legislabion in which its interests are deeply involved. I think this is a matter upon which a conference for discussion and explanation, which would smooth the way for every one concerned, might take place. In addition to answering Mr See's telegram, I have intimated to each of the other State Premiers the substance of my telegram to him, and have asked them to express thenopinions upon the subject. view of the request ter, before the second reading of the Bill is moved, lay upon the table a memorandum showing, in connection with the illustrative value of £10,000,000 odd, what is the value of the property of each transferred department in each State? reference to this matter that the figures contained in the tables which some honourable members have already seen are not intended to represent with any approach to accuracy the amounts or values of the properties which will be the subject of transfer. They have been prepared merely to show by way of illustration how a proposed method of dealing with the question-no t a method of compensation or valuation-shoul d be arrived at. Almost any other set of figures would have done as well to show what operation the proposal would have. I want it to be particularly understood by honourable members that there is no attempt on the part of this Government to lay it down that any figures set opposite the column of values are intended to operate as the ultimate valuation. The only intention is to endeavour to show how, with any given set of figures, the proposal will work out. We shall lay as much information on the subject before honourable members as we can. I do not care to delay the passage of the Bill, but I have agreed in my telegram to-day to postpone the discussion of tlie clauses in which the States are immediately",14,Setup

""WhatI particularly wish to know is the value of the buildings of the Customs department in each State, and my reason for asking for that information to be stated separately is, thatthereis powerunderthe Constitution Act to deal with the buildings of the Customs department differently from other buildings. any power to deal with any class of buildings differently from any other class, except so far as section 85 of the Constitution A ct provides. I want my honourable friend to clearly understand that there cannot be placed upon the table by this Government at the present time any accurate valuation of these buildings. All we can lay down is rules as to the manner in which, in failure of an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, the Governor General's discretion with regard to methods, not of valuation but of compensation, may be exercised, subject to the advice of his Ministers. It is not possible for us to lay before the House an accurate valuation of these properties, for the reason that the State authorities are making inquiries on the point, and we must receive the result of those inquiries before we can institute-if we institute at all-an y independent valuation.

As the expense of such a work has been computed at between £17,000 and £20,000, my honourable friend will see that the matter is one which the Commonwealth Government must consider twice if the proposal is made to it . We are, however, considering a proposal under which each State, as well as the Commonwealth, would receive a reproduction of the building in a form which would serve to remind those who come after us of the beauty and the value of the edifice. to was a proposal for the re-erection of the structure at a cost of £8,000. The PremierI do not think there is consented to consider the question, though I did not at the time mention to him what the probable cost would be. I have seen with reference to this matter is one which was arrived at by a conference of experts held in Sydney, from which it appears that the cost would be £17,500 or more. Since then I have had no direct proposal from any source which warranted the supposition that the work could be carried out at a less cost. If I receive any such proposal I shall give it due consideration. BILL.

26,Mr Isaacs,"It is practically that proon the face of the Bill, I would put that exclusion on the face of the Bill and run the risk, because the other peril would, in my opinion, be the greater. This Empire is a great Empire, and must expect to take perils and meet them as it is able to do. It is an incident of greatness, which greatness cannot shun; but if we have before us a course which I think will enable us to speak with equal force and efficiency, without the risk of a rejection of the Bill, what is to prevent I suggested the other day that we should insert a sub-clause in this Bill, providing that all persons and all classes and descriptions of persons who were declared by proclamation of the Governor General to be' prohibited immigrants should be prohibited' immigrants. did in the time of Queen Elizabeth. Parliament 1 tion. by Act of Parliament. What1 propose to do is to insert a few words of restriction, which will enable us to .avoid putting upon the face of the Bill anything that can possibly be construed into an affront by any nation. The insertion of the words proposed will prevent any distinction from being made between nationalities. Their use would prevent the Japanese Ambassador in London from approaching the Imperial authorities and asking them if, as an ally and treaty-bound friend of the Japanese, they would permit a Bill to go forth to the world which upon its face bore an insulting distinction, to say nothing of the feeling that would be engendered by such a Bill in the case of some powerful princes in our Indian Empire. The course which I propose has the advantage that it will not leave it in the power of the Ministry to declare whom they wish to be prohibited immigrants. It will be equivalent to an Act of Parliament; it will not run the risk of being rejected by the Home authorities, and when it becomes law it will speak with the voice of all Australia. My proposal is to insert after the word "" namely,"" line 5, of clause 4, the following words :Any person and any cliiss or description of persons declared by joint resolution of the two Houses of Parliament to be prohibited immigrants, or prohibited immigrants.

My desire is the)' that we shall get an effective Bill through. I am desirous of excluding undesirable virtue of an Act of immigrants, but I do not want to have on the face of this Bill a provision which may No , by proclamalead to its rejection or which may result in delay. If we insert the words which I suggest, not only shall we gain elasticity, but we shall enable the two Houses, without going through the formalities of protracted legislation, to say whom they desire to see declared prohibited immigrants. That will prevent any Ministry from having a. despotic power. It will enable the whole world to see what is the opinion of the Parliament of Australia,, and it will not leave it open toany foreign nation to ask the Imperial Government to disallow our legislation. do straight out, and not by a subterfuge. friends have the choice of doing this with a. velvet glove or with the iron hand exposed.. We can achieve our object as effectually in the way I desire as it can be accomplished in the way they suggest.

47,Mr Isaacs,"I did not understandmandate from one end of Australia to the other for a white Australia, and it is tlie duty of every honourable member who has -pledged himself to it to bow to the decision of the :people and to see that their wishes are, as nearly as possible, carried out. A number of proposals have been brought forward by the friends of the Government for no other purpose, as far as I can see, than to prevent a straight-out issue from being placed before this Parliament. Those honourable members who support the Government admit that it is necessary that Australia should be preserved for the Australians, but they would like to put off the decision of this question to some distant date. here, however, to -give a straight-out vote, and as the Opposition have been good enough to say that they do not regard this as a party question, 1 think that it devolves upon the Government to come round as nearly as possible to the lines of tlie policy they have laid down. When the Federal constituencies were being addressed upon the various questions that were expected to occupy the attention of tins Parliament, it was well understood that all parties were agreed that the coloured labour question should be decided at once and for ever as far as Australia was concerned. It was admitted by the representatives of the Government that the influx of Chinese or other alien races wasmostundesirable,-and the Attorney General, in his speech on the second reading of this Bill, told us that there were no less thaii S0,000 coloured aliens in Australia to-day-the greater number of these being Chinese and Japanese, and a small proportion being Polynesians. plain duty, therefore, to prevent any further inf lux of these coloured aliens into our midst, and no proposal having this object would, I think, besoeffectual asthatputforward by the -Opposition-that is, the straight-out course. This question of excluding coloured aliens is no new one. It was debated in some of the provinces of Canada as far back as 1884. We know also that the matter has been fully dealt with in Africa. In Natal'the colonists have been most persistent in their demands for the exclusion of foreign, coloured races, and although thelegislation passed there has been referred to by the Secretary of State for the Colonies as nn-example for us, it must not be forgotten that the particular form of enactment passed there was forced upon the Natal Government at the dictation of Downing-street, -because tlie Hindoos raised a very strong protest against the proposed legislation in that colony. I believe that the Government proposal would prove ineffectual even with the insertion of the word "" European"" instead of the word ""English."" If the Government have a policy on this question, let them announce it. As the Opposition are disinclined to make this a party question, the Government will lose no prestige, and they will lose no influence by altering their present proposals. They may lose a little moral influence by sliding from one side of the question to the other, but they will not suffer in the estimation of this I am Chamber by accepting the decision of the House on this great question. T am of opinion thab the Government proposal will be ineffectual for many reasons. I fail to see how the heterogeneous races that are to be found at Cairo will be prevented from entering Australia by the imposition of the educational test proposed by the Government. There are also large numbers of the natives of South Africa who would find the educational test no bar to their entering the Commonwealth, and large numbers of the Hindoos, who .landed in Natal before the agitation was raised in that country againsb their immigration, are now able to talk English fairly well, and would find no difficulty in complying with the requirements of paragraph (a). Many of these natives were able, even before they went to Natal, to speak and write English fully up to the standard likely to be required by the officers administering this Act and one may travel through province after province in BritishI t is our India and find thousands of-men who would be able to pass a test similar to that now in. operationin Natal, and which the Government have embodied in this Bill. Away in the West Indies, again, there are hordes of coloured men, half-castes, and others, who would be able to pass any ordinary test such as is proposed in this Bill. A t Hong Kong also there are tens of thousands of people who would similiarly find no difficulty in doing all that was required of them under the educational test, and the same .remark applies to a considerable number of the residents of Yokohama. In the islands of the Pacificin Fiji, in ""New Caledonia, and in Tongathere are many thousands of Polynesians who are able to read and write sufficiently for all the purposes of the proposed test, and in Samoa and in the Hawaiian Islands there are thousands of natives to whom no obstacle would be presented by it. In the Hawaiian Islands there are more schools in proportion to the population than we have in Australia, and the children are all taught to read and write-chiefly English language. Then again there is a Negro Republic in Africa where not only is the English language spoken, but where the currency and the weights and measures of Great Britain are in use. The population of that country would find no difficulty in passing this educational test-to say nothing of the millions of negroes to be found in the southern States of America. I am referring to all these places because they are adjacent to Australia. in Chinatown Chinese-a are more or less acquainted with the English language. whom I have referred can speak English fluently, and are endowed with sufficient intelligence to enable them to overcome any such obstacle as would be here presented. In the Hawaiian Islands the well-to-do people are principally Chinese, and half the population of Chinese and Japanese in Honolulu not only speak and write Enghsh well, but own most of the valuable property. carriages are. half-castes, and belong to that race of men who have come into existence through the admixture of ths Chinese, Japanese, and Kanakas. It will, therefore, be seen that the proposal of the Government would not be sufficient to keep out hordes of men who would be free to come in here and add to the 80,000 coloured aliens who are already in our midst. These people would be easily able to pass the educational test, and the phrase, "" Australia for the Australians "" would be a byword, and would have no meaning, just as "" a white Australia"" coming from the mouths of the Government really has no significance whatever. The facts I have mentioned must command the serious consideration of honourable members. that legislation restricting the invasion of aliens has been adopted in all the countries of Europe,and has been applied to aliens from any part of the world, lest tbe low standard of living of these people should have a tendency to degrade the people into whose midst they might go. Even in Turkey we find that for the reason just stated, objection is taken to the Mr Henry Willi*. immigration of aliens of a degraded class. These low-class aliens are legislated against in all parts of the world, and notwithstanding the statement made by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, that it is a in the tradition of Great Britain that we shall not enact legislation that shall be prohibitory of these people, it is only in recent years that this matter has been neglected. We find that the question was under consideration, politically, as far back as the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Mr Wilkinson, who has written a book upon the alien invasion of Europe saysTo sum up, therefore, it appears that in all European nations-wit h one insignificant excepIn San Francisco they have tion-som e measures, more or less drastic, are a population of 50,000 taken, either for prohibiting the admission, or for little colony in itself-who the expulsion of destitute and undesirable aliens. This policy is the deliberate outcome of years of thought and legislation. It is framed in the All these people to interests of the native population in each country, and is, in all cases, fully in accordance with the popular will. It is generally recognised throughout Europe that it is the duty of every State to deal with its own paupers and undesirable citizens, and it is recognised also that the only way to bring about that desirable end, is by other countries politely but firmly refusing to admit them. Thus it may be safely said, that in the continent of Europe, all countries liable to suffer from undesirable immigration have taken steps to guard themselves against it-wit h one The men who roll about in their single exception. That exception is Great Britain. That refers to modern times. But I find that in Great Britain Alien Exclusion Acts were passed in 1390, 1402, 1439, 1491, and 1543, and in the reigns of Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth similar proposals to that advocated by the honourable and learned member for In d i wore adopted in Great Britain, and undesirable aliens were excluded by proclamation. In the Georgian and Victorian eras the Alien Acts contained regulations for the expulsion of aliens "" if the State requires it , "" and in 1846 Sir George Grey, in moving the adoption of the Aliens Act, saidThe grounds upon which it is proposed to piss I find this legislation are simply those which this country has always maintained, and has every right to maintain, namely, that of self-protection. The people of Great Britain have also spoken out distinctly upon this question, notwithstanding the statement of the Honourable Mr Chamberlain that the people of Great Britain would be greatly incensed if the Crown were called upon to assent to legislation prohibiting the lower classes of coloured aliens from coming into our midst. I find that 46 labour organs and trades unions in Great Britain have condemned unrestricted alien immigration into the country, for the reason that we wish to restrict such immigration here-that it will have a tendency to lower the standard of living and morality, and to drag the people of the States down to the standard of the lowest class of immigrants who come to their shores. W it h these facts before us, we are justified in taking a course which will preserve Australia to the Australians, just as legislation is enacted in Great Britain and in other European countries against undesirable immigrants being admitted to their shores. was never put into force. was no need to put it into force. It was special legislation, enacted at the time of continental disturbances, and could have been put into operation if the necessity had arisen. The Attorney General, in a very long speech, which has given great satisfaction to the supporters of the Government, sought to justify the measure which we are now considering, but, having very carefully looked through what he said, I am inclined to the opinion that all his sympathy is not with the Bill, nor with the Opposition, nor with the labour corner whose views have been represented by the honourable member for Bland. Sir WILLIAM of trouble to show that. trouble and a great deal of time; and it takes a great deal of time and trouble to find out what his speech meant. He said -and it is a very important statement that of 80,000 coloured aliens there are 40,000 Chinese, and that these 40,000 Chinese and more than 20,000 Japanese had come to our shores since he himself took a very active part in enacting legislation in what was then the colony of Victoria against their immigration. In his statement to the House he told us that he was speaking not for himself but as representing the Government; so that all he has said has to be taken as representing the views of the Government of which he was the spokesman. He saidThere have been determinations which hereafter may have important consequences arising out of our administration, as well as other measures which will be submitted to Parliament, all having in view the accomplishment of the same end. That end, put in plain and unequivocal terms, as the House and the country are entitled to have it put, means the prohibition of all alien coloured immigration, and more-it means at the earliest time, by reasonable and just means, the deportation or reduction of the number of aliens now in our midst. The two things go hand in hand, and are the necessary complement of a single policythe policy of securing a ""white Australia."" It would appear from that that the honourable and learned gentleman is in favour of a white Australia. He told us that the threatened invasion in 1855 and 1883 received his careful and determined opposition, and that he indited a despatch to the Colonial-office, iu which it was stated that Australia relied upon uniform legislation in order that its voice might be thoroughly appreciated and respected at Downingstreet, and would look to the Colonialoffice to see that diplomatic measures were taken, so that its wishes might be respected and enforced. For, he saidWe may have in the future some development which may call for tlie application of the Monroe doctrine in the Pacific. But far more important than that, and a far more significant declaration at the present time, is this for a white Australia. It is the Monroe doctrine of the Commonwealth of Australia. I believe that it is. Australians have said definitely that they will have a white Australia, and whether this Government are or are not prepared to give it, the question on this occasion, the people of Australia will still have it. Notwithstanding the fears of the Attorney-General of the possibility of the yawning cannon of the Japanese being brought to our shores by their ironclads, the Government will find that Australia has spoken out on this subject as America has spoken out upon the Monroe doctrine. America, indeed, has spoken upon the very question which we are now considering. She spoke upon it many years ago, and her voice has been respected. Our voice will also be respected if we are determined, earnest, and sincere. In 1896, the Premiers determined in conference that there should be uniform legislation upon this question, in order that provisions against tlie immigration of Chinese might be so pronounced that there might be no invasion or influx of these people in the future. But, although Bills were passed by the Legislatures of several States, and a despatch was",19,Willis Asked The The Presence Of The Officer A Passage Of

I believe that the Victorian measure was assented to, and when it was found that Australia was in earnest and had .passed uniform legislation which she expected, an was stated by the Attorney-General, who was then Attorney-General for Victoria, to be passed, the authorities in Great Britain said-""AV e decline to allow you to enforce legislation which will have the effect of making these people unable to enter Victoria."" Premiers were in London, Mr Chamberlain had repeated conferences with them. He knew that they were able men, men as capable as himself, and he had to treat with them on equal terms. He had really to induce them to follow his advice, because their experience of Australian affairs was greater than his. He told them that there was only one measure that would be acceptable to tlie British Government, and that was what is now known as the Natal Act. He re-stated the case for Australia in these words :I wish to direct your attention to certain Legislaout that line of policy ever since. tion which is in process of consideration, or which has been pissed by some of the colonies, in regard to the immigration of aliens, and particularly of Asiatics. I have seen these Bills, and they differ in some respects one from the other : but there is no one of them, except perhaps the Bill which comes to us from Natal, to which we can look with satisfaction. I wish to say that Her Majesty's Oovernment thoroughly appreciate the object mid the needs of the Colonies in dealing with this matter. We quite sympathize with the determination of the white inhabitants of these Colonies, which are in comparatively close proximity to millions and hundreds of millions of Asiatics, that there shall not be an influx of people alien in civilization, alien in religion, alien in customs, whose influx, moreover, would most seriously interfere with the legitimate rights of the existing labour population. Nothing could be more conciliatory than the .statement there made. Mr Chamberlain was talking to men who were not likely to be bluffed, and he found that he would have to go slow, and pave Ids way. He was leading up to something, a declaration such .as really put the fear of him into the heart of the present Attorney-General, as honourable members will -find if they read the honourable and learned member's speech. Mr emigrants to Natal were taken on labour Chamberlain was leading up to the determination which had been arrived at in Cabinet by the British Government to continue to refuse legislation to Australia, just i Mr Henry Willis. as they are now doing to other parts of the world, such as Canada. He -saidAn immigration of that kind must, I quite understand, in the interests of the colonies, be prevented at all hazards, and we shall not offer any opposition to the proposals intended with that object, but This"" b u t "" is most significantwe ask you also to bear in mind the traditions of the Empire, which make no distinction in favour of or against race or colour, and to exclude, by reason of their colour, or by reason of But when the Colonial their race, all Her Majesty's Indian subjects, or even all Asiatics, would be an act so offensive to those peoples that it would be most painful I am quite certain to Her Mujesty to have to sanction it. It is not because a man is of a different colour from ourselves that he is necessarily an undesirable immigrant, but it is because ho is dirty, or he is immoral, or be is a pauper, or he has some other objection which can be defined in an Act of Parliament. It is not the colour of the man that is to be the pretext for excluding him. It must be upon some other grounds that he is to be excluded. Mr Chamberlain came from under the rose in that declaration, and he has been most consistent in carrying He extols then the industiy of the Hindoo. Here we come to the old question that caused the British Government to be firm. They were apparently indifferent until objection was raised by the rajahs of India and the princes of Hindustan, who believe themselves to have come from the same stock as ourselves in past ages, who do not believe they are different from us in any shape or form, who say that they are as intelligent, and that their standard of knowledge, education, and art is as high as our own, and that they should be respected by all civilized people. AAe find that His .Majesty the King is to r be crowned Emperor at Delhi, which is the important place from which all these objections have come, as will be seen if the matter be looked into thoroughly. It is from that part of India that the objections have come to class and colour distinctions in legislation of this kind. It was not until objections were raised by the rajahs of India, and of Hindustan in particular, from which the agreements, that any action was taken at all; and their influence was so great in Great Britain as to cause the British Government to prevent the proposed legislation in Natal, and insist upon an educational test, so that the susceptibilities of the Indian princes might not be offended. It is not u question, they say, of colour, but a .matter of character. I am not here to vote -upon those lines. Domestic legislation, judiciously applied and administered, should be left to regulate the character, status, and the .morality of people who are admitted to this countiy. I am here to vote on the coloured question-the question upon -which Mr Chamberlain says we are not called on to legislate. 1 am here to -oppose the dictation of Mr Chamberlain on this question, and to vote in favour of a ""white Australia""-in favour of preserving tlie race, blood, and stamina of the people of Australia for all time. Mr .Chamberlain's recent despatch to Queensland is another instance which shows clearly what are tlie opinions and intentions of Downing-street on this important question. Home authorities recently rejected the .Bill passed by the Government of Queensland for application to the northern part of that great State, they refused to allow any restriction to be placed on the employment of Asiaticsi n the sugar mills there. That Bill, to which Mr Chamberlain would not advise Her Majesty to assent, embodied disqualification based on the place of origin, which is .practically a distinction of race and colour, and i u this matter Mr Chamberlain returned to his old argument that we must not legislate against colour, but against character. saidAny attempt to impose disqualifications on the ish Columbia in 18S4 was enacted for base of such distinctions, besides being offensive the purpose of excluding Chinese, and to a friendly power, is contrary to the general that province of British North America conceptions of equality which have been the guiding principle of British rule throughout the has been most persistent in -this matter.

Fate is law, and law is perfect; If ye meddle, ye will mar ; Change is rash, and ever was so : We are happy as we are. When we come to a consideration of the question as it arose in Canada, we find that the British Government declined to assent to a measure similar to that which we now have before us. According to a recent press telegram it appears that Great Britain, at the instance of Japan, has persuaded the Canadian Government to disWhen the allow a Bill lately passed by the Legislature of British Columbia, imposing an educational test for the purpose of excluding Chinese and Japanese immigrants, and forbidding their employment in certain kinds of work.

52,Mr Henrywillis,"The Billat the Court of St. James, and urged that not only were those laws unjust, but also a violation of the treaties between China and Great Britain; whereupon Great Britain, as she has done on a more recent occasion, made representations to the Government of Canada that the laws should not be restrictive as against the Chinese. Chinai n those days had not had the sad experience of a war with Japan, and her voice was as strong as that of Japan, and her desires quite as much respected. We find that the British Government treated the Japanese as they did the Chinese on a former occasion, but the same respect is not shown to China to-day, simply because she has no ships of war, though the intelligence of the higher grades of the Chinese is quite as high as that of the people of Japan, and should be respected accordingly. W it h these proposals before us, and with our experience of Great Britain in regard to legislation that has been enacted in other colonies, it is necessary that Australia should be firm if she wishes to have her voice respected. The Attorney-General in his speech recently took a sudden turn after perusing the despatches that were written to Australia from Downing-street, and we find that he is opposed to the definite proposals which are before us to-day. I would direct the attention of honourable members to tlie remarks of the Attorney General, who saidThe Government have no particular love for this method of proceeding any more than for any other method, but they realized-as honourable members of this House who share their responsibility must realize-that when a reasonable request was preferred in a most reasonable conciliatory manner to the people of Australia, it had to be taken into account. It is the opinion of the Attorney-General that the Government have no more love for this Bill than for any other Bill, and that they have no love at all for this restrictive legislation. his own offspring. should not. knows its own father."" from that remark that the Attorney General is not fathering this Bill at the present time, although he earlier stated he spoke for the Government. If the Attorney General is not at one with the Government, have we not the experience of the Minister for Defence, who has no sympathy whatever with the Administration on a certain question, but said there was nevertheless such a thing as being faithfu l to it . Again, we have the case of the honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Philip Eysh, who, while he did not approve of certain legislation introduced here, said it was his duty to be faithful to the Government and to support the Bill. It appears, however, that the Attorney-General is not faithful to the Government. He has no sympathy whatever with the proposals of the Government, and I should think his place was , outside of this Ministry. The Attorney General further saidA nation which is capable of the achievements which Japan is able to exhibit artistically, and politically, and of the industrial expansion now going on in that country, is justified in resenting -as we should ourselves resent-an y unnecessary reflection upon its character by another nation. He said againJapan is justified in resenting 3113' unnecessarily offensive legislation on the part of another nation, just as we might object to being classed with the peoples of the Pacific Islands, as if the Polynesian residents of those islands and ourselves were on the same plane. Further on, the Attorney-General saidTo lump all these peoples together as Asiatics and undesirables would naturally be offensive to a high-spirited people like the Japanese, and surely, without any request from the British Government or without any representations from the Japanese people, mere considerations of courtesy, such as should exist between one civilized people and another, should lead us to make this distinction. Considerations of simple politeness, such as honourable members extend to each other in this House, should at least govern the actions of civilized nations in their dealings with one another. This legislation, it appears, is merely a matter of politeness and consideration for the Japanese-the politeness that one European would show to another is to be shown to the Japanese to the extent of admitting them to our shores. It appears that the Government have no policy on the question, if tbe He certainly Attorney-General is to be taken as their spokesman. The Secretary of StateI t is "" a wise child that for the Colonies would appear to have won over tlie Attorney-General to his I should judge way of thinking, and the latter is of opinion that the British Government and the British connection must be supported to the extent of casting aside the aspirations of the Australian people, and admitting coloured aliens to our midst, On the ground",24,Mcmillan H E Took A Lot Will Come Up Again I F They Do Not Give I T

56,Mr Henrywillis,"that to do otherwise would interfere with the British Government in certain negotiations they are conducting at the present time. If Australia is to he cast aside on every occasion that a knotty point is raised in the East, I suppose that we shall repeat the experience which we had when the war broke out in South Africa. Upon that occasion the very first slice of concession which had to be made was made to Germany and the United States by giving to them the Samoan Islands. The concession was one which was opposed to the desires of the Australian people, and although a mild protest was raised at the time, that protest was not sufficiently backed up by the Governments of the day, out of consideration to the delicate negotiations which were in progress at that time between certain countries and Great Britain. It was feared that these people would step in and support the Boers against Great Britain. These concessions will have to be made at the expense of Australia, because the plane of battle is now being moved to the Pacific Ocean, and it is in this part of the world that these matters will be fought out in the future. Every concession that is made will be made at tlie expense of Australia, and at the sweet will of Downing-street. Whilst Mr Chamberlain and the Government of this Commonwealth urge that the adoption of such a proposal as that of the honourable member for Bland would embarrass tlie British Government, we have every reason to believe that they would not be embarrassed in the slightest degree. Under a treaty between Great Britain and Japan, provisions have already been assented to in favour of Australia legislating against the influx of coloured aliens. In this treaty it is stated that the people of Great Britain and Japan shall be at liberty to travel within the countries mentioned, and shall be protected. be as free in one countiy as in the other with certain exceptions. exceptions extend to India, the Dominion of Canada, Newfoundland, the Cape, Natal, New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia, and New Zealand. that Australia is at perfect liberty to legisUnited States the coloured people of Porto late against the influx of Japanese. The Japanese has no voice in the matter. Under that treaty the Japanese Government have already assented to Australia legislating in favour of bis exclusion. separately the spirit of the treaty. some action was taken in Queensland. There is no reason why we should not act because we have everything to gain, and were excluded from the operation of the original treaty. Notwithstanding this fact, we find that in British Columbia, which is one of the provinces of Canada, the Imperial Government, at the simplest hint from Japan that she was displeased at similar legislation, recently used their influence at Ottawa to prevent such legislation from coming into operation. It is for us to see that the aspirations of the Australian people are not thwarted either by tlie action of tbe present Government or of Mr Chamberlain in Downing-street.' He desires to abrogate this treaty iu favour of the Japanese simply because he has a knotty question to settle in tbe East. But if he has about him men who are capable of discharging the duties of diplomatists, this question will be dealt with just as America dealt with it . In America they will have no fuss. If they are in earnest they say so, and their opinions when they are advanced are respected. There they have dealt with this question with a strong firm hand, and their decisions have been enforced, even though by so doing they recently gave offence to the Japanese. Certain Japanese ladies, when called upon to submit to the ordinary test which is required of persons travelling into American territory, in order that it may be determined whether or not they are suitable persons to be admitted to the country, objected. Quite a fuss was made through their representative, but they were very soon told by the authorities at Washington that America would govern her own affairs as she thought best. As a result, these Japanese women It is provided that they shall were dealt with in the same way as other people were dealt with. The decision of Those the American authorities was at once adopted, and no more was heard of the matter. Just after the Spanish-American war was concluded, the American Government were confronted with the quesThus we see tion of whether they should admit into the Rico, the Hawaiians, and the Filipinos. A decision was immediately arrived at by the Supreme Court of the United States that the United States of America could govern her colonies in any way that to Congress",25,Mcmillan H E Took A Lot Will Come Up Again I F They Do Not Give I T

58,Mr Henbywillis,"I think thatseemed best. As a result the Filipinos, Hawaiians, and Porto Ricons are not admitted into the United States to-day, although they are colonists of that country. America will not foregOj at the present time, her right to exclude undesirable immigrants even in favor of these people, to whom she has given the protection of the stars and stripes. That is a case in point for Great Britain to consider. that her Indian subjects shall be admitted to any part of Australia. ever, does not desire their presence, and is prepared to enact legislation to prevent, them from coming here. The colonial aspect of this question was very much under notice in 1887. It was at that time the Chinese immigration aroused the irritation of the industrial community of this continent, and their voices were heard upon the public platform. Premiers of the various Australian colonies, and they made their voices heard to such an extent that united action was taken against the influx of the Chinese. The Emperor of China-as in the case of British Columbiasent a Commission to Australia. missioners went from one end of Australia to the other, and found that there were restrictive laws in operation for the exclusion of the Chinese, but notfor the exclusion of people from European countries. made a protest against this and urged that it was in violation of the laws and treaties existing China and Great Britain. was that Lord Knutsford sent a circular letter to the Governments of Australia, calling upon them to answer the objections which had been raised by the Chinese Court. Immediately an outcry was raised all over the continent against this circular letter. letter that the Government of the day were opposed to the legislation then in operation. Lord Carrington was called upon by his Ministers to send home a despatch which had no uncertain ring about it. The other colonies sent similar despatches. answer of Australia was so full and complete that Lord Elnutsford had to do what Mr Chamberlain would have to do if we were only sufficiently firm. He had to surrender to the expressed decision of the several Cabinets of Australia-. received tlie replies of the Governments he telegraphed to know under what law the Chinese were restricted from coming to our Mr Henry Willis, shores. A reply was sent by the late Sir Henry Parkes, and I think that it is worthy of consideration. That veteran was told by Members of the New South Wales Parliament that he had no Act of Parliament to support him in the stand which he had taken. Coming from so great a. constitutional authority-fro m a man with 50 years' longer experience in colonial answer was significant. He saidAustralia, howI care nothing about your cobweb of technical law. I am obeying a law far superior to any law which issued these permits, namely the law for the preservation of society in New South Wales. That was the stand taken up by Sir Henry Parkes, who, by the way, is seldom quoted in this Chamber. Lord Knutsford again, telegraphed to know upon what law the Chinese were excluded, and the reply of Sir Deputations waited upon the Henry Parkes was that both laws and treaties must give way to the strength of colonial feeling. That was the decision of Sir Henry Parkes on that occasion. AndI would ask, what is the colonial feeling to-day 1 It is undoubtedly strongly against The comthe admission of Chinese or Japanese into our midst, and there is also a determined feeling among the people of Australia that the Polynesians should not be admitted here.

I would refer the Minister for Defence to the law that, was enacted in The British Columbia, in 1884, which was passed to exclude the Chinese; it was found insufficient for the purpose, and an amending Act of a more rigorous character was passed. If we desire to know the experience of British colonies upon the Chinese questWhen he ion, we have only to refer to the little province of British Columbia, and to the colony of Natal, in order to find that in both those places tlie law has proved ineffectual.",26,Mcmillan H E Took A Lot Will Come Up Again I F They Do Not Give I T

If the present Government are afraid of the Japanspoken of in one or two quarters as displaying disloyalty and immoderation in many respects, but, from all I have read and heard, I think no one, either in our midst or in the mother land, could accuse a single speaker of having used any expression that was capable of being construed into disloyalty or immoderation. of such vast importance that we should be wanting the responsibility we occupy if we did not speak out as plainly as honourable members have done, and I think I might go further and say that still more plain speaking is required if we are to adequately impress the Home authorities as to our feeling on this matter. No one could take exception to the general tone of the discussion. There has been no disposition on our part to any Spreadeagleism or ""hifalutin"" which we admit that the embarrassments of the Home Government are considerable, and I feel that, determined as we are to arrive at a proper solution of this subject, we shall always approach it in a spirit of loyalty and moderation. I object to the question being hemmed round with what I might call the tradition which has ruled in Great Britain there should be no distinction of race or colour in any of our enactments. principles are never fixed, the world is moving on in everything, all political matters we are in a state of flux. Whatever the tradition referred to may have been in the past, and whatever good it may have done, I hold that it has not been a universal tradition, and is not such a tradition as ought to rule us today. When we have to deal with a question of this sort we should not slavishly follow traditions or precedents. in this rising Commonwealth of Australia, to make precedents for' ourselves, and we have to display that originality of thought, that definiteness of expression, and that sincerity of act and emotion that were exhibited by our fellow men in the United States in the early days of their history. I hope, therefore, that we shall not approach this great question in any sense by tradition or precedent derived from any part of the World. The problem is ours, and must be solved by us, and the only way we can solve it is by adopting the amendment of which notice has been given by the honourable member for Mr G. B. Edwards. Bland. The problem is one which is peculiar to Australia. It affects no other part of the world as it affects us. AVe have taken as a heritage from our predecessors this vast continent, which theyhavedone more than any other race in the world could have done to bring to its present high state of prosThe matter is perity, and we take this heritage under a Constitution which is second to none for the in that fair sense of democratic development of its principles ; due to the position and if we are to develop this great land in the interests, not only of Australia, but of the whole civilized world, we are bound to see that the civilization here is maintained as an Anglo-Saxon civilization. Therefore, this is a great national question, and I am happy to say that there has been no attempt to make it a party question in any sense whatever, but, on the other hand, a patriotic unanimity of desire to allow party upon a matter in feeling to slumber whilst we are dealing with this matter. Outside the House an opinion seems to have been formed that this is a labour question-that is, that it is interesting alone to what are known as the labour organizations of Australia. I deny, At the same time however, that in that sense this is a labour question. It is a national question, and, though I am ready and willing to follow that the leader of the labour party-sinc e he has brought forward an amendment which Political adequately expresses my viewsI deny tlie right of any one to assume that the and in interest in this matter is restricted to any one section of the community. If any proof were required of this view of the facts, we have it in the speech delivered by the honourable member for Wentworth very early in the debate. That speech, to my mind, was one of the best, if not the best, which has been delivered on the question in this Chamber, and it has given a We have, feeling of great satisfaction to the whole of Australia. In the honourable member we have a gentleman who is noted for his loj alty and his caution, and who is not conr sidered by any one to have a bias in the direction of labour or social legislation. He grasps the nettle, and tells us plainly, after a lifetime of commercial activity, and after long experience in the political world of Austrammelled tralia, that the only way to obtain what we desire is to move boldly in the direction of it . If anything was required to prove to us that we are united in this matter, and that it is a national and not a labour question, the admirable speech delivered by the honourable member does so. The danger to Australia has been referred to over and over again, and I do not think it can be magnified. Here we have a fair new Commonwealth, its lands almost unoccupied, offering every inducement to people to come from all parts of the world and settle amongst us. There are close to our shores, in view of the modern means of transit, hundreds of millions of people of a civilization which differs from ours. We know well from recent experience that great numbers of these people would be only too willing to move out of their over-populated lands, and to come and settle on our fertile shores. It would be very much to their advantage probably, but it would certainly not be to the interest or for the good of the people of Australia, if they did. Our civilization is distinct from that of the nations of whom we are in this matter afraid -and I use the word "" afraid "" advisedly. We are afraid that our civilization will be permanently injured by contact with a large number of persons of races belonging to a different civilization. To my mind it is not a question of colour at all. The distinction of colour comes into it ; but it is a question of difference in civilization. Since my boyish days, when I read books upon the civilization of mankind, I have regretted that there are so few civilizations in the world. I regret that the civilizations of the American continent became extinct, because I believe that it would be a good thing for the world if we had a greater variety of types of civilization than we have. But I do not think that anything is to be gained in the interests of humanity or of Australia by intermingling the existing civilizations. that no good comes from hybridization, because hybrids reproduce the vices of both parents with the virtues of neither, and for this reason I think we should preserve our civilization intact and uncontaminatedI am, therefore, prepared to support the amendment at all costs and at all hazards. I am willing to admit that the Japanese, the Hindoo, and the Chinese civilization may ultimately evolve something higher in the development of humanity, but whatever it evolves will necessarily be something different from that which has been evolved by European civilization. W it h my faith in Australia, and the grand start she has had, I look forward to seeing European civilization carried to a higher eminence in Australia 15 i than it has yet been in any other part of the world. Therefore I hold that, whatever may be the cost, and whatever time it may take to accomplish theobjectwe have in view, this House should, in the interests of the Commonwealth, take a decided stand, and move steadily forward year after year until the end is obtained. The very nature of the legislation which is likely to be enacted in Australia will provide an additional attraction to those whom we wish to exclude. The tendency of our legislation is more in the direction of socialism, of improving the lot of the masses, than that of the legislation of any other part of the world. This must necessarily create conditions which will attract men of civilizations which I hold to be inferior to ours. The question is one which we must solve, not for the present day, but for posterity. I do not believe that I or my friends, or our immediate descendants, are likely to suffer greatly from the invasion of the races which we wish to exclude. But there is no doubt that the danger to our remote descendants is extremely great, and even threatens their political extinction. We have to legislate to-day not so much for ourselves as for posterity. That being so, we can go as slowly ""as we like, so long as we keep in view an adequate solution of the problem. It has been said by some that we, a mere handful of people, occupying this continenta mere 4,000,000 -hav e no right to set up our will against the desire of 40,000,000 of people residing in Great Britain, as expressed by their representatives. But, as we are endeavouring to solve this question not for ourselves We see in tlie natural world but for our descendants, we must look forward to a time when the population of Australia is likely to be 100,000,000, and that of the dear old mother land may not exceed 60,000,000, and we have therefore no right to allow the opinions of the larger population there now to settle the question in a way which will hand down a legacy of increased difficulty to our descendants. If the population of Australia is likely to become 100,000,000 within a little over a century, we must ask ourselves, in the interests of the whole British race, what is to be the character of this future Australian people % If we admit races of another civilization, we are likely to have a mongrel breed,' thoroughly out of sympathy with the aspirations of people of the British stock, and Australia will then be no friend of Great Britain in her hour of need and trouble. But, if we preserve the characteristics of our European civilization, the Greater Britain that is to be here 'will be the natural ally and friend of the mother countiy in those troubles, which, judging by the history of humanity throughoutthecenturies, upon her sooner or later. of Great Britain herself we should preserve here the English race, and make it so prosperous and free that Australia will be the best security for Great Britain in years to come. I do not think that the magnitude of this question is well understood in the old country, or that Mr Chamberlain, although he has been so ably advised upon it, understands it as we do. He does not know the temptations which Chinese and Japanese have to come here. mass of the English people have no interest in the question at all, and if we voice the feeling of Australia in such a way that it will be impossible for. the people of England to misunderstand it-if sons for the faith that is in us-we shall, by this debate and the comments which will take place upon it, so instruct them that their future Ministers, who will have to decide finally upon legislation of this sort, will not be able to withstand our wishes. have had kings in England who were statesmen, and statesmen of the British race who were kings. in English history were men who would not have thought twice as to how to deal with this question. brating-and have not had a similar celebration herethe millenary of Alfred the Great. was an ideal Englishman, question could have arisen in his day, or if he had bved in our day, it is evident in what way he would have dealt with .it. How would Queen Elizabeth have dealt with such a question had she had a dependency like Australia? such men as Pitt, who hailed with satisfaction the American revolution when he knew the gross facts of the case, have dealt with it 1 How would men like Rhodes deal with it 1 The giving of annoyance to Chinamen, the irritation of the Japanese, the coming into conflict with the Indian subjects of His Majesty would have been difficulties which would have been brushed aside by such rulers as unworthy to weigh in the scale with the hopes and fears of Australia at the present moment. Mr G. B. Edwards. do the Ministers of the Commonwealth propose to deal with the problem ? They have broughtdown a measure the fourth clause of which provides that no one shall be allowed to enter the Commonwealth unless he can write 50 words in the English must come language. I thought at one time that In the interests Ministers were acting under secret instructions from the Colonial-office in this matter; but, when the egregious folly of this test is considered, one is forced to admit that that cannot be so. Many persons of Japanese, Chinese, and other races whom we desire to exclude, can read and write English far better than the natives of friendly European powers who are desirable immigrants. Such a clause as this-as I pointed out to the Prime Minister when he introduced the The great Bill-woul d exclude Erench Canadians, and he said, in answer to my interjection, that he would deal with that matter directly. I have not seen that he has dealt with it in any way. we give good reaA clause like thiswould have prohibited my fellow-countryman-if I may be allowed to call him so-the honourable member for West Sydney, had it been in operation when he arrived in this country at nine years of age, and when he could not speak or write We a word of English. A clause such as this would prohibit the natives of the Channel Islands, the Gaelic inhabitants of the North The greatest men of Scotland, and many other very desirable immigrants. Buti t would not prohibit many undesirable immigrants, the exclusion of In England they are celewhom is tlie very object of the Bill. JapI think it is a pity that we anese could come and go through the test, and the Chinese, knowing of the test He would work up their knowledge and be and if the prepared to pass it . Hindoos will do the same, and the answer to all this by the Prime Minister, so far as he has given an answer, has been a sort ofenigmatic assertion, "" We can provide for all t h is ; you must trust tlie -administration*"" In How would other words the proposals of the Minister have no principle, and all we have to depend on is the aclministration of the law by the officers of the Government. What will that amount to 1 How is the Act to be administered 1 When a Japanese presents himself to a landing waiter,' has the visitor to be reported to the superior officer as a. man speaking very good commercial English, but as a man who is an undesirable immigrant on account of his race ?

The Prime Minister has admitted that he is not committed to this proposal altogether-that it is not a A'ital principle of the Bill, but that he is willing to make the test a European language. If a Japanese can speak and write English and French well, will he have prescribed some antique Spanish diction, or 50 words, from some Florentine poet 1 Is a German who comes here to be allowed to pass in his own language, while we stop the Japanese who can speak French? If that is the intention I hope the committee will pause before we commit ourselves to such a piece of deceitful legislation, wanting in principle and in everything that ought to bers. We have no right to look at bhe consequences of passing this measure with the amendment of which the honourable member for Bland has given notice. If we think that the amendment is the right way of obtaining that which we all wish to obtain, and we think that that which we wish to obtain is absolutely necessary for Australia, we must leave the responsibility of vetoing this measure with His Majesty's Ministers at home. I do not myself fear that the Bill will be vetoed. I am willing to admit bliat in the first instance it may probably be vetoed; but I am perfectly certain bhat if the same measure is j>resented again, some solution of the difficulty will then be found, if it has not been found in the interim between the Bill being first vetoed and its second presentation. Mr G. B. EDWARDS the very longest, two years. I do not know whether the honourable member for Melbourne Ports favours the amendment or not, but the course I suggest would .15 I 2 give an adequate and final solution of the difficulty. The Bill, as proposed, gives no solution whatever. The clause has been adequately described as a piece of hypocritical legislation, which means more than it says, and which is to be administered in On the such a way as to give expression to the will of the Ministry of the day. That is not the way Australia ought to legislate. We ought not to give power to Ministers to administer an Acti n any way they like. If we were dealing with a matter of internal administration, we would not submit for a moment to a clause which could be administered one way for one person and anotherway for another, and if we would not submit to such legislation in our internal affairs, we have no right just now, when we are for the first time making our voiceheard in the councils of the world, toframe a measure on such deceit and obliquity; but we ought to act on principle in "" scorn of consequence."" A vast majority of honourable members who have spoken have been entirely against the Government proposal. Some honourable members, however, have been fairly frightened by this bogy of the Colonialoffice, and have admitted that if it comes, to be a question of vitality to the Government they will support them. That is a poor statement to have to make in support of thecommend it to honourable memclause, namely, that if they were free to vote,, they would vote against the Government proposal. When the Government told the committee that though the Bill is not vital to the Government the clause is vital to the Bill, the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne said that in that case he considered himself free to vote against the clause and in favour of the amendment. The Prime Minister, whom I believe we are to hear again on the subject, spoke undoubtedly under very great restraint. I looked for the cause of that restraint, and I can see nothing further than that he is depending on the administration and not on the principle of the clause. That is, I have already said, a wrong and wicked principlefor the committee to adopt. The Attorney General, in speaking in support of the Government measure, delivered one of those able and eloquent speeches for which he is so justly famous. No better speech probI t will take, at ably has been delivered in this debate ; but that speech, from the beginning right through till nearly the end, was, every line of it, an argument in favour of the amendment",28,Mcmillan H E Took A Lot Will Come Up Again I F They Do Not Give I T
66,Mr Mauger,"Ho w long will that take ?of the honourable member for Bland. It was only when the Attorney-General came to the finish and had to square those views which he had expressed, and which are so thoroughly in accord with those of tlie whole of Australia, with the Government proposal that his speech came to a ""lame and impotent conclusion."" The speech was probably the very best that could be delivered in favour of a ""white Australia,"" .and of those definite conclusions which are .aimed at in the amendment of the honourable member for Bland. But notwithstanding that ->to the Ministry and to everybody .else that their proposal is out -of this committee, and that the whole community of Australia is out of sympathy with it-that it has been demonstrated over and over again that it will not secure the end we are aiming at, and that it is oblique, -deceitful, and hypocritical in its expression -notwithstandin g all that, it seems that the Government are going to stick to the -proposal, and endeavour to pass it through the House, or to drop all effort at legislation on the subject. I hope that even at the last moment the Government will reconsider their position, and will take . advantage of the reiterated fact that the Opposition have not the slightest inclination to make a party question of this B ill ; and that Australia is almost entirely united as to the wisdom of taking definite and strong measures in an endeavour to settle this quesI consider that if the B ill be passed in tion ; and that they will allow the amend.ment to go into the Bill, and be sent tp the Home authorities. They can then consider what they will do if the Bill should be defeated, and probably, under these circumstances, some solution of the difficulty may be found. If the measure as it now stands . should go home and be assented to, no possible solution will ever be obtained ; and for the reasons I have given I am going to .support the amendment of the honourable .member for Bland. ""honourable member who has just sat down, I am going to support the amendment of the honourable member for Bland. I do this after very serious consideration, and I do it because I think that amendment is a better scheme than is the proposal of the Government. It is a better scheme, not only in the interests of the Commonwealth, but a so in the interests of the Empire of which we are a part, and I say this having f u l l regard to the very serious difficulties that are attendant on the question. It is the first question with which the Commonwealth Parliament has had to deal that is of international importance, and it is a question the solution of which will have very far-reaching results. I must say, having fully considered the difficulties attendant on the satisfactory solution of this question, that the proposal of the Government must create a good deal of dissatisfaction amongst those throughout the Commonwealth who exthe fact is plainly apparent pected an effective scheme for a ""white Australia,"" of which we have heard so much. totally Prior to the federal elections, the Prime of accord with the opinions Minister and the various members of the Ministry, together with those who supported their policy, talked a great deal about a "" white Australia,"" and made it one of the most prominent planks of their platform ; they now come forward with this education test, it is somewhat disappointing to find such a very small result from all their talk on the question. The proposal of the Government, as several honourable members have pointed out, is objectionable, because it will not keep out undesirable immigrants, while it certainly may keep out desirable immigrants. What was said by, I think, the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister was to the effect that this educational test-o r at any rate there was the implication-woul d be applied only to the coloured races. But even if that be the case, its present form it will be a very bad advertisement for Australia throughout the whole of Europe. This clause of the Bill will be published in the press of the northern countries of Europe, and it will be seen that an education test is necessary before admission can be gained to Australia. The consequence will be an undoubted diminution in the class of desirable immigrants who have for some years been coming to the Commonwealth-immigrant s from Germany, Scandinavia, and other parts of northern Europe, who have added verymaterially to our population. It has been proposed -o r at any rate there has been a suggestion to that effect-that instead of the education test being in the English language, it should be in a European language. If Japan, or any other Eastern nation, feels very sensitive on matters of this kind, I fail to see why it should not be",32,Mcmillan H E Took A Lot Will Come Up Again I F They Do Not Give I T
67,Mr Kirwan (Kalgoorlie),"Lik e theequally objectionable to them to have the limitation in the form of a European language. The discrimination will be just the same. It will be a matter of language and not of colour, and from the Japanese point of view I should say the original proposal, as it now stands in the clause, would be far more acceptable. that the English test is not objectionable, but that the European test is. Government will not meet the wishes of the Japanese, and I fail to see why we should consider Japan in every matter of this kind. I very much doubt whether the British Government, if they knew the seriousness of the question to us, would pay so much attention to the wishes of Japan as some honourable members seem to think they are likely to do. To my mind the strongest argument against posal of the Government is that it has been adopted in one of tbe States of which I have some knowledge-""Western Australia. This proposal, which was adopted in Western Australia in 1897, has proved altogether ineffective there. then there has been a large excess of departures over arrivals in Western Australia. number of departures has to do with the matter at all. The point which we have to consider is that of the number of the arrivals. arrivals since the end of 1898, and 117 departures. have here statesThe Natal Act was passed by the Western Australian Government in 1897. Since the beginning of 1898, the arrivals of Asiatics have numbered 525, and the departures 890. When we consider that the population of Western Australia is about 180,000, it will be seen that a total of 11,000 undesirable immigrants would be added to the population of the Commonwealth on the assumption that the same ratio of arrivals continued. The Prime Minister has directed attention to the fact that the arrivals included only 34 Japanese. I am sure that he does not know the facts in regard to the number *of Japanese women who are upon the gold-fields of Western Australia, or he would doubt very much the figures contained in that official return. For many years there have been a large number of Japanese women arriving on the gold-fields, and I think that, if he inquires from the police, he will find that 40 per cent, of the women of bad repute there are Japanese. There has beeii no check imposed upon the arrival of these women. I have here a copy of the North Coolgardie The new proposal of the Hercdd, which is published at Menzies. It has a leading article which shows the state of the alien trouble in that district. The article statesThe following petition is in course of signature at Mount Morgans and district:-""We, the undersigned business prople and residents of Mount Morgans and district, hereby pledge ourselves that on and after 1st September, .1901, we will not patronise, by agent or otherwise, any teams that are owned or driven by Asiatics, or the prodeal off Asiatic hawkers."" Honourable members can imagine the state of things which exists in Western Australia, where this Act has been operative since 1897, when the people have to adopt a boycotting system such as is here proposed.

It is a question, therefore, of whether the Imperial authorities are going to consider the interests of the Commonwealth or some diplomatic success that they may secure in the East.

In introducing the Bill, Mr Chamberlain referred to the 39 articles which embody the legislative powers of this Parliament, and saidThirdly : Legislation dealing with the people of an3' race, not being natives of either of the States. I think that has in view legislation in regard to Asiatics. That reference shows pretty clearly that the Imperial Government fully expected some legislation would be passed applying to Asiatics. limitation of the powers of the Commonwealth iu this matter. the Home Government have learned more about Australia since Mr Chamberlain made that noteworthy utberance which has guided bhe Government in the preparation of the Bill which they have now presented to this Parliament. the Imperial seriousness of this question of a "" white Australia,"" and have decided to give us a free ihand in regard to it.

76,Mr Puller (Illawara),"As one ofof Ausbralia. Amongst the advantages that were prominently brought before tlie people as likely to follow from the federation of the States was the fact that instead of speaking as several disunited States upon matters of vast importance such as this, we should be able to make our influence felt as a united people; but at the very first stage of our national existence, instead of approacliing . the British Government with firmness and determination, and straightforwardly and honestly putting before them the wishes of the Australian people, the Government propose in this Bill that we should speak with fear and trembling The whole of the actions of the British Government in connection with the Australian colonies have been of a character which should have inspired us with every confidence, and have deprived us of all. hesitation in openly stating -our views to them. ""When the federation of Australia was first placed before the Imperial Government they hailed with delight the advent of a new nation growing up under the British Grown, and everything thab has beeu done by bhe British Governmenb in connection with the birth of the Commonwealth should have induced us bo regard them with feelings quite opposite bo those which now seem to animate bhe Governmenb. 1 believe it is absolutely dangerous to the social welfare of the whole of Australia to have these coloured aliens imported here, and I will support the amendment of the honourable member for Bland, because I think that it proposes to deal with the matter in a straightforward and honest way. The method proposed by the Government, namely, that of adopting an educational test, would, it seems to me, cause just as much irritation to a great nation like Japan as if We were to openly declare our intention on the face of the Bill. the word ""European"" for ""English"" in connection with the educational test; and if we do that we shall immediately say bhat whilst bhe people of Europe can come in on such a test the Japanese shall not be admitted at all. giving as straight a thrust ab the Japanese as could possibly be administered. I believe with the honourable member who last spoke that the British people think more of us Australians, and of our friendship and kinship, than they think of the Japanese or any other people; and this House will be recreant to its trust, and to its pledges to carry out the wishes of the Australian people, if we do not let the British Government know what is the tiue feeling of the Commonwealth on this subject. Governments exist to carry out bhe wishes of the people, and if ever there was a matter upon which the people of Australia have spoken out straightforwardly surely it has been with regard to their desire for a white Australia. I do not think one honourable member, excepb perhaps bhe honourable member for Tasmania, Mr Cameron, has declared himself as being otherwise than in favour of having a white Australia, and whatever the Government may do now, it is certain that the pressure of public opinion throughout the whole of the Commonwealth will bring about a white Australia at an early date. It was the pressure of public opinion that brought about the Reform Bil l in England, and public opinion in Australia will insist that we must have a purely white people' setbled on bhis conbinenb. The references made bo our abtitude towards the Imperial authorities bring to mind the position taken up by the late Sir Henry Parkes in New South Wales, when that Stabe was only a pebby colony. When the Chinese question came up in 1888, at a time of great tumult in New South Wales, Sir Henry Parkes made use of language in moving the second reading of the Chinese Restriction Bill, which I think honourable members might very well bear in mind when deciding how they will vote upon this subject. Sir Henry Parkes in speaking in general terms upon these matters said""For a generation-lon g before some of tbe men who are listening to me took any part whatever iu public life-and at all times, I have It is j>roposed to substitute opposed the introduction of Chinese upon these, as I conceive, national, and to a large extent, philosophical grounds. 1 maintain that in a country like New South Walesi t is our duty to preserve the type of the British nation, and that we ought not, for any consideration whatever, to admit any element that would detract from, or That surely would be in any appreciable degree lower, that admirable type of nationality. Now, I would like for a moment to examine the ground on which I stand. I contend that if this young nation is to maintain the fabric of it3 liberties unassailed and unimpaired, it cannot admit into its population any element that of necessitv must be of an inferior nature aud character. In other words, I have maintained at all times that we should not encourage or admit amongst us aivy class of persons whatever whom we are not prepared to advance to all our franchises, to all onr privileges as citizens, and all than any other matter, and there was good our social rights, including the right of marriage. reason for it . We have been engaged in I maintain that uo class of persons should be subduing this vast continent, and in admitted here, so far as we can reasonably exclude peopling it, and in carrying out that them, who cannot come amongst us, take up all our rights, perform on the ground of equality all work in these latter days we have been our duties, and share in our august and lofty brought face to face with the fact work of founding a free nation. During that debate Sir Henry Parkes resupremacy with the alien races of Asiaferred to the action taken by himself as head particularly with the Chinese, Japanese, and of the Government in communicating with the peoples of the great Indian Empire. the Home authorities, and he stated that in One of the main considerations that in his despatch of the 31st March, 1888, he put fluenced the people of Australia in deciding forth our claim to be considered in the that it would be a good thing to federate exercise of treaty rights in these wordsAs these colonies form an important part of the part of the different States to shut out unEmpire, it is submited that our cause of contendesirable immigrants, the work in that tion is of sufficient national concern to be taken up by the Empire; if we have no voice in the direction had been ineffective for want of making of treaties, it seems only just that our unity.

Purther on the claim proceedsI t is respectfully submitted that the examinathe federal movement, and it was rightly tion of these principal phases of the question can considered that, speaking as one people, we only lead to one conclusion-namely , that the should be able to deal with this question Chinese must be restricted from immigrating to any part of Australasia. The despatch concluded in these words, which formed the most significant part of the message that was sent to the Home authorities However desirable it may be to avoid tlie political parties in promising the electors that irritation and conflict of interests which may arise from local legislation of a drastic character, their wishes should be carried into effect as if protection cannot be afforded as now sought, speedily as possible. The Government, in the Australian Parliaments must act from the accordance with their pledges, have subforce of public opinion in devising measures to mitted a proposal, but instead of bringing defend the colonies from consequences which they down a straight-out measure to prohibit cannot relax in their efforts to avert.

Then the people desired that",35,Mcmillan H E Took A Lot Will Come Up Again I F They Do Not Give I T
77,Mr Brown (Canobolas),"The clause no consideration should be allowed to standdefinite in its terras, and that it will totally feeling that the British authorities were not exclude these Asiatic races from the Commonwealth; but the question of expediency has been raised, and we are told that it will be better to follow a roundabout rather than a direct method. We are to tell these people whom we do not desire to see here that we do not object to their colour, but to their inability to speak our language, and that when they have made themselves sufficiently acquainted with it to pass the test to which we submit them, we will waive all objection on other scores, and receive them into our midst as equal with ourselves. I hold that that is not the position which was put before the electors of the Commonwealth, nor a compliance with the mandate which they gave us. If they spoke to this Parliament upon any one question more clearly than upon another, they so spoke upon this question, and the mandate which we received from them was to see that the Commonwealth is preserved for tlie white races of the globe. On those grounds I support the amendment in preference to the provisions in the clause as it stands. The amendment provides in a straightforward, honest, and effective way for meeting the difficulty which we have to face. In dealing with this matter we must consider and weigh the claims of Asiatic peoples--whethe r Chinese, Japanese, or our fellow subjects residing in India to admittance here with our obligations to the great Empire to which we belong, and to the people whom we directly represent. If the purpose that we have in view is tlie exclusion of all persons of Asiatic race, is it honest to pretend that we do not wish to exclude them, and propose to exclude them only if they have nob acquired a certain knowledge of our language? If bhat is our object, well and good. Let us tell the people of the Commonwealth that we are satisfied with that position. .Buti f that is not what we desire, and if we are certain that it will not comply with the mandate of the electors to preserve the purity and maintain blie predominance of white races in Australia, let us adopt tlie course best calculated to secure what we aim at. Undoubtedly the British governing authorities have to look at this matter from a large stand-point. They have to consider the relations of the Empire with other powers as well as its relations with us. A t one time during the debate there was a prepared to allow us to legislate to the f u l l extent necessary for our protection ; but I was glad to learn, from the very able address delivered by the Attorney-General, that that is not so, and bhab bhe British authorities do nob raise bhe question of our right to legislate upon this subject. All the Home Government say is thab, in view of their relations with the foreign powers whose subjects we seek to exclude, they prefer that we should adoj>t a certain form of legislation, and limit our restriction to a language test, rather than go in bhe direction of absolute prohibition. I bake ib, however, bhab if we are satisfied that it is necessary for our national welfare that we should legislate for total prohibition, the}' will be prepared to consider the position from our stand-point. The Attorney-General informed us that what the Government proposed is only an instalment of legislation on the subject, and that if necessary it will be supplemented by more drastic provisions. But to pass such legislation would not, to my mind, be carrying out the mandate of the people, which was to secure the tobal prohibition of coloured alien immigration. If the measure is passed as it stands, time must be allowed to test it before further legislation can be introduced, and if ib is found wanting, the number of undesirable aliens in our midst will be increased before we can take any remedial action. I bhink that the more honest course to pursue with respect to the races which we desire to exclude, the British aubhorities, and the voters whom we represent, is to pass legislation which we believe will be effective. If assent is refused to that legislation, we can ask for the reasons for its refusal, and then consider' whether those reasons are such as we should accept. The honourable and learned member for Indi is very much concerned about the susceptibilities of the Japanese. He would have us to suppose that if we told the Japanese nation that we did not wish Japanese subjects to enter our terribory ib would be greably offended; but that if we took power to legislate by resolution it would not have the sense to know what we are aiming at. pains to explain that that is not what I meant. have misundersbood the honourable and learned member.

79,Mr Brown,"Then I am sorry bhab I-what objection can there be to telling the Japanese straight out, by Act of Parliament, that we wish to prohibit their immigration ? in two speeches that I addressed to the House. would prefer straightforward de.'iling upon our part, and that they would rather have a prohibition Act in black and white upon our statute-books than an Act enabling ns in an underhand or back-door way, such as has been suggested, to deal with their -exclusion by resolution. I refuse to believe that they would not see through such a proposal, and that it would not be as objectionable to them as the passing of a direct prohibition Act. Only the other day we received a cablegram to say that one of the Canadian States proposed to adopt an educational test for the exclusion of certain immigrants, and that the British Government, at the instance of Japan, had induced the Canadian authorities to disallow that legislation. That shows very clearly that the Japanese know what the legislation means. We may call it in the Act of Parliament an educational test, but they know that it is a mode of preventing their people from entering the State and sharing in the advantages which the country affords. 'They object to it as such, and use their powers of diplomacy with the British -Government to bring about a disallowance of the legislation. To say that the Japanese people will not be fully cognizant of the fact that we are endeavouring to legislate against them as a race and as a people, and that we are endeavouring only to secure a knowledge of our language, is a position which I confess I do not understand. I give the Japanese credit for having a -greater amount of knowledge and intelligence than to be deceived by such a pretence. I desire to enter my protest against this roundabout method of dealing with this matter, and to signify that it is my intention of those who believe in the British-speaking to give my support to the straight-out and straightforward method. I will undertake to bear my share of any blame that may attach to this course. I will leave those who prefer the other course to justify themselves before the electors of the Commonwealth, whom they told they were coming here to legislate, not for a high standard of knowledge in languages, but for a "" white Australia."" possible for the Prime Minister of England to listen to the debates in the first Parliament of Australia, he would realize, think, as we do, that above all the questions that have brought us together, this question of a "" white Australia,"" is one on which there I believe the Japanese is the greatest degree of unanimity. AVe have the Parliament absolutely unanimous in thinking that we should take a stand as a young nation on new lines-that we should profit by the experience of other countries, particularly the experience of the great federated States of America, which from their initial mistake have a trouble facing them which is puzzling the best minds and intellects amongst their great people. The United States people have some 13,000,000 of a coloured race in their midst, and they do not know what to do with them. The best minds of their statesmen seem incapable of formulating a programme or a proposal that is calculated to effectively deal with these aliens, who appear in many cases to have become more degraded since they were made free than they were under slavery. I do not wish to dwell on that phase of bhe question, but to say that the Australian people, I am glad to realize, are awake on bhis question. In the addresses that were delivered on various platforms, throughout Australia during the agitation to bring aboutfederabion, bhis alien question was a prominent topic, and it was the question particularly which caused us to wait until Queensland could be persuaded to join in the Pederation. AVe understood that that colony, as it was then termed, suffered more from the influx of Kanakas, Japanese, and other undesirable aliens than did any of the other colonies. The Australian people have emphatically said that they are going to give a chance to those who will come after us, bo build up a civilized nation which we hope will set an example-as indeed we have already done in the shape of advanced legislation-to the rest of bhe world. I am one race as having a mission. I realize the great advantages we possess in being part of our greab Empire, and I am proud of our connection with Great Britain. I do not want to be understood as forgetting blie connection for one moment-, but I want also to remember that we are a self governing people-that Britain has said bo us-""You are bo have a Constitution under the Crown, but you are to practically",38,Mcmillan H E Took A Lot Will Come Up Again I F They Do Not Give I T

The honourable and learned member for In d i has indicated another amendment under which a resolution would have to be passed by both Houses of Parliament. Whilst the object could be attained more quickly by a Bill, that would be a declaratory act by the Government of the Commonwealth through the Parliament. But would that declaration not be cabled to Japan? What is bhe difference between a resolution of that kind, which names the nation, and the proposal of the honourable member for Bland? carried only at a dangerous time. That is another objection. amendment of the honourable and learned member for Indi were passed, then, as soon ns the measure received tlie Governor General's assent, Parliament would pass a resolution. If that is not to be the case, what is the good of the amendment 1 I admit the weight of what has been urged in favour of the Bill especially by the Attorne\'-General, but the only argument brought forward was that the language test would be the quickest way of dealing with this matter. I am quite conscious that the Prime Minister has said he would prefer the straight-out method ; and practically there is no division of opinion regarding the amendment. The Government believe that to be the best course, the only difference of opinion being on the point of time. Unless the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Indi, if carried, were acted upon as soon as the assent to the Bill was given, we should be acting treacherously to the country which sent us here to legislate in this matter at the earliest opportunity. If they have vent our acting on the amendment the moment the Bill becomes law. the honourable and learned member for In d i had better support the amendment of the honourable member for Bland, seeing that the difference between the two proposals is not sufficient to make it worthwhile to take the roundabout way. We should not be acting honorably, if, after passing a resolution of the kind in both Houses, we failed to notify the countries concerned. Wouldi t not be our duty to immediately cable to Mr Chamberlain that we had declared that the aboriginal natives of Asia,-becaus e we should include all those people were undesirable immigrants, and that we were not going to allow them to land ? 1 Mr Chamberlain would have to notify those nations; and where I ask is the difference between the proposals 1 If we carried the amendment of the honourable member for Bland the Imperial Government would be able to say"" A t the beginning of their national life they have dealt with this question, and have passed a law which is best suited to their conditions, and which declares straight out that they will not allow these undesirable immigrants to enter their shores."" When the British Government had once explained why such action had been taken the matter would have euded. Tf Japan wished to deport her population here she might possibly make a little fuss, but I have not heard of anything to justify the assumption that Japan would take up any such attitude. Perhaps we have been making too much of Japan. Because China is a somewhat weaker power than we thought her to be a few years ago it is often urged that she constitutes less of a menace to Australia than does Japan. In my judgment, however, we have greater cause for apprehension from China than from Japan. That danger arises chiefly from the fact that China is being cut up and dismembered. We know that already there is a British sphere of influence in China, but we do not know that a portion of China, in a few years, may not have become British. Another source of danger is in India.

I do not think that many Japanese have a desire to come here. .But I would point out that the Syrians and Hindoos are gradually creeping in. They are not sent here by the Governments of their own countries, but they are coming here in units. The greater our population, the greater will be the proportion of these undesirables who will come here unless the door is closed upon them. I regret very much that the Government have not shown greater courage in dealing with this question, because I believe that it would be wise to deal with it in the straight-out manner proposed by the honourable member for Bland. The Prime Minister has said that if the test imposed in this Bill proved to be insufficient we could go further. To my mind, it would be just as well to settle the matter right away. is important that we should look at it from the point of view of our self-governing powers. government or we are not to have it . It has not been shown that England will get into any complication with any country if we adopt the proposal of tlie honourable member for Bland. I can quite understand that negotiations may have to be entered into, and that we may have to explain why this great section of the Empirea section which the Imperial authorities have had to appeal to for help in time of great trouble and difficulty-desire s that Australia shall be kept white. I believe that the British Government would readily consent to our accomplishing our purpose in what we believe to be the most effective way. Let us say at the birth of the nation that we are going to adopt that course which is calculated to give our people the best possible opportunity. What is the aim of all legislation but to make the conditions of life as good as we can? If we are not to have a measure of this kind, I do not think it worthwhile working for social reform any longer, because all such reform would be nullified by the deterioration of the race. would so lower the aggregate standard of the community that in a very short time social legislation would be ineffective. But, if we keep the race pure, and build up a national character, we shall become a highly progressive people of whom the British Government will be prouder the longer we live and the stronger we grow. I do not think that the Imperial authorities would hesitate to give their assent to a straight-out proposal to close the door to those people who would degrade our national character, lower the standard of the energy and capacity of our people, and thus weaken the Empire itself. The Hindoos have shown themselves to be friends of England; and some of our best fighting material has come from India. But I refuse to believe that if these coloured men were living here they would maintain our present living wage. The lack of welding together, owing to the differences between their ideas and instincts and our own would be a permanent obstacle to its maintenance. I hope that the committee will carry the amendment of the honourable member for Bland, as I feel confident that no difficulty will arise from the adoption of that course. one of those unfortunates who were not able to address the House upon the second Either we are to have selfreading of this Bill. I therefore avail myself of the broad spirit of this particular clause to address to the committee the arguments that I should have used had 1 been present during the second reading debate. I am very much afraid that the remarks I intend to make will seem exceedingly heterodox after the very continuous flow of advocacy for a white Australia, and for tlie necessity for taking up a very strong attitude towards the Imperial Government in this connection. There has been a good deal said about a determination to keep Australia white and pure, two phrases which I am bound to say I have not been able to clearly understand after all the speeches which I have heard and all the newspaper articles which I have read. I think that this measure is a very important one, but I do not regard it as important for all. tlie reasons which have been given by many honourable members. I think it is important in this respect, that the debate on this great question-and it is a great question-and the results of this debate will constitute a sort of mirror in which we, as a people, The influx of these aliens can be seen by other nations, because for 1 the first time in Australian history we are put to the test to demonstrate our sincerity in using so many glib phrases which though they apply admirably when they involve concessions by other people, yet seem to change their meaning altogether the moment they involve concessions to be made to others.

The history of this measure is a singular one, and under other circumstances I might have been mclined to give my vote silently without speaking upon the matter ; but at present the question is in rather a strange position. The Government have introduced a measure which proposes an educational test in one language, that of England; and if that Bill were before the House for its second reading, I should have no hesitation in voting against it. I think that to have established a single test in a single language -that being our own-for the whole world, would have undoubtedly made us the laughing-stock of Europe. We should have, been the butt of the whole civilized world if it were shown that we Australians had deliberately legislated to shut out of Australia all Europeans who could not pass an examination in our own language. The whole question, however, is very much broadened by the suggestion that the test should be a European one; but I see a difficulty even in that case. I greatly respect the good opinion and friendship of the Japanese people, and I recognise that, by mentioning the names of European nations and not mentioning Japan, we are significantly differentiating the Japanese from the Europeans. It is recognised that thousands of Japanese already speak the English language, which is taught universally in their schools; so that in making the test English we are really not excluding the educated Japanese at all. Therefore, it comes to this-that if we are to choose between adopting a European test and thus appearing to exclude the Japanese, and adopting the English test, so as not to differentiate Japanese from European powersI should prefer to seem to exclude the Japanese, knowing f u l l well that they who are educated would have a. chance of coming in as well as the educated of other races. These, however, are not the three alternatives before the committee. The amendment proposing a European test comes from the honourable member for Melbourne ; but the honourable and learned member for Indi has made a further suggestion which has taken the form of an amendment that the languages should not be I am not named at all. member will allow me, I would explain that my amendment proposes that any persons, or class or description of persons,-who are declared by joint resolution of the two Houses of Parliament to be prohibited immigrants, shall be prohibited. able, and learned member's amendment would have tlie effect of limiting instead of extending the provisions of the Bill.

I have no sympathy with that whatever, and therefore, with these four choices before us, I am bound to say that until some of the amendments winch will give greater scope to the Japanese are put into shape, my disposition, is to favour the European educational test, because I am satisfied that a large proportion of the Japanese people are able to speak our language, or would be able to qualify themselves to come within the European test. It is very difficult to know, out of tlie multiplicity of proposals which have thus been made, what is to be the ultimate question put",42,Mcmillan H E Took A Lot Will Come Up Again I F They Do Not Give I T

99,Mr Bruce Smith,"The furtherbefore the committee; and I think that we have very good reason to complain of the want of definiteness on the part of the Government in regard to this matter. Although we have become a little demoralized in the Australian States with regard to the leadership of parties, I think that in this Parliament we are entitled to expect some element of leadership in the Government. I do not know to which proposal the Government will attach most importance. We were told by the Prime Minister that one aspect of the Bill was v it a l ; but when he was put to the test by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne he explained that he meant "" v it a l to tlie Bill, "" which I understood to of another country shall enter indicate a distinction between the vitality of the Bill and the vitality of the Government.

As I have pointed out, I consider that the proposed English test, if adopted, would make us the laughing stock of Europe. It is not by what we mean, but by what we say, in our Acts that we shall be judged; and for it to go forth to the world or to Europe that we, the people of Australia, are declaring at this initial stage in our history, that no citizen our ports unless he can pass an examination in our own language, would, as I have said, make us the butt of the civilized world. , The European test has this disadvantage, that, whilst it announces to the world that we are open to receive the people of any European nation, it differentiates one of the most civilized races of the race good reason to complain that wo I accept the be better to provide that the test shall be a",44,Mcmillan H E Took A Lot Will Come Up Again I F They Do Not Give I T

104,Mr Bruc Esmith,"I am sure thatusing that -word, and I repeat that the B ill in its original form was a highly hypocritical measure, because it must have been clear to every one who heard the speech of the Prime Minister that, although on the face of the Bill, the English language was made the test as to whether certain peoples should be allowed to enter the Commonwealth of Australia, the measure was intended to apply not to Europeans at all, but merely to Asiatics and other coloured races. I say again that the B ill as introduced was hypocritical in form, and to a. great extent its form is still hypocritical. Whilst we are professing a profound anxiety tibout the educational qualifications of people who may come to our shores, the foundation of the Bill is racial prejudice, and the desireI will not say tlie fear, though the word "" fear "" has entered largely into some of the speeches which have been made-that some other races who by reason of their possessing certain qualities, which I think come under the category of old-fashioned virtues, shall not comehere and be a menace to our industrial System. The Attorney-General has gone so far as to say-and I think it a humiliating confession-that the principal reason for shutting out the Japanese race is, not that they are a low type of humanity or a degraded people, but that they are too thrifty. They work too hard, and they are too provident, and they possess so many of those old-fashioned virtues that we Britishers cannot compete with them in, our daily life. That is one of the things which, I think, would be best left unsaid. I think it is a humiliating confession to go forth to the world from one in so high a position that the truth is that we are afraid to come into contact and competition with a race like the Japanese. standard of living. I was careful to explain that. general statement, which has been detailed by other honourable members. What is this inferior standard of living? The statement means that these people live at less expenditure than we do. I think it will be generally admitted that amongst the old fashioned virtues were economy, thrift, sobriety, and simplicity of living. I recognise that there is an economic side to the question which makes these people objectionable, but I leave that for the present. 15 K tue to work for sixteen hours a day. men do not differentiate between acts which may be prevented by legislation of another character, and qualities which are inherent in another people, and on that account make them such great opponents. We hear great complaints of tlie dirty, filthy, and insanitary conditions under which the Chinese live ; but every one knows that to live in that condition is not peculiar to the Chinese. We know what tlie condition of things was in Sydney three or four years agoa condition of things which was said to give rise to the plague, and which was of such a disgraceful character that words could hardly describe it. Nor was that condition of things referable only to the.. Chinese quarter of the city. I want to befair to these people. It is so easy to point, to a hovel in a Chinese garden, and to say,.. ""That is the condition in which thesepeople live."" When that statement is made it is only fair to point to the slums of. many of our t i g cities, and to ask whether many of those of a low type of our own race who are living there are living under better conditions than the Chinese. The insanitary condition which we complain of among these people does not involve the carrying of a measure of this k in d ; it could be equally easily remedied by the passing of local Acts requiring persons to properly drain their premises, to keep their habitations in a fit condition, and generally to live amid surroundings equal to those of the most reputable of the British raGe living near them. That could be done in mere self-defence.. We recognise that it is a most allowable precaution to prevent other people from, menacing our health by the manner in . which they live. It is also possible to limit the hours during which these people shall: work. It is all very well for the honorable and learned member for Indi to say in an ad captimdwn way"" These people work sixteen hours a day."" I work sixteen hours a day during a great many of the days of my l if e ; but we know thattheworkingclasses are limited in their hours of labour in order to distribute the work more widely among them. Therefore, in that respect, these people could be dealt with.

I say that the public ought to hear those phrases; because they ought to know how far this sort of legislation is founded on hysteria, and how much it is founded on good sense and good reasons. I should have voted against this Billi n its original form, because if it had been honestly placed upon our statute-book it would have meant that some of the most eminent men of Europe would have found themselves barred from entrance to our country, unless we actually "" winked a t "" a breach of the Act, and allowed them to come in. Honourable members know very well that there are hundreds and thousands of not merely educated, but cultured and. distinguished, men in Europe who can speak no more of the English language than the majority of us can speak of German or French. I venture to say that if we were put to the test of correctly writing out 50 words of French, a very small number of us could do it . TheB ill in its original form would have meant that a member of the French Academy, a German professor, or an Italian cardinal would have found it impossible to enter Australia except by leave of a Customhouse officer or with a passport from the Government. applied! That is the hypocritical part of the proposal to which I object. Whilei t is said the English test should be the test, the honourable and learned member himself is aware that it was never intended, even if the B ill passed, to apply thetest to the people of other European nations who come under the heading of civilized people. against the test, as being hypocritical. to hear that. I was the only member who at that time thought fit to use the word, but I am. very glad to find, now that it has been used, that a great many others are of the same mind, although they did not so express themselves. The Billi n its present form:-if I may so refer to it-wit h the European test, is not hypocritical, because it says, as plainly as words can say, that any European language is a sufficient test if a man desires to come into our midst. And it also plainly says that none shall come within the Commonwealth who cannot pass that European test. There is no great hypocrisy about t h a t ; ' t h e hypocrisy lay in the fact that it was intended to admit the people of European countries although they could not pass the test which the Bill provided. But if we say plainly that we will admit anybody who can pass a test in a European language, a great part of the hypocrisy is gone, and we have a Bill which honestly says what the people of Australia mean. I asked the right honourable gentleman who introduced the Bill whether he hod considered what the original term meant, -because I do not think it can be doubted that, apart from our making ourselves the laughing-stock of Europe, if we had persisted in the Billi n its original form we should have found ourselves in a very awkward predicament had some other European nation reciprocated the treatment accorded to them. If France or Germany had been so eccentric, and so wanting in level-headedness, as to say they would reciprocate, I should like to know what sort of attitude we should have adopted on finding ourselves treated in exactly the same way as we proposed to treat those nations. I therefore made a further observation at the time by asking the Prime Minister whether he had considered what would be the possible effect upon us as a people if we received reciprocal treatment from some of the older countries If the test were of Europe? Now, there is another aspect of this measure as it stands to which I will refer; and I think I am quite justified in criticising the B ill in its original form. A t present, the Government have not given a distinct statement as to the respect in which the Bill is likely to be amended.

We are now in a session, the first in our history, which is literally choked with legislation. No one can doubt that the most important measures which are upon the notice-paper at the present time, are those measures which deal with the machinery of the Commonwealth. Already many questions are arising which the Federal Court of the Commonwealth will have to decide as between the States and the Commonwealth itself. Only within the last few days one has arisen of tremendous importance, with regard to the taking of the assets of the States by the Commonwealth. Yet while this B ill is being pressed on in deference to the wishes of a section of the House, this particular machinery Bill is not yet heard of, except through being placed on the notice-paper. learned member Acquisition Bill? tlie Judiciary Bill. I was pointing out that while we are in a session which is literally congested with measures for setting the machinery of the Commonwealth in motion, this Bill forced on us at a moment which is exceedingly premature, as I shall show. If we take the whole Commonwealth, and each of the States 15 K 1 indmdually, we shall find that this constant repetition of statements as to hordes of aliens coming into Australia is an exaggeration. We find that in different States, where' it is said we are being inundated with Asiatic nations, the people who are coming in can, as a matter of fact, almost be counted on one hand. Yet this Bil l has been forced on largely for political and electioneering purposes. Mi-. BRUCE SMITH Surely not j because honourable members know that they entered into undertakings at the last election that this measure should be forced on, and they are now only fulfilling their obligations to their It would have, exconstituencies. But whether these obligations were entered into with' a due regard to the business of the Commonwealth, and with due regard to the necessity of passing those Bills which are more essential to the progress of the Commonwealth, is another matter altogether. cause a large number of anticipated members give a variety of assurances to their constituents that certain measures which have a popular flavour about them shall be forced on in the first session, that is a justification for the House precipitating those measures when there are other matters of much more importance to be dealt with. I was referring to the Judiciary Bill, and saying that already many questions are arising between the . States and the Commonwealth which will call for the interference of the Federal Court of the Commonwealth ; but the B ill which is to constitute that court is not yet heard of. It is on the programme, but as things are going, I think honourable members will agree with me^ there is very little prospect of such a Bill being passed during this session. That Bill will therefore go on to the second year of the mean the Property history of this Parliament. Yet there is no court of appeal from the supreme courts of I am speaking of the different States-n o court to decide questions of State rights.

We have heard a great deal in the course of this debate about the Empire. It is a very large word, and has a very large atmosphere about it .

130,Mr Bruc Esmith,"I hope that mypartnership is it open to any one member of it to say, "" If I do not get my way I shall secede."" After all, although Australia is a large and important place, we shall have to put on a wider lens if we desire to understand the logic of the British Empire. It is not open to us to say, "" We do not like the action of those who are at the helm of the Empire, and therefore we propose to cut the painter."" That is the spirit which we have seen exhibited here a few years back; and although the phrase is not used much nowadays, I have heard it said, "" We must consider our position."" I think we should do well occasionally to look at this question. of Empire from the other point of view. I should like to ask honourable members to consider what the Empire has done within the last two or three years. I remember when the gentleman at the head of the Opposition used a most eloquent illustration of that idea in one session of the Convention when he said that the British Empire was a whispering gallery, and pointed out that the smallest complaint from its outskirts reached the ceutre and found a sympathetic echo there. I say that the British Empire is as nearly as possible a complete organism, so that if we affect any part of its outskirts, there is immediately a communication with the nerve centre in England, tind we get a return action which endeavours to correct the injury. We have experience of this only the other day-eve n to-day-in connection with the Transvaal war. There was a body of British citizens, contributing no taxation whatever to the Empire, whose liberties were being infringed by another people; and that Empire has added one-third to its national indebtednessa sum of £200,000,000-in order to enforce the granting of those rights of free citizenship. That is surely a generous sort of action ; and I think that we should do well to reflect upon these things when we speak thoughtlessly of what we owe to the Empire, and act as if we were under no obligation to it . We must remember, when we are attempting to do something which we are told iu the most pleasant way possible would be inimical to the interests of the Empire, that it is our duty to consider whether we ought not to make some reciprocal sacrifice in order to facilitate the management of this enormous national proprietary which stretches right round the world. We are told very plainly in connection with this question that certain countries in the Pacific are in such a position that their friendship is essential to the easy working of Imperial affairs. Isi t not our duty, seeing what the Empire has done for other British citizens in other parts of the world, to take into consideration those difficulties, and at least to cultivate a mood in which to make some sacrifices in the interests of that great Empire? ,AVe are called upon at this time to do that. I know that there is a very natural tendency on our partstanding here as we do in comparative security-to exclaim, "" What does it matter to us ? We want the people of this country to be pure and white; and although other parts of the Empire have suffered by the incursion of these Asiatic races, we are going to start afresh, so that we may stand out from the rest of the world as a specially selected race of people."" That is a very fine ideal, but, like a great many ideals, it may not be practicable. I venture to say that it is not practicable if we have a due regard to the interests of the Empire, of which after all, though we have a very large territory, we form a very smallpart from the point of view of population. I should like to say that I am so deeply impressed with the obUgations which Australians are under to the Empire as a whole that I cannot conceive of any circumstances which would justify us in speaking lightly of the Imperial connection. I would ask honourable members for a moment to allow me to name some of the difficulties involved in this question, when looked at from an Imperial point of view. Looking more closely than one usually does to the constitution of the Indian Empire, I find that the British Government are practically supervising the government of 45 provinces under 45 different Indian princes. These 45 princes are exercising individual control over their general peoples. They have 50,000,000 people under them. These 45 separate communities comprise, as a whole, twelve or thirteen times the population of the Commonwealth of Australia. Cannot honourable members recognise the diplomatic difficulties to be dealt w it h in this connection alone? Outside of these 50,000,000 people, there are a further 230,000,000 in India with whom the Imperial authorities have to deal. A l though every honourable member may not realize it, there is a very large proportion of these Indian subjects who are as highly educated as ourselves. I find that at least 18,000,000 recorded in authoritative either ""literate"" number represents nearly -five times the population of this Commonwealth. original form this Bill was going to indiscriminately bar the whole of these people admission to this country. that it is desirable that they should all be allowed to come here-. I sympathize with the desire to keep a large preponderating portion of Australia as British as it is at the present time. WhatI want to avoid is the hysterical treatment of this question -ther e were 36,000 Dutch people ; that in I have no desire to see low-class Indians, Chinamen, or Japanese, generally known as coolies, swarming into this country. It would be a menace to our peace and good government. part to deal with this question in such a way that we do -not unnecessarily offend the educated nations which are likely to be of great assistance to us in the future. doubt for a moment the importance of a friendly British Empire and the Japanese and Chinese people ? Honourable members may think little of the Chinese at the present time, because they have just emerged so badly from a war with a community of the nations of Europe. the wonderful recuperative powers of a nation is afforded by the case of Japan. We know already that they have resolved to apply Western methods to the government of China, and as we understand the enormous wealth of the country, who can doubt that before the world is very much older the Chinese will stand in a position almost as important, and almost as influential as that occupied by the Japanese at the present time ? That is the position that tlie British Government to take into consideration, because we-know that there is great rivalry between the European nations as to which of them shall stand best with these Eastern peoples in the case of future trouble in the East. Honourable members will recollect what a magnificent and dramatic effect was produced on the-statesmen of Europe only 25 years ago, by the action of Lord Beaconsfield in bringing a regiment of Indian troops from India and landing them at Malta, thus clearly indicating to European nations that that was merely a sample of what we could Mr Bruce Smith. do to supplement our British forces in the of the Indian people are event of any trouble arising. We all recolworks as being lect that, and to recollect that incident is to or ""learned."" That realize-to a mind that has any imagination at all-the immense utility of our friendIn its ship with these Eastern peoples. Now, will honourable members consider for a moment that one of the difficulties of the Empire lies I do not say in the fact that we have in Canada fo deal with 1,500,000 of French people; that in the Mauritius we have 250,000 French colonists; that in the Transvaal, before the war-and no doubt avery large proportion of them will be there afterwards the Orange River Golony, before the war, there were 70,000 Dutch people; and that in the Cape Colony there were 370,000 Europeans, a large proportion of whom But there is an obligation on our speak the Dutch language. One has only to consider for a moment these figures, and what they indicate, to realize the classes of those immense importance of considering the interests of the Empire as a whole when we Who can are dealing with legislation of this kind. And then as to the actual power of feeling existing between the these Eastern peoples: I find that at the present time Japan, with a population of 44,000,0001 am taking the figures of 1899-ha s a regular army of 125,000, with reserves numbering 280,000; that she has 31 ships of war-fou r of them But evidence of the most modern in the world-rangin g from 3,000 tons up to 1.2,000 tons, and travelling at the rate of from 11 to .24 knots per hour. sury. member has reminded me of a fact I am very glad to mention. Although Japan has a population of 44,000,000, and has accomplished all the work that I have mentioned, have she has a smaller national debt than the State of New South Wales. the financial condition of Japan is such that it has been able to undergo this enormous transformation from its previous primitive state into a condition similar to that of Western nations, without adding to its national debt a greater sum than is now owed by New South Wales. than that of Holland. the facts stated show at once immense",49,Mcmillan H E Took A Lot Will Come Up Again I F They Do Not Give I T

I should like to examine for a moment what I may call the moral ground upon which this Bil l and the agitation which has preceded it has been built up. We are told that the great desideratum in view is purity of race; but I should like to know whether we British people are the most entitled to talk of such things. I think I am right when I say that there is no race on tlie face of the earth that is of a more mixed character than the British race. about the purity of the race. In my desire to centuries the recognised and inherited worship of be perfectly fair I do not hesitate to say right has gone on strengthening ; and so strong is that the Chinese and the Japanese and the the feeling that to hint to them that right Indians are in the strict sense of the term must be supported by might excites somepurer as a race than are the British sovereign to subject, and man to man, have been or the American peoplesI say that so long authoritatively acknowledged and defined advisedly.

Although these facts are rather historical and academic than practical, they should appeal to the minds of those who have laid so much stress upon the purity of the British race. Now looking at the moral aspect of this question, I should like to read an extract from a book published this year by one of the greatest living authorities on China, namely Sir Robert Hart, Inspector-General of Chinese Customs, a man who has spent a large part of his life in China, and who is fully acquainted with tlie people. His expression of opinion only shows how wide of the mark theaverage Britisher is in condemning the Chinese as an immoral and degraded people. This book was published as late as this year. In it Sir RobertH a r t says : The Chinese.are a proud, some say a conceited people, but they have very good reasons for their pride, and their conceit has its excuses. Far away from the rest of the world, they have been living their own life, and developing their own civilization ; while others have been displaying what humanity may attain to with a revealed religion for its highest law, and a Christ for its pattern, they have been exhibiting what a life a race may rise to and live, without either. The central idea of them all is filial rjiety ; reverence for seniority, intensifying with every generation that has transmitted it , settles all the details of family, social and national life. Instead of "" Commit no nuisance,"" the placard on tlie wall says "" Respect thvself."" They are pre-eminently I am talking a reasonable peopfe, and when disputes occur, it is the appeal to right that solves them. For thirty thing more than amazement.

142,Mr Bruc E Smith,"Anothe r aspectwhich cannot be generally sented by tonnage, entering and clearing, is 39,000,000, and I should like honourable members to realize that outof this 39,000,000 tons 23,000,000 tons per annum is trade with the British people-only tons with the Japanese and only 3,000,000 tons with the Germans. So that 61 per oent. of the trade of China is transacted with the British people, and it can be easily understood why the Imperial is anxious not to do anything that would unnecessarily alienate the friendship of these people. We should seek to restrict immigration to the very best class of these Eastern people by a politic and statesmanlike course : to avoid deliberately insulting those whose friendship may be of the utmost importance to us in our future history. to say a word or two is the alleged danger to Australia arising from the present state of affairs. I have already said that we have been inundated with statements as to the immediate stands, and the urgency of this measure have had the advantage of looking at the figures of which I have spoken, and I should like to point out the condition of things in the Northern Territory-one with regard to which we have heard the loudest and most hysterical cries.

I find that in Western Australia the arrivals during the last two years were 29, while rate. the departures were 83. In Queensland there were 206 arrivals, and 584 dethe return enables me only to partures during the same period.

145,Mr Bruce Smith,"Yes; I bake bheJapanese from the three States of Western Australia, Queensland, and New South Wales for the last two years -were 390 ; so that the Japanese, as far as one can ascertain, have been leaving these three States at the rate of 195 per annum, during the last two years, instead of coining into it . Turning to Dr. Maxwell's report-which , perhaps, all honourable members have not had an opportunity of reading, because we get such an enormous mass of reading matter put before us-wha t do we find him writing with regard to the Kanaka? Although the Kanaka is dealt with under a separate Bill, I claim tlie right of speaking of him as forming part of that "" scourge and contamination"" to which one honourable member has referred. Dr. Maxwell states that as a result of white settlement there has been a decrease in the number of Pacific Islanders employed, yet a simultaneous expansion in sugar production. In 1885, according to his report, there were 10,755 Kanakas in Queensland ; in 1S90-fiv e years afterthere were only 9,689 ; while in 1899nine years after-ther e were only 8,826. 10,000 there. logical conclusion the fewer Kanakas we have, the more sugar we produce. 1885 and 1899, a period of 14 years, tlie Kanaka traffic, instead of being an increasing one, has been reduced by something like 1,900 people, although, as I shall show, sugar production has gone up from 100 to 150 or 200 per cent. This is what Dr. Maxwell says in the body of his reportI "" 1898, as it has already been stated, the number of white cane growers in Queensland was 2,610, with the production of sugar increased to 123,28!) tons, and the number of Pacific Islanders reduced to 8,826. The actual reduction in the number of Islanders is 1,929, but the relative reduction is not less than 60 per cent, from what it was in 1885, when the production of sugar at these respective periods is considered. The logical indications of tlie situation are that the South Sea Islander is a declining factor in sugar production in Queensland, and that the decline is due to a natural operating law, by reason of which tlie lower is being gradually substituted by a higher form, and by a higher standard of producing agencies in these locations where the laws or conditions of nature, such as climate, do not operate in tlie opposite direction. This law may be expected to continue to operate, and with continued and increasing results, providing it is uot checked through any device by which it may be sought to hasten the rate of movement of natural law. T think those figures make it quite clear to any one who approaches the report with an unbiased mind that at all events the Kanaka is a declining factor in Queensland. If honourable members acknowledge-as I have demonstrated-that such is tlie case, and that the arrivals over departures of all other Asiatic peoples in Australia are so infinitesimal as compared with onr enormous population and our increase of population, then I think they will see clearly that this measure is not only premature, but hysterical. It is hysterical because it is based upon an assumption, on the part of people who have not been able to look into these things for themselves, that we are in the presence of a menace to the purity of their national life, whereas the whole thing is a bogy, a scarecrow. I venture to say that a large part of the scare is founded upon a desire to make political capital by appealing to some of the worse instincts in some of the more credulous of the people. number of honourable, members who believe in it? them. I do not say that there are not many polifcicans, here and elsewhere, who are perfectly sincere in their advocacy of measures for the reduction of this immigration ; but I contend that, so far as a large number of the people are concerned, the cry is hysterical, and that political capital lies at the bottom of it. .1 do not want to be invidious or persona], nor do I apply my words at any particular section, but 1 do say that this scare has been used for political purposes.

152,Mr Brucesmith,"I always standwould take his own course. It is an extraordinary, and, to my mind, an entirely new state of things, that where a man is impressed with the fact that a certain condition of affairs is really vital to his country, vital to the purity of the race of which he is one, he should put that question of purity of the race aside and Mr SA WISES -The honourable and learned member said it was only a question as to the method. learned member. make a personal explanation 1 The honourable and learned member's excellent speech is marred by any attempt to misrepresent. I think he does not attempt to do so wilfully, but any one who heard me knows that what the honourable and learned member has imputed to me was as completely distant from my mind as anything could be. I asked the Government whether regarded this particular method of dealing with the difficulty as vital? The Prime Minister said he regarded it as vital to this Bill. An y oue understands what that means. I replied that, inasmuch as it was only vital to this particular Bill, I should vote in the way which, in my opinion, will best secure for us a "" white Australia."" than that, which I will explain later on. members who are acquainted with me know that I would never say or do anything to unnecessarily hurt the feelings of any honourable member. If I have misrepresented the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne in any way I offer him my apology most sincerely. I am bound to say that on the incorrect interpretation which it now appears I put upon what he said I was somewhat surprised. It did seem to me at the time that, although tlie honourable and learned member recognised that the condition of things against which this Bill is aimed really constituted a menace to this countiy, he was prepared to vote one way or the other, according -as the Government attached or did not attach party importance to the Bill.

I am very glad that he has removed from my mind what I thought an unfortunate utterance. I think I have said practically all that I desire to put before the committee. I am bound to add, however, that I have never yet been be permitted to satisfied as to what we really mean by a "" white Australia."" Whether we refer to colour or not I do not know. MrO ' MAXLEY It is the skin colour. by ethnologists to be a question of climate -and sunlight. If the tinge of colour is going to be made a ground for excluding people, or for treating them as subjects for exclusion, then they it is going to be a question of climate. I understand the sentiment to be, although it is not very clear, that, with regard to the Asiatic races, the African races, and the Pacific races, there is a desire on the part of theHouseto, at all events, very much limit their immigration if not to absolutely exclude them. I should like to say, as a practical politician, that I recognise these two elements of statesmanship. If there is a danger to a State, that is a very .good reason for interA l l honourable ference on behalf of tlie State. I recognise also another element, namely, the fear of danger. Although there may be no real grounds for danger, as I think there are no real grounds here, if you find the people permeated, so to speak, with a fear of danger, it becomesnecessaiy for all thoughtful men, who take part in the public affairs of the country, to put an end to-to allay that fear. A l though I believe that tlie fear is, to a great extent, imaginary at the present time-a t all events it is not an urgent danger-stil l on the .ground that there is a very widespread fear throughout Australia that the possibility of the advent of the Asiatic is a menace to our national prosperity and national happiness, I am perfectly willing to fall in line to some extent with the movement, and to assist, at all events, to allay that fear. I believe this Bill will do that. But I believe that it will be allayed in ""the most wise way by adopting a European test.

159,Mr Bruc E Smith,"That is admittedprepared to offer some other solution of the difficulty which, whilst allaying the fear, will keep oat tlie very worse class from which the fear arises, and at the same time having no effect which is calculated to slacken our hold of tlie centre of our great Empire, and to frustrate its attempts to stand in a friendly relation with the great nations of the East, I shall certainly favour the proposed amendment which makes the European test the one for admission to Australia. I shall certainly vote against the amendment for the complete prohibition of tbe Asiatic, African, and Pacific races, and I shall vote, as I said before, against the purely English test, because I think it would bring down upon us the ridicule of most civilized peoples. must express my regrets to the committee that I was unable to take part in the debate on the second reading of this measure. I shall speak now, important as the matter before us is, only if I can have the assurance of honourable members that they will not resent the fact that I wish to make some remarks on the question generally. Although speech should have been addressed to tlie second reading of .the measure, I feel that the matter before us is of such a grave character that honourable members will pardon me if I take some part in the debate on the clause and the amendment before the committee. .There is no doubt that in a way quite unusual, the spinal marrow of the matter before us is containedinthe clause or in the amendment to tlie clause which is to be submitted by the honourable member for Bland. I suppose there is not a single member of this Chamber who does not honestly desire to prevent the influx of a large number of the coloured races of the world. Even my honourable and learned friend, in spite of the philosophical manner which often does him great injustice, must, I am sure, in his inmost heart be capable of feeling as strongly as other .honourable members in this matter, if he Gould realize as vividly as others the gravity of the question. I do not think that any honourable member who views this as an urgent measure of legislation can justly be termed hysterical. think that if ever there was a subject during the years that have gone by, or during the first election for this Commonwealth Parliament, which excited more strongly and more universally than any other the feelings of the electors of Australia, it was the subject we are now dealing with.. I do not think I go far wrong when I say. that tlie Federal Government, realizing the strength of the feeling on this subject which existed throughout Australia, took care to put this matter in the very fore-front of their appeal for the support of the people of Australia. From that time down to the present, the Federal Ministry have lost no opportunity-and no one can blame themof emphasizing the position which they then took up. The Attorney-General has assured us that no question has occupied the attention of the Cabinet more frequently or more closely than this measure, which is so important that I wish as scrupulously as I can to avoid any remark which might seem to bear a tinge of party feeling. Honourable members on this side of the House know-eveiy one of them knows-that I have never dropped the slightest remark calculated to influence them as to any vote which may be .given or any views which may be expressed. I feel that upon these higher matters of national politics the less the sound of the party whip is heard the better. The fact my that so honourable and learned a member of the Opposition as the honourable member for Parkes made tlie speech which he has just made, is, I suppose, one of the strongest proofs we can give that there has been no party concert in connection with this matter. The speech made by tlie honourable member for AVentworth was made entirely without any sort of consultation with me. I had not the slightest knowledge of the line which the honourable member proposed to take, and, feeling as I do that I should endeavour to suppress any sort of party action, I never sought to influence his views in the matter at all. His speech was one which he delivered entirely on his own responsibility. I would like to ask the committee to remember that after all we are dealing with no new question. Fifty years ago this question was just as keenly to the front in our political agitations as it is to-day. When the gold-fields of Australia were discovered those of us who were then in this country can remember the thousands of I Chinamen who swarmed here. Do we not remember the legislation which was then passed 1 again in New South Wales and Queensland. In those days this legislation excited the",55,Mcmillan H E Took A Lot Will Come Up Again I F They Do Not Give I T

Then the friendly ally of Great Britain was not Japan, but China; and the Secretary of State in a despatch in 1877 expressed his deep regret that a colonial legislature should feel called on to pass an Act excluding the subjects o a friendly power. I have the greatest possible feeling of indulgence for the spirit which animates British Ministers in viewing measures of this sort with disfavour. cast in the mother country, we should feel more at liberty to indulge the larger feelings of philanthropy than we feel here in Australia under the actual conditions of the future as they lie before us. Let us imagine for tlie moment that in the United nearly five per cent, of the population consisted of coloured races from Asia, that some 2,000,000 of Asiatics were settled in the United Kingdom. It strikes me that the feeling in the mother country would then become very much in touch with the feelings which we express in Australia to-day. Those who in Australia seem able to view this matter with much calm indifference would, I think, if the matter were brought closer home--if they were living near some Chinese den, and their children were exposed to any sort of contact the persons to whom I refer-find all their stoicism would gave way, and that it was not altogether a matter of ""climate and sunshine."" -we may, compared with the Chinese, be a most uneducated and vicious people-but whatever we are we have fully made up our minds that the current of Australian blood shall not assume the darker hues. This is not a matter on which there is any room for discussion. That has been the feeling of the people right through, and no man can misunderstand it. There is not a single man who can sit in this House and say that he is a representati ve of the people of Australia while he does not share these That being the state of the case, I come to the Bill which the Minister has submitted. I cannot sufficiently express in guarded language the indignation I feel at the method adopted by the Government in making this matter wear an aspect which it should never be made to assume. find it right some day to draw this line sharply; at present it is only a colour line. There is no man at present who wishes to ban the races which inhabit the continent of Europe, because some of the best settlers Mr Beid. throughout Australia are men who have come from these European nations. But the Government have put this Federal Parliament in what seems to me a most odious position before the world, when by this measure they have proclaimed to the world that their policy is that not one of these highly civilized nations who share our blood, after all, to a very large extent are to be If our lot were allowed to come to Australia; that unless they can satisfy some Custom official as to the degree of knowledge they possess of a language which is not their own, Australia is debarred to them. I cannot too strongly deplore the fact that the Federal GovernKingdom ment have taken such an extreme course. There is, I believe, an A ct in Western Australia in which such a provision is contained. tralia has such a provision. Australian Bill was not proceeded with. South Australia, but was thrown out. The Prime Minister in his speech quoted as a precedent that in Western Australia an with Act was passed in 1897 which set out that a that prohibited immigrant should includeAny person who, when asked to do so, fails to We may be an inferior race write out in the characters of any language of Europe a passage in English of 50 words in length, taken by the officer from a British author, and append his name in his own language. characters of any language of Europe. is perfectly right. It does say "" in the characters of any language of Europe a passage in English of 50 words."" ThatI presume is a double sort of test. An English official reads an English passage, sentiments. and the unfortunate Frenchman or German has to put it into another language. That is rather a wonderful, test. It is what I call a double-barreled prohibition. It is bad enough even for some of us to have to write our own language from dictation, but if we were asked to put into French on the We may spur of the moment some English read by a Customs officer, I think we should all have to be expatriated. This seems to be the source of the unhappy inspiration which has led the Federal Government to put into a Bill of this sort such a narrow and unstatesmanlike clause.

169,Mr Reid,"My right honourable friendJapan! Isi t not a remarkable thing that. Ministers are so permeated with a feeling of delicacy for the susceptibilities of the Mikado of Japan that they flaunt the whole of Europe in. this contemptuous fashion? Isi t not singular that they flaunt all the races of Germany, France, Russia, Austria, and Italy, because the Prime Minister has laid it down that a knowledge of English is to be indispensable ? According to Hansard, page 3500, the Prime Minister saidThe chief difference between this Bill and the provisions of tbe Acts to which I have referred is that the English language is indispensable, and the words must be dictated by the officer. I have had no hesitation in regard to making the English language indispensable. such thing as the English language. It is the British language. and learned friend will not celebrate his recovery by interrupting me just now. Prime Minister goes on to sayI do not see what claim there is on the part of any one seeking admission, who may be undesirable, to choose the language in which his test shall be taken. Here is an indispensable test-a n English test-which , it seems to me, offers an unnecessary insult to the nations of Europe. I do not suppose that they will take the slightest notice of it . I do not suppose that they will ever hear of it . I do not suppose that tlie Mikado will ever hear of some of the speeches which have been made against the Japanese. I really think there is a trace of hysteria in the awful diffidence which His Majesty's Ministers feel in legislating against the influx of Japanese. It strikes me that Japan like every other power in carrying out its policy, views large measures of national interest from the stand-point of national advantage. Why is there this friendly alliance between England and Japan, or between any other two nations ? Isi t a matter of sentiment ? Nothing of the sort. The fact is that it is supremely to the interests of these two great powers to keep a joint eye upon the movements of B.ussia in Asia. about the friendship between these two great powers as being at all imperilled by any legislation that we may pass with reference to the management of this Commonwealth is to intrude into tlie realm of hysteria. Great nations do not come to great resolves except for great things. Japan is the ally of England to-day on high grounds of national interest, just as if the interest of Japan changed to-morrow, she might not be the ally of England bub the ally of Russia. It seems to me that the hysteria of this matter is to throw over this momentous epoch in the history-making of Australia the shadow of these references to possible consequences to bhe mighb and interest of the British Empire. The treaty arranged between Great Britain and Japan seven years ago is an absolute exposure of the utter hollowness of all this talk. Notwithstanding all the hysterical fear which overshadows the minds of Ministers regarding tlie sentiments of the Mikado of Japan, there is a solemn treaty in existence between Great Britain and Japan, and in that treaty Japan expressly recognises the right of the -self-governing colonies of the British Empire to be exempt from its operations. In that treaty it was further provided that they should be open to make The treaties for themselves with the Mikado of Japan. What does that mean? It means the recognition by Japan herself that these colonies are self-governing communities, that they have the right to fashion their destiny as their Parliaments decide, and that if Japan wishes to have a treaty or understanding with Ausbralia or Canadaand the smallest dependency, Newfoundland, is not omitted-in reference to matters of mutual concern, such treaty is to be arranged between the British self-governing colonies concerned and the Government of Japan. There is thus in the Japanese treaty a recognition of a sound broad constitutional principle, which ought never to be forgotten. What did the grant of self-government mean to the colonies of Australia 50 years ago? It absolutely meant that blie momenb Parliaments were erecbed in bhese soubhern lands, bhey carried with them all the ordinary rights of legislation in matbers within their own province, which are possessed by the Imperial Parliament. Of course, bhere is the Royal assent needed to our measures just as the Royal assent is required to blie measures of the To talk Imperial Parliament, no more and no less. Therefore, we know that our legislation is subject to the risk, as is the legislation of the British House of Parliament, of being vetoed.

Let it be done. Exactly that course was taken, and I was a party to it, only a few years ago. I wish to do full justice to myself in regard to that matter, and I think it is a proper subject for me to refer to. As these States grow, different phases of the same great trouble arise. Until ten years ago, tlie great danger which Australia apprehended was in regard to an influx of the Chinese. travelled since then, and we have come to see that it is not enough to exclude the Chinese, and that the principle be pushed further. ence in 1896, over which I presided,it was unanimously agreed that the legislation with reference to the Chinese should be extended to all coloured races, and a Bill was introduced and passed in the New South Wales After the session of the Federal Convention in the early part of 1897, some of us went a conference There is no doubt whatever that the result of that conference was that another measure was introduced into the New South Wales Parliament some little time afterwards providing as a test tlie knowledge of a European language, and passed. But now let me draw a distinction between the position then and the position to-day. We were then on the brink of the Federal union-the met, although it had not concluded its labours. this problem was and always will be the most serious, although it joined with us in the declaration I refer to, stood out. The Premier of Queensland the conference, but his colony was represented by other Ministers, and he practically disowned what his colleagues had done, with the Japanese thus exercised cause the right to make a treaty is the prerogrative of independent That right has been recognised by the British Government and by the Japanese Government, in connection with the instrument I have referred to. This treaty was passed. So far as New South Wales was concerned, the problem was a comparatively Mr Reid. simple one. I go absolutely with the Government in saying that proper loyal If we statesmanship should induce us to proceed as nearly as we can on the lines of Imperial convenience in our legislation. I do not blame the Government for trying to do that, and as far as I was concerned I recognised that obligation. It was not a matter of grave urgency to New South Wales, because Queensland had made its own arrangement with Japan, and as we were within reach of a federal union,, which alone could deal with this matter in a national way, I felt no sort of difficulty in Events have giving way so far as New South Wales was concerned. must measure was only tentative, any way. fectly clear; and I do not think I need take up much time in showing the vital difference between the position I occupied then as the head of the Government of New South Wales, and the position I occupy now in this Parliament upon those lines. Chamber as a member of the Federal Parliament which has to deal with the continent as a whole as well as with to England, and there had that part of the continent where all with Mr Chamberlain. the trouble and danger lies. The position is absolutely different, and, further, I say that whilst diplomacy and the requirements of diplomacy may often be studied with advantage, there are certain subjects upon which a people that claims to be respected must speak with a straightforward honourable voice. We are young at law-making, we are young at nation-building, but if we, convention had in dealing with the foundation stones of our national laws and institutions, trim with Queensland, the colony where the dexterity of diplomatists, we shall begin a line of legislation upon great affairs which will not enhance the character of Australia before the eyes of the world.

173,At The Sydney Confer,"Mr Reid -Yes, that was made perhoard Alfred Deakin, but we do not find him in the Bill-w e see him in the amendment. It is not because the Japanese are undesirable neighbours that the Attorney General objects to them, but because they are dangerous competitors, and why ? Partly because of their education. Does the Attorney General not know that the English language is now being taught in thousands of schools in Japan, and if the Bill is passed at it stands what sort of attitude shall we stand in with reference to the Japanese or other coloured races, whose members diligently study perhaps for years to qualify themselves to become residents of Australia ? When the current of those who can pass the Customs test thickens strongly enough, tlie Government tell us that they will use their prerogative powers to shut them out. We are told that this is one only of a chain of measures* But there is no sort of honourable statesmanship in putting upon our national statute-book a measure providing for admission to Australia upon passing a certain test, with the f u l l intention of destroying that facility if those to whom it is offered take advantage of it . That is a depth of Australian duplicity-and diplomacywhich I hope this Parliament will never descend to. If we cannot emulate all the virtues of the Japanese which have been so eloquently spoken of by the Attorney General, let us at least emulate them in the one little virtue of straightforward dealing between white, and yellow, and black. If the Government take up this position-that they have no sort of objection to the educated Japanese, or Chinese, or Polynesian-the y will be justified in voting for this Bill, because that is the principle they have embodied in the measure. But if they want the House to believe that, although they have put that principle in the Bill, they do not want the educated Japanese, and that they will not let them in if they come here in formidable numbers, then they are asking this House to legislate upon lines that are not usual in civilized Parliaments when dealing with foreign countries. That, I think, is a perfectly legitimate criticism. Do tlie Government intend to stand by that principle? Do they mean to say that if 5,000 highly cultured Japanese arrived here, and could honestly pass the test under the Bill, the Government would let them in? getting out of obligations. That is like the man who owed money, but said it did not matter, because his creditors would not turn up. If it would never occur, what is the use of the provision in the B i ll ? uneducated-the educated Japanese would not come here. we have a slight r if t in the lutea slight diversity of view of the Japanese as between the honourable member for New England and the Attorney-General. Tbe Attorney-General speaks straightforwardly, because he says, ""The JapaneseI am afraid of are not the ignorant, vicious, dirty, slovenly members of that race, but the industrious, virtuous, frugal, thrifty men."" Now, the honourable member for New England says that the latter class of Japanese will never come here, and between the two honourable members every one ought to be satisfied. to the list of qualifications. knows that the Japanese who can speak and write his own language correctly may be more highly educated than some of us ? Does not the honourable member see that the man who has learnt enough English to pass the Custom-house test may not be an educated man, whilst a Japanese who has not learned a word of English may be a highly educated man in his own country? According to this test no man can be an educated man unless he can talk 50 words of English according to the Custom-house officer's standard. The man who can squeeze through tlie test may be an uneducated man. But what I want to know is whether the Government intend to admit such of the coloured aliens as can pass the test. Ministerial assurance, I must admit that the Ministry stand on perfectly plain and straightforward ground, and that not one of the remarks which I have just been making would apply to such an attitude. I did not, however, understand the Attorney-General to say that, because he led us to believe that if the test proposed in the B ill did not prove stiff enough, the Government would adopt some more",59,Mcmillan H E Took A Lot Will Come Up Again I F They Do Not Give I T

181,Mr Reid,"If I am to take that as astringent measures, and that this B ill was only the first link in a chain of measures intended to achieve the desired result. Here we find the aim of the Government expressed by the Attorney-Generali n halfa-dozen words. A t pages 4S05-6 of Hansard, the Attorney-General speaks of what is really the object of the Government. He saysI t was for this reason that so much stress was laid on this issue, and it is for this reason that, since the Government took office, uo question has more frequently or more seriously occupied their attention, not only because of this one proposal now before the House, but with regard to executive acts that have beeu and will be necessary. hereafter may have important consequences arising out of our administration, as well as other measures which will be submitted to Parliament, all having in view the accomplishment of the same end. That end, put in plain and unequivocal terms, us the House and the country are entitled to have it put, means the prohibition of all alien coloured immigration. Now, there are the views of the Government. There is an express reference to executive acts, honourable members will observe. The only construction that can be put upon that statement is this-""We will apply this sham test. If it does not answer we will use our executive power. But we will do what our country expects us to do. We will prevent the alien coloured immigration at all cost."" Is that the policy of the Government ? Isi t the Government policy that if numbers of these coloured races pass this test they will be admitted ; or is it that if they show too strong a desire to come and pass the test the Government will take some other measure, either executive or legislative? choose; but I cannot put it too strongly that in dealing with these large matters we had better express the ""mind and intention of this Legislature. There must be a division on this occasion between those who feel it to be their duty to Australia to pass a clear and unmistakable law embodying the policy of the people of Australia, and those who take refuge in an expedient which has not even the merit of being politically honest unless it is intended as a means of admitting the educated coloured races to Australia. It is honest then. Ministry say-""This is our first weapon; if it is too blunt we will t r y another,"" then I say these methods are not for Australia yet, I hope. Buti t is for tlie committee to decide. learned member for Parkes spoke of our duty to make concessions for the Empire; he spoke of the feelings of the 50 semi-independent states of In d i a; of the people there; the rulers there; the millions there just as the Attorney-General did. Now, so far as I can read the trend of the policy of all these races, the great bulk of them are just as anxious to stay where they are as we are that they should. There is no sort of eagerness, so far as the great body of these races are concerned, to trouble us, but unfortunately in our present state of developmenta handful of people spread over a vast continent-the ordinary There have been determinations which immigration into this country of a number which would never be missed from amongst the millions of Asia would cause a serious race taint to Australia. Then my honourable and learned friend speaks of the small numbers. Can we not remember the time, not so long ago, when, instead of the great Anglo-Saxon young nation that we see on this continent, there was a mere handful of settlers on the shores of Port Jackson1 Can we not remember that the stream of immigration which has made us what we are to-day was in its first stages thin and disturbed ? And so with the movements of these great coloured races to-day. The tiniest rivulet that begins to-day to trickle from Asia to Australia may become a mighty power to-morrow. What a painful zeal that was which saw that every little stone in the dykes of Holland was in its place, be-' cause the tiniest r if t of that system of dykes might cause universal ruin and devastation; and we here, who have grown to this stage It is for the committee to to-day, cannot forget our past so thoroughly as not to see that the tiny coloured streams of humanity that are coming into this great continent from those mighty races near us mean something that we ought to guard against. A t any rate let us be honest and straightforward, and in our great measures of legislation say the thing we mean. As far as the British Empire is concerned, I venture to say that just as in all its might and its majesty it has managed to remain free and united with all its different races, each living in its own realms, so it will never be so strong as when If the it adds to its strength the strength of an Anglo-Saxon Australia. I feel that there are times when a man ought to forget, if he can, the political trammels which confine him. There are times when a man The honourable and owes some duty to those who send him",60,Mcmillan H E Took A Lot Will Come Up Again I F They Do Not Give I T
182,Mr Reid,"here, and if we are nob prepared to do our duty on this occasion, then I think that the prospects of useful legislation ab the hands of this Parliament will be remote. I realize strongly, too, that honourable members here feel upon them the tie of honourable political obligations. I feel that they are too honestly anxious to act up to the spirit of understanding which knits bhem bo their constituents the people of Australia to act in any way inconsistent with our higher character in this matter. There are matters upon which we can have our political fight, and nothing happens, but when we come to deal with these things which lie at the very heart of the manhood and nationhood of Ausbralia, we must then at least be true to those who send us here. Mr L. E. GROOM (Darling Downs) ""WhilstI have some diffidence in speaking upon bhis question, seeing bhat I have so recently come from my electorate, I feel ab bhe same time that, inasmuch as this is a national matter, it is perhaps rather fitting than otherwise that I should address myself to it. I have just come from a contested election, where the question of a white Australia was really a vital one, and I can say emphatically that I believe that principle has given an impetus to our national life. It is no mere catch cry; it is no mere sentimental question ; it is a question striking deeply inbo bhe vital principles, of this new in this way: eve of our national life, and it behoves us at the very beginning to decide who are going to be the citizens of the Commonwealth. decide for ourselves only. We have to decide it for posterity; and it is right that we should determine definitely bhat Australia shall be for those of European extraction. This matter is perhaps of more importance to the members from Queensland than to those who come from obher Sbates, for the reason that we come from that part of Australia which is said to be so essentially a counbry for coloured races. It strikes us very deeply because those who are really opposed to a white Australia say that our island continenb is divided inbo bwo portions, blie north and tropical; the south and temperate. They say that it is utterly impossible for bhe white races to work in the north ; that as a matter of physical the white man deteriorates there and cannot do bhe work. Thab being so, 15 h what is to follow? The opponents of a white Australia say the work must be done; that we cannot leave these wide and fertile fields uncultivated, and that, therefore, we must permit inferior races from Asia to enter the Commonwealth. What is the constitutional aspect ? The argument, which has been clearly penned, is that bhere will be two races in Australia; two forms of government. In the north there will be the servile races working under aristocratic rule, while in the south the people will be governed by democratic principles. They do not hesibabe bo put that strongly. We do not hear the argument raised in this Chamber, but at the same time these people tell us that we are fighting againsb the climatic conditions of the continent. They declare that no matter what we may do in this Parliament the climate will settle bhe question. I do nob believe that their position is correct. I believe that we want the whole of Australia for the white races. Seeing that the flow of coloured races to Australia is comparatively small at present, I think we cannot do better than stop it at bhe beginning. Honourable members for Victoria know that the. rabbits were looked upon as very innocent tilings at the beginning; 3-et they have multiplied enormously and rapidly, until they have become a great scourge. In Commonwealth. I look ab it Queensland we suffered in the same way from We are just on the the prickly pear and other pests of that kind, and we say that we should stop the flow of coloured races bo bhis land ab the very beginning, and that we should do it It is not a matter that we have to decisively and firmly. I went before my constituents pledged to the juinciples of the Barton Bill, and I will certainly vobe for ib. There are bwo ways of dealing wibh this question. One is by means of treaty, and the other is by means of legislation. From what I have seen of the working of treaties in Queensland, however, I contend bhat we cannot attempt to regulate this question by such means. We must deal with it by means of restrictive legislation. A treaty is difficult to enforce. In the first place it is necessary to have loyal co-operation at both ends. It is a contract, and unless both parties to it are endeavouring to work loyally together a treaty is bound to result in failure. We conditions have in Australia a desire to keep our country for the white races of bhe world. The Japanese may not have so strong a desire to assist us. They may wish to keep certain classes of their people in their midst, but until we get both parties imbued with the true spirit of the treaty it will not work well. fairly proved. official correspondence placed upon the table of the Queensland Legislative Assembly at the request of Mr Brown. Sir James Dickson, in a letter to tlie Japanese consul, dated tlie 7th March, 1889, saidIn this connection I may state that certain facts have recently come to my knowledge which indicate that in some cases the Japanese authorities are being misled by persons wishing to proceed to Queensland, and who, in order to make it appear that they are merchants, produce, for inspection, goods to the value of some hundreds of dollars. These goods, however, do not actually belong to the persons professing to own them, who on arrival in Queensland hand them over to some of their compatriots already established in business in the colony, while they themselves engage in avocations, which, if stated.in the first instance, would, in the terms of the understanding with the Japanese Government, certainly have led to the applications for passports being refused. I shall feel obliged, accordingly, if you will be good enough to bring these facts under the notice of your Government, in order that such precautions may be adopted in future as will preclude any similar attempts being made to evade the restrictions now imposed. Then, again, on the 29th May, 1899, Sir James Dickson wrote another letter to the Japanese Consul, in which he stated distinctlyI take this opportunity of informing you that, on the 8th May, instant, there were landed at Thursday Island, by the s.s. Yaioatu Maru 39 Japanese, bearing passports stating that they were visitiug Queensland for commercial purposes, who forthwith signed articles of agreement with Japanese owners of pearl-shelling boats. That shows very clearly that this treaty which was intended to restrict the importation of Japanese labourers and Japanese artisans is an utter failure. These passports purport to be issued to men for commercial puposes only, but we find them used as a flimsy disguise for Japanese labourers and artisans, who are coming into the countiy just as freely as if there were no treaty in operation at all. So strongly did Sir James Dickson feel in the matter, that he drew attention to the fact that the working of"" the treaty was not satisfactory, and in another letter he said :Unless greater care is exercised by the authoritorate, by means of flaming placards, that ties in that country to prevent artisans andl labourers from obtaining passports for Queensland, this Government may find itself reluctantly' Mr L. E. Groom. compelled to introduce restrictive legislation dealing with the question. The Queensland Government took up firmly the attitude that if the treaty did not This is a matter that has been succeed-as it did not really-the y would I read now from the not stand to it, but introduce restrictive legislation. I take it that the position is that we in Australia do not exercise delegated legislative functions-. In the words of the decisions of the Privy Council, we so far as we are concerned in legislating in Australian matters, do really exercise sovereign jurisdiction and, therefore, we inherently possess the power to, and can deal with these measures in such a way as we deem fit. But at the same time it is incumbent upon us to listen to representations that are made to us by the home authorities. When we are told distinctly that certain measures are not acceptable for certain reasons, it is our duty, so far as we can, to secure the harmonious co-operation of the whole of the Empire, and pass such measures as we feel will be readily accepted. We should deal with this matter at once in order that the Bill may come into operation immediately. If we amend the Bill as proposed, the chances are that the Royal assent will be held over for some time, and may possibly be refused. It is theoretically within the power of the Crown to refuse assent, though in practice in Great Britaini t is not refused; but in regard to the veto we are in a somewhat different position. The Imperial authorities throughout the Empire have constantly exercised the power of veto. It has been exercised in Queensland and in other States as well. What we ought to do is to pass the Bill on the lines suggested by the Government, and secure in the first year of the Commonwealth a recognition of the principle that We should exclude undesirable immigrants from our midst. If it be found that that is ineffectual, then I believe it is our duty to go further and speak firmly on the matter. We should continue to agitate and pass measures until Australia's will is carried into Australia's law. As regards the educational test, it has been the subject of considerable misrepresentation, and I do not think anybody has suffered so much from that misrepresentation as myself. As soon as it was announced that the test would be an English test, it was suggested throughout my electhe measure was an insult aimed at the other nations of the world, some of which have contributed their best virtues in building up Australia's population. In other words, men have tried to inflame racial hostilities with a view to blocking a measure which will really secure Australia to the white people. It is a peculiar thing that the people who raise the question, and who at this time are so particular to preserve the interests of the Germans and Scandinavians, happen to be great friends of the Asiatics. MrL . E. GROOM I do not wish to mention any names, and the letters and other documents speak for themselves. When we find people trying, to stir up racial hostility at the very beginning of our national life, whom we desire all the different races of Europe to co-operate in building up a nation here, we may well view with suspicion a good deal of the objections raised by them. sincerity of those who desire to treat the matter in a straightforward manner; but as against that, there is the question of urgency. TheB ill is urgent for the reason that we hope soon to have a B ill passed restricting the importation of Kanakas. If the present B ill is not passed, the result will be that those who want cheap labour will continue to try to get coloured labour into the Commonwealth from other places. A letter in the Sydney Morni/ng Herald put the position clearly. It stated that as a fact of nature the Polynesian is a decreasing and a declining element, and seeing that the planters of Queensland are going to produce articles which will come into competition with the tropical produce of the rest of the world, they must get cheap labour elsewhere than from the islands. That means that they are looking to secure cheap labour from Asia for the purpose of growing sugar. The two questions are thus to a certain extent connected, and I think it is necessary for us, seeing that we shall have a Polynesian Restriction Bill to pass, to pass a measure at this stage to prevent the increase of Asiaticsi n this country. I am opposed to the immigration of these aliens, in the first place, because it goes without saying that we cannot blend with Asiatics. The feeling between them and lis seems to be antagonistic. It is not a question of colour; tlie antagonism lies deep-rooted in antipathy to the very nature of the Asiatics themselves. 15 L 2 They are differently constituted in their tastes, manners, and ways, and it is essential for us to preserve Australia for the European stock. In the second place, there is what is known as the constitutional objection. We should not lnwe admitted into the Commonwealth a large class of persons to whom we cannot extend the franchise. We have here self-government under a Constitution, and every person who is a citizen of the Commonwealth, and who earns his living here and pays his share of the taxation, is entitled to a voice in the government. By this means we are able to secure on the statute-book the will of the people. If we are to have admitted into the Commonwealth a large number of Asiatics, that principle cannot come into f u l l operation, because their views are different from ours Their feelings are different,, and if we have I can appreciate the them here without a voice in public affairs, we are striking at the very elements of democratic government. We should have a large number of people whose industries we are controlling by law, whose taxes we are taking, and whose lives we are controlling, and yet exclude them from the privileges of self-government. For that reason, I say, we must keep the Asiatics out. The third reason is what may be called the economic reason, which strikes at the very foundation of our civilization. We believe that we should have a high standard of civilization, though we are told that we should try and live as thriftily as the Japanese. Buti t is not our desire, I think, to lower the standard of civilization in any way. We like our State schools, and we like the comforts of civilization. We like to feel that every working man's son, by means of the educational advantages placed at his disposal, can be so trained that in the end he can attain tlie highest position in the Commonwealth ; and that pre-supposes that the parents receive adequate compensation and remuneration for tlie services they perform. That, we find, is not the case as regards the Asiatic, who will accept a low standard of civilization, and, so long as he gets enough for bare existence and maintains a roof over his head, is perfectly satisfied. For these social, economic, racial, and constitutional reasons, we must firmly and decisively keep Australia for the European races of the world. agree with the honourable member who last",61,Mcmillan H E Took A Lot Will Come Up Again I F They Do Not Give I T

184,Mr Watkins (Newcastle),"I quitespoke that it is desirable that we should deal with this question at the earliest possible moment, and should pass a Bill, which will not be delayed in any way. Buti t is of equal importance that we should deal with the question effectively. If we are to believe in what I may call the lecture we had this evening from the honourable and learned member for Parkes, it seems to me that the measure brought forward by the Oovernment will simply mean that we are going to admit Japanese and all other classes of Asiatics from time to time. If that honourable and learned member fully believes in the opinions he has expressed, he should give his vote decidedly against the third reading of the Bill, because it seems to me that every word he uttered went to indicate that he was clearly in favour of allowing all classes of people to enter the Commonwealth. While he was free to taunt honourable members of this House with the statement that they pander to their electors, when they say they are favorable to the exclusion of those .alien races, he alone is the man who is quite prepared to take up a firm stand in this connection ; and he should be firm and say that he is in favour of admitting these people here. It is not for me to lecture to the honourable and learned member in return, further than to say that in common with many honourable members of the House, I am prepared to go a long way to please the mother country. But while we should be wery sorry to do anything to lead the mother country into an entanglement, we have a right to know where this so-called partnership is going to lead us. partnership we should have at least some .say in that partnership. means that we have established a Commonwealth Parliament here, and we are to have our legislation dictated to us by one member of the partnership, then it is not a partnership at all. Mr O'MALLISV -They -dividends. .member says, they take all the dividends, .and there is no partnership in the matter. I do not think for a moment that anybody is going to make the bold statement to-day that the people of Australia do nothing to assist the British nation, or to charge us with not being prepared to assist Great Britain in every way possible; but it seems to me that this discussion about the proposal to exclude the alien races being vetoed by the British authorities is altogether beside the question. It is premature, I think. AVe should not anticipate anything in that direction. We have been assured by the Attorney-General that if we desire this legislation we can have it. I am satisfied that if Mr Chamberlain occupied the position in which we find ourselves to-day, he would take up quite a different attitude to that which he at present adopts. I cannot agree with the educational test proposed by tlie Government, but if there is one thing more than another to which the British Government would have a right to object, it is the amendment suggested by the honourable and learned member for Indi. That amendment would, I think, be more readily vetoed than would any proposal which has yet been suggested. But even if it were not vetoed, I cannot see that it would be a straight and honourable way of dealing with this matter. Honourable members told the people during the recent election campaign that they were in ;favour of a white Australia, and it is their duty now to place the promised legislation upon the statute-book. The direct way of dealing with this matter is by adopting the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Bland. If we attempt to accomplish our object in a backhanded way, we shall be offering a greater insult to foreign nations than by dealing directly with the question. Let us point out to the Japanese that, whilst we,-desire them as friendly allies, we wish to keep Australia for our own people. I agree with If it is to be a the honourable and learned member for Parkes that the provisions of the B ill in If it simply regard to the educational test would constitute hypocritical legislation. I do not think that that is the class of legislation which we should sanction at tlie commencement of our national existence. We ought also to recognise that administration is just as important as is the passage of take all the good legislation. I have always thought that a bad Act of Parliament well adminisA s the honourable tered is better than a good Act badly administered. Administration is everything, and to allow any Government the right to say whether they shall put into force an Act of Parliament or withhold its operation from time to time is too great a power to give them. I can quite understand that the Government have put forward these arguments in all good faith. I quite admit that the educational test would only be enforced in",64,Mcmillan H E Took A Lot Will Come Up Again I F They Do Not Give I T
185,Mr Watkins,"certain cases; but in the hands of an unscrupulous Minister or Ministers it could be applied to the detriment of the people of tlie Commonwealtb. It could be enforced when it suited their own particular ends, which ends, however, might not be those of the people of Australia. I do not say that the Minister for Defence would attempt anything of the sort, but surely he does not claim to have a lease of the Treasury benches for all time. The best method of dealing with this matter is to adopt the amendment of the honourable member for Bland. Much as we may desire to be friendly with Japan or any other people of anything like a high standard, we must still look nearer home. Whilst we claim to be equally patriotic with those who find it necessary to be always preaching their patriotism to the mother country, we still feel that we have a right to be loyal to Australia. We are entitled to know to what length our powers go in this direction. If we are to be told that because legislation of a similar kind has been vetoed in Queensland, our legislation will also be vetoed, I ask, is there anything in the statement so frequently made, thatj the powers of the Commonwealth would be greater than the powers of any State1 If not, why was this Federation inaugurated ? It seems to me that we ought to have greater powers in this connection than the State Parliaments. I would point out that in four Acts which were passed in Queensland, and to which the Royal assent was given, that State asked for more than we are seeking here. I admit that they did not ask for the exclusion of coloured aliens, but they affirmed that they would not allow these particular persons to be employed on the works provided for in those Acts. We declare that every alien who has been naturalized here shall have equal rights with every other citizen of Australia, but we ask, at the outset, for the exclusion of certain people from our Commonwealth. We do not wish to-entice them here and then to refuse them the rights which are enjoyed by every other citizen of the Commonwealth. I trust that when a vote is taken, the amendment of the honourable member for Bland will be carried, and that we shall thus affirm that the principle of a white Australia shall be a reality and not a sham and an hypocrisy. the amendment of which I have 'given notice, and which I think will not have the effect of restricting debate, I wish to say a few words as to what has been said in the course of the debate. Taking first the remarks of ' the honourable member for Parkes, it would appear as a fair inference from what he said that the Government in bringing this Bill forward were acting on the direct suggestion of that section of the House to which the honourable member for Parkes is fond of referring, as though it had struck upon a portion of his epidermis in a way that does not agree with him. But the honourable member seems to forget that the policy of a white Australia which this Bill purports to carry through, was put in the forefront of the Government programme, and also in the forefront of the programme of the leader of the Opposition, whom the honourable member follows at the present, time. So that, although the labour party, I claim, had throughout the various Statesa great deal to do with the popularizing of' this emphatic cry for a white Australia, still, so far as the present position is concerned the Government would have been absolutely false to their pledges to the people if they had not brought in a Bill at this early stage in the manner they have done. Again, the honourable member fovParkes spoke of a phrase which, he said,, has been used by a certain section ; that is,. "" the equality of mankind,"" or "" the equal rights of man."" Now, I. do not know that the section of honourable members whom I represent, has, at any rate during my term, used any such phrase. What we have claimed is that all citizens should have equal opportunities. We never say that ""all men are equal."" No sensible set of men would ever say so. But we say that, every man should be equal with every otherman in the eyes of the law, and that equal opportunities should be afforded so far as. the law can allow to every citizen. And we reserve the right to say who shall be-citizens. We ask that they shall be on a moral and physical level with ourselves^ and that they shall be such as we can fraternize with and welcome as brother citizens of what we hope will some day be a great nation. Again the honourable member spoke of the necessity on occasions like this of preserving a statesmanlike attitude. I agree with him in regard to that. I do not pretend to have any of the qualities of",65,Mcmillan H E Took A Lot Will Come Up Again I F They Do Not Give I T
186,Mr Watso N (Bland),"Before I move statesmanship myself, but, at least, I thinkam justified in claiming this-that years ago the people of America had had legislation of this character, with reference particularly to the immigration of slaves to that countiy, and any man had lifted up his voice against that immigration, he would to-day have been hailed as a statesman by the people of America. could have foreseen all the dangers, and the troubles, and the dire distress, that have followed in the footsteps of the introduction of black labour into man who could have foreseen and even attempted to prevent that evil in those days-would One who should have had the whole nation behind him in the work he tried to do. ' True statesmanship, to my mind, consists, not in putting forward a number of plausible platitudes and philosophical meanderings in this Chamber, but iu looking ahead, and seeing what is likely to be in any way a menace to the people of our countiy in the f uture. We, who support this policy, do so in the interests of those who succeed us, and :for whom we have a trust in our hands to see bhat any action we take is such as will, as far as possible, prevent the likelihood of the occurrence of those dangers which we foresee. With regard to another point quoted by the honourable member for Parkes, as to the interests of the Empire, I do not think it is necessary to say much, because every honourable member who has spoken has been alive to the necessity of considering, as far as possible, the interests of the Empire when ' we are dealing with questions of such great ^gravity as this. But I do say that if there is a partnership in existence of which the honourable member spoke, then we should have some voice in governing the affairs of the partnership. there is no true partnership. ""handed over to us by the British Government, as has been pointed out before, the power to govern ourselves, to control our own affairs within the four corners of the this .particular it is contained within the Constitution and has been handed over for our control -and direction. posed amendment, but before moving it I have to soya word-or two upon the attitude of the Government. the Government are -not justified in tlie attitude they have taken up with resj>ect to the amendment Mr Watson. if 100 notice. The Prime Minister stated the other evening in answer to a question put by the honourable member for Northern Melbourne that he regarded clause 4 as vital to the B ill ; that is, that if the amendment of which I have given notice was carried the B ill would be dropped. I say there is Tlie man who no justification in the position for any such statement or attitude on the part of the Government. If this were a party movement-if it were a question of displacing America-the the. Government-if there were any large divergence of policy between the Government and the majority of the House-if to-day have been honored .as there were any of these considerations in existence, I-could understand their taking up the attitude of dropping the Bill or even of resigning the positions they occupy in the event of my amendment being carried. But, sir, there is no question at stake except the question of method. We pretend bo be all of one mind, with the exception of the honourable member for Parkes, and I am not quite sure what his mind is upon the subject. But speaking generally, we are all of one mind with respect of the object we are striving to attain If we differ in method, if the Government .feel that the difficulties are such as constrain them to bring in no more drastic proposition than that which is now before the Chamber in this Bill, surely it is not necessarily a declaration of want of confidence in the Government if the committee should carry the amendment against their proposal. AndI say this, sir: that the only effective way of dealing with the question at issue is by means of such an amendment as I have given notice of. If that is the only effective way of attaining the object, and the inUnless that is conceded, terests of the whole of the people of AusWe have had tralia are -at stake, then I say that the Government has no right to attempt to coerce the members of this committee who desire to aGti n the interests of the people of Australia. If the question .arises of having Constitution; and, so far as to choose between this Government and the matter is concerned, interests of the people of Ausbralia, I am prepared to make up my mind at very short notice indeed. I .wish now to come to the proI contend that the Government will be justified in submitting to -the will of the House on this question. There is no doubt In rny opinion that by an immense majority tlie House is against the Government, and if Ministers allow bheir supporters to vobe free from bhe of which I have given whip, we shall soon see what the feeling of this Commonwealth Parliament is.

197,Mr Watson,"From their appearance,Whatever objection might be urged against my proposal by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, as to diplomatic trouble being likely to arise through the protests of Japan, would apply with a little more force to the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Indi. No subterfuge that the first use to be made of the power proposed to be given under his amendment would be to pass a resolution involving the prohibition of a number of nationalities, and therefore its purpose would be easily vinderstood who, after the speeches would see that they were aimed at. In addition to that there is danger of delay in taking exclusion of aliens. Moreover, the spasmodic treatment of a matter of this kind by a series of resolutions would result in greater annoyance and insult to the people of a particular nation than if a clearly defined law were laid down early in our existence, as a part of our permanent policy. I admit that, if the committee reject the proposal which I now desire to move, I shall be prepared to favour that put forward by the honourable and learned member for Indi; but, as compared with my suggestion, 1 think it has a number of disadvantages in the direction I have indicated. one remark to add upon the question of urgency. necessity for passing this Bill without anything in it that would be likely to cause delay, so far as the Colonial-office is concerned. In that connection the honourable member for Darling Downs-who, the pleasure, if I may do so, of congratulating upon his opening speech-implied that, if the planters were denied at once the opportunity of getting additional Kanakas, fchey would look elsewhere; that, in the absence of some such provision as that contained in this Bill they would be able to get coloured labour from another place. So far as places outside Polynesia are concerned, it is not so easy as it may appear at first sight to obtain a large body of these people. Especially is that the case with regard to India. In view of the attitude hitherto taken up by the Government of India with respect to shipments of coolies even to British possessions, I feel assured that, in the event of delay taking place between the passing, of the Bill here and its acceptance by the Home authorities, Mr Watson. representations by this Government to the Government of India would be quite sufficient to prevent any contract being legalized in that country for the employment of coolies. MrV . L . SOLOMON -The Indian Government are not anxious to let coolies would get over the knowledge leave under contract. to permit coolies to go abroad under contract. The Government of India have not only discouraged the engagement of coolies for F i j i and British New Guinea plantations, by the Japanese people but they have surrounded their engagement made here, with restrictions of which the planters in those places complain very bitterly. Therefore I think that representations from effective measures for the this Government will get over any trouble so far as Indian coolies are concerned, while with regard to. other nations, an act of State will be quite sufficient to exclude undesirable people from Australia pending the passage of this Bill. deavouring-eve r since this question assumed the dimensions it has attained because of a recent influx-to exercise an Act of State with regard to persons who are not British subjects, many scores of people have come in.
