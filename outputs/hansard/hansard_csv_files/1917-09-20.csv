Mr J. H . CATTS -Yesterday , when I was referring to the proposal of the Government to tax eligible single men, I spoke of conscription as a party issue. The honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lynch) retorted that iii was never a party issue, and subsequently interjected, "" The honourable member ran upstairs on the 14th September, and then ran away again."" A t the tune I did not understand the interjection, but thought from the context that it had something to do with conscription. Having spoken to him since about it, I have ascertained that he was referring to the fact that when a member of the partyI do not know who-calle d a meeting to make a -protest to the Central Political Labour Executive of New South Waiea regarding the endorsement of candidates, and I found that a. petition was being prepared which I was not prepared to support, I left the meeting.

Interjections in the first place distract the attention of the Chair from what is. being said by the honourable member addressing the House, and also give (provocation for going beyond the making of a personal explanation.

When by way of in terjection I took exception yesterday to a statement made by the honourable member for Cook( MrJ . H . Catts) he replied, "" Why did you leave the Labour party to support a conscripbionist Government "" ? I wish to remind the honourable member that the issue before the party and the -country at the time was not that of conscription, a principle to which I have always been opposed, but as to whether freedom and liberty of opinion and conscience was to be retained within the Labour movement. the firsb to protest when, following on the resolution passed by the Labour Conference in 1916, a notice was sent te members of the Labour party that, unless we opposed conscription both inside and outside of Parliament, we would lose our indorsements. the 14th September, 1916, that we made a strong and emphatic protest. We said thab the threat to withhold our indorsements was without constitutional warrant and opposed to the principles of the Labour party and Democracy. That was the attitude we took up, and I was prepared, if necessary, to go out of Parliament, in supporb of it . I also said that tbe honourable member, seeing perhaps that his seat was in danger climbed down and left the room. to add that the majority of the party at that time-includin g the honourable member for Cook-kne w perfectly well that the protest was against tyranny in the Labour movement, and had nothing to do wifch the issue of conscription itself. for Trade and Customs yesterday whether he would lay on the table of the 'House copies of fche instructions under which all "" loading "" of invoices of British goods is made. say whether he would or would not, bufc repliedfchafcsuch instructions were of a confidential character. ask h i m if he can give any public reason why those instructions, .confidential or otherwise, should not be disclosed to honstate whether the Commonwealth Governorable members of this House? the honourable member's question consideration, and to in f o rm the House later on of my decision. state what steps, if any, the Government have taken to provide for u n if o r m income tax returns for both State and Commonwealth purposes? understand it , is that the Commonwealth and State Governments have agreed fchafc uniformit y is both desirable and necessary, and that the hitch which is preventing the completion of the arrangeI was amongst ment has arisen through the difficulty of applying it to the varying circumstances of State and Commonwealth taxation. My right honourable friend the Treasurer could tell the House exactly where the trouble is. It lies with the Income Tax Commissioners themselves.

I am now in a position to give h i m the following answer:The allowance referred to was payable only to such members of the Instructional Staff as were employed in Australian Imperial Force Camps and Schools. Wheni t was granted, large numbers of recruits were coming forward, I asked the Minister and owing to the shortage of instructors, those available were called upon to work long hours, and for practically seven days per week.

Replying more directly to his question, each State has control of the construction of the silos subject to the desteamer arrived in that State within a sign and price being approved by the Commission. The price of construction is fixed. We do not control the tenderers, and we cannot distinguish between one tenderer and another. tenders do not come before the Commonwealth Government, 30 that in the State of New South Wales, for example, any tender can be accepted, and the Commonwealth has no voice in the matter. . STREETS. Minister whether his attention has been drawn to the fact that there was a large congregation of people in the streets last night, that windows were broken in various parts of the metropoliton area, and that injuries were received by constables in the execution of their duty? If so, will he take steps under the Unlawful Associations Act to deport the leaders who incited large numbers of the people to this ruthless and unprovoked destruction of property and interference with individuals ? of the honourable member's question. I assume that that which is alleged to have taken place last night is an offence against State law, or, perhaps, an offence against Commonwealth law, in so far as it happened within the proscribed area. As to what steps will be taken, it is not usual to speak of these things; but the law will be enforced. The question as to whether we should take tlie unusual step of dealing with certain persons in the manner suggested is to be considered. I shall say no more about the matter now. fence against Commonwealth law if no meeting was held within the proscribed area? son) -The honourable member is not in order in founding a question on an answer by the Minister to a previous question. a telegram from the Perth Chamber of Commerce stating that unless . another fortnight there would be a shortage of several kinds of foodstuffs. I would like to know whether the industrial situation has improved sufficiently to enable regular The sailings to be resumed shortly, or, failing that, whether steps will be taken to provide the people of Western Australia with necessary food supplies ? created by the industrial trouble are, of course, very widespread, and not easy of settlement. As the honourable member knows, one vessel has been despatched to Western Australia, and an effort has been made to despatch another. There are now in Western Australia two vessels, which werethere before the strike. I communicated some time ago with the Premier of the State, asking if he could make arrangements for the despatch of those steamers eastward, in order that we might have the advantage of the tonnage; but probably he found it impossible to do that. However, we are endeavouring to despatch another-steamer. I point out, not by way of excuse, but by way of explanation, that the position in Northern Queensland is equally bad, and in the State of Tasmania little better. Where railway communication does not exist, such difficulties must arise, but the Government are doing what is possible.

51,Mr Speaker (Hon. W. Elliot John,"in the course of his memorandum he saysSubject to the unanimous concurrence of honourable members in the proposed classification, and to the staff being officially informed, from time to time, of changes in party membership, there would be no difficulty in making the proposed addition. I would, however, respectfully suggest that if it be desired to give greater publicity than the reports already afford to the party adherence of honourable members, the object might be conveniently attained by the inclusion of the letter (M) or (O) after their namesin the list which is published on the wrapper of each weekly issue, and is afterwards incorporated in the bound volumes. This list would be subject to constant revision by honourable members as circumstances might require, and could be easily referred to by readers of Bansard. In considering such an alteration of practice, regard must be paid to the fact tKat every change of Government would inevitably involve considerable changes in the party designation of honourable members, which might, therefore, have but a very limited significance or value. I point out that the indication of party membership is generally to be found in the speeches of honourable members as reported in Hansard, and that a rigid or accurate designation of party adherence is not always practicable. For' example, during the latter part of the life of the last Parliament, certain changes of political and party adherence took place, which involved considerable difficulty in ' the matter of classification for some time. mous concurrence of honourable members themselves, but not otherwise, I propose to adopt the suggestion of placing the letters "" M "" and "" O "" after the names of honourable members printed on the Hansard paper cover. prehensible practice. wish it to be done, it will not be done. question upon this matter w ill be disallowed as being one arising out of an answer already given. made the subject of debate. have the opportunity of objecting to the the publication in the Commonwealth of method proposed to be pursued? out of an answer to a question are nob having been submitted to censorship in in order.

In Committee of Ways .and Means (Consideration resumed from 19th September, vide page. 2293, on motion by Sir JOH N FOBBEST)That a tax be imposed on incomes derived from sources in Australia . . . [Forf u l l text of motion see page 1411.] Sir JOHN FORREST (Swan-Trea surer) [11.42] I propose to ask the Committee to deal with the motion in subdivisions, and that w ill enable us to discuss all parts f u l l y without again having a general discussion on the whole proposal, and making no headway. Until we reach subdivision F , I shall not propose any amendment, except the correction of a clerical error in subdivision B , where £559 10s. should, read £599 10s. Subdivision F was the subject of practically the whole of the discussion yesterday, and It asked the Committee to report progress in order that the Government might f u r ther consider the matter in the light of the views expressed by honourable members. When we reach that subdivision, I shall propose some amendment, which I ing the wishes of honourable members if I indicate now the alterations I shall move. In sub-paragraph i i of paragraph a, I shall propose to strike out the words "" and was under the age of forty-five years."" That w ill make the tax apply to every unmarried man or widower without children who is not under the age-of twenty-one years.

We intend to retain paragraph 4 altered in this wayThat a majority of his brothers of military age have been on active' service outside , Australia during the present war,, or are members of an Expeditionary Force raised for service outside Australia, or have enlisted for service outside Australia in a ship of war. We propose to retain paragraph 5, which readsThat he is permanently incapacitated for work. We wish to delete paragraphs 6, 7, and 8, which readThat he is employed in the police or prison services of the Commonwealth or of a State; or That he is employed on a lighthouse; or That he is a minister of religion. We propose to add a new paragraph to this effectThat fie is in receipt of an invalid or old age pension. We propose that subdivision G shall stand as it was on the notdce-paper for yesterday to be followed by this new subdivision : There shall be payable in respect of a cash prize in a lottery income tax to the amount of 10 per cent, of the gross prize money. These are all the alterations which we wish to submit. concurrence of honourable members to this Sir John Forrest. suggestion, that the Chairman should take the motion in parts, because by tliat means we should be able to deal with the In parts in. a far better way than we could by taking them as a whole. I remind honourable members that subdivisions A to E are the law at the present time. I propose to move, sir, .that you take the motion before the Committee in parts.

It will be very convenient, and, I think, w ill tend to expedition. lor's Tax? it , sir, from the way in which the motion was submitted to the Committee that every honourable member will have the same right as we had yesterday to deal with the proposal as a whole, and that ib w ill not be competent for you to rule/that an honourable member cannot debate subdivision F whilst subdivision A is being discussed. The motion was submitted to fche Committee in seven or eight different parts or sections, and I take it , sir, that it will only be possible to do what the Treasurer desires by him asking leave to withdraw the motion, and submitting, an amended motion. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE Y o u agree that it would be the most convenient way to deal with ithe proposal? that I have already spoken to the general question. I admit that paiib F is tlie most vital one, and I am opposed to its adoption, even in the amended for m which has been suggested. Other honourable members,-however, have not had an opportunity of discussing the motion, and thoy desire to discuss it as a whole, and not to be tied down to any particular sec-' tion. If certain parts were passed, they would be prevented from doing that. It is to safeguard the rights of honourable members that I protest against the Treasurer being allowed to take the course which he suggests. ' I wish to speak on the general question. First, I take the objection that, inasmuch as the Government was elected to carry on the business of the war, it has no justification for seeking to impose taxation I would like to get the which has not been submitted to the electors.

This procedure is followed in the British House of Commons, and is sanctioned by our own Standing Orders. . Sir JO HN FORREST (Swan-Trea surer) [11.57] I move.

I remind honourable members that, after the motion has been approved, if we get that far, a Bill embodying its various proposals will have to be introduced, and on the second and third readings they can discuss the whole question. It is idle, therefore, to say that an opportunity to speak on the subject would be taken away from any honourable member. In my opinion, the only way to deal with this business is to take the motion in sections, the same as the Estimates are taken. I did not anticipate yesterday that we would have much discussion until we reached part F. I cannot understand how any honourable member can, take exception to the course I propose. Mr J. H .

The object of getting into Committee of Ways and Means is to allow honourable members to voice their opinions on questions of taxation, and to give the widest possible latitude of discussion.

Mr J. H . CATTS -Does the honourable member think that the authority which he has quoted enables the Treasurer to move two motions at the one time? can do that. The Committee is now in possession of the motion, which covers all these matters. Thus far, I agree with the Leader of the Opposition. Mr J. H .

When an honourable member in charge of a motion desires to substitute another motion for it , is it not the usual practice for him to ask the leave of the Committee to do so? to substitute another motion for my first proposal. gentleman cannot have two motions before Chanter) -In my previous remarks I pointed out that both under our Standing Orders and under the practice of. the British House of Commons the Presiding Officer, either in the House or in Committee, has power vested in him to subdivide any motion for convenience of debate. Our standing order dealing with this matter is standing order No. 122, which provides that the House may order a complicated question to be divided. The same powers are vested in this Committee as are vested in the House, and, therefore, this Committee has power to divide the Treasurer's proposal into sections. The honourable member for Flinders( Sir William Irvine) has called attention to the practice of the House of Commons, as laid down in the 10th edition of May, page 271. Therei t is statedThe ancient rule that when a complicated question is proposed J;o the House, the House may order such question to be divided, is observed in the following manner. Then follows the extract which has already been quoted by the honourable member. The point taken by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) is, in my opinion, hot applicable to this particular case, because here the original motion, which was "" That the motion be agreed to,"" is not removed from the Committee. That motion still stands. The intervening proposal of the Treasurer ( Sir John Forrest), is that, for the sake of convenience, the motion shall be divided into parts. Some honourable members apparently think that if the procedure proposed be adopted they will be deprived of their rights. I would point out that, so far from that being the case, their rights will be multiplied, because, instead of being restricted to speaking twice upon the motion itself, they will be at liberty to speak twice upon each alphabetical section of it Mr J.

It would be very easy for the Opposition to sit down and let this pass, and then go on the platform and tell the people how the Treasurer had neglected his duty. I prefer to do it here first, and am now pointing out to the Treasurer the opportunities he is neglecting in not increasing the income tax. ^all in good time. for Grey( Mr Poynton) pointed last night to the fruitfu l seasons we have been enjoying and the enormous profits that are being made in many businesses. I showed, in discussing another measure, that in Victoria alone 1,308 individuals or companies made profits of £8,500,000 in 1914, whereas in the year ending 30th June, 1917, 1,362 individuals or companies had made over £10,000,000 in profits, or an increase of over £1,500,000 in the three war years. The Government have golden opportunities of taxing these people that they will not have in the near future. That is why I ask the Treasurer now to grasp this chance. what we are going to do. Treasurer will say that the Government have the question of additional taxation under consideration now. anything of the kind. to hear the Opposition asking the Govern^ ment to tax the people more would ask the Treasurer to divulge information that would be the means of causing the Commonwealth to lose one penny of taxation. But that does not apply to an Income Tax Bill. indicate was that the Treasurer has already told the honourable member that his taxation proposals are settled for the year. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.S0 p.m. are tunity for obtaining revenue by mean's of taxation presents itself at this time. No doubt it would be better, in the party interests of the Opposition, not to make suggestions to the Treasurer with a view to improving the taxation proposals of the Government, but to go on to the public platform, and there criticise them. taxation will not be very popular when preached from the platform. for Flinders( Sir William Irvine) said that if there was one definite pledge made to the people before the election it was that those who had been making excess profits during the war should be called on to repay part of them to the Government, but he said that the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill let these people off. The Treasurer, however, does not propose any other taxation to deal with them. The Government makes a tremendous mistake in not proposing a super-tax tb get at these people. We. are agreed that no profits should be made out of the war, but we know that many persons are making fortunes out of it , and they should be taxed. The Treasurer could get at them by increasing the super-tax provided for in subdivision D.

The financial proposals of the Government were laid before honourable members when I made my Budget Speech on the 8th August last. I then showed exactly whab revenue we expected, and what we intended to expend, and I stated what the new taxation proposals would be. I said, further, that additional taxation would have been necessary but for the surplus'from last yfear and the transfer of £825,000 from the London Liabilities Account. people, as I then pointed out, are already heavily taxed, the Pederal, State, and municipal taxation of Australia being equivalent to £7 4s. 2d. for every man, woman, and child within the Commonwealth. Now we have imposed a Wartime Profits Tax. one. members complain of the high cost of living; but do they think that to increase taxation will make things cheaper ? want more taxation in order to make things dearer? Of the income tax 84 per cent, is paid by persons having incomes exceeding £1,000 a year. However, this is not an occasion for speaking on the financial position of the country. The Committee is asked to re-enact taxation which is now in existence. 'Should the Government need more money than was anticipated when the Budget was made, we shall have to provide it . shall avail myself, of every opportunity to make it plain that the financial proposals of the Government are not what should be expected from the occupants of the Treasury bench. There are times when a community can bear taxation, and other times when taxation is difficult to enforce, but in my opinion there could be no better opportunity than the present for imposing it. There is an immense amount of borrowed money in circulation, and the profits that are being made are much greater than they have been in any previous period of our history. The year 1913 was a prosperous one', but the bank balances now are higher than they were then. Ministers think that they can carry on with borrowed money, but the people, I am sure, are against heavy borrowing for any but war purposes. A little later the community will not be as well able to pay taxation as they are now. No one knows what will happen after the war, but we may be sure that an immense amount of money will be needed to carry on the service of government, and to provide for the repatriation of our returned men. Most of these will wish to resume the occupations which they were following when they went away, and thus The employment must! be found for them. . A t the last election the people were led to believe that taxation would be increased, and they are prepared for extra taxation. A Government that cannot look ahead is un. fitted to govern. Even the Treasurer must be ashamed of the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill as a means of providing revenue, so many exemptions being made in it. Ministers should recognise their responsibilities, and should not allow things to drift. No private member can move to increase taxation, and therefore it is the more necessary that the Government should state the true position, and take steps to prepare for probable eventualities. I am sure that many honourable members opposite are not in favour of land taxation as the sole means of obtaining revenueI myself"" am not-bu t it will not be long before we have a bigger land tax. Honourable members must abandon the idea that the ordinary services of a country can be carried on with loan money. We should borrow only for war purposes. If honourable members do not give"" attention to the financial affairs of the country, the people will choose other representatives. It is proposed shortly to have an adjournment for a period of , five or six weeks, during which time the ; country will'be at the mercy of the. Go. vernment. I do not know why there should be such an adjournment, '. when so much work remains to be done. It is not in accordance witb the wish of the people. There is too much indifference to public affairs. By shelving things we shall only make the position worse. If honourable members opposite are not sufficiently patriotic to look after tbe welfare of Australia then at least it can never be said that I failed to draw attention to their lack of duty, and to their want of appreciation of the public demands.",39,Additional Tax

I submit to the ruling, but I am surprised at it , because I waa under the impression that a private member could not move to increase the burden of taxation. time if I quote the ruling that has already been given on a similar point. If honourable members will look at the Votes and Proceedings for 1901 they will see a ruling which I gave and the autliorities I quoted on that occasion in reference to an exactly similar matter in Committee of Ways and Means. For the purpose of settling the point definitely for all time, it was submitted to Sir Frederick Holder, and I shall read what he said in regard to it . This was the ruling he gaveI may BayI have known for some few weeks past that this question would arise at some stage of the proceedings on the Tariff, and I have, therefore, given it very careful consideration. When first this was made known to me, I at once conceived that the idea of any unofficial member proposing an increase of an item of taxation asked for by the Crown was contrary to the spirit of parliamentary governmentthe spirit of parliamentary government being that the Crown asks for ati impost to be made on the people, and the people's representatives in Parliament consider the request of the Crown, and may grant the request, or may grant a lesser amount, but would not conceivably give to the Crown a larger sum than the Crown asks should be imposed. When, however, I went from the question of the spirit of parliamentary government to the practice which has grown up as parliamentary institutions have developed, I am obliged to admit that in the House of Commons, whioh is the standard of our proceedings where it is not otherwise set out in our Standing Orders, tlie practice of imposing imposts on items not suggested as subjects of taxation by the Crown, and of proposing increases on items which are suggested as subjects for taxation, has sprung up, and that on several occasions, without any objection being taken, new taxes have been proposed and increases by unofficial members, on details of taxes suggested by the Government. There are cases which I am prepared expected the to quote, but which I understand the Chairman has already cited. One case dates back to 1840, and another can be seen in Hansard, vol. 218, page 1041. Striving to interpret the practice of the House of Commons by the practice in other Parliaments, I find that in Canada the same course has been followed, and also in Victoria, where attention was I have ruled on called to the importance of the matter. In South Australia, according to Blackmore's Practice of the House of Assembly, the practice was followed in 1870 and on other occasions. Therefore, ruling as I have to rule, that neither standing order No. 171 nor standing order No. 247 applies to this case, as we If a private memare now dealing with resolutions in Committee only, and the Bill stage will come later; and, falling back on standing order No. 1, which incorporates the practice of the House of Commons, I am bound to decide that the ChairJOHN FORBEST I do not accept man has correctly determined the practice of this House, which is that duties on items may be increased, and that other items which are mentioned in the Tariff on which no duty is proposed may be proposed as subjects for duty, and that, in that way, the House will have the freest possible hand in debating the Tariff. I may say I should have been better It will save pleased to have decided the other way had my duty permitted me so to decide, because I can see that the ruling I have given may tend to produce considerable discussion beyond that which otherwise would have taken place. But with the practice of the House of Commons before me I can only rule as I have ruled, that the Chairman is correct in hie decision. I give the same ruling now. A private member may move an amendment in creasing the burden of taxation in Committee of Ways and Means, but not after the B ill has been introduced. surer) [3.29] I wish to say that it would be very unwise on our part to enlarge the area of this tax. It is already proposed to extend the operation of the B ill by striking out the words "" a n d was under tbe age of forty-five years,"" and it would be unwise, to go further than that at the present moment.

This tax was not framed with the intention of raising revenue for repatriation purposes, because the amount required cannot be collected from those whom the Treasurer seeks to reach. order to get the advantages of the exemption, must a widower have children of his own? Although a man may have no children of his own, he may have adopted somebody else's children and be responsible for their upbringing. In such cases will the man be exempt from the operation of the tax? If the Treasurer is anxious to do justice according to his point of view, I , like the Lamond), fail to see that there is any justification for exempting married men who are without children. has a wife to keep. against bachelors is that by not getting married they are not doing their duty to the country. If the bachelor is a sinner in that respect, and is to be penalized, those who get married and do not do their duty in the matter of rearing children, are far greater sinners. If the Treasurer wishes to stimulate the birth-rate as well as recruiting, he should agree to the tax being applied to married persons who are without issue. I am opposed to the tax in its entirety, but if the Treasurer has any wish to deal fairly with all sections of the community he will accept the amendment. On no logical grounds can the Treasurer refuse to accept the amendment. is directed against men who are untrammelled by responsibilities. surer's point of view, a widower without children should be no more subject to this tax than should a married man without children. a wife and home to maintain. son for the Government's opposition to a widening of the scope of the Bill. Only under the strenuous pressure of a few of their own supporters did they consent to remove from the measure some of the crude injustices that it proposed when introduced in its original form. I am opposed to this tax entirely, because it rests upon an unjust and improper foundation. It is crude, class, penal legislation. I rose merely to point out the inconsistency of the Government in refusing to accept the amendment. opposed to this special tax, but in reference to the amendment it should be borne iu mind that a man who is married is, at least, responsible for the support of somebody, and he has to maintain a home. The tax proposed by the Treasurer is intended to apply only to persons without encumbrances. man with dependants in any worse position than a single man with dependants? man my opinion the single man with dependants should be exempt. I cannot support the amendment. Mr .WALLACE (West Sydney) [3.37] -I , also, am opposed'to this tax, and I cannot understand why a proposal of this nature should have been introduced. The subdivision to which we have just agreed provides that a man in receipt of an income of £100 per annum shall pay a tax of £1. That is sufficient. It is also provided that a man in receipt of an income of £2,000 per annum shall be taxed only to the extent of 2J per cent, of his income. Now the Treasurer proposes that, because a man is unmarried or is a widower without children, he shall pay further heavy penalties. The proposal is unfair. The Government might as well tax a man because he has red hair. If revenue is required, I am in favour of equitable taxation, but I cannot support a tax which discriminates between sections of the community. to distribute the burden of taxation. agreed that taxation should be borne equally by the whole community, and that has every man should pay in proportion to his ability to pay.

Some thousands of Australians are serving in the BritishA r m y , as well as w i th the French. I know of men who have done very fine work in the French air service. One man, whom I knew very well, was sent by the Commonwealth Government to study aviation in Great Britain, and on the outbreak of war was refused an appointment to the British aviation service because he was over age. He then joined the French air service as a pilot, and did very fine work. A f t e r serving for two years in that capacity he has returned to Australia, and now holds the rank of major in the Australian F l y i ng Corps.

I am sure, however, that no one desires that every son in a family should have to go to the Front. It is open to every son to enlist, but we think that if a majority in a family voluntarily go we should in this way show our respect and admiration for that family. word "" majority "" for the word "" a l l "" ? difference in the result as far as three sons going is concerned; but in the case of four or five sons going, the exemption would be greater if the word "" a l l "" was retained. If a majority of them have volunteered, that is quite as much as we should expect. I think we should take this opportunity of showing our admiration of, and consideration for, such families. I know of many families every son in which has gone to the Front, and we should express our admiration for the fathers, and especially for the mothers, of these men, who have sent them out on active service. We are saying, in effect, to the mothers and fathers of Australia, "" If you choose to send all your boys to the Front, you may do so, but if you send only a majority of them, we think you have done enough, and that we should not impose any special taxation or restrictions on those who remain behind."" [4.11] I hope that the Treasurer will move to omit the whole sub-paragraph. Now that we have decided to strike out other exemptions, we should also remove this exemption. The Treasurer has made ari emotional speech regarding those who have sent the majority of their sons to the Front. I do not believe that the boys who have gone to the Front were sent there by any one. They went because they wanted to go,, and I do not think their fathers or mothers had anything to do with their volunteering. There are families other than those mentioned by the Treasurer who have made still greater sacrifices. I refer to small families ' they have tossed up, or left it to the all the male members of which have volunteered, and to large families consisting of a number of girls and only one boy. I know of such families who are attempting to carry on dairying after the only boy has enlisted. Believing it to be their duty to go to the Front, they have done so, and have left their fathers' farms in a worse position, perhaps, than that of those owned by men a majority of whose boys have enlisted. I would point out to the Treasurer that under his amendment this exemption would be extended to a man who has refused to go, and will not go, to the Front; he is going to extend it to men who are working to fill their own pockets and not to assist their parents. the reputation of their brothers who have volunteered. is so. In this instance no question of conscription is involved. A man may please himself whether he enlists or not, and if he does not go to the Front he is only' asked to help in repatriating those of his brothers who have"". I know many cases where only a certain number of sons have gone to the Front, because families are like other communities, and every member is not imbued with the same sentiments and purposes.

I ask the Treasurer to consent to the deletion of sub-paragraph v. Sir graph has been already agreed to.

I agree with the honourable member for Wannon that the taxation of ministers of religion may impose hardship. There are some clergymen who, by the rules of their church, are not permitted to marry. who i6 compelled to be a bachelor is entitled to some consideration. Many mjinikte'ris of religion have no money, others are very poorly paid, and have little opportunity of saving money. What is the use of asking them to pay? and Christadelphians, who, although not clergymen, are conscientious objectors to military service? objector is just as much beholden for his protection to the men who go to the Front as is anybody else in the community, and if he has the means to pay he should not be exempt. There is no Many such analogy between conscientious objectors and ministers of religion. I had already given notice that I intended to propose the removal of the exemption of ministers of religion, and I am pleased that the Treasurer has forestalled me. There is no valid reason why such an exemption should be allowed. The fact that certain ministers of religion are absolved from responsibility for military service, as well as from the perils of matrimony, is no ground, why they should JOHN FOBBEST -That sub-parabe exempt from the payment of this tax. The Treasurer stated yesterday, in answer to a question, that this exemption had been included in this resolution because ministers of religion are exempt under the Defence Act. It is most illogical to exempt a man from one obligation for no other reason than that he is exempt from another obligation. To carry that reasoning to its logical conclusion, a man who is absolved from liability for active service and financial contribution should be absolved from every liability.

There should be an exemption in this subdivision similar to that in subdivision E. It is with tbe utmost reluctance that I shall vote for a proposal to take £ 5 a year from every single pefson in the community, no matter how small his earnings may be. The Treasurer might well make this exemption, because he will not be able to collect the tax.

I do not know of any country worth living in where there is a tax on bachelors, and the Government has not had a mandate fro m the people to propose such a tax here. W it h the exception of the ex-member for Oxley,' no candidate at the last election advocated a tax on bachelors, and I think that his defeat was due largely to several speeches which he made on tlie subject in this House. This is a departure in 'taxation which is without justification.

We hope that after the war a large population may come to this country, but a poll tax of £ 5 a head on bachelors, with the addition of a minimum income tax of' £ 1 , is not an attractive advertisement.

I look upon this as a pernicious tax, altogether unworthy of a progressive community. The Government have no mandate from the country ,to impose what is virtually a tax on bachelors. They have never consulted the people on the question, whereas the Labour party, in imposing the land tax, had a direct mandate from the people to do so. I think the Government would be well advised if they agreed to eliminate this tax on bachelors, and proposed a super-income tax, which all who had the means would cheerfully pay. gravamen of the charge which the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Riley) has made against the Government is thati they have no mandate from the people to impose this tax. He seems to overlook the fact that the conditions to-day are altogether different from those prevailing in time of peace. The Imperial Government, I would remind him, have since the war repeatedly imposed taxation for which they had no mandate from the country. We are perfectly justified, in time of war, in resorting to any form of taxation that will swell the revenue. possible for fhe Government to anticipate to any extent to what particular form of taxation they w ill have to resort, since is really a system of economic conscripthey have to legislate from time to time to meet the exigencies of the situation. The Government are justified in resorting even to the imposition of a bachelor tax to assist in raising the money necessary for the prosecution of this war. The honourable member for South Sydney said that bachelors would be unable to pay this tax, and that the bulk of tlie shearers and shed workers travelling through the country were single men. It was only a few weeks ago that the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court increased the wages of shearers, rouseabouts* and shed hands to the extent of £4,000,000 per annum. A shed hand now receives £ 2 8s. a week, in addition to his keep. Surely he should be able to bear a fair share of the taxation necessary to raise funds for the prosecution of the war. As to the further statement made by the honourable member that many single men are not receiving more than £ 4 0 or £ 5 0 a year, I think that, having regard to the awards of the A r b i have contributed to repatriation funds to tration Courts and Wages Boards, ifc I would ask my honwould be difficult to find in Australia today any young man who is earning less than from £ 1 2 0 to £ 1 5 0 a year. The minimum wage is 9s. per day-fa r more than I received when I was a young man -and I considerfchafc,in dealing with all these matters, we must not lose sight of the fact thafc we are at war, and must adopt extraordinary methods fco raise fche requisite revenue. I have to oppose this subdivision, on the ground thab ifc does not place fairl y on the whole of the people the responsibility of finding the money necessary for the purposes of government. Ifc discriminates to no small extent, and particularly against that section of the community which can least afford to pay. Ifc is most extraordinary that the Government should ask single men receiving £ 1 0 0 a year to pay a tax of £ 5 . I know that the Treasurer is very sincere in the measures he puts before us, but I think that, on this occasion, he has overlooked the fact that, in a great many cases, those who w ill be called upon to pay this tax w ill be unable fco do so. In those circumstances, they will either be sent away or put in gaol. No provision is made for a deferred payment system. So far as these men are It is quite imconcerned, ifc will be a case of pay up or be shut up. If they do not pay up, they w ill probably, be sent away to fight. That tion. ber suggest that a single man cannot pay 2s. a week? South Wales to-day men earning only £100 a year who have nofc £ 5 by them. They are not all carrying on farming operations upon a huge scale' as the honourable member is doing. If , like h'im, they owned large tracts of land, I do not suppose they would be called upon to pay a tax of this kind. They belong to the working section of the community, and it seems to me thafc, on each and every occasion, the workers are called upon to bear the burden. It may be said that those who are asked under this subdivision to pay a tax of £ 5 per annum have not contributed their share towards the repatriation of their comrades at the Front.

It is most iniquitous that a penalty of £ 5 should be paid by every single man in this country. This tax w ill affect a young man who is serving his apprenticeship, and is receiving £ 8 0 or £ 9 0 a year, and even less. There are in Australia to-day men of twenty-one who receive considerably less than £ 1 0 0 a year. A f t e r tbey have paid for their clothes and their keep, they are not likely to have sufficient money to meet this tax. If they are called upon to pay it , they will probably apply to their employers for an increase of wages to enable them to meet the additional liability thus thrown upon them, and that will have the effect of upsetting quite a number of awards. Court, in giving awards, makes no provision for extra taxation; and it is only reasonable to expect that, if this measure be passed, there will be application after application for variations. can see, this taxation is not going to have the expected effect of stimulating recruiting, but, on the contrary, is going to do recruiting much harm. that this taxation is not economical compulsion. for Cook( Mr Catts), on behalf of the Opposition. it on my behalf, for I can see nothing in the proposal except economical compulsion. it is not economic compulsion. am saying that it is-that , instead of stimulating recruiting, it will have the reverse effect. men to join the Forces, tent that, if men cannot pay the taxation, the Government w ill see that they join, by some rule or regulation; and that is what I wish to prevent, in the interests of the particular class affected. what you are going to say. I have said what I desired to say. This taxation is not going to do recruiting any good. The very fact that a man will have ' to pay a penalty for not enlisting twelve or eighteen months ago will annoy h i m ; and, however good his intentions may have been then, he may possibly decide to think over the position, in view of the extra liability he has to meet. All these circumstances have to be taken seriously into consideration. The proposal, considered as a whole scheme, does not seem to me to be in accordance with the best system of government. Apparently, one section of tbe community is to' be penalized, while another section is allowed to go scot-free. If it is the desire of the Treasurer to collect revenue, he ought to direct his attention to some other channels, from which larger amounts might be obtained, and not ask workers receiving only £ 1 0 0 The Arbitration a year to bear the burden. There are many men who will not be affected at all by this taxation, although they possess huge amounts of money, and have never contributed anything towards repatriaSo far as I tion, or .other patriotic purposes-wh o have not attempted in any one instance to assist in bringing about an effective settlement of the war.

The Treasurer, in introducing the measure, said that it repreably, if honourable members opposite were sented the policy of the Government as a whole. He also said that honourable members who had been in public life for a long to do, as it were, by a side track. The time knew that Ministers were not always in accord with the proposals that they adforce into the fighting ranks those who are vocated in the House, but that he was in absolute accord with this measure. Evidently, however, the Government were not in accord, for it was deemed necessary Is. or 200s., as originally proposed, a pento modify the measure, and cut down the original proposal by something like 50 per cent. It is true that the Government have enlarged the scope with a drag-net proposal to embrace men over the age of forty-five. I am not at all concerned about the responsibilities which honourable members opposite will have to carry in connection with these proposals. WhatI am concerned about is the interests of the people who will be unduly oppressed by this legislation. Honourable members opposite will have to take the responsibility of meeting their electors on the point; but there was an honourable member, now missing from this chamber, who had certain fads in regard to a bachelor tax. affected his election in the slightest degree ? member who is missing.

It will be seen that the arise, the question of conscription would again be placed before the people. Many honourable members opposite went much further than the Prime Minister in promising to oppose conscription by means of the referendum, or by a Bill introduced in this House. The people of Australia accepted the assurance of the Prime Minister, and they rely on the Government to keep their promise, not only to the letter, fore us, though all that they have been In my opinion, the proposal immediately before us partly achieves the object which the Government, as a whole, have not the courage to introduce, namely, conscription. Proba more compact body, they would do directly that which they are endeavouring Government proposal has a tendency to eligible, and the fact that the penalty has been reduced does not affect the ethics of the proposal. Whether the penalty be alty is there. Those people who refuse to go to the war-wh o refuse to again present themselves for enlistment so that they may receive a new discharge-wil l have to pay £5. Several honourable members, and not only on this side, have asked what are the Government's intentions in regard to the collection of the tax. Personally, I am not at all anxious that the tax should be collected, but the Government, by strength of numbers, can place it on the statute-book. So far, however, they have not told us what they intend to do with those people from whom they cannot collect. I venture to say that there will be great difliculty in collecting this tax, not only from those who are able to pay, bnt from those who cannot pay. A medical student may be dent! ing an illustration, but I shall say a son of working-class parents, who may be a medical student. The parents of that son will have to pay £5, and, if he be in employment, and earning over £100, a tax of 5 per cent. In my opinion, no taxation which is oppressive or unfair should be imposed; and it is usually accepted that every person shall be taxed particular taxation now proposed is not based on the accepted principle.

As the lionorable member has just pointed out, this tax may develop into a tax on married men. A man who has two sons over twenty-one years of age studying at the University will have to pay the tax imposed on those sons, because they w ill be earning nothing.

The only way in which he could attend the university was by depriving himself of food, and the fact that per cent. on their salaries. he now occupies one of the best positions are just starting out in in this country stands to his credit. If he or his parents had had to pay a tax such as is now proposed, he could not have remained at the university. There are many working men who are struggling to keep their children at universities in order to give them a better opportunity of getting on in the world than they have had. These students should be exempted, and if my amendment is too wide, and will go further than I intend, I am prepared to"" withdraw it if the"" Treasurer will agree that men who are not producing wealth of .any kind, or are not engaged in I wish some occupation shall be exempted. that the case of university students is sufficient to justify the insertion of a paragraph specially exempting them. on eligibles 'with the idea of compelling them to enlist, but by the extension of the age it has become a bachelor tax.

I ask those who have put u p p it if u l appeals for the single man, What man can keep a wife on £ 5 a year?

I ask the Treasurer to seriously consider these representations, feeling sure that if he does he will again "" see the l i g h t . "" I think that this measure, like another recently before the House, should be withdrawn for docking and overhaul. If the Government desire to obtain money for repatriation, in order to keep f a i th with our soldiers at the Front, they should tackle this big question in a big way. Our soldiers and their dependants are crying out for some proper system of repatriation, and yet the Treasurer comes along with a miserable proposal, the purpose of which is to tax a man because he will not get married. It is not worthy of the Treasurer, or of a big-hearted Australian; and I believe, if he gives this matter a little further consideration, he will withdraw the B ill , and approach this important question in a broad national spirit. have not any intention of delaying the Committee for any length of time, but I would not like to give a silent vote on a matter like this. I am somewhat at issue with the Treasurer ( Sir John Forrest), and I wish that he had kept to his original proposal for a 10 per cent, tax, because we would be perfectly justified in asking those who have not made any sacrifice to contribute financially towards this scheme for the repatriation of our soldiers. It is a matter of surprise to me to hear complaints from honourable members on the' other side of the chamber about the threatened infliction of a small amount of taxation upon the single men of Australia. 'Surely they can afford to pay something. money into the war loan at 4£ per cent. done to assist Red Cross work, and other similar, activities, is infinitesimal. not strange that, after nearly six years of Labour rule, during which time millions upon millions of borrowed money was spent in this country, there should' now be any talk about poverty ? Look at the enormous addition to our national debt. In New South Wales alone, under Labour rule, there has been an increase of nearly £30,000,000 of borrowed money in Honourable the last four years, and there has been a heavy increase also in Western* Australia and other States; and yet honourable members opposite dare now to talk of destitution and misery in this country. there is destitution ? , tion. by the extravagant policy and the disloyal utterances of honourable members opposite. 14s. a week' in some of our factories. hundreds of people would be glad to give girls 14s. and 15s. a week, with their keep, if only they would go into service.

Bub, about two hours after he had introduced this measure, directing his special attention to the paragraph now under discussion, he had heard sufficient from his own supporters to make him forget those eloquent periods of his, and to hasten round the benches in an effort to find out where he stood in regard to the proposals. The paragraph is purely penal. I need not pause to argue that point, because it was well demonstrated by my learned senior, the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr. Maxwell), when he spoke yesterday. It is, as a matter of fact, purely penal; and to call it taxation is a mere misuse of language. It is not taxation, but punishment proposed for certain classes of persons because the Government could nofc reach them in another way with the referendum last year. There has been some doubt expressed as to how the fine is to be recovered. It is to be imposed on ypung men without means.

The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Wise) told us not to be afraid-that there is no imprisonment attached to the penalty, and that if a man cannot pay there is an end to it . warrant. than that. I could tell my lay friend of quite a number of devices that. the law provides for dealing with persons of that kind. It would be absurd enough if the Government proposed a taxation measure without any method of collecting it, but they know that there are methods at their disposal. There is, for instance, in operation in this country what is known as the Fraudulent Debtors Act, When I mentioned that Act yesterday somebody-interjected that the Government would not for one moment think of applying it in respect of men who had no means. But I ask whether the Government, who seek to fine and penalize men with no means, would' not be prepared to resort to that or any other Act to give effect to their desires? The proposed measure will not help the Government in the slightest degree, except as a penal Act. The Government were thwarted by means of the referendum;, and to-day, by way of giving effect to their promise to win the waron the eve of their slinking into recess with their whole programme unaccomplished and promises unfulfilled-the y come with this paltry penal measure to impose a fine on men on whom they bad hoped the referendum would act. Is the conscription of wealth involved in the section now under discussion? I venture to tell honourable members that the proposal involves conscription of more than the wealth of a certain class of people. It says, "" We do not propose to take your all, but to penalize you in the most drastic way if you have not that ' a l l ' we desire to take."" Government, being wedded to the princases have been brought under my notice ciple of conscription, and smarting, as since this measure was introduced.

It has been variously said that the clause might or might not be successf u l as a method of economic conscription. When the Leader of the Opposition ( MT . Tudor) said that he did not think it would be effective as a means of constraining young men to go to the Front, honourable members opposite asked, ""Them why talk about economic conscription?"" I say that the taxation will not operate, and'would not have operated even in its original form,' in the direction of enhancing to any material extent the number of recruits. Honourable members opposite, and the Government, entirely misapprehend the reasons which move the young men of this country .who have not, up to the present, enlisted for war service. They fail to appreciate the real reasons; indeed, T doubt if they have ever tried to appreciate them. them, which are suggested to me by the paragraph under discussion. The reasons, cannot be found in those terms of abuse such as "" disloyalist,"" "" shirker,"" "" proGernian,"" and other vindictive and virulent epithets. Some of the reasons are, as I say, suggested to me by the paragraph. I see it is proposed to tax, for instance, &. young unmarried man, who may be the sole support of mother, sister) invalid or crippled brothera young unmarried man, who may be, in a variety of ways, which this Committee cannot possibly understand, discharging all the duties of citizenship to the very fullest extent. judge each case. that the responsibility which the Government dare not take is to be shifted on to the shoulders of the Commissioner.

That is a grave scandal, aggravated by the fact that the Treasurer, and his Government have utterly failed to impose taxation upon those persons in the community who can best bear it . To me, it is more than repugnant-it is repulsive-fha t we should be faced with the position that men who have grown to mature years in this country, lived in peaceful times, and accumulated great wealth should, in this hour of dark distress and difficulty, through their representatives in Parliament, be diligently evading their responsibilities to the country, and saddling them upon those who are least able to bear them.

If they are anxious to raise money for the purpose of doing justice to our soldiers, why do they not bring down a graduated income tax, which will fall upon themselves and upon those who stand behind them, who have made profits from the increased cost of living, not only out of those who remain behind,. and whom they term shirkers, but also out of dependants of tbe men whom they talk of helping? But we hear nothing about bringing down a genuine' measure to help these men. Instead, we have a vindictive and petty effort to force men to go to the Pront.

610,Mr Glynn (Angas,"Minister f o rwhile section 81 of the Constitution provides that all moneys raised by the Government shall form one consolidated f u n d , to be appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth. As this B ill deals with taxation, no other subject can be in troduced in it , because section 55 of the Constitution provides to the contrary. The Treasurer, therefore, proposes to follow the only constitutional course open to him, by providing in another B ill to be introduced forthwith, that the revenue raised by means of this tax shall be appropriated for repatriation purposes. I do not intend to allow this measure to pass without making a final protest against it . In the first place, I think the title of t u r n e d , ^ impose this taxation, the result the B ill is wrong, since it provides for a tax, not on incomes, biit on bachelors. The original motion introduced by the Treasurer provided for a special tax on all single men, and widowers without children, between the ages of twenty-one and forty-five years. Finding that there was strong opposition to that proposal, the Treasurer, in order to pacify his party, so extended the provision as to include every unmarried person in the Commonwealth, with the exception of old-age pensioners and one or two others. I wish to p u t my protest on record, so that when' the day of reckoning comes-as it w ill come when the Government proceed to collect this t a x I shall be able to point to 'the fact that I anticipated that difficulties would present themselves. The Government are proposing that aged men, who are obtaining from a little property just sufficient to make it impossible for them to obtain an old-age pension, a tax of £ 5 per annum. These old men might not have a total income of more than £ 5 0 or £ 6 0 a year. might have a little property, to obtain which they have struggled hard, and the income from which, while barely sufficient to keep them, debars them from obtaining an old-age pension, and the Governmentare now proposing to take from that scanty income £ 5 a year. A sum of. £ 5 may not appear of much consequence to honourable members who enjoy a regular income, but it is a big amount to the poor man who is struggling hard to gain his daily bread. orable member has mentioned would be incapacitated for work witbin the meaning of the law. Eveni f he were, he would have to go through certain formalities in order to secure the exemption. It is a disgrace that such a tax as this should be imposed by a Parliament, not one member of which at the recent elections told the people that if returned he would support the imposition of a tax on the single men of Australia. their supporters had not the courage to do so. general elections the people had known that the Government intended, if rewould have been different. The Ministerial party would have been in opposition to-day. As originally introduced, the Government proposal was to impose a special tax of £ 1 0 on a l l eligibles who had not volunteered. Subsequently it was widened so as to include all single men, and was reduced to £ 5 , or 5 per cent, of the taxable income, whichever is the greater amount. Had the people known that the Government intended to do this, they would not have returned them with a majority. trouble about that if I were the honourable member.

The Treasurer, who taunts me in this way, has said, time after time, that he would not be prepared to impose any further direct taxation on the wealthy people of this country, either for repatriation or any other purpose.

Honourable members will notice that this measure does not make any mention of the existing exemption of £ 1 5 6 .

Consequenbly I move That the amendments be agreed to. these amendments en bloc? explanation of them. Sir JOHN FORREST happy to give the desired explanation. The first amendment of the Senate is in clause 4, where it is proposed to leave out the words "" of foodstuffs, the produce of Australia, for the purposes of manufacture or sale."" These words have been omitted because they have been in serted in clause 8, and it is unnecessary to duplicate them. The second amendtion of "" co'-operative company."" It is proposed that the following definition be inserted:"" 'Partnership' includes beneficiaries under a w ill , settlement, or other deed of trust, who are carrying on business j o in t l y . "" That is necessary to protect the beneficiaries. The thir d amendment made in the same clause inserts after bhe word "" A u s t r a l i a "" the words "" so f a r as regards the manufacture, preparation, or wholesale distribution of [11.35] I foodstuffs, the produce of Australia."" That amendment relates to the definition of a co-operative company, to which I have already referred. That seems f a i r and reasonable, and has been approved by the Government. It is also proposed to insert in clause 8, after paragraph / , which defines the businesses to which the tax applies, the following new paragraph:""and (g) businesses commenced since the fourth day of August One thousand nine hundred and fourteen for the purposes of mining for wolfram, molybdenite, tungsten, scheelite, or any other rare metal used in the manufacture of munitions of war, if the output of the mine is disposed of to the Imperial GovernCommittee (Consideration of ment."" In clauses 12, 15, 16, and 59 the words "" to the satisfaction of the Commissioner "" or "" it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner t h a t "" have been struck out, the object of the amendment being to give the taxpayers a wider appeal to the Board of Referees or the Court, as the case may be. The amendment does not interfere with the discretionary powers of the Commissioner generally, but prevents a final determination by h i m on questions on which the taxpayer may appeal. Clause 15 is amended also in respect of deductions for wear and tear or for expenditure of a capital nature for renewals, & c , by leaving out the words and if allowed shall be only of sueh amount as appears to the Commissioner to be reasonably and properly attributable to the year or accounting period.
