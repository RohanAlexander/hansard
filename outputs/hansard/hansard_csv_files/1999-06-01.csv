I would like to say a few things about some of the specific areas of policy that are covered One of the more amazing things in the in the budget and were given some promieducation field was the government's pennynence. Before the budget was released, the pinching attitude to an equitable scholarship Prime Minister made great play that it was scheme for tertiary students.

This going to be a budget for research. Everybody budget proposes to give public schools $10 in this parliament will get up and make a extra per student each year. On the other speech about how important it is to be a hand, it proposes to give private schools an creative nation, how important it is for our extra $210 per year per student. There is no future to invest in R&D and things of that shred of decency, there is no principle that the kind. In the build-up to this budget, as part of government can identify that justifies that their public relations spin, the government totally distorted and divisive policy.
