25,Mr Hill (Echuca,"Minister f o rI t will be noted that of the total amount granted under the provisions of the two previous measures, approximately £400,000 is still available; but it should be remembered that practically the full amount, or £918,540, to be exact, has been expended, or committed for works in hand. Honourable members who represent Western Australian constituencies have complained from time to time that the Government of that State has been unable to find sufficient money to take advantage of the grant on the £1 for £1 basis, but reference to the table I have just read will show that of a total amount of £192,000 allocated to that State, the sum of £173,114 has been expended or authorized for expenditure. is appreciated. have also heen made in behalf of the Tasmanian Government that that State has been unable to take full advantage of the grant because of the conditions attached to it. Up to the end of the year only 20 per cent, of the total Tasmanian allocations had been expended, but I am glad to say that since then, the total expenditure or commitments there account for 60 per cent, of the allocations. should like to point out that, at first, expenditure in nearly all the States was retarded by reason of the fact that some time elapsed before the necessary machinery in relation to the scheme could be got into proper running order. Prior to the institution of the Commonwealth main roads development scheme, it was the practice of several of the States to spend the bulk of their road votes on existing roads. The greater portion of the money allocated as Federal road grants has been expended on entirely new roads. necessitated, in many cases, complete surveys, and the re-location of proposed roads in localities varying from wet, billy, heavily-timbered country to dry, sandy, and open plains. In some of the States, it was found that the existing technical staffs needed augmenting to some extent, to carry out the surveys and supervision of construction, for in most cases the shires were not able, for a considerable time, to detail their engineers to will enable the various States to do the work. As a matter of fact, not many of the local authorities were organized to do the work. It would have been very easy to spend the money on existing roads already located and graded, and easy of access, but it was provided for roads which would develop new country, -and in order to ensure that it would be satisfactorily expended, the preliminary work has taken much time. As all expenditure has to be carefully scrutinized and passed by the Auditors-General in the various States before claims for reimbursement can be made on the Commonwealth, it is often some months after the expenditure has been incurred that a claim for the Commonwealth's share is made by the State Governments, noted by the Federal Auditor-General, and appears as Commonwealth expenditure. The works in all the States are now being considerably accelerated. This is due to a more complete understanding of the Commonwealth Government's requirements. I have no doubt that if the proposals of the Government as set out in the bill, are approved, the whole of the present unexpended balances, together with the amount of £1,000,000 to be made available by the Governments of the Commonwealth and the respective States during the current year, and the additional I £250,000 which the Commonwealth Government proposes to advance free of contribution by the States, for the purpose of reconditioning and strengthening main roads, will have been expended or commitments entered into with regard to it. In passing, I may say that the introduction of the bill has been unavoidably delayed, but the Government has authorized the various States to proceed with and complete works in hand, or to undertake extensions of existing works, on the basis-of a grant of one-twelfth of last year's allocation per month. The This has States have, therefore, already formulated their plans for the ensuing year. Our object in adopting this policy was to permit of continuity in the employment of workers, as well as in the activity of contractors. The period for which that authorization was made has now expired, and I ask honourable members to give the bill their close attention so that it may be passed at the earliest possible moment. .

26,Mr Mann,That shows that the grant,16,Second Reading
27,Mr Hill,"That is so. Complaintsof roads have been cleared, formed or constructed with money voted by the Commonwealth Government. That is valuable evidence of the beneficial results of the scheme to the country. The details are:Length of roads cleared Length of roads still to be cleared, from the grants Length of roads formed and metalled (or gravelled) .. Length of roads still to ibe formed and metalled (or gravelled) .. Those figures bear eloquent testimony to the permanently beneficial effects of the adoption of this policy. If the Commonwealth grant had not been made available, many roads that are now in use would not have been constructed. Possibly the work would have been delayed for a number of years. Inorder to provide for continuity of employment and the adoption of a comprehensive main roads programme, I ask honourable members possible of the proposals in the bill. In the absence of an assurance of some measure of continuity of programme, the authorities are handicapped on account of the difficulty in obtaining suitable tenders for the carrying out of the authorized works. tender for works of this nature, and to provide expensive road plant, unless they can see the possibility of the works continuing for some time. From the point of view of economical construction, therefore, it is advisable that this further grant be made available during this year. In this connection I shall read an extract from the report of MrW . Calder, chairman of the Victorian Country Roads Board, which he submitted on his return from his tour of 'inquiry in Great Britain and the TJnited States of Americai n connection with subjects relating to road problems: Without the assurance of funds in sight for a period of years ahead no systematic programme of work can be planned. The country people become disheartened with the deferred hope of improved conditions, and the exodus of the young men from the country to city will continue. One of our greatest needs is population, and particularly the peopling of our empty spaces. If we cannot keep our own settlers and their families contented, and the main cause of discontent in settlersis the condition of the country roads, it is useless to expect the most desirable immigrants-fwrmer B of British stock-to settle in a country where the roads are so short of the standard to which they have been accustomed. The want of a continuous policy of construction is also uneconomical as regards cost, inasmuch that with no definite assurance of the amount of work in sight, contractors are not encouraged to procure tlie plant and equipMiles. ment, without which work on a large scale .. 700 cannot be carried on expeditiously aud cheaply. IF, ou completion of a contract, there be .. .. .. 250 delay in Jetting of new contracts through shortage of funds, the contractor has one of 1,1 SO1 two alternatives-to realize on his teams and plant, probably at some sacrifice; or leave for .. 300 nuother district or State. When work is again renewed, competition is lessened, and equipment may have to be transported from a distance, and the eost of this transportation is added to the cost of the work. The proposal to advance to the States a further sum of £250,000 for the purpose of reconditioning and strengthening portions of the existing main roads in the various States is, in the opinion of the Government, sound. I desire to emphasize that this £250,000 is not to be exto approve as soon as pended merely in filling pot holes, but for reconditioning and strengthening those main roads that come within the meaning of the act, so that when the work is completed they w ill be equal to newly constructed roads. It is pointed out that in some of the States diffiContractors are not inclined to culty is experienced in providing the moneys necessary for the maintenance of existing roads, owing to the contributions on the £ 1 for £ 1 basis which they are called upon to provide under the existing legislation. Much of the money which has usually been spent on the maintenance of existing roads, is being utilized on the class of roads provided for in the Commonwealth act, the result being that many of the important existing roads are in a bad state of repair. The proposal in the bill is submitted with a view to meeting this difficulty to some extent at least. Honourable members will agree that, while the Government is to be commended for making available the sum of £250,000 for this purpose, that amount is really only like a drop in the bucket. It would be more appropriate if we were to spend £25,000,000 on road construction. A t a later stage I shall explain the reason why the Government considers that £250,000 is ample for present requirements. It is not the intention of the Federal Government to relieve the State Governments or municipal authorities of their ordinary obligations in regard to roads. vanced by the Commonwealth, together with the corresponding snms made available by the States have been, and are being, utilized in the construction of main developmental roads, the object being to extend and promote the development of the Commonwealth by the provision of roads which will enable the produce of a district to be economically and expeditiously transported to market. Road construction, generally speaking, is the function of the State authorities. It has, however, long been recognized that, in order to enable this country to develop as rapidly as its natural resources justify us in trusting that it may, and to absorb the large number of oversea settlers that we hope to induce to settle here, means of communication in outlying districts are an urgent necessity. The States cannot be expected, without some aid from the Federal Government, to cope with the demand for these arteries of communication. I think that honourable members generally will agree that the Government has adopted the right course in this matter. It will be of interest to honourable members if I refer to the policy of road construction adopted by the Federal Government in the TJnited States of America. the importance of linking up all the States and . their principal centres of population by means of .a national system of roads, and its responsibilities in this connection, has passed legislation providing for the construction, in cooperation with the States, of approximately 180,000 miles of main roads. Grants are made to the various States on a £1 for £1 basis, the total appropriation of federal funds for this purpose between 1916 and 1923 amounting to approximately £90,000,000. which is known as the Federal Aid Highways System, is controlled by the Bureau of Public Roads established by the central government. By the '31st December, 1923, 23,291 miles of federal aid roads were completed, the roads completed and under construction in pursuance of this scheme now being about 57,000 miles. The expenditure on all roads throughout the TJnited States of America during the last few years has amounted to approximately £230,000,000 per annum, which indicates the value that that country places.upon the provision of Mr Bill. The moneys adfacilities for the rapid and economical transportation of goods to markets, and for enabling the settlers and residents-of the remote districts to maintain a closer intercourse with the commercial centres of the nation than would otherwise be possible. In the Dominion of Canada the central government has passed legislation under which grants are made to the various provinces for expenditure on main roads connecting markets or cities. The appropriation for this purpose under the 1919 act was $20,000,000, to be spread over a period of five years. The policy adopted in the two countries referred to is an indication that it is realized that central governments are vitally interested in road construction, as under the prevailing economic conditions, action to improve the conditions associated with the marketing of a country's primary produce is a matter for the whole nation. It can be fairly claimed that the Commonwealth Government's action in instituting the main roads development grants has assisted very materially in this direction. The total expenditure incurred on road construction in Great Britain during 1921-2 amounted to £42,000,000, as against £17,500,000 in 1914-15. I am unable to state exactly the amount spent on road developThat Government, realizing ment in the Commonwealth, but it is approximately £14,500,000 per annum. Of this amount the State contributions represent £2,000,000, and municipal contributions, £12,000,000. I do not think there is any necessity for me to further stress the desirability of providing, to the greatest possible extent, suitable means of communication throughout the Commonwealth. When one takes into consideration the distance of Australia from the markets of the world, and the cost which has to be incurred before This system, the produce can be placed on those markets, the necessity for roads which will enable those costs at the source of production to be reduced to a minimum is apparent. In the absence of roads connecting our agricultural, pastoral, and mining centres with railways and local markets, what hope have we of developing our out-back country, cor. what to-day are regarded as the waste spaces of the Commonwealth? What hope have we of settling upon the land migrants from, overseas, or even our own people, or of competing in the world's markets with countries that are in closer touch with those markets, and have road systems designed to reduce to a minimum the costs of the producer 1 The development of this country, with its great natural resources, must of necessity be retarded unless the road construction programme throughout the Commonwealth is considerably in creased. While our finances will riot permit of an expenditure comparable with that in the TJnited States of America, the future of our country demands that every possible effort shall be made in the direction of extending and improving our road system. The betterment of the living and working conditions of the out-back settler, who has enough natural difficulties to contend with, w ill , I am sure, receive the sympathetic consideration of the House, and there is no doubt that one of his worse difficulties is the bad condition of the roads. This, I am convinced, is responsible in a great measure for the d r if t ments have co-operated heartily with the of poptilation from the ""country to the already overcrowded cities. Twenty years ago traffic over country roads was confined almost wholly to horse-drawn and bullock-drawn vehicles. motor-driven vehicle has become so much a part of our commercial and social lives that no district or town can hope for advancement, unless the roads leading thereto are reasonably capable of providing for such traffic. The economic losses incurred throughout the Commonwealth by reason of the condition of a great proportion of our country roads must amount to an enormous figure. The heavy wear and tear on motor cars and vehicles, and the excessive consumption of petrol due to the bad condition of most of our country roads, must account for many thousands of pounds per annum, apart from the losses incurred through delayed transport of produce to markets, and of the materials required by the man on the I j n d . I draw attention to the fact that the works carried out as a result of these grants have given a great deal of employment throughout the Commonwealth. already expended under the two Commonwealth acts, complaints have from time to. time been addressed to me by honourable members regarding the exclusion of roads in this or that district. I remind honourable members that the selection of the roads recommended for inclusion in the scheme rests with the State authorities. Shire councils and roads boards have approached me and asked to be allowed to participate in the grant. The proper procedure is for those bodies to make their representations to the State authority-eithe r the Country Roads Board or the Public Works Department-and if their requests are approved by the State authority and forwarded to me, they will receive the same favorable consideration as has been extended to all proposals that have reached me from the State Governments. If roads so recommended come within the four corners of the act, they receive my approval. It cannot be expected that the amount of money made available under the two acts, together with the corresponding contributions by the State Governments, will be sufficient to cover more than a small proportion of the roads which are deserving of inclusion. The best use possible has been made of the money available, and the State GovernCommonwealth, and have shown a desire to assist in spending the money where it will be most effective in developing the resources of the country. Realizing the To-day, the benefits derived from the works already carried out, the Government v ill at a later stage consider the desirability of extending the operation and scope of the act, so far as the expenditure in future years is concerned, with che object of presenting to the House a more comprehensive scheme of road construction. It will be necessary, first of all, to confer with the States with a view to drawing up a programme of road construction for a period of years. Continuity of policy and work must be assured, together with-and this is of the utmost importance-the maintenance of the roads so constructed and existing main roads. It will be futile for the Commonwealth or the States to engage in a big road construction programme unless ample provision is made for the maintenance of the roads In my opinion, road patrols sliould be established for the maintenance of all roads upon which Commonwealth In connection with the moneys money has been expended. The yearly cost of maintaining in first-class condition a road, the construction of which cost £4,000 per mile, would be from £ 1 2 0 to £130 per mile. good repair, and tarred for an annual charge of from 3 to 3£ per cent, on the capital cost.

29,Mr Hill,"A road could be kept i nensure thai; no road is laid down unless ample provision is made for its maintenance. It may be suggested that the grant which the Government proposes to make is not sufficient, but the unexpended balance of £2.50,000, which, together with the £500,000 which is being made available on a £ 1 for £ 1 basis, plus the £250,000 to be given by the Commonwealth without contribution by the States, will make £1,000.000 available for expenditure this year. As their expenditure in the previous two vears amounted to only £600,000-admittedly , they had difficulties to overcomethe States will able task in expending in twelve months. H ad the previous grants been f u l l y expended, the Government would have taken into consideration at once a programme of road construction over a period of years; but will be f u l l y occupied in spending £1,000,000 this year, ' and we hope to bring forward a more comprehensive I recommend the bill to the favorable consideration of the House. Every one recognizes the value of good roads, especially in out-back districts. I have suffered for a great many years from the disadvantages of bad roads. I live in a district that has been settled for three-quarters of a century, and yet, to-day, there are not good roads in that district to market towns distant only 14 or 15 miles. Boads that have been made have worn out in the space of ten or twelve years. T urge honourable members to approve of bhe Government's proposals, which have for their object the development and settlement of this great continent. This bill will secure the support of most honourable members. We all recognize the necessity for good roads, especially in this age, when we have so much motor traffic. I believe that in country districts it would be preferable to spend money upon roads rather than upon railways. The cost would be less, and better facilities would be given to people in remote districts to get their produce to market. Any financial assistance which the Commonwealth can give to the States for the construction of good roads will be money well .spent. I was very glad to hear the Minister for Works and Bailways( MrH ill ) say that ho will endeavour after this year to see that proper supervision is exercised in the expenditure of these grants, so as to secure the necessary maintenance of roads already laid down, in addition to extensions and new roads. No matter how much we spend on road construction, if adequate provision is not made for the maintenance of the roads in a proper state of' repair, the money will be wasted. There is a tendency on the part of public bodies to yield to requests for bhe expenditure of money on new roads without due regard to the fact that roads have a consideralready laid down must be properly main£1,000,000 tained. Boads that are f u l l of pot-holes are very unsatisfactory. In most of the Statesi t will be found that roads constructed in years past have not been properly maintained. It is risky to travel' over some of tbem, and they are quite we assume that the States unfitted for heavy traffic. I was a member of the State Parliament when the Local Government A ct of New South Wales was passed, and the amount availscheme at a later date. able for main road construction was dependent on the expenditure by the Government at the time. The Parliament lost sight of the fact that when a local authority is established, as development takes place within its boundaries, peonle agitate for the construction of roads to meet the settlement, and so additional expenditure is incurred, and insufficient money is provided to keep in a proper state of repair the roads that have been made. dowment was cut down also. before the Government endowment was reduced, many main . roads had been allowed to get into a deplorable state.

The Minister should look to it that roads constructed with these grants are properly maintained. co-operation with the State authorities in the expenditure . of the grant, and proper means being taken to supervise the work.

I particularly appreciate the proposed additional advance of £250,000 which is to be made without conditions as to subsidy or its expenditure upon developmental roads only. In New South Wales it must be recognized that there is great danger of the whole structure of local government falling to the ground. Local Government Act of that State, and even the amending act of 1919 were passed at a time when the possible development of motor transport was not realized. What has caused the trouble is that when the original act was passed the duties of local governing bodies were almost limited to keeping in good order roads leading to. the railway stations. The whole of the circumstances have beeu revolutionized by the introduction of motor traffic. In my own electorate there are two main arterial roads, the northern and the western road. The western road traverse's the whole of the electorate for a distance of about 140 miles. Almost the whole of the motor traffic from Sydney to the western portion of the State goes over these roads through the shires and municipalities between Blayney and St. Mary's. It is quite impossible for ihe local bodies concerned, without assistance, to keep those roads in a good condition for traffic. Much work has been done by tbe Blue Mountains shire. made to the Main Eoads Board established by the last State Government. I was very glad to hear the Minister state that his department intends to see that these grants are not used to relieve State Governments of what should be' their own obligations. We know the present financial position of the State Governments, and unless the expenditure is watched there is danger that some of the proposed grant of £250,000 may be expended to relieve State Governments of reof a chain lies in its weakest link, and sponsibilities they should bear themselves.

The suggestion to substitute new roads for railways, as far as wheat growing is concerned, is out of all question. I ask the Minister to give special assistance in instances where main roads pass through the corners of shires.

Fault has been found in some districts with the regulation which provides that no money is to be granted on roads running parallel with railways. This regulation has inflicted a certain hardship. of Western Australia is a main road used by the pastoralists and others travelling through the country between the Murchison line and the town of Moora. The road runs along the railway line for 70 miles, and then there is a sand patch which the ordinary motor car driver finds it impossible to negotiate. It is true that some drivers traverse it, but they do so purely as a driving test. I have already suggested to the Minister that a portion of this grant should be made available for (putting this main trunk road into a passable condition. In the present circumstances a person has to go due north from Moora, then east, then north for a long distance, and then west, to reach a certain town on the midlands line. All that extra travelling is necessary because the conditions governing this grant prevent the local authorities from making the direct road passable Some complaints have been made respecting the condition that a minimum of £1,000 must be spent on a given work on one road.

In the Esperance district of Western Australia, for instance, there is a lot of natural stony road surface, with sandy patches at intervals. Along the Esperance to Salmon Gums railway the country is 'only surveyed for 12 miles on either side. Consequently, stretches of only 12 miles of road are necessary. It is unfortunate Running into the north-west that, although a good many of the roads in this area have fine natural surfaces for considerable distances, intermittent sand patches render them absolutely impossible for the hauling of wheat. This is a new district, which has very little money available for road work. If £200, or a little more, could be spent in making a road across these sandy patches in different localities the people would be provided with satisfactory roads. been made available shows that in several places in the honourable member's own constituency works which cost less than £1,000 were constructed, out of the grant. ter that these complaints that I am voicing were made to me by members of roads boards. They are not imaginary in any sense. It has been suggested that where a road crosses a railway line it should be considered to be the same road on either side of the line. That would enable many contracts to come within the £1,000 regulation.

Victoria, however, is gridironed with railways. It has been developing for ninety years. question the fairness of the basis upon which the grant is made. I am not at all sure that the population basis is the best that could be fixed. Western Australia contains one-third of the territory of the continent, and her need of roads is probably greater than that of any other State. I do not desire, at present, to argue at length along that line. I may say in conclusion that I believe it would be advantageous if a number of the roads boards in the more sparsely populated districts of Western Australia would amalgamate. They would then spend less on staff maintenance, and would be able to undertake contracts for themselves. Misapprehension has existed in parts of Western Australia as to the conditions under which the road grant must be impended. were under the impression that tbe work had to be done by the State Public Works Department, and their experience of its activities, in some cases, was uot at of the country to defend itself; but are all satisfactory. for instance, the Public Works Department started a gang of men on a road contract a mile away from the point where the road ought to have commenced. The men had made a mile of road before the error was discovered. Works Department there also seems tq be obsessed with this continuous road idea that is in the mind of the Minister, and it has constructed roads over natural surfaces that need not have been touched. It seems to be governed by red tape methods, and often spends more than, is necessary to make roads quite passable. am sorry that I am unable to join in the general chorus in praise of this bill. Of course, everybody agrees as to the necessity and desirability of making good roads in Australia. We want more roads and better roads. The question is, Who should make them ? Shouldi t be the Commonwealth Government or the State Governments ? In proposing, year by year, legislation of this character the Commonwealth Parliament is placing itself in a difficult position. . It is merely granting financial subventions instead of devoting its revenue to the work which should properly concern it. Although the Commonwealth Parliament has no power to legislate for main roads as such, I might, if I cared to do so, we are discussing a bill the object of which, as we all know perfectly well, is to make possible the construction, of main roads, without considering at all whether this admittedly desirable object is one of the objects with which the Commonwealth legislature ought to conce.ru itself. I venture to assert, although I know it will be unpopular to do so, tliat in passing legislation of this description we are not acting constitutionally. This Parliament has no power to legislate for main roads. It has power, of course, to grant financial assistance to States which need it.

We should be in an entirely different position if the GoThe Public vernment had brought down a measure to provide for the construction of main roads between the capital cities of Australia based upon strategic considerations that had the backing of its technical defence advisers. This bill does not pretend to provide for anything of that character, as honourable members know very well. It cannot be said that the States require financial assistance from the Commonwealth. Does Victoria, for instance, require such assistance? The bill, cannot be effectively defended on that ground.

I contend that ' if money is voted for main road construction, provision should also be made for the maintenance of the roads that are constructed. No proposal of that nature has been suggested. There is no certainty that these subventions will continue. It is only because the Federal Government has more money than it knows how to spend. that these grants have been made. The revenue of the Commonwealth comes mainly from the States of Victoria and New South Wales. This money is being spent upon a basis involving a consideration of both area and population. The result is that tbe States which have already developed their territory from their own funds are now being called upon to assist in the development of States which are larger, and whose development commenced later. It may be that this is a proper thing; that the main roads should be a charge upon the whole of the people of Australia, instead of on the people of the several States; but in that case this matter should be considered by the whole of the people of Australia. If they want this Parliament to deal with our main roads, let them say so. The people of Victoria and New South Wales would then know that they were providing money for the construction of badly needed roads in Queensland, Western Australia, and. elsewhere. the Federal Government of the United States of America made under a similar section of their constitution? I have not studied that aspect of the constitution of the United States of America. There is one further point to which I desire to direct attention. It is generally agreed that one of the functions of Parliament is to keep a careful watch on the expenditure of money. It is for that reason that detailed estimates of expenditure are annually brought before us. But in this bill there is no schedule of the works to be undertaken. I recognize that to supply such a schedule is impossible, because this House, constituted as it is, cannot pretend to have a local knowledge of all the items that would appear in it. The result is that a large sum of money is being placed at the disposal of the Minister without any direction from the House as to the way in which it shall be spent. different in connection with other expenditure. It may bo said that the States have not sufficient money for road-making; but with equal force it may be argued that the reason that the Commonwealth has funds at its disposal is that it is imposing so much taxation that it has more money than it needs, and is, therefore, prepared to spend it lavishly. Lf we. were to reduce Commonwealth taxation, and to confine ourselves to our proper functions, the States would find it easier to raise the money required for their roads! The making of roads is a State function. The Commonwealth is collecting too much money from the people, and is expending upon a State basis money which has been collected upon a Federal basis, and that without the matter having first been submitted to the judgment of the people. Mention has been, made of the desirability of fixing a minimum of £1,000 in respect of any one road-making undertaking to which the Commonwealth shall contribute. The Minister said that the regulation to that effect was not enforced. Of what use is a regulation 'if it is not enforced 1 If existing regulations are wrong, they should be amended; but while they remain they should be enforced strictly. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr A. Green) invited the Minister to reduce the minimum to £200. ' I suggest that if we had some guarantee that this money was being spent upon a I do not know, as well-considered scheme, honourable members would derive much more satisfaction from voting for the bill. We know that it is impossible in some weathers to drive a motor car from Melbourne to Sydney. That is a condition of affairs which should be altered. Main roads which could be regarded as having a strategic value might possibly be brought within the control of the Commonwealth, but it would appear that this money is to be spent upon ordinary developmental road-making.

Having regard to those statistics, I hope that honourable members representing city constituencies will not support the objections raised by the honourable member for Kooyong. 1 only knowledge he has of roads is gained by pleasure motoring.

To develop Australia, country life must be made more congenial, and we must endeavour to induce young men and women who have been reared on farms to regard country life as their destiny. The way to do that is to make country life more attractive. This problem must be dealt with iu a broad and generous spirit. Academic objections to this measure should not be allowed to hope they will support my request to the Minister to increase the grant to £2.000,000, and thus assist the State down roads that will be a national asset, a tremendous assistance to rural production, and a great convenience to the man on the land. congratulate the Government upon the continuance of the principle of making Commonwealth money available for the construction of main and feeder roads.

64,Mr Prowse (Forrest) [4.55],"Iof the Commonwealth expenditure upon roads within Slates does not concern me. I heartily approve of the Commonwealth assisting the States to make good roads. This expenditure from a fund to which -both Commonwealth and States contribute, is still a novelty, and the regulations controlling it are still the subject of a good deal of complaint. The State of Victoria, having a good Country Eoads Board, seems to have been better prepared than other States to handle this mixed grant. In Western Australia the Country Roads Boards were able to spend properly the money that was raised formerly by local taxation and grants from the State Government, but in connection with the Commonwealth grant an unfortunate conflict seems to have occurred between-the Works Department of the State and the Commonwealth authorities. The Minister read to the House a statement by a Victorian expert that unless this grant were made continuous young men would be flocking from the country to the cities. The tendency in Western Australia has been to send from the city to the country for the carrying out of this work men unaccustomed to it , and, as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie said, the work has been done clumsily. The men who had been accustomed to build roads for the local board were squeezed out, and the roads built out of the fund contributed equally by the Commonwealth and the States have not been made with anything like the same efficiency as hitherto. I could mention in my own electorate instances similar to the Moora road to which the honourable member for Kalgoorlie referred. There is plenty of room for improvement in the administration of this money, but the regulations should be strictly observed, and the grants should not be used for political purposes by any government in any State. The purpose for which the money is granted is the construction of,roads in the country, but the people complain that they do not get half the value they used to get for a given amount of money. I think that that grievance can be rectified, and I understand that the Minister is giving attention to it . member think is wrong? member for Kalgoorlie pointed out, gangs are sent from Perth to do work in the country according to a red-tape system. The Roads Boards understood the work thoroughly, aud if they were given a little more money the people would get greater value. ning more smoothly now. that; but its operation was very rough when I was last in my district. WhilstI approve of the principle of Commonwealth assistance to the State for the making of good roads, I hope that no government or party in any State will be allowed to use these grants as political pawns, and that the local authorities will be given further opportunities to control the making of roads within their districts. I welcome the M in ister's statement that the Government proposes to make these grants continuous. If continuity is assured more people will be willing to take contracts, and they will be better equipped with knowledge and plant to do the job thoroughly. trust that this proposed grant by the Commonwealth to the States for road construction will be continued, and that in time we shall be able to double, and even treble, the amount proposed in the bill. The honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) referred to the manner in which the Commonwealth grant has been handled by the Country Roads Boardi n Victoria. The board is certainly a very capable body, but the allocations to the shires have not been altogether satisfactory. The greater proportion of Victoria's share of the grant has been expended upon what are called national highways round the coast, and not upon genuine developmental country roads. These roads do not go through agricultural areas, except in a very few cases. I understand that thc Victorian Country Roads Board now proposes to construct a national highway between Melbourne aud Mildura. I venture to say that its intention is to use a large portion of the grant in the construction of that road, although it w ill r u n almost parallel with an existing railway. This money is given by the Commonwealth for the construction of developmental roads; that is to say, roads running into newly settled areas used for agriculture and dairying, and roads which w ill be feeders to the railways; it is not",28,Second Reading

69,Mr Mcneil L (Wannon) [ 5 . 4 ],"Iintended for tlie construction of roads running parallel to the railways. The man who resides near a railway and can use it for the marketing of his produce suffers no hardship, but when a man who lives 20 or 30 miles from a railway and has no made roads of which he can take advantage is refused a grant from the Country Roads Board he has just reason for complaint. This is the case with residents of many shires, including Glenelg, Dundas, Portland, and Arapiles. As the Minister is aware, there is a big soldier settlement in those districts. Some little time ago a deputation from residents of Casterton, Coleraine and Hamilton waited upon the Victorian Minister for Public Works and asked for a grant of £20,000 to construct a road between Dengholm and Ellerslie. This road has been surveyed for the last 60 years, but it has not yet been grubbed, and there are patches on it that in winter time would bog a double-webbed duck. Men have to cart their produce over that road, and drive their stock over it in winter time. There is an old stage coach running over it between Dengholm and Apsley, which is frequently bogged in the winter time. Tho Country Roads Board is aware chat there are soldier settlements from one end of the district to the other, and it might have agreed to spend a few thousand pounds out of this grant to gravel and form a road that should have been made 50 years ago. Yet the Glenelg 3hire council has been refused its request for a grant of £20.000 for this road. The road between Strathdownie and Mt. Gambier is another road which has been left unmade for 50 or 60 years. The State Government has decided through the Country Roads Board to regard that as a national road, and it will make and maintain it. But had it not been for the persistent agitation of the residents of the shires,. and the enterprising business people in the towns, the Country Roads Board would 'lever have consented to make that road. If these grants are to be of any use to the men on the land it must be insisted upon that the money is to be spent on the construction and maintenance not of national roads for the convenience of owners of motor cars, but of roads leading into settled areas that are at present without roads. It is common, sense to insist that money given by the national Parliament to the State Governments for road construction shall be for the specific purpose of the construction and maintenance of roads in settled areas, and particularly soldier settlement areas where the settlers have to suffer enough without having to suffer the hardships of bad roads. The Minhamite shire council on two occasions asked the Victorian Country Roads Board for a porMinhamite, tion of the grant to construct a road to the Warrong settleaient, but the board refused the request, just as it refused the request of the Glenelg, Arapiles, Portland, and other shire councils, saying that it had no money for that class of road. If the State Government is not prepared to spend these grants on the construction and maintenance of roads in newly-settled areas, the Commonwealth should cease to make them. The road running from Melbourne to Mildura, which is to be regarded as a national road, runs through country already served by a railway. We are not interested in the making of grants to State Governments to improve roads for motor car people. Our concern is to study the convenience of settlers who are suffering hardships to-day because they are without roads upon which to transport their produce. If the State Governments are not prepared to spend this money upon providing roads for those people, I . nersonally, would not give them a shilling. I was surprised to learn from the Minister that £400,000 of last year's grant remains yet unexpended. How many of the States have failed to make application for mouey for road construction? I should like to know what they have been doing. The State Governments make a poor mouth, and say they cannot find the money necessary to construct railways that are needed, and here we have £400,000 offered to the States for road construction unapplied for. The State Governments are not making developmental roads for the benefit of new settlements, and yet, apparently, they cannot find the time to collect a portion of the £400,000 that is in the Commonwealth Treasury for the purpose. What can they be thinking about? They would make very poor managers of a farm or a station. The Commonwealth Government should make it a strict condition that these grants must be weed for de-",29,Second Reading

I do not think there is an honourable member who would willingl y delay the passing of this bill. No doubt the financial assistance proposed to be given by the Commonwealth w ill be greatly welcomed in all the States. It seems to have become the settled policy of the Government to make these grants annually. I wish to raise the question whether it is to be a permanent policy, because I anticipate that at some time in the future the Commonwealth Government may find it difficult to refuse to make money available for this purpose. The present Government has been very fortunate during the last few years in having a large amount of money at its disposal, and it has not found it difficult to make these grants. sympathy with' the contention of the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham) that it is not f a i r to take money out of the people's pockets by way of taxation in order to give it back in the form of roads; but the justification lies in the fact that the expenditure will be of benefit to the community. the Minister whether there is not something wrong with the conditions attached to the grant when such large sums remain unexpended year after year. Is there any suspicion that the State Governments are not co-operating as they might do in the matter?

It appears that the shire councils and local authorities within whose territories this money is expended in the construction of roads are responsible to the State Governments for half the expenditure incurred. Many of them are complaining of the cost of the work. The chairman of one shire assured me that a road in his territory constructed under this grant cost up to £12,000 per mile. or a macadamized road? have alluded is a metalled one. It is quite impossible for much road construction to be undertaken unless roads can be constructed for considerably less than that amount. I am afraid that in the case of roads that were constructed to assist in settling returned soldiers on the land, the time will come when a considerable portion of Tiheir cost will have to be written off so far as the shires are concerned. I 'suggest ito the Minister that with the popularity and great increase of motor traffic in certain localities,' more permanent roads should be constructed. Whilei n New South Wales last week-end I took particular notice of macadam roads in the cities, and some concrete roads in the country. The conI have some crete roads have a great deal to recommend them, and I consider it to be a waste of ""money to construct roads of gravel or cheaper material in places in which there is a large volume of motor traffic. Seeing that the motor ttaffic has now seriously challenged the railways, I suggest to the Minister that he should seriously I ask consider whether it would not be cheaper and more satisfactory to construct roads instead of many of t i e railways that are at present proposed to be built .

I have previously expressed the fear that future Commonwealth Governments may not be able to continue these grants, and in such an event may find themselves in serious difficulties. intend to oppose the b ill . Like otheT honourable members, I commend the Government for having made a further grant available for road construction, but I think it would have been economy in the long run had the original grant been equal to the sum that is now proposed to be voted The total amount provided for main road development, assuming the bill to be agreed to, is £1,750,000. This bill makes provision for £500,000, to be spent on the construction of developmental roads, provided that the State Governments spend an equal amount, and, in addition, £250,000 as a contribution for the maintenance of main roads that, perhaps, are not developmental. The previous act and the regulations governing it are largely responsible for the amount of £400,000 at present unexpended. Honourable members know that applications for grants are made through the local governing bodies to the State Minister, whose recommendation is sent on to the Eederal Minister. In my electorate, as in that of the honourable memtions for many roads that should have been approved have been rejected. would be a better policy for this Government to allot the money to the State Governments, who understand local conditions, and to give them the final say in the distribution of the grant. The local bodies would then deal direct with the State Government, and if an application were rejected they would know who was responsible. there is a motion on the notice-paper in another place embodying this suggestion. Had such a system been in operation last year an amount of £400,000 would not now be outstanding. Generally speaking, ihe bill is hedged round too much w it h regulations. The large number of regulations attached to the grant is largely responsible for the neglect of some' of the district or municipal councils to make application for it . Had the regulations been properly drawn up, and the act I am leniently interpreted, there would . have been no unexpended amount last year. Many applications for developmental roads have been rejected. one body were responsible, the reason for the rejection of the application would be known. My electorate is divided by Spencer's Gulf, and the people living on Eyre Peninsula are to all intents and purposes isolated from the mainland so far as transport facilities are concerned. They are at present dependent on the shipping service to the ports of Eyre Peninsula. I have frequently complained in this House of the high freights charged for transport, and the inadequate shipping service to the peninsula. It is almost impossible to travel by road around the top of the gulf. Persons wishing to take stock from Eyre Peninsula to Adelaide have to take them to Port Lincoln at the bottom, end of the gulf, and ship them from there to Adelaide at exorbitant costs. The only alternative is to use an obsolete punt at Port Augusta, which is controlled by the municipal council there. Eyre Peninsula contains more undeveloped good country than any other part of Australia. The State Government is making provision for a water supply which will make available a large tract of undeveloped agricultural and pastoral country. What is urgently required is some means of transport. There has been an agitation for the conIt struction of a bridge across the gulf at Port Augusta, and I . now ask the M in ister to say whether he w ill agree to the construction of that bridge being brought within the province of this bill, so that the people may have this necessary facility.

I consider that the practice of motor lorries competing with railways for short distances w ill increase rather than diminish. Tasmania has not been able to spend more than between £2 000 and 3 £3,000 of the road grant of £50,000 allocated to her.

If he advanced those arguments to the farmers of my electorate he would find that they were concerned, not about constitutional points, but about roads to carry their produce to market.

The honourable member for Kooyong should keep his speeches on constitutional difficulties for city audiences, as he w ill find The Tasmanian Government that the producers in the country have no sympathy with his views.

The people out-back are the real producers and developers of the country, and the time has come Avhen steps must be taken to provide them Avith the greater facilities to which they are justly entitled. Telephones and wireless are valuable conveniences, but good developmental roads are an absolute essential, because they are the most effective means of correcting isolation.

In State. reply to the objection raised by the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr. Latham), I say that there is no work of greater national importance, and none more deserving of the sympathetic consideration of the House than the construction of roads.

114,Mr Bowden (Nepean) [6.13],"IMain Roads the States for expenditure upon main and Other roads. Sof a r as I can ascertain, the American constitution gives no specific power to the Federal Government to make such grants; it does not give to the Centra] Government even that general monetary power, which is conferred by section 96 of the Australian Constitution, to assist necessitous States. I think it will be found that the grants by the Congress of the TJnited States of America are niade by virtue of the powers inherent in the Federal legislature. In all countries the tendency has been to widen rather than narrow the scope and power of the federal legislature, and having regard to its inherent powers under the Constitution, this Parliament is not taking any questionable action in making these grants to the States for the construction of roads. The honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) has rightly reminded us that adequate means of communication are of the utmost importance to the people in the back-blocks, and are, indeed, essential to settlement.. That being so, the construction of main roads is more than a parochial concern; it is a national necessity, and as such may very properly receive attention from this Parliament. grants are being made at the present time, however, does not satisfy me. Much more must be done. debate has shown the need for a clear and denned policy to be evolved by the Commonwealth and Statesi n consultation. The system of Commonwealth assistance in the construction of main roads must be permanent if it is to do lasting good. A t the present time there is no assurance of continuity, and the very fact that the two previous grants, and the one now proposed, are chargeable to surpluses already realized, instead of being made from ordinary revenue, in accordance with the settled policy of the Government, emphasizes that insecurity. Although the Minister has told the State Governments that they may continue expenditure upon main roads in anticipation of Commonwealth assistance on the basis of last year's expenditure, it is diffiroad f r om the time it was constructed up cult for any authority to undertake large works involving the expenditure of many thousands of pounds and extending over many months, and perhaps years, unless it is assured that the help which is available when the work is commenced will be [9 SEPTEMBER, 1925.] Development BiU. 2343 forthcoming for its continuance and completion. There are places where roads are very necessary, but their construction would be so expensive that both the shire councils and the State Governments are reluctant to commence them in the absence of any certainty that Commonwealth help w ill continue to be available. The absence of a guarantee of continuity militates against the success of the Commonwealth main roads policy. The restrictions imposed by the Federal authorities have aroused some complaint, but there must be some regulation of these grants and their limitation to main, developmental, and arterial roads is sound. While we adhere to that restriction we shall be on firm ground; if we depart from it we may experience trouble. Many municipal and shire councils have complained of their inability to collect rates from defence properties. In some very poor shires and municipalities there are roads which are used almost exclusively for defence purposes, and I would like to see provision made by which the Federal Government bears its fair proportion of the cost of their The manner in which these upkeep. It has been urged that to make such a provision in a bill of this character would be equivalent to giving This with one hand and taking away with the other. Yet the obligation cast upon the local authority of providing and maintaining roads almost . exclusively for defence traffic, without being able to collect any rates in respect of the properties they serve, is a very real grievance, and should be redressed. I know there is another side to the question, because I remember that during the war the Defence Department built a very fine macadamized road, for a distance of, I think, 6 miles, from Seymour to the Seymour Camp, on the understanding thai the local shire council would keep it in order after it was constructed. So far as I could learn when I was in the Department, nothing was done on that to the time the local authority asked for furthe r assistance to keep it in order. I welcome the proposal in this b ill for a grant of £250,000 for the purpose of reconditioning and strengthening existing main roads. Tasmania is not unique in the possession of roads constructed many years ago -which have fallen into such a state of disrepair as to need reconstruction. There are roads in m y electorate that are over 100 years old. Others were formed 80 or 90 years ago, and are now practically impassable. There is one road over which a very celebrated Australian artist travelled, and to which he refers in a beautifully illustrated little book which is to be found in the Parliamentary L i b r a r y; I refer to the old Cow Pastures-road from Parramatta to Camden. A centennial celebration was held in the districtnot long ago, and at it there was a tableau representing the old people who lived in the district 100 years ago, and amongst them Governor Macquarie. The then Premier of New South Wales was present at the celebration, and, facetiously, said to the gentleman who represented Governor Macquarie, very great changes here n o w "" ; but he met w it h the reply, "" Well, I do not think been done to our road since left."" local authorities to improve the condition of roads formed in the old days. As I have already mentioned, I believe that if some understanding could be arrived at between the Commonwealth and the State Government for the carrying out of a continuous policy, this Parliament could afford to make a very much larger grant to the States for road construction than it is being asked to make at the present time. My objection to the b ill is that its terms it is becoming beyond the powers of the are not sufficiently generous. I agree State Governments to perform, and it is with the honourable member for Parraessential that the Commonwealth should matta ( Mr Bowden) that there should be recognize the part it must play in making continuity in our policy of national roadadequate provision for the construction making, and that is not provided for in and maintenance of national highways. this measure.

124,Mr Makin,"The road problem isdo not lend themselves to efficiency and economy. The shire councils and municipalities adopt various methods of road construction, ancl as the Oommonwealth Government is now taking a part in this national work, it should be prepared to advise the local governing bodies respecting the best methods of road construction, which has now become a highly specialized undertaking. It would, perhaps, be advisable to establish a technical branch, consisting of experts, whose services would be made available to local governing bodies. I suggest to the Minister that he might well refer the road making problem to the Institute' of Science and Industry as re-constituted. Much of the Commonwealth grant is misspent because of faulty construction of roads, and the provision of inadequate drainage. I have seen many a good roadway almost ruined through baddrainage. continent of great distances such as Australia, the road problem is of first importance. with the question of defence. Road transport w ill , in the hour of emergency or present practice of making grants for one aggression, be one of the main factors in helping or hindering us, and from that stand-point alone it is essential that a permanent and efficient for m of road making should be undertaken. construction should also be considered part of the scheme for developmental roads. New South ""Wales and Victoria, together with the one crossing the border between Victoria and South Australia, is a roadway which is known as no man's land. No one seems to accept the responsibility for its maintenance. These roads are in a bad state of repair, and require immediate attention, and I hope that the Commonwealth Government w ill be sufficiently broad-minded and national in its outlook to impress upon the local governing bodies the necessity for keepticularly in times of adversity, to get their ing in effective repair all main roads that produce to market with less expense and lead from one State to another. It is generally recognized that the nearer to the metropolitan area, the better is the elass of roadway, but this is not always the case. Eveni n my own electorate are roadways that could be considerably i m proved. The main arterial roadway in South Australia runs from the Outer Harbour to Port Adelaide, and over it is carried much of the merchandise and produce for the whole of the State. It seems unjust that the people of Port Adelaide should be taxed in order to maintain that roadway, which rightly should be the joint responsibility of the State and the nation. Road making is essentially a national question, and is getting beyond the powers of local governing bodies. A certain municipality in my district had the foresight to construct permanent roadways, and is deserving of every assistance and encouragement. I regret that my representations made recently on their behalf were not favourably received by the Commonwealth Government. We should have a continuous policy of road making, extending over a period of three or five years. would be preferable. In a A Government that is elected for three years has no right to commit this country to a definite policy of road construction, It has a close relation which a succeeding Government might consider to be totally inadequate. The year only, and giving the States no assurance of what w ill be the grant for the succeeding year, does not permit of the adoption of a uniform policy of road Bridge construction. Unless foresight is exercised we cannot have either efficiency or economy in our road construction. Road Crossing the border between making must necessarily become more important in Australia. I believe that u l t imately we shall need Ministers for Roads just as we need Ministers for Railways. Although roadways can never confer such great advantages on our people as railways, they are nevertheless most necessary to our community life. Generosity on the part of the Government in making this grant will be appreciated everywhere. If we have good roads our visitors will undoubtedly appreciate our country more. Our producers will be able, parworry, and altogether the community will benefit. I request the Government to increase the proposed vote with a view to making possible a continuous road policy on the part of the State and local governing authority.

127,Mr Whitsitt (Darwin) [8.19],"her roads and the manner in which she has constructed them, but that State's policy of road construction is a credit to her and an example to all the States on the mainland. We realized that when we put men on the land it was essential to provide them with roads. We were not prepared to allow our primary producers to plough through slush, and slime to reach their markets. The authorities on the mainland, however, were prepared to do so. We have borrowed about £5,000,000 in all to make roads. Tasmania recognized that public prosperity is like unto a tree -agricultur e is its roots, and industry aud commerce are its branches and its leaves. If the roots are not nourished the leaves fall, the branches wither, and the tree dies. Therefore the State mortgaged herself to provide roads for her producers. Now, at the eleventh hour, the Commonwealth Government is providing money f OT road making, and we are denied our share of it for the simple reason that while in the years gone by we spent our capital on road construction the States on the mainland did not. The honourable member for Lilley( Mr -Mackay) stated that some roads on the mainland cost £12,000 a mile to construct. .We buil t ,our roads in Tasmania for £1,200 a mile. borrowed from the mainland. kind. You on the mainland sold your birth right. Instead of putting the proceeds from the sale of your land into roads you put it into revenue and spent ii: in other directions. We in Tasmania did what was right. We have encumbered ourselves to the extent of £ 2 5 per head of the population for road construction, and now the Commonwealth Government tells us that we have lost our opportunity 'of participating in this grant. Are we to be the Cinderella State of the southern seas-to be looked down upon and denied our rights? The worm w ill turn. We shall turn before long, if we do not get justice, as sure as my name is Wliitsitt. The heavens may f a l l before this Federation breaks, but we w ill get justice for Tasmania, even if it means our withdrawal from it . Apparently we may pay, pay, pay; but we can get nothing in return. That is what is worrying me. I hope that whoever succeeds me as member for Darwini n this chamber w ill be able to make a better plea for Tasmania than I have been able to make. If he does not, I do not know what the result w ill be. We have mountainous country, basaltic soil, a wet climate, and other difficulties to contend with in our road work. Our pioneers, who "" l i v e d laborious days,"" tackled the impenetrable jungle, the home of the wombat and the wallaby-ha d very often to take their winter supplies with them and remain for three months of the year in isolation because of the impassibility of the roads. Every one of them deserved a gold medal for what he did and endured. Yet honourable members -in this chamber slight Tasmania. Shame on them! Not one of us has half the vitality or endurance of the pioneers, who converted the bush from what it was then to what it is now. Watt) -This bill does not deal with pioneers. That is not right. so f a r as road construction is concerned, sir. These men have actually done what I have described. They might have become web-footed had they remained long enough in the slush of that soil. The law of evolution might have turned them into ducks. I want the Government to realize the actual position, and to make No t h in g of the special conditions for Tasmania. I want them to say, "" Seeing that the average expenditure of the States on the mainland, for main road making is £6,000 or £'7,000 a mile, and that of Tasmania is only £1,200 a mile, we are willing to make Tasmania's grant up to the average expenditure of the other States."" That would be the f a i r thing. It would do justice to Tasmania. In the past the grant has been made under such conditions that Tasmania has not been able to take advantage of it . Our population is small, and cannot bear the expense of constructing tip-top, luxurious roads. We have had to be content w it h macadamized roads, which we have been able to construct and maintain. To do even that we have had to tax ourselves to the extent of Is. 6d. or Is. Sd. in the pound.

They would then see that it was expended or at least act more quickly. If any member representing a country constituency in New South Wales had been given charge of the money, it would have been spent. B y carrying over such, huge sums each year we are only tinkering w i th an important matter. I hope that if the Government of New South Wales gives favorable consideration to the construction of the road from Goulburn through Tallong to Nowra, it w ill be treated as a main or developmental road under this bill, and be entitled to a portion of this money. If that road were built, it would not only be of great advantage to the people in the vicinity, but it would open up one of the most beautiful tourists' resorts in New South Wales. While not opposing this bill, for the reason that I look upon it as an improvement on previous legislation of a similar character in that it provides an additional £250,000 for the maintenance of roads already constructed, I regret that the amount has not been increased to £l,000j 0 00 per annum, and that that sum has not been made available .for a period of at least five years. I have had many years' experience as a shire councillor, and know that it is impossible to make good roads when uncertainty exists regarding the amount which w ill be made available in future years. That has been the trouble with previous legislation of this character. In connection with road-making, it is absolutely essential that an amount of money should be set aside in advance so that the work can be planned ahead until the whole road is completed. This class of legislation was originally introduced to assist tbe development of new settlements. Cases have come under my notice in which the local board has been unable to obtain grants for the construction of the necessary bridges over creeks. In one instance I was successful in getting the decision reversed, but failed in the other case which I took up. Honourable members w ill realize that it is useless to construct a road on both sides of a creek if no bridge is provided Commonto cross the creek itself. I hope that but that future grants will include, provision for the necessary bridges. I hope also that a definite sum w ill be made available for a number of years, so that the work may be planned in advance and carried out in a business-like way. I disagree with the contention of the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr. Latham) that there is no justification for the Federal Government providing sums of money for this purpose for a period of years. The honourable member said that the revenue derivable in the future from Customs and other sources might become less, but I would remind him that for the year 1923-4 the Customs duties on motor cars, motor parts, ancl oil for motors amounted to £2,121,000. There appears to be no likelihood of the diminution of motor tramc, and it is probable that that amount w ill increase in succeeding years. If the money derived from that source, or even £1,000,000 of it were spent on our roads, we shall not be doing more than a fair thing, because we have, such an enormous area of untenanted .land which can be settled only by the construction of suitable roads. Mention has been made of the fact that £400,000 of this grant was not expended last year. It is probable, however, that a great deal of that sum was allotted. So far as Queensland is concerned, I know that a great deal more than the sum allocated was applied for, but at the end of the year no definite decision regarding the applications had been arrived at. For that reason the expenditureof the money was held up. had to provide for the expenditure of a sum of money that was unexpectedly made available. give some assurance as to the continuity of this policy there w ill be no difficulty in regard to the expenditure of the money in future. The experience that the State Governments and roads boards have had has impressed upon them the necessity for bestirring themselves to expend the money as it is made available by the Commonwealth.

I do not desire to cross swords w it h the lionorable member for Kooyong' ( Mr Latham) regarding the constitutionality of grants by the Federal Parliament for the construction of roads in State territory. W it h all due respect to the legal knowledge of the honourable member, if I were a member of the Ministry I should have no apprehensions or doubts about the propriety of this policy. Money is voted by this Parliament for many different purposes, the constitutionality of which is equally open to challenge. The Australian Constitution resembles very closely that of the United States of America, and I find that for the seven years ended SOth June, 1923, £82,000,000 was spent in America upon road construction. Of that amount the Federal Government contributed £35,000,000. In the following year £102,000,000, of which the Federal Government contributed £45,000,000, whilst for the year ended 30th June, 1925, the Federal Government was contributing another £15,000,000. A t least a corresponding amount would be provided by the States, and it is safe to estimate that between £30,000,000 and £40,000,000 is being expended this year by the Federal and State Governments in conjunction, iimder what is known as the FederalA i d Highway System Act. It is clear that the American Congress realizes the value -of road construction, and does not hesitate to make money available for the purpose. We are told that this expenditure should be restricted to main roads or militar y roads. The militar y authorities may declare a certain thoroughfare to be .a militar y road, but probably during war -operations many other roads would be -used for military purposes. Therefore, the more roads throughout the Commonwealth that are kept in good repair, the better prepared shall we be for the defence of our country. D u r i ng the Great War motor vehicles were used extensively in France and Belgium, for the transport of both men and provisions, and but for -the good roads the troops of the Allies 'would have suffered heavily. We may justly regard any vote by the Federal Parliament for the construction of roads as a contribution towards the defence of Australia. I understand that these grants are applied exclusively to the construction of country roads. Is any of the money expended within the metropolitan area ? are the two cities of Footscray and Essendon, through which pass four of the five principal arterial roads between Melbourne and the country. For some miles the main road to Ballarat and Geelong runs through the city of Footscray. there are as many potholes in roads within the metropolitan area as in any country road. tricts without any roads. understand that the Prime Minister had the total was increased to a painful experience of country roads when motoring in Gippsland recently. A l though I represent a city constituency I sympathize with the people living outback who are wholly dependent upon roads for means of access to the towns and railways. Peoplei n the metropolitan area have the advantage of tramways and railways. In respect of some metropolitan roads upon which there has been a considerable amount of cartage from outlying districts the Government has come to the assistance of the r municipalities through which the roads passed. The main Sydney road and the Bendigo road pass through the City of Essendon. trade to the city. does great damage to roads within the city boundaries. Through Essendon and Footscray passes the motor traffic toGeelong, Ballarat, the North-Eastern District, the Goulburn Valley, and Bendigo.

The Federal Government should do the same. We must take the risk of our revenue being sufficient for the purpose. I have explained that the Federal Government Country Roads of the TJnited States of America has been contributing for some years to a system of road construction, and those who have Consetravelled the roads of that country quota tell me that they are the finest in the world.

That, no doubt, would be very satisfactory to motorists, but thereasons which actuated the Government in I agree with bringing forward this policy of Commonwealth assistance for main road construcconstruction protion are exactly similar to those which-",43,Austin Chapman Th E Honourable Seeing That This Is The Third Annual
153,Mr Gregory (Swan) [9.2],"Iactuated the Government of the TJnited States of America when it adopted the same policy shortly after the war. It came to the conclusion that the construction of developmental roads would increase settlement, increase production, and decrease the cost of living. ' The figures quoted by the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) show how the. policy has developed in the TJnited States of America. I have been pleased to hear honourable members opposite endorsing this policy, and I should like to see it extended. It should be definitely continued over a period of years. There have been complaints that large sums of money have been l e f t unexpended from these grants at the end of each financial year. But we must recognize that when the Commonwealth Government submits a proposal to advance £500,000 to the States under the conditions attaching to these main road grants, the State Governments must make their arrangements for the expenditure they have to meet. No State Government could be expected to submit in the middle of a session a policy for the expenditure of £200,000 or £300,000 on road construction. Their financial obligations render it necessary that they should have ample time for considering such proposals. the conditions upon which these grants are 'made, applications have to be received, the State Minister for Works must have proper surveys made of the roads to be constructed, and, having come to the conclusion as to the best way in which the money available can be expended, he has to send his recommendations to the Federal Minister for his approval before a start can be made with the works. In the circumstances there is no occasion to reflect upon any Government for anv delay that may have taken place in the expenditure of these grants. The proposal to' put the amount available to each State to a trust account is a very good one. Under this arrangement the State Governments will know that money unexpended at the close of one financial year w ill be available for the next year. Contracts for road construction and promises of road construction may have been made by a State Government in March, A p r i l, or May, and it is impossible for the expenditure upon such works to take place during the remainder of the financial year. essential that there should be a carry over from year to year of moneys promised for road construction. If a State Government is not availing itself of the opportunity to carry out a reasonable construction policy under this measure, the Federal Minister for Works and Bailways can ta-ke such action as may be necessary. The bill provides for this, and should tend to more speedy construction than has taken place in the past. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) suggested that the construction of developmental roads might obviate the necessity for railway construction. That might be so in some districts, but it would not apply to wheat-growing areas from which the traffic to markets is very heavy. Railways will still be necessary in such areas. There is room for the construction of a large number of developmental roads as feeders to railways. I join issue to some extent with the honourable member for Maribyrnong as to the method of construction to be adopted. If only the best macadamized and tarred roads are to be constructed, the cost may run up to £6,000 per mile.. What is chiefly required is the construction of developmental roads which will afford settlers facilities for bringing their produce to market. ThatI take to be the main purUnder pose of the bill. Whilsti t may be wise in some places to construct first-class roads, I am satisfied that a poorer type of road would be quite satisfactory in many districts. I hope that the Minister will not insist upon high-grade roads being laid down i u newly opened-up districts. I was pleased to hear the complaints of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr. A . Green) in connection with the large expenditure which has taken, place in connection with many of these works carried out by day labour in country districts in Western Australia. Day labour construction may be all very well where it is possible to have proper supervision. Where gangs of men have to be sent to places at an enormous distance from centres of population, construction by day labour may result in heavy loss. I have heard many complaints on this ground. Where there are responsible rpad boards, and the Minister is satisfied that they command the services of competent officers, they should be permitted to carry out these works without many of the conditions that are being imposed in some of It is, therefore, absolutely the States. I do not blame the Western Australian Government-it s predecessor was more responsible than the present Government in this connection-for many of the complaints that have been made to me regarding the expenditure of these advances for road construction. proposals submitted by many boards were approved, but the money to carry them out was never made available. unjust that they should be promised the advances for which they applied, and should then have been lef t waiting for the money where official approval for the construction of a road has been obtained, the money should be expended on this work, and not diverted elsewhere. There is provision, in this b ill for the advance of £250,000 for the reconditioning of old roads, and the Commonwealth Minister for Works and Railways may provide the whole of the money for this purpose. I do not quite concur in ' this proposal. I believe that the State and local authorities concerned should contribute some portion of the expenditure for the reconditioning of roads.. mania out of the grant altogether. Seventy-five per cent of the cost might be provided by the Commonwealth, and that would be sufficient. I do not say that the proposal is wrong, but it does not appeal to me that the Commonwealth Government should provide the whole of the cost of reconditioning old roads, when if a new road is being constructed the local authority or the State is required to r»rovide £ 1 for £ 1 of the expenditure necessary. The matter is one which may be dealt with in committee, and the Ministeri n charge of the bill would be warranted in insisting that some proportion of the expenditure upon the reconditioning' of roads should be borne by the States concerned. Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) said it would be unfair for any government to commit a future Parliament in these matters, but I remind him that this was done in connection with the per capita payments to the States. It is within the province of a new Parliament to repeal what it considers to be unjust legislation. scribed as repudiation. justified in repealing legislation which it does not believe to be wise. This Parliament agreed that the per capita payments should be made to the States for ten years continuously, or unti l Parliament otherwise provided.

The per capita payment is made to the States with no condition as to its expenditure, but the main roads grant is made to the States under such terms and conditions as we think f it . The; adoption of a continuous policy for a period of three years would enable the States to make their financial arrangements ahead, and to carry out a satisfactory programme of works. Under such a policy we would not hear the.complaints, that we have heard to-night about the amount of money remaining unexpended. ber favour a continuous policy for three years ? policy brought down from year to year as at present, it should be definitely fixed for three years. ' Eveni f we onlyhad a statement from the Government that it would endeavour to make the grant available for three years, it would enable the State Governments to make provision for their share of the money. I look upon the policy of main roads development as one of the best ever initiated in Australia. It is impossible to imagine the great valuethat must accrue from the construction The honourable member for of developmental roads. We are opening up a large area of new country, and it isessential that we should give to those people who have the courage to settle in the back country under adverse conditions, every possible means of getting their produce to market.

Sir Monaro) [9.18] -Many of the statements by honourable members about metal roads were delightfully vague. The Minister for Works and Railways( MrH ill ) said that it was essential that good roads should run to the railways and to some of the main centres. He said nothing about tbe settlers in the back country, who cannot get good roads. Where is the guarantee that if the shire, councils expend their own taxes for the construction of roads, the Federal Government will continue the grant ? Last year large sums of money were expended on roads on the understanding that the State Government would contribute to the cost. In one case £28,000 was granted for a road from an important farming centre to a seaport. This road was to be constructed to enable the settlers to get butter, cheese, and other produce to market, and to open up new country. What happened? The grant of £28,000 was sent to the State Minister, and he promptly turned the proposal down. I opproached him, and wanted to know where the grant had gone. He said that he did not know, except that it had been expended on some other road. I discovered had in That shows how necessary it is that we should place on a sound footing any proposal for the construction of new roads. I am surprised at honourable members representing small constituences in small r States such as Tasmania ber knows nothing about Tasmania. Sir honourable member thinks that Tasmania is the only place in the world. ' I know something about Tasmania, or at any rate about its roads. I am surprised that the honourable member is satisfied with the roads in Tasmania. New South Wales has done very well in its expenditure on roads. In my electorate, such places as Bega and Moruya, which purely entitled to a portion of the Federal surplus for road construction purposes. ask for macadamised roads. fcare subdued the wilderness, established their homes, and sent their produce to markets, and they are entitled to get the money; and the maintenance of the road for a certain number of years if the surplus can stand, it . We know very well that we cannot get roads unless the Commonwealth Government has a surplus. There is an old but true saying, "" You cannot get blood from a stone."" Shire councillors get no profit or reward for the work they carry out. They meet once or twice a fortnight to consider the question of costs and the best methods of expenditure on roads. They are surely entitled to some consideration. I cannot understand the attitude of those who are satisfied with the country roads boards, which have no expert knowledge respecting the construction of roads. The shire councillors who have battled all their lives with hard roads, and who get no pay for the work they carry out for the good of the district, should receive some grant to enable them to construct roads. Why should the moneys be handed over to the State Government, and then to the roads board ? I have already given an illustration of what happened to the grant of £28,000 that was dbtained to construct a road from Bega to Tathra, which by close search that it would have given the settlers a market been expended on a road for their butter and cheese. Surely, the Minister's own electorate. these people are entitled to consideration. I am concerned, not with roads suitable for motor cars or main roads, but with what I call farmers' roads. We should give the farmers the help they need, for they are the backbone of the country. Decent roads are necessary for proper agricultural development. The farmers are not asking for concrete or made ordinary roads that w ill stand lip to reasonable traffic. I am absolutely opposed to the adoption of any policy that w ill place the Federal authority which administers this act at the beck and call of the State Ministers. I have had some experience of -that, and I do not desire any other Minister to suffer it . There is an old saying that he who pays are dairying districts, are the piper shall call the tune. I believe in that.

Sir AUSTINCHAPMAN Tasmanian Government w ill make it available to the shire council in Eden Monaro, they w ill spend it and get good value for the money. I cannot understand why the money has not been spent. Plenty of people are looking for work, and plenty of roads need making. The provision of better roads w ill lecd to an increase in the productivity of the land. The farmers will be able to give more time to growing their produce, for they will not need to give so much to its transportation to markets. money and we need the roads. Let us, therefore, adopt a practical, common sense policy. tricts of New South Wales w ill eagerly spend all the money that the Government will make available to them for road purposes. Governments or the State Roads Boards too much authority in connection with this grant. the people spend a bit of their own money in the way they deem best. It is idle to say it is either Commonwealth or State money, for it belongs to the people, and they are entitled to reasonable consideration. As one who took some interest in the initiation of this policy, I am naturally concerned about its development. I wish to make a few observations, more upon the subject of a general roads policy than upon the bill itself. The honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham) has been criticized because he introduced what the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) called a jarring note into the debate, but if , in his opinion as a lawyer, with a wide knowledge of constitutional matters, he believes that the measure conflicts with the Constitution, he is only doing his duty in saying so. Whether the bill strictly conforms with the Constitution or not, the fact is clear that honourable members on all sides of the chamber are unanimous in supporting it . It seems to me, therefore, that I was if there is a constitutional irregularity about it , the question is not whether we should abandon the policy, but whether we should make some effort to square it with the Constitution. The advent of the motor car has made a tremendous difference to outback life in Australia, If the but it has also created a tremendous problem for the local governing bodies responsible for the construction ancl maintenance of our roads. The problem is, in fact, too groat for them to cope with. The State Governments have recognized this, for they have appointed roads boards to consider it . In the first year in which the Government initiated this policy there was no uniformity in the road administration machinery, if "" I may use that term, of the several States. I refer particularly to the difficulty created by the lack at that time of a. country roads We have the board ih New South Wales. The States are now recognizing the necessity for a permanent policy of road construction. Many of the coastal -disThe Federal Government has shown that it, also, is aware of the need. Such a policy ought to provide for the maintenance, as well as the construction, of roads. I object to giving the State Otherwise chaos must result. The claims of Tasmaniai n regard to road construction and maintenance have been ably There is nothing like letting placed before this Chamber by honourable members who come from . that State. Even when I was administering this legislation, representations had come to hand which indicated that the conditions in Tasmania were somewhat different from those of the mainland. If the people of Tasmania have spent considerable sums of borrowed money in the past in constructing roads, ancl are still paying' interest on it , if seems to me that the Government would be justified in fixing some different basis upon which grants might be made -available to them. Certainly a complete in quiry into the position is warranted. Reverting to the future policy of' the Commonwealth in regard to road work, I advocate the constitution of a Federal roads board,' comprised ' of representatives of the Oommonwealth' and a l l ' t h e States, in order that a continuous road developmental policy may be adopted, .In stead of providing money by the present more or less haphazard methods, I con-",47,Austin Chapman The Asphalted Speedways But Simply F O R Well
163,Mr Seatsrook,Tasmani a has been,48,Austin Chapman The Asphalted Speedways But Simply F O R Well
164,Mr Stewart (Wimmera) [9.88]:,"sider that, in view of the insistent demands from country centres for road -work, a permanent and settled method of providing it should be adopted. It has been requested by various country interests through the Customs Department on motor ear importations, and also the revenue from State motor car taxation, should be ear-marked for road-making purposes. That is a matter that could be given close attention. A broad, general policy might. be formulated along those lines. If a Federal roads board were constituted it could f i x the standard of road construction and provide for a continuous policy that would not be affected by political changes in either the Commonwealth or States. Experts could be appointed who would work harmoniously and continuously. I have been pleased with the unanimity of honourable members in dealing with this bill . The address of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) .this afternoon was particularly gratifying. There is no doubt that road-making and ' maintaining is one of the big national problems of the day. Australia may rest assured, if one may judge from the speeches that have been made on this bill, that whatever political party may be in power a permanent policy of road development will be adopted. I am satisfied that the country people, especially those in the remote parts, appreciate this action of the Government, and will continue to show appreciation of any government which continues along similar lines. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat referred to the amount rece'vcd by t h i Commonwealth in Customs duties on motor cars and other vehicles. I have not the figures with me, but I believe that the amount is between £2,000,000 and £3,000,000 a year. portion of that money the Government in tends to apply to road construction and maintenance. I am glad that the Federal Government, recognizing that the States and the municipalities are unable to meet the growing demands upon their revenue for the maintenance and construction of roads, has entered this field of activity, Those who have had any experience of municipal life know that there are many avenues for the expenditure of the revenue received by way of rates. honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) mentioned some of the richer municipalities in the metropolitan area. I have the honour to represent a constituency which includes the thickly-populated cities of Caulfield, Malvern, and Brighton, that the duties received whose revenue each year runs into a considerable amount. But, notwithstanding the large amounts received as rates, these municipalities find it difficult to cope with the growing demands made upon them in connection with their roads. The difficulty with both metropolitan municipalities and country towns and shires is that muoh of the traffic which passes over their roads comes fro m other districts. It must be evident to any one who travels in our country districts that the country towns and shires experience difficulty in obtaining sufficient money to maintain their roads in proper condition. The state of their roads is not due to a lack of enterprise on the part of shire councillors, most of whom,, I believe, are keenly interested in the development of their districts; it is due solely to the lack of sufficient funds for the purpose. W it h in the last twelve months the Government of Victoria has increased very considerably the taxes payable in respect of motor cars-, the annual revenue now derived from that source being approximately £750,000. The owner of a motor car in Victoria who, twelve months ago, paid in taxation £ 5 per annum, is to-day required to pay £ 1 2 per annum. I am glad, however, that the greater portion of the £750,000 received by the Victorian Government from this source will be spent on the roads of the State, including £40,000 in the metropolitan area. The whole of the £750,000 could well be expended in maintaining the roads in good condition. Not only should those roads which carry heavy commercial traffic, and roads connecting the larger towns be considered, but some of the money should be expended to develop A roads in tourist districts. Our greatestresponsibility in connection with roads is to those who have gone into the outback areas as pioneers, and who have considerable difficulty in getting their produce to market. The honoraole member for Macquarie ( Mr Manning) pointed out to-day that it sometimes costs a settler as much to convey his produce 14 miles by road as to send it 350 miles by r a i l. The honourable member said that motor transport is dearer than transport by rail, and The while that may be so to-day. I believe that motor transport would be much cheaper",48,Austin Chapman The Asphalted Speedways But Simply F O R Well
165,Mr F. Francis (Henty) [9.45],"if better roads were provided. This measure has my whole-hearted support, because I believe that it is in the interests of the settlers in the outback districts of the Commonwealth. I think the argument of the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) that a portion of the amount received as Customs duties should be applied to the construction and maintenance of roads is a sound one. I pointed out just now that a considerable increase in the taxes payable in respect of motor cars had recently been made in Victoria. To the man who owns a number of cars, that increase represents a big outlay, and he should know what he is to get in return. Personally, I do not object to this taxation if it results in better roads being made available for motorists; but, if the revenue is to be applied to the creation of new departments and to meeting the expenses of administration, I hold that the increase is not justified. I maintain that it pays to make good roads, that-they are cheapest in the long run.

The responsibility of indicated by this bill, and I am certain pronouncing upon the merits of different. that there w ill be no protest from the people livin g in country districts, who realize that their very existence depends, to a great extent, on the quality of the roads over which they have to carry their produce to market. Some time ago I had pleasure in supporting legislation which had as its object the finding of markets for our produce. The Government would have shown a lack of foresight if , having introduced legislation to assist in the marketing of Australian produce abroad, it failed to ayail itself of the opportunity provided by this surplus revenue to do something to make it possible for our outback settlers to carry their produce to the railway station over good roads. It would have been absurd to assist in organizing markets abroad while neglecting to provide access to the home markets. The Federal Government, and I hope, the. majority of the State Governments, will probably adopt a progressive immigration policy, which will mean the placing upon the land of more settlers from overseas. State Governments, also, are carrying out comprehensive land settlement schemes, and they will be very greatly assisted by the fact that the Commonwealth Government has recognized I hope that the road construction as a national responsidependent of any subsidy by the States, for reconditioning or strengthening existing main roads is of vital concern to one council in my electorate. It did not participate in previous Commonwealth grants because it had no absolutely new works for which it could claim such assistance. Under the terms of this bill, however, a shire council The honourable member reis within the definition contained in the",49,Austin Chapman The Asphalted Speedways But Simply F O R Well
166,Mr Gardner (Robertson) [9.58],"proposals should rest with the shire councils and the M'ain Roads Board, which has been newly created in New South Wales. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro is apprehensive that the creation of that body will deprive the shire councils of their autonomy. I have met the members of the new Main Roads Board, and I consider that New South Wales is fortulick and the other gentlemen associated with him. They will, I am sure, cooperate with the shire councils, by whom the applications for assistance from the Pederal grant must be initiated. The Federal authorities may safely be guided by the board's recommendations. Like other honourable members, I would like to see a larger sum provided by the Commonwealth for road construction, but we must feel satisfied that a start has been made, and that a principle acceptable to all honourable members has been laid down, namely, that developmental roads, and others giving access to markets, are the proper concern of the national Parliament. W it h the Main Roads Board functioning, and public-spirited men continuing to give their services as members of shire councils, we can look forward to a more generous and progressive policy, from which the Commonwealth will benef it to probably a greater extent than from any other legislation that we have passed for a considerable time. in the State of Victoria, and .possibly in other States, an organization known as the National Roads Association, and I was privileged to attend recently a lecture under the auspices of the association in the city of Geelong. The discourse was highly instructive, and was illustrated by lantern views of the most modern methods of road construction in the TJnited States of America. The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) mentioned to-night that the TJnited States Congress voted £15,000,000 for road construction during the year ended 30th June, 1925. That amount may sound very large, but, having regard to the fact that it is contributed by 115,000,000 people, it is a very modest charge in comparison with, the burden of taxation that the ratepayers of Australia have to bear. The proposal to increase the Commonwealth grants from £500,000 to £750,000 has my hearty approval. Many years ago I had much bitter experience of the difficulties -with which the man on the land has to contend, particularly in the bad roads that separate his farm from the railway. I have vivid recollections of a road in Queensland which, on account of the hilly nature of the. country, had to follow the bed of a creek for 7 miles. ""Tn that distance there were no less than 28 crossings, and after a heavy rainfal l it was impossible for a farmer to get his products to market without unloading the dray three or four times on the journey, and carrying his produce through mire and water to high ground further up the gully Fortunately, such conditions are rare, and I hope that they w ill become even more so. The grant to be made available under this bill w ill assist materially a great number of men who to-day have to bear the burden of maintaining a very expensive road which they barely use. During the time. I have been a member of this HouseI have frequently mentioned the injustice done to shires of whose total revenue f u l l y o.ne-third is absorbed by contributions to the Country Roads Boardf or the maintenance of the arterial roads, not 5 per cent, of traffic upon which originates within the shire. I have in mind a road through Braybrook, from the quarries into the metropolitan area. That road is being cut to pieces by drays carting metal to all parts of the metropolitan area, and the ratepayers of the district are heavily saddled with the cost of its upkeep. Under the bill, as drafted, there seems to be no chance of those people getting any redress, but I hope that the scope of the measure may be widened so that injustices of this kind may be remedied. I give the b ill my blessing, and I hope that the Government w ill , in the near future, submit to Parliament proposals for a continuous policy of road construction. We desire to effect economy, and that can be done only by continuity of policy extending over a period of at least five years, and possibly seven years.

He is well known to practically every one who has been a member of this Parliament. When his attention was drawn to the remarks of the honourable member for Bourke on his return from Sydney, he wrote me a letter, which I now intend to read, and asked that the whole file should be placed on the table of the House. This is the letter I received from Mr Collins:The Honourable the.Treasurer, My attention has been drawn to the Parliamentary debates of 3rd September,' 1025, in which Mr Anstey has made .some references to me. I do not deserve the personal reflections which the honourable gentleman has made.

I regret very much that this attack has been made upon cue of the most prominent public servants in Australia. Mr Collins' career is unblemished, and he has earned the goodI am availing myself of will and gratitude of the su/sscssive Treasurers of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Bourke professes to be aggrieved because I said that the Labour Treasurer had entered into an arrangement with the banks which was not so good, from the public point of view, as that which had existed between the Oommonwealth Bank and the MutualL if e and Citizens' Assurance Company Limited. To show that I was quite accurate in the statement that I made, it is only necessary that reference be made to the copy of correspondence, which, ai the request of Mr Collins, I shall table to-morrow. That correspondence shows quite distinctly that, on the 9th November, 1914, the final approval to the arrangement with the banks was given by Mr Fisher, the Leader of the Labour Administration. It is quite fruH, however, that Mr Fisher did not initiate the arrangement. Indeed, it is clear that, prior to the 17th September, 1914, when Mr Fisher took office, the Cook Administration had entered into an arrangement, which, because it was agreed to in the main at a conference of all parties, could not honorably have been departed from by the new Administration , and if Mr. indicate, Collins told Mr Anstey that Mr Fi'her was bound he had every justification for interjected during the so saying.

Chairman of Directors of the Commonwealth Bank, and is not able to refute in this House any statements made. man) stated in this House on the 3rd September lastMr Garvan's company profited by the situation, for in the six months from ist January to 30th June, 1924. the Commonwealth Bank paid it nearly £40,000 in hard cash on these exchange transactions. A little further on he saidI am advised that in twelve montli3 the company cleared through the Commonwealth Bank a profit on exchange of approximately £100,000. . . . My point, however, is that while Mr Garvan's company was in the fortunate position of having large sums of money in Australia with which to take advantage of the abnormally high rates of exchange, it* had an overdraft from the Commonwealth Bank at 5 per cent. In this connection I have a letter dated Sydney, the 7th September, 1925, and signed by all the directors of the Commonwealth Bank, with the exception of Mr Garvan. That letter readsThe Hon. Earle Page, Treasurer, Commonwealth of Australia, Mel bou rue, Victoria. Dear Sir,With reference to the statements made in Parliament to the effect that Mr Garvan and his company had made large sums of money in exchange transactions, with the assistance of the bank, the board has investigated the matter, and finds the position as follows:That the Mutual Life and Citizens' Assurance Company Ltd. entered into large contracts on behalf of this bank, for the sale of London exchange. The period covered by these contracts was from October, 1923, to March, 1925, during whicli period the transfer from London to Australia of thc sum of £5,600,000 was effected. Neither Mr Garvan nor his company, nor any oflicer of his company, received any prolit or recompense in connection with these transactions, the whole proceeds of which went to the 'bank. The result of tliese transactions enabled the bank to deal effectively with a difficult posiD i d not the Treasurer tion created through the accumulation of large funds in London, and also had the effect of saving the bank a considerable sum of money. As the board is of the opinion that transeonnexions should' not be disclosed, it makes this statement with the consent of Mr Garvan Later, I corrected my stateand the Mutual Life and Citizens' Assurance Company Ltd. Yours faithfully, B. B. McCOMAS. J. 'MACKENZIE LBBS. Mr Garvan is <S. HOBDEBN. K. S. DBUMMOND. JAS. R. COLLINS.' The Far, then, from receiving any profit from this transaction, the facts show that Mr. Garvan, through his company, has rendered very material service to the bank. I believe that everybody in this House, without respect to party, desires to see a strong national bank. We disagree, possibly, as to the methods that should be adopted, but our aim, I am sure, is the same. The most certain way to secure that end, it seems to me, is to put all its transactions beyond suspicion, and I am glad to have the opportunity of vindicating the character of two of the directors of that institution by the production of these papers. One other t statement, and I have finished. It is in regard to the question of the insurances of employees of the bank. I have had a statement prepared regarding the 954 policies. Seven hundred and fifty-four were issued"" by the Australian Mutual Provident Society, 89 by the Mutua l L i fe and Citizens' Assurance Company, 51 by the National Mutual, and 61 by various other offices. Of the last 62 policies taken out by the employees, only four were issued by the MutualL if e and Citizens' Company.'

176,Honourable Member F Or Reid ( Mr Cole,"do not intend to say very many words in reply to the Treasurer's statement. The correspondence relating to what happened at the time that Sir Joseph Cook's Government relinquished office and Mr. Fisher took office bears out what Mr. Anstey said in this House. I shall leave that matter for Mr Anstey himself to deal with. I stated that I believed that persons employed in the Commonwealth Bank had to insure with the Mutua l L if e and Citizens Assurance Company Limited. I am glad to know that that statement was not correct. I did not say that this was Actually so, but that it was rumoured. I think that it would be f a r better for all concerned if the Government appointed some persons to make a proper inquiry into the allegations made in this House. While certain things have been answered, nothing at all has been said regarding Mr Garvan's overdraft, the period of that overdraft, and whether other _ customers had to meet their overdraft w it h in eighteen months. Strong allegations were made, and I think, in the interests of those gentlemen themselves, the least one could expect them to do was to ask that an inquiry should be made into the whole of the statements respecting the method of conducting the business of the Commonwealth Bank. That is the only way in which the position can be cleared in the public mind. support and emphasize the points made by the Leader of the Opposition.

I made my speech in this chamber in the belief that I was doingit in the interests of the public, as its representative in this Parliament. My attack was by no means intended to be personal. I made it because I considered the bank a national institution and for the reasons that I previously stated. I leave the matter at that stage. I shall carefully read the answer given by the Treasurer. I regret, also, that the principal points raised by me in my speech have not been answered. Owing to the lateness of the hour, I "" do not wish to pursue the matter furthe r at this stage. Treasurer w ill be making a great mistake if he thinks he can leave the question where it is. I have not taken any part in this discussion because I am uot familiar with the facts, but a very important matter like this cannot be ended by endeavouring to answer some of the definite statements made by the honourable member for Reid by merely reading a letter to this House, and then letting the subject rest. In the letter signed by the directors of the Commonwealth Bank they have evaded the main issues of the charges or statements made by the honourable member for Reid. They do not attempt to justify them, '.rhe directors take up one aspect which the honourable member for Eeid says was a subsidiary matter, and merely a supporting arguThe exchange tranment to the definite statements made. I I support the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition that a more impartial in vestigation should be made by members from both sides of the House, including an examination of those who made the statements. If we allow, the Minister of the day in charge of a department merely to get a statement signed by certain officials, place it upon the table of the House, and declare that D i d the company the last word has been spoken, and finality reached, we have reached a pretty pass.
