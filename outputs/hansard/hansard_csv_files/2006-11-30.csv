Beyond Home is a wonderful program which has provided transitional care services for veterans and/or family members in Sydney’s inner west who are transferring from home and into aged care. Moving from one’s home of many years can be a difficult thing for all of us, let alone the frail, elderly or those without family support structures. Beyond Home is a unique service that provides members of our ex-service community with practical and emotional support, be it information that allows informed decisions to be made, purchasing furniture for a new home or visiting members to calm their nerves while settling into their new environment. For all intents and purposes, Beyond Home workers walk hand in hand with the person during a transition period that could otherwise distress or overburden them. My attention has been drawn to the case of a local constituent, Rita Robinson, who is 87 years of age and partially blind. She has had to uproot her entire life to move into a nursing home and has openly admitted she could not have done so without the assistance and support of her Beyond Home volunteer. I understand that Ms Robinson and her volunteer have since forged a strong friendship. We are all required to be mindful of those within our communities who require our assistance and support. It is important for those of us who do enjoy the good life in Australia to help those who, for whatever reason, need our practical or emotional backing. Such a philosophy also extends to the government when it is running record budget surpluses and can clearly continue to fund this unique and important program. Australians have long placed considerable stock in the values of mateship and social justice, and those involved with Beyond Home have brought great credit to these values. When announcing funding for this program in 2004, the then Minister for Veterans’ Affairs stated: Australia owes a debt of gratitude to its veterans and service personnel for their service and sacrifice in times of war and conflict and their continuing contribution to our community. Never has a truer word been spoken. I would be grateful if the department could investigate extending this debt of gratitude by providing further funding for the Beyond Home project. I also placed question No. 4934 on yesterday’s Notice Paper for the minister’s attention and, given the budgetary pressures on Beyond Home, trust that the minister will address the matter raised as soon as he can. In speaking on this matter, I have not intended to merely strike at the heart of securing more funding for Beyond Home; I have sought to bring to the attention of those here today the need for ongoing support, be it financial or otherwise, for this and the many other worthy projects in our communities which are undoubtedly valued but whose work may sometimes be forgotten or taken for granted.

168,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (9.30 Am),"According to a report by Marie Sansom in today’s InWorld AIDS Day day which I hope will very much raise people’s awareness of one of the biggest development and security challenges facing the world today. The latest figures available indicate that there are an estimated 38.6 million people living with HIV and an estimated 4.1 million will become newly infected. Although AIDS is believed to have peaked, some countries are bucking the trend. A notable and worrying exception is Australia’s very close neighbour Papua New Guinea, which has the highest incidence of HIV-AIDS in the Pacific with 115 new cases a day. Reports suggest there are between 32,000 and 140,000 people living with HIV in PNG. These estimates are very rough, as the real prevalence of HIV-AIDS is unknown-not enough people are being tested in PNG. For example, last year only 4,000 people were tested out of a target of 50,000. PNG has reached a critical point where HIV-AIDS is now a generalised epidemic in both urban and rural communities, in both male and female, in both young and old, and threatens to be an epidemic of similar proportions in sub-Saharan Africa. If the disease grows at the current rate, by 2010, 1.2 million people in PNG will have HIV-AIDS and almost all of those people will be from the workforce, leaving a disproportionate number of dependent old people and children. Already over 60 per cent of occupied beds in Port Moresby General Hospital are for HIV related illnesses, with PNG losing many of its young and able people, the most affected group. Two other most affected groups are females between the ages of 20 and 30 and males between the ages of 20 and 40. Sexual violence and gender inequality increase the vulnerability of women to the disease as it is difficult for women to negotiate sexual relations and condom use. It is estimated that between 1,500 and 4,500 pregnant women in the country were HIV positive in 2003, potentially passing on the virus to some 1,400 babies during birth or breastfeeding. Globally, with 65 million infected to date and nearly 25 million people already dead, AIDS is one of the greatest development and security issues facing the world today. The challenge it presents to the Pacific region requires exceptional ongoing leadership. We know full well what disaster awaits if the response to AIDS continues to be inadequate. On the eve of World AIDS Day, I want to remind those closer to home and those here at home-young Australians-that they are playing with fire if they have casual sex without a condom. Education education in schools for almost 25 years as a primary school teacher, an education consultant in primary methodology, a school principal and a president of the Adelaide Metropolitan Principals Association. I can teach. I can run a school and I influence my peers to aspire to higher levels of performance. Unlike almost any other profession, everyone has an opinion on education, many declaring themselves experts based on only their own personal involvement. They are usually and consistently wrong. During my educational and political career I have met, listened to and read the narrative of some of the most stupid people in Australia on educational issues-the pity being that so many of them hold such senior positions in education.

There are some common failings: a lack of a sound educational rationale, a lack of common sense and a lack of an identifiable and coherent set of educational outcomes. I note with great sadness the void of national educational leadership in both the House and the Senate at the executive level of government and opposition for the last 20 years. In this parliament, education requires, in the national interest, bipartisan support. As we slip ever further downward in OECD surveys and international comparisons, education flounders and splutters in an ever-increasing morass of confusion. The parliament, under the influence of its respective executives, treats education as an opportunity to divide, distract, divert, wedge, engage in pointless one-upmanship and generally act at a crass lowest-ever common denominator level. In almost 20 years I have never heard what would even be close to an inspirational speech on education in this place from a senior member of government or opposition. More often than not, the opposite is true. That is a national tragedy and that is the major reason why education in this country at all levels has slumped into a most unsatisfactory onesize-fits-all category. Primary and secondary schools are deliberately disadvantaged in this country at both public and private levels. Public education is white-anted. Senior secondary schools and universities so jealously protect their undeserved privileges by comparison with primary and junior secondary schools that they deliberately opt out of leadership that could reform and return education in Australia to a fair, sensible and quality system. There are some saving graces. There are the teachers and principals in our schools who quietly and effectively filter out the educational claptrap and get on with tried and proven educational programs. However, I get the impression that their numbers, particularly at the principal level, are diminishing. Secondly, there is the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Vocational Training, which, over the last 18 years, has been the only real forum for proper debate for education in this country. (Time expired) Iraq tion moved in the House by the member for Ryan on Monday. Extremist Islamic groups like Jemaah Islamiah-JI-would have their popularity propped up through a supposed victory if troops leave Iraq before the job is finished. I remind this chamber of the 92 Australians and the 245 other people who died as a result of the JI terrorist attacks in other parts of the world. These were in Bali in 2002 and 2005, the Marriott Hotel attack in Jakarta in 2003 and at the Australian Embassy in Jakarta in 2004. I want to highlight to the chamber the incredible job that our Australian troops are doing in Iraq. The fact that troops have been able to withdraw from the Al Muthanna and Dhi Qar provinces is a positive sign. Now troops are supporting the Iraqi security forces in these two provinces. They are also assisting in preparing and training the Iraqi army to be able to operate independently in the future. I was privileged to visit Iraq about 12 months ago as part of my role as Chair of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I saw these young Australian men and women in action. They are very proud to be part of the MAIN COMMITTEE",127,Statements By Members
171,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa) (9.39 Am),"I rise to continue my comments on the morebuilding of Iraq. I have nothing but admiration for the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. They are doing an absolutely outstanding job. It is crucial that the Australian Defence Force remain in Iraq to assist in the creation of a democratic and free society-a society in which its people adhere to the rule of law, are tolerant of other people’s beliefs and can live safely without fear for their lives. Extreme Islamic groups reject this concept of a society and have used and will use indiscriminate violence in the future, unless we continue to remain in Iraq and help Iraq to determine its own future. Not only will keeping Australians troops in Iraq until the job is completed benefit the people of Iraq; it will benefit the wider community by not allowing extreme terrorist organisations to grow and cause more bloodshed and heartache to many innocent families across the world. I conclude by saying that the tragic news of the Black Hawk accident off Fiji overnight reminds us all of the dangers that our men and women of the ADF face as they operate and train on a daily basis. I hope, as the search goes on for the missing soldier, that it is successful. I extend my sympathies to all those who have suffered as a result of the accident overnight. (Time expired) Merchant Mariners Memorial Service Ms HALL (Shortland) (9.42 am)-On Saturday, 3 December, at 11.15 am, the 11th memorial service for merchant mariners will be held at Norah Head. This service is held on the first Saturday of December every year at the Norah Head Merchant Mariners Memorial to commemorate the significant role played by merchant mariners on the Central Coast in defending Australia during World War II. I have invited interested people to attend the service to remember and honour the invaluable service of merchant mariners. During the war, one in nine merchant mariners perished. We must all recognise the debt that all Australians owe regarding the great contribution made by our merchant mariners. The service holds special significance for families and friends of those mariners who died when the MV Nimbin sank after striking a mine on 5 December 1940. The Nimbin was the first vessel to be sunk by enemy action off Australia’s east coast in World War II. In fact, we will have two survivors, Don Burchell and Mick Harris, from another ship that sank in local waters in 1942, the SS Iron Chieftan. The Nimbin had struck a mine laid days before by the German raider Pinguin. Seven of the crew of 20 of the Nimbin, including its captain, Captain Byzantson, went down with the ship. On Saturday, the coastguard from Sydney Harbour, Cottage Point-Hawkesbury River, Swansea and Tuggerah Lakes, Terrigal Sea Rescue, Norah Head Search and Rescue and Hawkesbury River VRA, along with New South Wales Maritime and possibly the Water Police, will be in attendance. The ceremony this year will be very special because a flotilla of boats will be assembled off the headland at Norah Head. The boats will move to the position where the MV Nimbin sank, place a wreath on the water and observe one minute’s silence. The service will be broadcast to ships up and down the coast of New South Wales. I would encourage people to attend, as I feel it is very important that Australians recognise the significant heroism of merchant mariners during World War II. I would like to thank all those who have been involved in organising this service, particularly Graeme Bissaker from Tuggerah Lakes Volunteer Coast Guard, as he has been instruMAIN COMMITTEE mental in helping to arrange for the coastguard to be located off Norah Head; members of the Merchant Mariners Organising Committee; the Norah Head Lighthouse Trust; Lyndal Bailey from the Gorokan High School band; the coastguard chaplain, Brian Jago; Father Hessey; the Gorokan High School band; Gregory Gould, who will be singing the national anthem; the Hawkesbury VRA; Lakes Anglican Grammar School; Malcolm Wright from the RVCP; Mannering Park Sea Scouts; the Maritime Union of Australia; Norah Head Search and Rescue; NSW Maritime; Soldiers Beach Surf Life Saving Club; Terrigal Sea Rescue; Toukley RSL Club Ltd; Toukley RSL Pipes and Drums; Toukley RSL Sub-branch; and Wyong Shire Council. (Time expired) Bonner Electorate: Bayside Water Action Group ter-recycling project that I am currently working on with the bayside community in Bonner. This project is not only helping to unite the Wynnum-Manly community but encouraging local residents, organisations and schools to think more carefully about how we can conserve and recycle our precious water resource together. Mr David Seeley from the Wynnum Golf Club and Mr Stan Plath from the Wynnum-Manly Leagues Club are two outstanding community leaders who share a genuine concern for our environment and the impact of current water restrictions and water shortages. In October this year Mr Seeley approached me with plans for an initiative which would see recycled water used to irrigate bayside parks and sports fields through a purpose-built pipeline. It is a plan that I believe can indeed be made possible, but it requires the full support of not only the community but each level of government. The bayside of Brisbane is a diverse but unique community, home to many local clubs, sports and school fields and community based organisations. Water is of course a resource in major demand, not only for basic necessities but for larger-scale irrigation. With the everdecreasing supply of readily available water, the community is becoming increasingly concerned about the future health of local sport and club fields, parks and the like. It is this concern that led Mr Seeley and Mr Plath to join with me and representatives of the community in forming the Bayside Water Action Group, which will focus on driving towards this water recycling project. Essentially, we will work towards raising and obtaining the funds to construct a pipeline to run from the local Wynnum-Manly waste water treatment plant through to the bayside so that the community organisations, clubs and schools in this region can all utilise recycled water. At present, the Wynnum waste water treatment plant is pumping out eight megalitres of water per day. While seven of those megalitres are accounted for, one megalitre is still available. If we can find a way to harness this recycled water for use by the community clubs, the bayside could play a vital role in saving our water resource. As the plant expands, more recycled water will be made available to the project and, in turn, the community will benefit further. Brisbane City Council has already been briefed on the project and a number of representatives from the water department are working with the Bayside Water Action Group to develop a detailed proposal. Letters have been sent to the Lord Mayor and to my state colleague the Hon. Paul Lucas urging support for the project and assistance to make this proposal a reality for the bayside community.

(Time expired) Postcard from Lombok Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (9.48 am)-TodayI want to read a postcard from Lombok from a friend and colleague of mine, Val Campbell: When writing about the Afghan Asylum Seekers stranded in Lombok, Indonesia, I am not referring to the past or providing detailed information about how they came to be there. This has all been covered in documents which are all available in the Internet ... especially the transcript of the Four Corners program and other progress reports on Australia’s and IMO supervision of these people. Particularly graphic are the reports, which outline the failed attempts of these desperate people to reach asylum in Australia and their subsequent five-year detention in a camp/compound in Lombok. Whilst these people are not behind bars and razor wire, they are effectively economically imprisoned by their inability to leave the island and not being permitted to work. These background documents make fascinating and heart-rending reading and explain in detail the horrifying experiences that these people have survived. I write this as a refugee support activist and a volunteer at the Asylum Seekers Resource Centre in Melbourne where I teach English to people new to Australia who are on temporary protection visas and thus denied government funded English lessons. There are 55 Afghans, 43 Iraqi and 21 Vietnamese in Lombok at the time of writing. Of the 54 Afghans, 15 are children aged from one 14 years. There and many more Afghan and Iraqi asylum seekers in Jakarta, plus 107 from Sri Lanka, 14 from Burma. She goes on: Regarding life in Mataram, I was advised that the first year there was pretty awful, as the Lombokians although Muslim were quite hostile as they feared the asylum seekers, particularly I guess because of the shortage of work in Lombok. But over time they have come to recognize that these are good living, non-violent people, who cannot attempt to take jobs, the locals are pleasant and quite supportive of the camp people. Also the Afghans have learned the Indonesian language, and people in Lombok appreciate it if you converse with them in Indonesian. The camp is not far from the large Mataram market where the daily food is obtained, so there is some social interaction with locals in the market situation. People in the camp live mostly on rice, a little vegetable, and occasionally a little fish, chicken or meat. Some families make their own Afghan-type bread. Most families have a little gas cooker, some have an old refrigerator, and a little furniture, but mostly people sit and sleep on the floor. How are they living? Val writes: International Organization of Migration (IOM) who is paid by the Australian Government provides the basic accommodation. The Afghan people receive a few large bottles of water per family each week ... They receive a few $USD a week for food. But, since it costs money to send their children to school, a lot of this money is consumed in educating their children. They live on a very basic subsistence of two meals a day. They have very little furniture and the living conditions are far from the hotel accommodation that some in Australia like to say these refugees in Indonesia are surviving in. Val ends by asking why these people cannot come to Australia. Most of them have family, relatives, here. Most of them have skills that are needed here. Why can’t they come to Australia to work? Why are they stranded in this no-situation in Indonesia? She says: They deserve better. They are not queue jumpers, there was no queue to join. They are genuine asylum seekers who have risked their lives more than once to find a safe and better place for themselves and their children. It is simply absurd that Australia continues to pay the IOM to keep these people out of Australia and even more disgusting that they would offer money to encourage them to return to unsafe MAIN COMMITTEE home countries. The Lombok asylum seekers must be supported to come to Australia to be with their families and other people who have fled intolerable situations in their home country. (Time expired) Oil for Food Program the parliament his findings after a year of investigation into the alleged conduct, impropriety and illegality of the AWB. His report was tabled this week. Of course, as members of the government and members of the executive contended all along, they were innocent of any alleged illegality, impropriety or constructive knowledge of the illegality of the AWB company. This is not satisfactory to the federal opposition. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition and, in particular, the shadow foreign minister should hang their heads in absolute shame after a year of seeking to tarnish the good name and reputation of members of the government and, in particular, Foreign Minister Downer, the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile. They should hang their heads in shame for seeking to smear the honour and the reputation of distinguished Australians serving their country as members of the government. I want to quote what Commissioner Cole said: There is no evidence that any of the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Trade or the Minister for Agriculture ... were ever informed about, or otherwise acquired knowledge of, the relevant activities of AWB. These are the words of Commissioner Cole, a very distinguished lawyer and a very distinguished former judge of a superior court of this country, making it absolutely clear that the Prime Minister, the foreign minister, the trade minister and the agriculture minister had no reason to have any information about the alleged activities of the AWB. Of course, the allegations coming from the federal opposition-allegations of corruption, bribery, dishonesty, deceit, cover-ups and immorality-are absolutely untenable to remain unchallenged in this postCole climate. We must continue to defend our names and our honour. I know the ALP does not like the findings of the Cole commission, but we must remember that this was a royal commission. It had all the powers of a royal commission, including powers of subpoena-indeed, powers of subpoena to the effect that the most sensitive documents of departments came before it. It was fully transparent. The Prime Minister of this country gave evidence. The foreign minister of this country gave evidence. The Deputy Prime Minister of this country gave evidence. And, after a long period of forensic and clinical investigation, the Cole commission cleared the Howard government. It cleared the names of the foreign minister, the trade minister and the agriculture minister, yet the character assassinations of the Labor Party continue. You cannot attack people’s reputation without substantial evidence, and the Labor Party should hang their heads in absolute shame.

Rather than being clear with local residents and saying once and for all what is going to happen with the land, the Howard government persists with its use of weasel words. In August last year I asked the minister for transport about the plans the government had for the Badgerys Creek site and the reasons for its ongoing planning restrictions. Not until 30 May this year-some nine months later-did I get an answer that was full of the government’s weasel words. The minister said this: ‘The government has previously made it clear that it does not believe that a second airport will be needed in the foreseeable future.’ The key words are ‘the foreseeable future’. The minister did not say what the foreseeable future was. The minister did not give good reasons for not lifting the planning restrictions, for why double glazing of windows and additional insulation is used and still being required of local residents or for why residents of Western Sydney should continue to face the uncertainties they do. Federal Labor has made it clear that, when it comes to Badgerys Creek, the airport will not be built. The only conclusion I can draw from the use of the words ‘foreseeable future’ is that buried somewhere deep in the Prime Minister’s bottom drawer is a plan to build Badgerys Creek airport. If the government does not have a plan to build the airport, it should remove the planning restrictions. Later today the Western Sydney Alliance will be meeting the shadow minister for transport, Kerry O’Brien, me and other Western Sydney Labor MPs to highlight the impact of the ongoing planning restrictions. The feelings of local residents were well and truly vented at a recent meeting that I attended at the Kemps Creek Public School. These feelings of local residents will certainly be made clear when the alliance meets in Canberra today. As the member for Macarthur said recently when asked about the government’s plan for Badgerys Creek, ‘We are in government to govern, but no-one wants to make a decision.’ No truer words have been spoken by the member for Macarthur, and on this occasion I stand here to say that I fully agree with his synopsis of this government’s actions, or lack of actions, when it comes to Badgerys Creek.

I am hoping to attend Charles Sturt University and complete a Bachelor of Arts (Communication-Journalism) and then hopefully begin work as a political journalist. I have recently become interested in foreign correspondence when a teacher suggested I would be good at this. Further research on this branch of journalism has caused me to possibly consider it as a career option. However my main interests still lie within Australian politics and working in a politician’s office would be one of the ultimate successes for me as a journalist. My parents, along with two of my sisters, drove me to Nowra. The trip was about eight hours long and very tiring. However once I started working at Joanna’s it was well worth the journey.

I have always wanted to work in a politician’s office to gain an insight into the daily workings of a politician’s life. I was ecstatic to learn that I was going to have the opportunity to travel to Nowra to work at Joanna Gash’s office. Working in Joanna’s office taught me a lot. Firstly, I have learnt that when you work in a politician’s office there is a lot of folding, collating and envelope stuffing that has to be done. Although this is not the most exciting job, it has to be done and while folding pamphlets I had the opportunity to listen and observe the inner workings of the office, which is something I would not have missed. This leads me to my next point; the staff of a politician has a lot of work to do. Joanna’s staff is always working hard organising events, writing press releases, helping the people of Gilmore and quite often people that are not even in their electorate. There is never a moment to rest when you work for Joanna; she loves to get involved in everything she possibly can (to her credit). However, the staff is always willing to help anyone that calls or comes into the office in any way they can. I hope that if some day I have the opportunity to work in a politician’s office, the staff will be as hard working and dedicated as Joanna’s. I have attended a number of meetings and functions with Joanna and had the opportunity to meet a lot of people that are involved in politics and the media; this has been invaluable to me as I have been able to talk to people in the industry I am hoping to work in. Talking to these people has allowed me to learn about the ins and outs of being a journalist and I have been able to see first hand how they work. To work in this occupation, I have discovered quite quickly that you need to be dedicated to your job. Getting up early and working until late at night is not unusual. Many unexpected twists can occur when planning an event and the ability to be able to accept this and work out a solution is vital to making this office run smoothly. Cooperation is a fundamental necessity when it comes to working in this office. The staff help each other whenever they can to make each other’s work-load a little lighter. These people are dedicated to giving Joanna as much coverage as she can get and should be commended on the excellent work that they do, it is not an easy job. As well as folding pamphlets and stuffing envelopes, I was given the opportunity to do a lot of things in the media section of her office. I did a lot of research on issues such as the current nuclear energy debate and the rising interest rates. I went to an oyster farm at Shoalhaven with Joanna to do a photo shoot with the owners of the farm. The opportunity to get practical experience is something that has been invaluable to me as it has confirmed that journalism and politics are my passion and the career I definitely wish for myself.

177,Mr Hunt (Flinders,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment andThe purpose of the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment (Antarctic Seals and Other Measures) Bill 2006 is to make amendments to the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980 and the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Act 2005. The Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980 gives effect to Australia’s obligations under the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty-the Madrid protocol of 1991, of which Australia was a principal architect. The Madrid protocol afforded significantly increased protection to the Antarctic environment. Measures giving effect to Australia’s obligations under the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Seals 1978 are currently embodied in the Antarctic Seals Conservation Regulations 1986, which means that penalties for offences can only be set at a low level. This bill transfers the seals related measures in the existing Antarctic Seals Conservation Regulations 1986 into the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980. Seals and whales are the only two families of mammals native to the Antarctic. Whales are already protected under the provisions of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The bill increases the penalties for seal related offences to bring them into line with other wildlife related penalties in the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980. Taking seals for commercial purposes will remain prohibited. The Madrid protocol specifically prohibits mining in the Antarctic, and mining remains prohibited by the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980. In addition to the pecuniary penalty already available, the bill introduces a maximum imprisonment penalty of 16 years for mining in the Antarctic. The ban on mining is the key feature of the Madrid protocol and the severity of the proposed penalty reflects the seriousness of this offence as well as the degree of premeditated planning required to commit such an action. In recognition of the high scientific value of meteorites found in the Antarctic, the Antarctic Treaty Parties in 2003 agreed to a measure to protect them from uncontrolled collection. The bill implements this agreement by requiring a permit to collect meteorites or to remove meteorites or rocks from the Antarctic. Accordingly, it will also be an offence for a person to remove a meteorite or rock collected in the Antarctic. Collecting rocks and meteorites under a permit is exempted from the restriction on mining activities. The bill will also extend to individual animals the protection afforded by the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980 to seals and birds in concentrations of more than 20. As a precaution against the introduction of non-native organisms and diseases to the Antarctic environment, the bill includes the requirement for a permit to re-introduce a native bird or seal to the Antarctic. Such a permit would set appropriate conditions for the safe reintroduction of a native animal. This requirement would apply, for example, to the return to the Antarctic of a vagrant individual or a specimen from a zoo. The bill also adjusts other penalties throughout the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980 to better reflect the hierarchy of offences, and to more closely align them with penalties for similar offences under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Finally, the bill will amend the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Act 2005 to allow a WELS standard to be incorporated by reference into a determination that relates to a particuMAIN COMMITTEE lar WELS product, and make another minor amendment to correct a drafting error regarding the definition of offence against this Act. In particular, I want to take this opportunity to congratulate not only the Department of the Environment and Heritage but also the Minister for the Environment and Heritage and his staff on this work. The minister has been a champion of Antarctic species mammals protection. It has been one of the defining elements of his period as environment minister, and at present he is one of the world’s leading conservationists for marine mammals. I believe that the extension of the Antarctic seals protection measures embodied in this legislation is an appropriate step forward and also a symbol of the commitment which he and the government have towards the protection of Antarctic mammals and marine mammals in general. I am delighted to commend this legislation to the House. ronment and Heritage Legislation Amendment (Antarctic Seals and Other Measures) Bill 2006. We do have, however, deep concerns about the government’s approach to environmental protection. The Howard government has delivered one extreme bill after another, each one designed to trample on environment protection measures. So it is a small relief to find a bill that we can actually support. The rule seems to be to introduce bills that roll back environmental protection, but this bill seems to be the exception. Maybe the influence of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage has brought about this result. The Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment (Antarctic Seals and Other Measures) Bill 2006 transfers the protection of seals in the Antarctic Seals Conservation Regulations Act 1986 to the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980. This enables penalties to be imposed which are in line with other wildlife related offences and to meet Australia’s obligations under the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, commonly known as the Madrid protocol. The bill also amends the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Act 2005 to enable a determination by incorporation of a reference to the water efficiency and labelling standards. It also makes other minor drafting amendments. I note that Senator Ellison in his second reading speech stated: In addition to the pecuniary penalty already available, the bill introduces a maximum imprisonment penalty of sixteen years for mining in the Antarctic. The ban on mining is the key feature of the Madrid Protocol and the severity of the proposed penalty reflects the seriousness of this offence as well as the degree of premeditated planning required to commit such an action. In recognition of the high scientific value of meteorites found in the Antarctic, the Antarctic Treaty Parties in 2003 agreed to a measure to protect them from uncontrolled collection.

Accordingly, it will also be an offence for a person to remove a meteorite or rock collected in the Antarctic. Collecting rocks and meteorites under a permit is exempted from the restriction on mining activities. The bill will also extend to individual animals the protection afforded by the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980 to seals and birds in concentrations of more than 20. Those measures are fine, but the real issue is the Howard government’s environmental performance. The problem with the inadequate performance of the government is best illustrated by the amendments currently being proposed to Australia’s main environmental law-the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. This bill shows how arrogant the MAIN COMMITTEE",134,Environment And Heritage Legislation Amendment Antarctic Seals And Other Measures Bill 2006
178,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (10.06 Am),"The Australian Labor Party support the Envigovernment is when it comes to environmental protection. Let us not forget there was no exposure draft and no environmental heritage groups were consulted about the bill. The 409page bill was introduced in the House on the Thursday and debated the following Wednesday. The bill was debated in the House without a Bills Digest and before submissions had even been received for the Senate inquiry. Senator Carr, Labor’s representative on the Senate inquiry into the bill, was given only eight minutes to question each witness. WA Liberal senator David Johnson got it absolutely right when he told the Senate on 18 October 2006 that the explanatory memorandum for the bill: … is probably one of the most appalling I have ever seen in the short time. I have been in the Senate. It discloses no motivation, no reasoning and no justification for some of the most draconian powers that this parliament can conceivably and possibly enact: rights of search and seizure without warrant and rights of personal frisking without warrant. … … … … this legislation should go back to the drawing board. It is of particular concern that we have the extraordinary position that the EPBC Act has 733 pages and the bill has 409 pages of amendments, and yet we have no reference whatsoever to climate change as part of the legislation or the amendments. The other issue that is worth addressing, given the relevance to the bill currently before the House, is the protection of whales. There is a profound irony that the environment minister uses the EPBC Act as his personal political plaything but runs a mile from it when it is all too hard. Just have a look at the Australian Whale Sanctuary. The EPBC Act provides for the establishment of an Australian whale sanctuary to: … give formal recognition of the high level of protection and management afforded to cetaceans (whales and dolphins) in Commonwealth marine areas and prescribed waters. It is a legally-binding safe haven for whales, and what has the Howard government done with these powers? Absolutely nothing. It is tragic that more whales than ever before have been slaughtered in the Australian Whale Sanctuary since it was established because the Australian government has refused to enforce the EPBC Act. It has also refused to take legal action. Indeed, when the HSI took legal action to enforce the EPBC Act, the Attorney-General intervened in the court case. In his submission, he said: It would create a diplomatic disagreement with Japan. Japan are our friends, but we do have a diplomatic disagreement when it comes to whales and when it comes to the failure to enforce the Australian Whale Sanctuary. In conclusion, the Labor Party supports the bill before the House, but we do have very deep concerns about the government’s approach to environmental protection. There is, of course, no more important issue than the issue of climate change, and this is a government that is failing to address the greatest challenge facing the global community in the interests of not just this generation but future generations to come. Ms HALL (Shortland) (10.12 am)-I share the concerns that the shadow minister has about the government’s approach to environmental protection. I believe that the government’s action in relation to climate change is flawed. It is letting the Australian people down in relaMAIN COMMITTEE tion to introducing initiatives to address climate change and in its failure to sign the Kyoto agreement. In the last week that the parliament was sitting, we debated the environment and heritage amendment legislation, which the government argued was to address the balance between the environment and development. I believe it removes the balance; it moves it away from the environment and towards development. These are two examples of how the government has failed to give real protection to the environment, protection for which the Australian people look to the government. The Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment (Antarctic Seals and Other Measures) Bill 2006, which we are debating today, transfers the protection of seals from the Antarctic Seals Conservation Regulation 1986 to the Antarctic Treaty (Environmental Protection) Act 1980. It also makes some minor amendments to the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Act. It enables penalties to be imposed which are in line with other wildlife related offences and it allows Australia to meet obligations under the Protocol for Environmental Protection to the Antarctic treaty, the Madrid protocol. The bill removes the protections given to seals under the Antarctic environmental protection act, whilst whales remain protected under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, the EPBC Act-and I will talk a little more about that in a moment. The bill also creates new offences relating to the removal and collection of rocks and meteorites from the Antarctic and updates offences in relation to the disturbance of Antarctic flora and fauna. They are very important initiatives, particularly given the fragile nature of the environment in the Antarctic. This is not a controversial piece of legislation and we on this side of the parliament are supporting it. As the shadow minister said, it gives us great pleasure to join with the government on an issue that deals with the protection of the environment. Seals were previously protected under the Antarctic Seals Conservation Regulations 1986. Those came into effect because Australia was not supportive of the commercial sealing that was taking place-and this goes as far back as 1960. Commercial sealing was an industry that we had serious concerns about. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals was set up to protect the six species of seals in the Antarctic: the southern elephant seal, the leopard seal, the Weddell seal, the crab-eater seal, the Ross seal and the southern fur seal. Seals are a species we really need to protect. Article7 of the protocol prohibits any activity connected with mineral resources other than for scientific research. The text of the protocol can be found in schedule 2 of the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980. Obviously the purpose is to avoid adverse impacts on the Antarctic environment. The legislation also looks at trying to avoid adverse effects on climate or weather patterns. The attempts to look at addressing that issue are very important given the current environment. They are also very important given the fact that throughout the world we have very serious concerns about changes in weather patterns. It is very important for us as a nation and as a society to realise how important it is that we are very mindful of actions that can impact on the weather and on our environment. It also looks at ensuring that the fauna and flora are protected. The protection of whales is an important part of the EPBC Act, which deals with the establishment of sanctuaries. While the act does establish sanctuaries, and government members are very supportive of the protection of whales, it is quite different when it comes to the enMAIN COMMITTEE forcement of the act. So, while the act prevents the slaughter of whales, the government refuses to enforce the act. I find it quite disconcerting that on one hand members of the government promote the protection of whales while on the other hand they fail to to enforce this protection. In conclusion, I reiterate that it is so important that as a nation we protect our environment. If we do not care for our environment, we are not caring for our future. By having a sound, flourishing environment and protecting the global environment we are ensuring the future of not only our nation but nations throughout the world. Heritage) (10.21 am)-in reply-In rising to conclude the debate on the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment (Antarctic Seals and Other Measures) Bill 2006, I want to thank those members who have spoken in the debate. The member for Grayndler presented, in his customary fashion, the opposition’s perspective. I refer in particular to the comments made by the member for Shortland, who gave a brief but moving eulogy on the importance of marine mammals, and I respect her commitment to these noble creatures. The amendments to the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980 will significantly strengthen the government’s protection of the Antarctic environment by, firstly, incorporating the provisions of the Antarctic Seals Conservation Regulations 1986 into the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980. This will afford additional protection to seals in the Antarctic by enabling appropriate penalties to be set for seal related offences. Secondly, it will introduce new offences regarding the collection and removal of rocks and meteorites from Antarctica. Antarctica, as I have previously noted, is a particularly rich source of meteorites, which are scientifically important, as was highlighted only this year in a major international film. These amendments recognise the high scientific value of these meteorites and give effect to an Antarctic treaty measure prohibiting the collection of meteorites and rocks in the Antarctic. Thirdly, the amendments introduce a maximum penalty of 16 years imprisonment for mining in the Antarctic, which will be additional to the pecuniary penalty already in the act of up to $110,000. The Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty prohibits activities related to mineral resources other than for scientific research. Because the ban on mining is a key feature of the protocol and any mining activity would require a significant amount of planning and resources, it is appropriate that the penalty for mining activities in the Antarctic be increased to reflect the serious impact that such activities could have on the sensitive Antarctic environment and Australia’s standing in the Antarctic Treaty system. The bill also amends the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Act 2005. These amendments are required to enable the establishment of water efficiency labelling and standards for a product, to be incorporated by reference into a determination that relates to the WELS product, and make another minor amendment to correct a drafting error regarding the definition of offences against this act. I conclude by making two points. Firstly, in relation to the view presented by the member for Grayndler that, whilst he welcomed the increased protection for marine mammals, he believed that there was still insufficient protection for whales, he has ignored the fact that the government has, under the EPBC Act, a strong and powerful criminal deterrent for inappropriate activities. This is a powerful regulation and enforcement mechanism, and we will not MAIN COMMITTEE",136,Environment And Heritage Legislation Amendment Antarctic Seals And Other Measures Bill 2006
179,Mr Hunt (Flinders,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment andhesitate to use it appropriately, as and when it comes up. Secondly, this is part of a broad push, led by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell, to safeguard marine mammals not just within Australian waters, not just within the Antarctic, but on a global basis. We make no apologies for the vigour with which we pursue our protection of marine mammals throughout the world. These creatures, whether they are whales or seals within our own waters or whales internationally, are a profoundly important part of the ecosystem and are also global environmental treasures. It is our task and our responsibility not only to conserve these species but also to let them grow and become a permanent feature and to never lose them for future generations. They are a fundamental part of our global biosphere, and we are proud to play a small role in ensuring that future generations have these animals as part of their global treasures. I am delighted to commend the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment (Antarctic Seals and Other Measures) Bill 2006 to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Central Queensland University build on opportunities on all its campuses in the Central Queensland area with a great deal of benefit to the provincial cities which have those campuses. Two weeks ago, on 16 November, I had the honour of opening Bundaberg campus’s $4.7 million academic and research building, which is designed to further the university’s research activities into science, multimedia studies, interactive journalism and information technology. The Commonwealth has played a key role in funding the development of this infrastructure and research program at CQU and has contributed to the establishment of this new infrastructure through a $1.9 million allocation from the Capital Development Pool program. The remaining $2.8 million was contributed by CQU itself. By helping to develop the campus research capabilities in the areas of science, information technology, multimedia studies and interactive journalism, the government is giving students even more reasons to consider studying in Bundaberg. As we all know, young people who do university courses in provincial areas are more likely to settle in provincial areas. The new business will allow CQU to expand its number of courses, including nursing, science, environmental science, human movements, biology, chemistry and, of course, as I said, aspects of journalism. Two of the four dedicated research rooms have already been allocated to environmental research groups, with a full-time research fellow and a possible research assistant taking up residence. I must say that the major twin laboratory which I inspected was most impressive. Bundaberg CQU campus is tangible evidence that a university does not have to be city based to provide facilities with top quality academic and research facilities.

180,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (10.26 Am),I move:,140,Adjournment
181,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (10.26 Am),"The Central Queensland University is continuing towill build on that reputation and will foster on-campus research, which has been growing in importance to the university in recent years. The Bundaberg campus has come a remarkably long way in a relatively short time, and there is no doubt that this new complex will prove to be a catalyst in the next phase of growth and service to the surrounding region. I have been associated with the Central Queensland University from right back when it was the Capricornia Institute of Advanced Education. In fact, I was on the council of the university at the time when it went from an institute to a university college and then to a university, all in one three-year process. I can remember, too, its early foundations in Bundaberg, where I was on the original committee seeking a university for the city. Our plans were not quite for what has turned out today; they were overtaken by the Dawkins plan-which I commend, I might add-and it has meant a great step forward in the university’s development. To have come from 14 students in the old Christian Brothers college buildings to the university today with approximately 1,000 students and in such a short time is quite remarkable. In today’s academic environment, access to state-of-the-art learning facilities is crucial to extending each student’s learning. By enhancing the campus’s research capabilities, CQU is giving its students the right tools for learning into the future. The university recognises the growing importance of continuing education and the need for people to be lifelong learners. Not too long ago I attended the opening of the campus’s information commons, which will provide easier access to online library databases along with multimedia and print resources. To see such a rapid expansion in development of local tertiary education resources is a great show of faith in regional Queensland and the people who choose to support CQU. I commend the vision of CQU, the Vice-Chancellor, Professor Rickard, and its former heads of campus, Alex Grady and Helen Huntly, and their enthusiasm for partnering with the government to provide more opportunities to regional communities. Partnerships such as this prove that the Australian government is not just investing in bricks and mortar but in regional universities and in what they can do for those communities. Mr David Hicks should be of grave concern to any government which purports to espouse the values of freedom, liberty and justice. I speak about the continued incarceration of Mr David Hicks, who has been held in US custody for over five years. In his Australia Day address on 26 January this year the Prime Minister rightly paid tribute to ‘the rule of law upheld by an independent and admirably incorruptible judiciary’. While many utilise those three words ‘rule of law’ as powerful rhetorical weapons, we ought to be concerned that their actions or inactions make a mockery of what those words actually stand for. We must never forget that one eminent principle emanating from the rule of law is that no free man or woman should be deprived of his or her life, liberty or property save by the due process of the law. What, then, ought those with an undiminished belief in the rule of law make of David Hicks’s continued detention at Guantanamo? Perhaps we could gain some insight from the esteemed former Chief Justice of Australia, Sir Gerard Brennan, who has said that Australians should examine: MAIN COMMITTEE",140,Adjournment
182,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (10.32 Am),"This morning I wish to again raise a matter that... how we have tolerated for five years now the barbarous treatment of the Australian David Hicks in Guantanamo Bay, still waiting to be charged, it seems, with an offence under a law yet to be specified, and tried by a process which mocks the civil rights sense of justice. While the Howard government likes to talk about the rule of law, it has turned a blind eye to the US government’s erosion of judicial principles in the David Hicks case. While the Howard government likes to talk about upholding the rule of law, it has done little to seek natural justice for David Hicks. One’s belief in the rule of law should be all pervasive. The rule of law ought to transcend the standards and behaviour found within any context, including the ‘war on terror’. We all loathe the thought of any Australian engaging in terrorist activities. We all detest terrorism. But the rule of law entails basic legal principles which any member of the Free World ought to adhere to. How can those who truly believe in a government of laws and not of men stand inert while David Hicks remains in detention without charge for years-not days or months? How can they stand by while attempts are made to establish a military commission which could be conceived as being imbued with self-interest or a partisan duty to convict? What guarantees have the Hicks family been provided to allay their legitimate doubts that a military commission will exist and operate independently from, and in paramountcy to, the US government? How can those who truly believe in the rule of law allow David Hicks to potentially be convicted on evidence obtained by coercion, on evidence which he may not have seen or on hearsay, with no inalienable right to cross-examine? These rules and procedures do not emanate from an ‘independent and admirably incorruptible judiciary’ that the Prime Minister has previously spoken about so fondly. These are not trifling matters, but they have been treated as such by members of the Howard government. Echoing the Fremantle declaration, I call on the Howard government to do far more than has been done previously to uphold these basic legal principles and to do so immediately. The continued imprisonment of David Hicks in these conditions is inhumane and an anathema to the very values that Australia stands for and seeks to promote worldwide. In the light of the disgraceful responses I have received to my questions about David Hicks’s case on the Notice Paper, including questions Nos 2788, 2789 and 4109, I am now calling on the Attorney-General to respond immediately to my question No. 4924, which I placed on the Notice Paper on Tuesday of this week. Members would recall that in August this year the Attorney-General indicated that he wanted a new US military tribunal and fresh charges to be in place by November. The Attorney-General also indicated that if this did not happen ‘as quickly as possible’ he would be seeking Mr Hicks’s return in the same way he did with Mamdouh Habib. Given that this time frame has now elapsed, and bearing in mind that it is 30 November today, the Attorney-General must answer my questions as a matter of urgency, for not only me and the Hicks family but also all the people who are supporting this matter. It is no longer good enough to feign concern about the treatment of Mr Hicks and do nothing. That is hypocrisy of the worse kind. Australian Wheat Industry came out this week and there are some enormous decisions that are going to have to be made over the next months in relation to the wheat industry. I spoke about it in a matter of public importance debate yesterday. One of the great concerns that has been raised since yesterday is MAIN COMMITTEE",141,Adjournment
183,Mr Windsor (New England) (10.36 Am),"As everybody is aware, the Cole inquirythat the Leader of the National Party, Mark Vaile, has recanted on a commitment that he gave in Victoria last year that essentially put in place a poll of wheat growers regarding substantial changes that might be made in terms of the future of the wheat industry. I see this as a very dangerous arrangement that is being put in place. I would like to place on record the reasons that I do have concerns. The Leader of the National Party is saying in today’s Land magazine that he will not consult with growers and he will not be carrying out a poll, even though last year he gave that commitment that he would, but he will consult with peak bodies. One of the peak bodies I imagine he will consult with is the Grains Council of Australia-and I was a member of that council before coming into this place. When the ethanol debate was on, that peak body was more concerned about the motorists of Australia having a choice as to the fuel they used, rather than the potential to develop a new industry with the use of grain. That peak body has a whole range of agendas, some of which suit the various players within what is essentially a politicised body rather than those who are out driving tractors and growing wheat right across Australia. The other peak body I imagine he would consult, which supposedly represents country people and the farming communities, is the National Farmers Federation. I have great concerns there as well, especially when you look at their performance in the immediate pastparticularly under the former president, who is now known as a traitor to his tribe in the north-west of New South Wales at least. Have a look at their stance on Telstra. It is of great concern if these are the bodies that the Leader of The Nationals and the government take a lead from the future of a very important industry, the wheat industry. These are the very bodies that have let the farming community down. The traitor to his tribe, Peter Corish, the former leader of the National Farmers Federation, was run over by a bus in the US trade negotiations. He did not represent the people; he represented a political future for himself. This is not the way for the Leader of The Nationals, the Deputy Prime Minister, to stand up for wheat growers in the post-Cole era of the wheat industry. What needs to happen is what he said in Victoria last year-and I supported him in this place. There are various options that people are looking at. As a wheat grower myself, I am leaning towards the option that the member for O’Connor has put up for public exhibition by way of a private member’s bill, but there will be other options-and so there should be. Those options should be put to every registered wheat grower in Australia in a poll. That is what the Leader of The Nationals, Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile, said he would do last year. It is no wonder that people in country Australia are concerned about these people-the National Party in particular-because they do not have a solid stance in the representation of people. They say they represent people. They were there to represent the people on Telstra and then voted those very people down. They said there were guarantees in place on broadband and basic telephone services. They said they had given an undertaking to the traitor of his tribe, Peter Corish, as leader of the National Farmers Federation at the time, in writing. No-one has sighted that letter, and in the intervening months that tragedy has ensued. I urge the Deputy Prime Minister: stand by your words and hold a poll with registered growers.

184,Mr Baldwin (Paterson,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourismdium, headed up by Gary Kennedy, head of the Newcastle Trades Hall Council. The bottom line of the letter reads: ‘Your rights at work are worth fighting for.’ I have to say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that hypocrisy is something that none of us can withstand, because this same Gary Kennedy, the head of the Newcastle Trades Hall Council, is the same Gary Kennedy who was also a director of the Panthers workers club in Newcastle. Seventeen workers from the Newcastle Panthers club were laid off-17 workers whose rights were not protected by the head of the Trades Hall Council. What is amazing is that all of this occurred prior to Work Choices coming in. In fact, it is disgusting that one of the employees laid off had worked faithfully for the club for 39 years-39 years of effort. When Gary Kennedy, head of the Trades Hall Council, sacked her, he could not even pay the correct retrenchment and entitlement rights. It goes further. Another person had been there for 11 years. Would Gary Kennedy allow negotiations on his future? No, not at all. Seventeen people were sacked by the head of the Trades Hall Council in Newcastle, yet today at the rally this is the person who stands up and says, ‘Protect the workers’ rights.’ It is supreme hypocrisy. This man will stand up and say one thing and then act in another way. There were no rights for the workers of the workers club. Hypocrisy reigns supreme out of the Newcastle Trades Hall Council. In the six months since Work Choices was brought in-which was after these workers were sacked by the head of the Trades Hall Council, with no negotiating rights-there have been 250,000 new jobs created. In fact, 184,000 of those are full-time jobs. Retrenchments are now 58 per cent lower than they were when Kim Beazley was the minister responsible for employment. There has been a 16.4 per cent increase in real wages in the last 10 years, compared to a 0.2 per cent decrease in real wages under 13 years of Labor. And what says it all is the $27 per week increase for the lowest paid workers. So, Mr Deputy Speaker, I say to you: do we look at the actions of the Newcastle Trades Hall Council and Gary Kennedy, or do we look at the track record of the Howard government in bringing unemployment down? In fact, the only thing that has come down has been unemployment. Wages have gone up. Job opportunities have gone up. Apprenticeships have gone up. But unemployment has come down. That is the critical factor. I note that the member for Batman, a strong unionist, is here. What would he say to Gary Kennedy, the head of the Trades Hall Council, who sacked 17 loyal staff at the workers club in Newcastle? It is not a workers club. In fact, the people who run that-allegedly the workers-do not represent the workers. All they want do is collect the union fees. Today’s rallies are nothing about jobs. They are about shoring up lame duck union officials such as Gary Kennedy, who is a fraud upon society for the fact that he says one thing and then does exactly the opposite. He talks about workers’ rights and then strips them away from the people he is supposed to represent. I notice the member for Shortland is absolutely silent on this, as indeed every other Labor member in the Hunter, state or federal, has sat dead quiet on this. She turns her back.

You are as bad as Gary Kennedy in supporting his action in sacking the workers from the workers club. Water heart and my head are very much with the hundreds of thousands of workers at the National Day of Action supporting their workers’ rights despite the legislation that has been put in by the Howard government in recent times. But I want to talk about the water crisis that we have around Australia. I want to do so because of two recent visits I have made to local schools. The first was on Monday for the launch of a tank-to-toilet project at Mill Park Secondary College, where, for the cost of $65,000-a $50,000 community water grant plus a $15,000 effort by the school community-they have put in water-harvesting tanks and are using them on demand in their toilets. The second visit was to the Thomastown Primary School. This visit resulted because I received a letter from one of the students in class 3/4, Phillip Papagiannopolous. I want to quote from his letter: I am a nine-year-old boy from Thomastown. We are learning about water at school and as you know we are running out of water. This is because of climate change and we are not using water wisely. I thought all the kids in Australia should plant trees because the trees help the water cycle. The other day I wrote a letter to Mr Howard to ask him to help and make a better future. Can you please make sure that this letter goes to Mr Howard? I left the envelope open so you can read it too. I will be seeking leave to table this letter from Phillip. I would prefer that it be inserted in Hansard so that Hansard would become a more readable document, because Phillip obviously went to some trouble with this colourful letter about his idea for water. I think he is trying to capture the hearts and minds of children throughout Australia by involving them in a treeplanting exercise to help combat the great water crisis that we confront. Let us put this into context. If we look at a recent media release from Yarra Valley Water on 2 November, it indicates that Melbourne’s water storages have dropped to 43.9 per cent. This can become a debate where we take partisan positions, but that is not going to help us to reach solutions. This is something that the states and territories will have to work through with the Commonwealth government at COAG. It is not something that is going to be easily fixed by new technologies; it will take a cultural change. Everything that can be done must be done to make sure that through the next few generations we have a sustainable source of water. This is of importance to us not only for our social and community life but also for our economic life, particularly in the agricultural sector. To produce one kilogram of oven-dry wheat grain takes 715 to 750 litres of water; for one kilogram of beef, it takes 50,000 to 100,000 litres of water. I do not quote these figures in any way to shift blame to the agricultural sector but to indicate the importance of water. We are going through one of the driest periods on record. That only serves to highlight the need for us-as individuals and as family units at our residences-to rethink the way we use water. There is so much potential for improvement through the use of water harvesting and the recycling and use of grey water. I congratulate class 3/4 and their teachers, Ms Lauder and Mrs Micallef, at Thomastown Primary School.

There is no harvesting of water or recycling of water, and 65 per cent of the use of water in Parliament House is for the gardens and the lawns. We really have to look at the components and our use. We have to look at the ways that we can use the water that is available wisely and minimise the total use of water out of the catchment of the ACT by creating sources of water on site. If we cannot do that here in Parliament House, I doubt whether we will be taken seriously as national leaders when asking others to do that.

I am glad that the member for Scullin recognises the importance of the Howard government’s Community Water Grants program. This program was introduced by this government-for the first time by any government-to provide grants at the community level to organisations so they can save and reuse water. It was only two weeks ago that I spoke in the adjournment debate about the wonderful work that was being done at the Croydon Hills Primary School in my electorate, where they have received a community water grant to install rainwater tanks and a number of other water-saving devices which will save the school two million litres of water. Of course, the reason that program has been able to be introduced by the Howard government-and the electors of Scullin for the very first time can have community water grants, which did not occur under the Keating or Hawke governments-is that we have the resources and the financial ability to fund such programs. Having paid off $96 billion worth of Labor’s debt, we now have the opportunity through the interest saving on that debtaround $8 billion every year-to increase funding for all sorts of important community priorities, be they health, education or important grants programs such as this. Another grants program I would like to commend today is the Volunteer Small Equipment Grants Program. It is a vital program that provides small grants of up to a few thousand dollars to help communities do their job for the benefit of our local society. In my electorate, numerous environmental groups have received community grants that have recognised the important role they play on the ground. Of course, in a partnership between government and community groups, we very much rely on the work that they do. In the recent allocation round, there were a number of successful applicants. I would like to mention them, what they received the grants for and the great work they do. MAIN COMMITTEE",145,Adjournment

The Patch Early Learning Centre also received funding for computer software. These are just some of the grants that have been successful. I pay tribute to all of those community groups. We can, as a federal government, assist them with a small grant, but of course the hours of work that volunteers put into those organisations make all of our local electorates much better places. I pay tribute to them and commend the program. Adelaide Airport Consultative Committee plied with ministerial direction to establish and maintain the Adelaide Airport Consultative Committee. Naturally, much of the consultative committee’s concerns are with all sorts of aviation issues. It has committee members from a whole range of industries that are involved in aviation. It has representatives from residents’ groups, and that is why it plays a very important role. It has representatives from the Netley Residents Association and the Southern Lockleys Residents Association. The consultative group meets on a quarterly basis. All elected members who have electorates-whether they be ward councillors, state members or federal members-affected by Adelaide Airport are invited. It is a very important consultative committee. It is important because it is a consultative committee where we turn up, we look at the issues-the things that affect the residents, the industry and Adelaide Airport-we discuss them and solutions are found and finalised. Of interest to the consultative committee members have been issues such as the federally legislated curfew, allegations of breaches, the investigations into these allegations, and dispensations. This gives me the opportunity, while the former shadow minister for transport, the member for Batman, is here, to thank him for the input that he had into the curfew bill a few years ago. He was able to negotiate an amendment that ensured that dispensations were signed off individually by the transport minister, and I thank him for that. He played a big role in it; he came to Adelaide and spoke to the residents groups that I have just mentioned. Their requests were put in the form of an opposition amendment to that bill, and today they are enshrined in legislation. These are some of the things we deal with. These interests are matters which Adelaide Airport Ltd is not responsible for, both in practical terms and that which may relate to federal policy. AAL is neither able nor authorised to address such concerns because there are government bodies that address those concerns. To fulfil this ministerial direction and maintain a consultative committee, it is only natural that representatives of the agency or departments that are responsible for highly relevant eleMAIN COMMITTEE",146,Adjournment
191,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (10.57 Am),"The Adelaide Airport has willingly comments of greater airport function, including those matters specifically dictated by legislation, be available to address concerns and inform members of this consultative committee. I understand that a representative of the Department of Transport and Regional Services contributes to meetings at the Sydney airport regarding their noise insulation programs, but DOTARS does not attend an Adelaide Airport Consultative Committee meeting. I would like to know why not. Are the residents of Sydney more important than the residents in Adelaide who are affected by aircraft noise? A curfew applies in Sydney, as it does in Adelaide, concerns regarding which can be answered or pursued by DOTARS representatives in attendance in Sydney but not in Adelaide. AgainI ask: why not? Are government ministers prepared to direct airport management to engage with the community, only to ignore all parties to the forum and starve them of information concerning the very matters they exist to address? How can a ministerially directed meeting concerning alleged, proven or permitted breaches of the curfew take place when the parties responsible for the curfew-the government, the ministers, DOTARS-do not even provide timely and intelligible information regarding its operation? At meeting after meeting we turn up and the reports are not there from the department. This information has been requested again and again by the consultative committee but to no avail up to this point. I have tried to advance the interests of the committee members in this place on many occasions. We have a terrific local community based resident organisation that takes these issues of the airport, the flight paths, the curfew and insulation very seriously. As I said, it is represented on this consultative committee. SoI ask that the current minister instruct DOTARS to provide information in a timely manner and in a comprehensible form for distribution to committee members and that the department make available a member of its staff to attend committee meetings and help members, including AAL, comply with the former minister’s direction. The Adelaide Airport Consultative Committee plays a very important role in dealing with issues. We try to work through issues together with the residents and the airport. The minister should give the committee the respect it deserves by ensuring that reports from DOTARS and other government agencies arrive on time for us to peruse and to ensure that we deal with them. Gilmore Electorate Office: Work Experience Naomi Cockerill, a successful work experience story in my electorate office, that I started in my member’s statement this morning. Naomi goes on to say: Keeping up to date on all issues is imperative to being a successful journalist. For the first time in a long time, I have been regularly reading as many newspapers as I can and watching the news. Doing this has made me realise how much I didn’t know about a lot of current issues, such as the increasing interest rates and current water shortage. My teachers have told me the importance of keeping up to date but it wasn’t until I have been put in the situation where it is a must that I have realised just how important it is. In the future I will most definitely be keeping up to date with current events. The main qualities that you need to possess to be a successful journalist or to work in a politician’s office are persistence, excellent listening skills and patience. Folding pamphlets has helped me improve my previously non existent patience. Attending meetings, speaking to various politicians, journalists and citizens has helped improve my listening skills. MAIN COMMITTEE",147,Adjournment
192,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (11.02 Am),"I would like to continue the story of 19-year-oldI have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Joanna’s office and have had a lot of experiences I otherwise would not have had. I thank Joanna and her staff for welcoming me into their office and for teaching me so much. I hope someday to be able to work in a politician’s office and this experience has only confirmed this. Last week I had another work experience student, Elizabeth Heppenstall, who is 15 years old. She writes: ... I am at the end of Year Ten-about to start my HSC course at Nowra Anglican College. It is compulsory for every Year Ten student at my school to do one week of work experience-it’s something you know you’ll be doing ever since you start Year Seven, but something most people don’t think about organising until three-four weeks before that (often-dreaded) week of work experience. I have not changed any of her words whatsoever. She goes on to say: Personally, the idea of work has always made me a bit apprehensive. Although I’m fairly intelligent and confident, school has always been a bit of a security blanket for me. It’s a place where I knew where I stood, knew the rules and the routines. There’s one other thing you should know about meI’m very indecisive. I have no idea what I want to do when I leave school, and possible career options range from being a chef, to a lawyer, to a politician. So, not only is what I’m going to study at university a bit unclear, but in the nearer future, the choice of what to do for work experience was rather baffling. In the end, it all became rather clear what I wanted to do for work experience. What made it clear? I was in Australian History at school, and we were discussing Gough Whitlam and his multiculturalism policy. My teacher asked my opinion of the policy, and I gave it. But I digressed-just a tiny bit. SomehowI had managed to be talking about mandatory detention for refugees and asylum seekers. And he cut me off saying, “Elizabeth, that’s not something I asked to hear your opinion on.” And me, being decidedly blunt, replied with, “You can’t ask us to have and express opinions on one thing, but not another.” And he frowned at me and said “You’re quite opinionated, aren’t you Elizabeth?” Then it clicked. The perfect place for me to do work experience, was at Joanna Gash’s office. This was so I could see what politicians and their staff had to do, and, possibly, begin to look at it more seriously as a future career. So when I stepped through the automatic door that still had the “Push” sign on it, on Monday the 20th of November, my placement had been organised, and I was delving into the unknown. Now being on work experience, I expected to be doing filing and taking the mail to the post office. Oh, and getting coffee. AndI did all that. However, I also counted stationary, addressed, stamped and/or stuffed somewhere in the vicinity of 1000 envelopes, folded little smiley face cards for primary school children who were to visit parliament house, tallied feedback and designed a couple of award templates. Not the most exciting of things to do for a week, but it was work experience after all. HereI am, in the last hour of work experience week writing a speech about my time at work experienceand hoping to never see another blank, empty envelope as long as I live. But I will leave here, with a completely different view of what it’s like to work in a politician’s office. It’s always busygood luck getting time to think. Everyone has something to do, but they always made sure I knew what I was doing, and I thank everyone in the office for that. Joanna Gash herself has so much to do-her schedule for the next month is jam packed. Sorry, but I don’t envy her. I’ve also seen that I don’t think I will ever be a politician-I’ll leave that to someone with better time management and organisational skills than I. But I will always remember this week. I’ve met so many different kinds of people, encountered problems and learned that coffee is a fairly vital substance in this busy office. I leave here the Year Ten student who has probably been the most effected by this one week of work experience. MAIN COMMITTEE Finally, I would like to thank Joanna Gash, Julia, Shawn, Sam and Wal for allowing me this opportunity and showing me what working here involved. It was very much appreciated. I cannot begin to tell you how proud I am of our young people who come to our office to do work experience. We have an average of about six or seven a year, and it is a great experience not only for them but also for me and the staff. We certainly learn about what young people want to do in their life, and I think Elizabeth has now decided what she wants to do with her life-and it is certainly not becoming a politician! Tourism to raise this morning the government’s Tourism Forecasting Committee figures-the forecast figures for 2007 which were released last week. They show the estimates of the number of inbound and outbound visitors to Australia along with an assessment of the predicted health of domestic tourism, which was reported with mixed interpretations by the media. The headlines in the Australian read a modest ‘Tourism on the up’, while the Sydney Morning Herald was far more enthusiastic about the future with the headline, ‘Tourism to skyrocket over next decade’. Conversely, the Australian Financial Review painted a much bleaker picture with the headline, ‘Tourism body arrives at grim conclusion’. Let us go to the facts. The truth of the matter no doubt lies somewhere in the middle of the two more polarised views, yet the differing media headlines as a collective probably accurately define the current and future state of the Australian tourism industry-one of confusion, unfortunately. The year 2006 unfortunately did not prove to be a good one for tourism operators and industry reliant businesses. The forecasting committee expects a 0.5 per cent decrease in overall visitor numbers in 2006, which is the worse result since the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak of 2003. Arrivals coming to Australia were down on the 2005 numbers, with substantial losses from key markets such as Malaysia and Singapore but also, more significantly, from the bread-andbutter markets of Japan and New Zealand which we so heavily rely on as a nation. Things were no better for domestic tourism, which reported a very sluggish year as people, influenced by high petrol prices and a growing trend not to take as much time off each year, chose not to take a short break travelling around Australia but instead to accumulate their annual leave and perhaps head overseas instead. Amid all this there was a period of significant uncertainty at the nation’s main tourism body, Tourism Australia, with the sudden and secretive departure of the former managing director Scott Morrison earlier this year at the minister’s behest. Notably, there has also been a lack of clear leadership from the minister, Fran Bailey, at a time of great uncertainty for the industry. When combined with everything else, is it any surprise that the media headlines give mixed messages? There is no leadership or direction at the senior levels of government in the minister’s office. The forecasts, to be fair, did contain some good news. They indicate that, hopefully, 2007 at least will not be as bad as 2006. That is good news for industry and the people employed in it, but it is hardly great news for an industry that has such enormous potential at a time when the global tourism industry is going through a period of immense growth. The issue is: where is Australia’s share of that growth? Serious issues need to be addressed so we as a nation can ensure that this $18 billion industry, which makes up almost four per cent of our GDP and MAIN COMMITTEE",148,Adjournment
193,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (11.11 Am),"As we draw to the end of 2006 I wantsupports over 500,000 Australian jobs, does not fall short-in essence, does not fall into a holding pattern. We hope that our industry is able to adjust sooner rather than later to changing global tourism trends and shifting attitudes to domestic Australian tourism and, in doing so, evolve new ways not only to get Australians to have a holiday but also to attract to Australia more people from overseas, including from the growing markets of China and India. I refer to a report in today’s Sydney Morning Herald which contains some alarming statistics about the tourism industry. The statistics refer not to tourism per se but to the number of hours the average Australian is working-more than 50 hours a week. Worse still, most were unhappy about it. I therefore say that, with the approach of Christmas, Australians need to start taking more time out for themselves not just to support an ailing tourism industry but for their own health and well-being. It may be fashionable to own the latest plasma television, but will it enrich the lives of individuals and families in the way that even a short trip to one of our great many natural beauties can? I say in conclusion that, unfortunately, one of the results of the Howard government’s industrial legislation is to put pressure on people either to not take annual leave or to cash it out. That is not good for those families and those employers, nor is it good for the Australian domestic tourism industry. (Time expired) ber for Stirling that when members pass in front of the chair it is expected that they acknowledge the chair. for your reminder. Community Water Grants been allocated in my electorate of Stirling. Like most Australians and many of the people in my electorate, I enjoy the wonderful natural environment that we have, and we need to be mindful of the kind of place we are going to leave behind for our children and our grandchildren. The natural environment is very important to the people in my electorate of Stirling, as is finding ways to protect and maintain our beautiful beaches, wetlands and bushlands. Many of my constituents spend considerable amounts of their own time caring for the local environment in a voluntary capacity, and I am always impressed by the commitment shown by members of groups such as Stirling Coastcare, the Friends of Trigg Bushland, the Friends of Star Swamp, the Friends of Lake Gwelup, the Friends of Carine Wetlands, the Friends of Dianella Bushland and other groups which people are prepared to give up their own time and resources to support. I think it is a very admirable thing. When I have talked to people in my community, many have shared their concerns about the conservation of our most precious resource: water. I think it is something that has been extremely topical in the midst of what is a very bad drought in this country. The local communities in my electorate are concerned about how we manage our water supplies. They want to know, and I think they need to know, that we are going to have enough water flowing for future generations-and of course that is why we must take action now.

196,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (11.12 Am),"I rise to speak about water-saving grants that haveHealthy waterways do not respect state or local government boundaries. This is very much a national issue. That is why I am very supportive of the Howard government’s community water grants, which in the past 12 months have provided more than a quarter of a million dollars in funding for local projects in my electorate. My local council, the City of Stirling-and I hosted the Mayor of the City of Stirling, Terry Tyzack, during his visit to Canberra this week-has recently been awarded $40,260 as part of the funding for a project that will total $104,000, which will be used to upgrade the irrigation systems at one of my local golf courses and the irrigation system at a sports oval by installing a sophisticated computerised system along with moisture sensors. This will save a staggering 162 million litres of water each year, which is an extraordinary saving to achieve through taking what are quite simple measures. It is the second water grant that has been provided by this government to the City of Stirling, which was already successful earlier this year in being awarded a community water grant for a water purification and revegetation project within the precious Claisebrook catchment area. Other successful applications in the latest round include St Kieran’s Catholic School, led by principal Redmond Berson, in Tuart Hill, which has received $50,000 to fund a project which will install slow-flow tap devices to save 219,000 litres of water each year. Glendale Primary School, under the leadership of principal Steven Ivey, in Hamersley, has also been successful, receiving $50,000 to install tap control valves that will save 243,000 litres of water each year. This great news followed more than $127,000 in local community water grants that had previously been allocated to Stirling, including $50,000 to Deanmore Primary School in Karrinyup for its efficient sprinkler project that will save over 14 million litres of water a year. These projects are proof that my local communities are taking steps towards achieving a sustainable and water-wise future, and everybody can play a part. My local schools, the City of Stirling and the many dedicated environmental groups which volunteer many hours to implement these projects deserve to be commended for the incredible commitment they have shown to conserving water. After the enormous success of these projects in Stirling that will literally save millions of litres of water each year, I would urge other communities in my electorate, whether they be sporting clubs, schools, service clubs or other community organisations, to consider applying for a community water grant. This is a tremendous program that firmly highlights the Australian government’s commitment to working with local communities on the ground to save our most precious resource, water. Human Rights: Darfur United Nations, Kofi Annan, for speaking up on behalf of the brutalised people of Darfur in western Sudan. Over the last three to four years, the worse genocide since Rwanda has occurred in that benighted country, with the active cooperation of the murderous regime in Khartoum. Since 2003, more than 200,000 people have been murdered in Darfur, along with mass rape and pillage by the Janjaweed militia. These Janjaweed militia brigands, apart from having air support from the Sudanese air force and the backing of the Sudanese army, are judged by all impartial agencies, such as Human Rights Watch and Freedom House, to be backed by the Sudanese dictator, Omar al-Bashir. His name will eventually live in infamy, like Pol Pot, Mugabe and Milosevic. MAIN COMMITTEE",151,Adjournment
197,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (11.17 Am),"I want to praise the Secretary-General of theThe UN Secretary-General’s anger was sparked by a shameful vote in the UN Human Rights Commission-22 to 20-to turn down a resolution from the European Union, Canada and others telling the Sudanese government to prosecute those responsible for killing, raping and injuring civilians in Darfur. Can you imagine that the UN Human Rights Commission turned down a resolution calling for the prosecution of those responsible for mass rape, mass killing and pillage in Darfur? What kind of a situation have we got to when things like that happen? To its great discredit, the Organisation of Islamic Countries, together with the Arab League and backed by various authoritarians such Castro, Chavez, Putin and Hu Jintao, all got together-the great humanitarians of this world-to vote down this resolution. It is particularly ironic because the people of Darfur are Muslims, black Muslims, African Muslims, and they are being persecuted by an allegedly Muslim government in Khartoum. This disgraceful vote follows another shameful decision of the UN Security Council not to classify the situation in Darfur as genocide because China has a veto and values its oil rights in Darfur above the poor persecuted people of that region. China wants to exploit its relationship with the Sudanese government. Therefore that government can continue to have its militia murder, pillage and rape in Darfur. It is the most serious situation in the world. The Secretary-General has rightly gone out on a limb over this. He told the UN Human Rights Council, in a statement read out by its head, Louise Arbour, that he urged the Human Rights Council, which was established after the widely discredited UN Human Rights Commission was abolished: ... to take care to handle this issue in an impartial way and not to allow it to monopolise attention at the expense of others. There are surely other situations besides the one in the Middle East which would merit scrutiny by a special session of the UN Human Rights Council. I would suggest Darfur is a glaring case in point. He was talking about the fact that there had been six resolutions on the Israeli situation before the UN Human Rights Commission and not one condemning the murder of 200,000 people and the mass rape and pillage in Darfur. It is absolutely shameful that the UN Human Rights Commission would allow this total misfocus of the world to continue. It follows the decision of the UN, at least in some waysthis following the intervention of that very brave other UN official Jan Egeland, shamefully treated by the dictator in Khartoum-to achieve some human rights on behalf of the people of Darfur. The UN was going to deploy a joint force along with the African Union in Darfur to try to protect some of the people in that country, but of course the Sudanese government has been backtracking on that. My comments follow a recent meeting I had with the Darfur Australia Network and their very impressive public spokesman Abdelhadi Matar, an inspiring refugee from the Masalit tribe in western Darfur. I appeal to the Australian government on behalf of the Darfurian refugees to get our embassy in Cairo to put more pressure on the UN Human Rights Commission to process the applications of refugees from Darfur, who are in an urgent situation, a situation where there is still murder, rape and pillage taking place, as we speak, in Sudan. Those applications are all being held up by the UNHCR in Cairo, which is processing no applications by refugees from Sudan. The Australian government needs to act directly with those refugees. MAIN COMMITTEE National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (11.22 am)-I was very pleased on Monday to go to the announcement of the projects for research infrastructure under the NCRIS. This is a scheme which is provided for under the Howard government’s Backing Australia’s Ability. What it does is provide critical infrastructure in a number of areas where Australia has an outstanding research track record. The projects are decided by a committee of eminent scientists. I was particularly pleased that there was $15 million for a plant accelerator which will be at the Waite Institute in the electorate of Boothby. I am told that this facility will enable them to find out much more quickly which crops are salt resistant and which crops are drought resistant. It is a high-tech piece of infrastructure which is much more discriminating than the naked eye and allows us to find, to a much greater degree of sensitivity, the best crops. It is also known as a plant phenomics facility. Phenomics is the expression of the genome and very important in areas like salt research, salt resistance and drought resistance. It comes on top of a number of other projects that have also been built at the Waite Institute. Four years ago there was $40 million for the Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics, and presently I am working with the Winemakers Federation to establish a wine industry cluster on this campus. The Waite Institute, as I have said before, is Australia’s pre-eminent agricultural research institute and one of the top two or three in the world. It sometimes comes as a surprise to people from interstate that our top agricultural research institute is housed in suburban Adelaide, but the reason for this was a bequest from a gentleman called Peter Waite, who in the 1920s donated his land to the University of Adelaide. At present it is very much what would be described as a cluster, with the CSIRO, the wine industry, the University of Adelaide and other things there like, as I have mentioned, the Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics. This plant accelerator will be a massive greenhouse-something like 4,000 square metres. That is a 40-metre by 100-metre greenhouse. I would like to pay tribute to those people who have put together this bid: Professor Mike Tester, Nick Begakis from the Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics, and the director of the Waite Institute, Professor Geoff Fincher. It is an outstanding piece of infrastructure and it is one of the benefits of having good economic management. Budget surpluses have enabled us to do things like Backing Australia’s Ability to provide infrastructure for our scientists, especially in an area like agriculture, where we have such a strong competitive advantage. We need excellent scientists. We need to be able to attract the best scientists in order to sustain our competitive advantage in this area. Mr Jim Comerford Ms HOARE (Charlton) (11.26 am)-On 10 November 2006, over 350 mourners gathered uty Speaker, I will be seeking leave later to table the eulogy read out by my father, Bob Brown, at that funeral. The funeral for our good friend Jim was one of the most extraordinary funerals I have ever attended. If members just close their eyes a bit they may imagine a coffin being brought into the hall, carried by six mine workers with their lights switched on and taken up to the front table. The funeral parlour was filled with Jim’s friends and comrades, all there to bid him a hearty farewell and to say thank you. MAIN COMMITTEE",152,Adjournment
198,At The Ryhope Memorial Park For The Funeral Of Mining Union Legend Jim Comerford. Mr Dep,"The MC at the funeral was Tony Maher, the General President of the CFMEU Mining and Energy Division, and there was a eulogy also read out by Jim’s good friend Paddy Gorman, the editor of Common Cause. I will quote Bob’s eulogy where he talks about Paddy’s contribution. He said, ‘It was an outstanding, sensitive, comprehensive, personal and compassionate statement from Paddy to say farewell to a much-loved comrade.’ Following Paddy’s eulogy we had the people’s choir from Newcastle singing Solidarity Forever. Behind me were sitting two former Liberal ministers, Wal Fife and Milton Morris, and they stood up and belted out the lyrics of Solidarity Forever with the rest of us, so great was the respect that they had for Jim Comerford. Jim’s body was piped into the funeral parlour as well. Following the people’s choir and our all singing Solidarity Forever, Bob Brown-my father, former member for Hunter and very good friend of Jim Comerford-gave his eulogy. Jim’s grandson Bruce then delivered a moving tribute to his grandfather. Following that, as the curtains closed around Jim’s coffin the six coalminers turned their lights off to the sounds of local girl Tara Naysmith’s version of Workin’ Man. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you can imagine, there was not a dry eye in the house. As members would know, Jim Comerford was one of the last three surviving miners from the Rothbury lockout in 1929 and his whole life was devoted to bettering the working conditions of working people, particularly coalminers. Jim Comerford was proud to be a socialist and he actually asked my father to make sure that he made reference to his commitment to socialism. He also asked Bob to quote from the only reference to mining in the Christian Bible. That reference to mining is in Job, chapter 28. As Bob said, it was an appropriate reference for Jim Comerford because it combines mining with the concept of wisdom: ‘Iron is taken out of the earth and brass is molten out of the stone. But where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding? It cannot be gotten for gold; for the price of wisdom is beyond rubies.’ Jim Comerford pursued wisdom and in the process found socialism. Reg and my family would like to convey our deepest sympathy and condolences to Mabel Comerford, Jim’s lifelong partner; his daughter, Jean, and son-in-law, Tony; his grandchildren, Bruce and Helen; and his great-grandchildren, Matthew and Callen. They are all very proud to be able to call Jim Comerford their dad, husband, grandfather and great-grandfather, as we are all proud to be able to call Jim Comerford our friend. For the labour movement as a whole, Jim Comerford is an inspiration, somebody who made the lives of working people today much better. I seek leave to table the eulogy. Leave granted. Redcliffe Peninsula: Volunteer Coastguard Ms GAMBARO (Petrie-Parliamentary Secretary (Foreign Affairs)) (11.32 am)-I am delighted to speak today about the wonderful work that the coastal patrol and coastguard do in Redcliffe. I had the great joy to visit them recently to announce a Regional Partnerships grant to them of $59,000. The Australian Volunteer Coastguard, which is QF3 down there, has been given the funds to construct a vessel and trailer as well as to fit out a vessel with outboard motor, safety equipment cables, VHF and other instruments. This is a terrific program, but more terrific is the fantastic volunteer work. There are some 105 volunteers who man the coastguard 24 hours a day. I want to put on the record my appreciation of the wonderful work MAIN COMMITTEE that they do-and also the 660 members of the coastguard and the boaties who use this fantastic service down at the Redcliffe Peninsula. This is a fantastic leap forward. The funding will enable them to get a rescue vessel that will be able to handle more water emergencies. It will also improve their response time and help educate boat users. Some 1.2 million tourists visit the Redcliffe Peninsula every year. They are drawn to the peninsula because of its wonderful coastline, and many of them have a great interest in boating. So it is fantastic to have this particular funding going to this wonderful organisation. I want to put on the record my appreciation for Caroline Gould, the grants officer there; Malcolm Olding, the flotilla commander; Roy King, who is the longest-serving skipper in the coastguard, having served for some 33 years; Neil Macfarlane, their administration officer; and Paul Baldwin, their publicity officer. This work could not have been achieved without the fantastic work of the Moreton Bay Coast and Country Area Consultative Committee, which brought this to fruition. I would like to acknowledge Estella Rodighiero for her fantastic work. A number of local companies also got behind the program. I would like to place on the record great appreciation for the Redcliffe City Council contribution of $15,000 and also for the great assistance by the Redcliffe City Rotary Club, Neilsen’s Electricals, Freight Plus, AVG Powder Coating, Hydrofield Boats and Sundown Marine. These partnerships are exactly that-they are partnerships between the community, councils and also businesses in the area, and they have been a great success. The Australian government has contributed some $270 million under the Regional Partnerships program from 2006 to 2010. It is fantastic that local organisations such as the coastguard are able to continue the wonderful work that they do and have the support out there. They are working hand in hand with the Moreton Bay coast and country committee. The Moreton Bay coast and country committee have done a magnificent job for the whole of the area that they represent, and they represent some four councils. We do have a wonderful lifestyle on the Redcliffe Peninsula. We have a number of recreational fishing vessels there and we have commercial fishermen who go out as well. They know that they have a reliable service that will provide fantastic search and rescue but also that the coastguard have continual training programs in areas such as first aid and also in terms of providing training for their staff in search and rescue. They are a very dedicated bunch. I delight in visiting them regularly, and I wish them well in their future endeavours. I look forward to the day when they invite me to officially launch this vessel-and that will be some time in the new year. I place on the record today my wonderful appreciation of the coastguard down at Redcliffe and wish them well in their future endeavours. Tebonin power which a few pharmaceutical companies have engaged in and the seeming inability of the regulator to adequately respond. During the June Senate estimates hearings, my colleague Senator Forshaw raised the issue of the marketing of the over-the-counter tinnitus relief drug Tebonin. Unfortunately, the responses from the TGA and the Department of Health and Ageing were inadequate to say the least.

199,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Reid) (11.36 Am),"I seek to raise the issue of the abuse ofvertigo. A number of consumer advocates, including Dr Ken Harvey and Mark Dunn, were concerned about the marketing and claims made. AusPharm Consumer Health Watch sought to publish a paper refuting the claims made by the drug maker. Unfortunately, the manufacturer took out a court injunction which prevented the publication of their analysis. The paper, which has now been published, makes the following claims. The authors of a number of recent scientific reviews have not been convinced that ginkgo biloba provides more relief for tinnitus than a pill without active ingredients-in other words, a placebo. The Australian suppliers of Tebonin were approached and asked to supply information about the efficacy of Tebonin. A thorough research of the scientific literature was then conducted by AusPharm Consumer Health Watch, and the papers found were also reviewed. The TGA was contacted to determine what claims for Tebonin were listed on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods and whether these claims had been submitted to independent verification. The Australian distributors provided two papers to support their claims that it provided relief and/or was an effective treatment for tinnitus. One paper was published back in 1997 and in their opinion was of poor quality. The other paper was published in 2000 and provided an uncritical review of earlier work. Both papers came to conclusions that differed from more recent independent reviews. Schwabe Pharma Asia Pacific Pty Ltd provided three additional papers published in 1997, 1999 and 2002. In the reviewing author’s opinion, the statistical analysis of the 1997 paper was poorly performed and the author’s conclusion that it provided greater relief than a placebo was not justified. The 1999 paper reported a trial that administered Tebonin intravenously in hospital followed by oral treatment. In their opinion, this research is not relevant to the treatment of tinnitus with an over-the-counter product. The 2002 paper was a review of earlier studies and concluded: Overall, the results of these trials are favourable to ginkgo biloba as a treatment of tinnitus, but a firm conclusion about its efficacy is not possible. At present, the body of evidence is small. More trials are needed to test the therapeutic value of ginkgo biloba for relieving tinnitus. Tebonin will cost consumers approximately $30 to $80 per month to use, although this will vary depending on the dose and the place and time of purchase. In the reviewer’s opinion, a product that appears to be no more effective than a placebo does not offer value for money. After a long and protracted complaints process, which was greatly delayed by court proceedings, the Complaints Resolution Panel, who investigate alleged breaches of the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code, found that the website and print advertisements were in breach of sections 41(b), 42(a) and 42(c) of the code. The CRP has no jurisdiction over similar complaints about statements on the product pack, packet insert, pharmacy posters et cetera. The CRP requested Schwabe Pharma Australia Pty Ltd in accordance with subregulation 42ZCA1(1) of the Therapeutic Goods Regulation 1990: (a) to withdraw the advertisements, including the website material, from further publication; (b) to withdraw the implied representations that the scientific evidence for Tebonin is extensive, unequivocal, of exceptional scientific quality and not subject to any serious question, and that Tebonin is supported by an overwhelming positive body of evidence; (c) not to use the representations in (b) in any further advertisement unless Schwabe Pharma Australia Pty Ltd satisfies the panel that the use of the representations would not result in a contravention of the ... Act ... MAIN COMMITTEE In a letter to my office, Dr Ken Harvey argued: While this outcome vindicates those who submitted the original complaints, the need to submit the complaint to three different bodies, the delays involved due to litigation and the varied responses of individual regulators highlight a number of deficiencies in the regulation of ‘listed’ therapeutic products. These include: 1. Regulation 42ZCAJ of the Therapeutic Goods Regulations which meant that the complaints had to be set aside pending resolution of litigation ... 2.

Very soon the cane toad will be added to that list. For those who do not know the history of the cane toad, 110 of these highly toxic amphibians were introduced to Australia to control beetles in the sugar cane industry in 1935. As with many introduced species, it was a good theory. But they not only failed to control the beetles; cane toads themselves have become a major pest. I know this first hand, as the threat to Western Australia is one I take very seriously, unlike-I am disappointed but not surprised to say-the Western Australian government. I mention the work of the member for Kimberley, Carol Martin, who is the only state member showing any willingness to assist in this sea of neglect by a Perth-centric parliament. The Western Australian state government provides considerable funds to a Perth based group called Stop the Toad Foundation. This is despite the debatable value of its work, after $500,000 was spent on an awareness campaign which resulted in a mere 45 calls in five months. I prefer action to as and support the Kimberley Toad Busters from Kununurra, a voluntary community group which has gone out every weekend for the past 16 months collecting the toads. The community volunteers, of whom there are now more than 1,000, have literally picked up more than 70,000 adults, tens of thousands of eggs, tadpoles and metamorphs. Their management plan is to hold the cane toad front line by picking them up, putting them in plastic bags and euthanasing them with CO2 until such time as scientists can find a biological solution. I travelled with them earlier this month to Victoria River station to support the group’s effort, see the problem first hand and help collect toads. I managed to pick up 400 that night. Between us we picked up some 2,500. No-one knows exactly how many cane toads there are in Australia. In fact, we know relatively little about them and their habits. We know they live up to 20 years and females lay as many as 30,000 eggs at a time and may lay two batches a year. We do not know how they decide which direction to travel, but we know they are headed for Western Australia and they are now just 100 kilometres from the Western Australian border. The threat was first brought to my attention by Sos Johnston of Broome, who was the candidate for the 2004 local election in Kununurra. He foresaw the problem. Once these advancing waves hit the Ord catchment, there will be no stopping the destruction of the fauna reMAIN COMMITTEE",156,Adjournment
200,Mr Haase (Kalgoorlie) (11.41 Am),"I rise today to speak on the subject of cane toads.sources so vital to the popularity of Kimberley tourism. The natural diversity of the pristine Kimberley region, already impacted by uncontrolled wildfires, is at real risk of being destroyed by the absolutely toxic effect of cane toads. The damage they cause is widely documented, but for those who are unaware of their enormous capacity for wrecking everything in their path I will outline a few cane toad facts. Cane toads are poisonous in all stages of their life and kill every animal that preys on them. The venom produced by the parotoid glands acts principally on the heart. Animals do not necessarily have to eat them; putting the cane toad in their mouth is enough. Cane toads can survive the loss of up to 50 per cent of their body water and can survive temperatures ranging from five to 40 degrees Celsius. Cane toads not only kill native animals, including crocodiles, snakes and lizards, but compete for food, shelter and breeding grounds. A preliminary risk assessment of cane toads in Kakadu National Park released by the Department of the Environment and Heritage in 2002 reported that 151 predator species were at risk from their advance. Concerning the health risk posed to humans, cane toads are not yet known to have caused any human deaths. The toad busters work is hard, hot and vital until our scientists come up with a biological solution. Discussions I have had with the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, the Hon. Ian Campbell, have secured over $300,000 for the Kimberley Toad Busters to manage the onground problem. Their work is making a real difference to slowing down the toad’s progress, and they can use more support from the federal government. I applaud Minister Campbell for his support, but I believe more can and must be done. This is the most effective strategy so far. At the moment, the toad busters go out in one group, but I think they have enough experience and capacity to split into three groups and cover a greater area. So instead of one group going out 52 times a year, we could have two or three groups out 52 times a year. For this, they need money. As I said, the toad busters are a voluntary group, but equipment is still required to support them with the cost of fuel and food. I will continue to lobby on behalf of the toad busters for that funding, because it will be too late to do something about it once the cane toads enter the Ord River catchment then progress almost immediately into the Kununurra area. That will see the Kimberley, with its vast range of fauna, wiped out as a tourist destination. I applaud the effort of the Kununurra based Kimberley Toad Busters. (Time expired) Antarctic Seals Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney) (11.46 am)-Earlier today the parliament was discussing the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment (Antarctic Seals and Other Measures) Bill 2006. It is a very important bill and I was glad to hear the discussion of it this morning. What was not discussed, unfortunately, is another very important measure to protect Australia’s and the Antarctic’s seal population. Indeed, Taronga Zoo in Sydney has one of the premier seal protection initiatives in the world, with the Australian Marine Mammal Research Centre and the Great Southern Oceans exhibit at Taronga Zoo, which is currently being rebuilt. The Australian Marine Mammal Research Centre is a joint research initiative of the Zoological Parks Board and the University of Sydney and has been operating at Taronga for more than 10 years. The particularly special thing about this research centre is the interdisciplinary approach that has been taken by the Marine Mammal Research Centre. It has focused on developing tools which improve our capacity to study the marine environment. The other really MAIN COMMITTEE special thing about this research centre is the work that it does in educating the public about marine mammals and the Antarctic environment. That will be the focus of the zoo’s new Great Southern Oceans precinct, which is due for completion in 2008. The Australian Marine Mammal Research Centre is presently conducting two studies of particular interest which focus on Antarctic seals in order to predict climate impacts in the Southern Ocean ecosystem. The first research study is the bioclimatic modelling research project, which is developing ways to predict how changes in ice habitats will impact on three particular species of pack ice seal. The seals, of course, rely on ice for all of their life stages. They never go ashore. They are very dependent on the Antarctic ice environment for their population, and we need to know what is happening to the ice in order to be certain that the seal populations are safe. With an underwater acoustician from the department of science, the research centre has developed acoustic technology which allows remote surveying of the marine environment over enormous regions, greatly increasing survey capacity. I believe that they can even attract seals under the ice with this technology. Preliminary studies have shown that the old way of determining the seal population by just looking at them-visual survey-was vastly underestimating leopard seal and Ross seal populations, and this acoustic technology will give much more accurate numbers of the seal population and will help us to determine how climate change is impacting those numbers. The obvious impact is that if there is not enough ice then there is nowhere for the seals to give birth, so there are fewer seals. The other very interesting research project is using seal whiskers to trace what the food sources have been for seals in recent years. The whiskers can show for about a four-year period what the food sources of the seals have been. The research centre has had seal whiskers since 1914, so it can look at the sorts of diets that seals have had over that time and trace their development. The Great Southern Ocean precinct will not just house these scientific laboratories. It will educate up to 1.6 million zoo visitors each year about the precious seals and the Antarctic environment, about how climate change can be reduced by measures that each one of us can take and about how important it is to take these simple measures to reduce our effect on the planet. Black Hawk Helicopter Accident: HMAS Kanimbla Fiji you in the chair. I rise in the Main Committee today to express my sympathy and the sympathy of the people in my electorate for the family of the Australian soldier who has been lost with the Black Hawk helicopter disaster off the coast of Fiji to express my best wishes to those who are injured and to their families and to express our feelings and prayers with respect to the SAS trooper who is lost. Over the last two years I have been privileged to participate in the ADF parliamentary program. I think this is a very worthwhile program because it gives members of parliamentwho these days have mostly not had very much or any service in the military forces-the opportunity to experience conditions in the armed forces for a short period of time so we are better able to understand the challenges that confront the serving men and women of the Australian military forces. I understand the honourable member at the table, the member for CanMAIN COMMITTEE",158,Adjournment
201,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (11.52 Am),"Mr Deputy Speaker Somlyay; it is always good to seening, has also been to this ADF parliamentary program. The Kanimbla, the ship from which the Black Hawk was lost, is a ship in which I spent a day or two off Darwin last year. I was really impressed with the high degree of professionalism. Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I and our colleagues understand how many days we have to be away from home to serve our constituents in the Australian parliament. But given the fact that we have so many deployments I was shocked to learn that, in 2006, members of the Royal Australian Navy are often away from home for basically two out of every three months. I want to place on record my admiration for those men and women in the Australian Defence Force and in particular those in the Royal Australian Navy who tend to be away as much as they are. I notice that this tragedy occurred off the coast of Fiji. This year I was invited by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to join the honourable member for Denison as part of an election observer team. We were based at Savu Savu and also at Taveuni, which is known as the garden island of Fiji. We were very keen, as part of the Pacific Islands Forum observer team, to see that the Fiji election was free, fair and open. I want to compliment the government of Fiji for ensuring that the election was fair and free, and I congratulate the Prime Minister of Fiji, Mr Qarase, who has formed a coalition government with the opposition Labour Party which is strongly supported by the Indo-Fijian community. Also, I am completely appalled by the prospects of a coup in Fiji by the military commander and by some people who support him. My own observation and the observation of the Pacific Islands Forum observer team was that the election in Fiji was fair and free. There was a very high degree of integrity. There was an absolute determination by booth workers of all political parties to make sure that the election was in fact equitable, fair and free. I am appalled that in 2006 we would find the military commander of Fiji threatening the government. Because he is under some possibility of being charged with sedition because of his threats against the government, he is talking about having a coup in Fiji. I have to say that in 2006 this is absolutely unacceptable. The impact of a coup upon Fiji would be as devastating on the economy and the international standing of that country as the previous coups were. One could understand that, if the election had not been fair and free, there might be a demand from the community to replace the government, but there is absolutely no doubt in my mind or indeed in the minds of all of the other observers that there was a very high degree of integrity in that election. There was a great degree of determination to make sure that the people of Fiji were able to choose the government they wanted. There was an absolute determination to make sure that the election was held on a democratic basis. Having said that, the constitution of Fiji has now been observed, the opposition Fiji Labour Party is included in the government, and the fact that we find this coup is being threatened is absolutely unacceptable. I want to salute the serving men and women of Australia’s armed forces, I want to recognise in particular those who were touched by this tragedy, and I want to say how much I am opposed to any possibility of a coup in Fiji.

Centrelink Payments (Question No. 3585) Mr Gibbons asked the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 30 May 2006: (1) Is he aware that, in respect of certain Centrelink payments, a family home may be excluded as an asset to the disadvantage of home-owners in regional and rural areas? (2) Is he aware that Centrelink places no upper limit upon the value of a principal place of residence, but that it applies different assessment criteria to farms with more than five acres of land, whether or not the land can be subdivided or produce income? (3) Is he aware of any inequity in Centrelink’s treatment of regional, rural and metropolitan home owners? Since the assets test’s introduction in 1985 a person’s principal home has been exempt from the assets test, as has up to two hectares of the land immediately adjacent to the home, if used for private purposes. Under the Social Security Act 1991 there is no upper limit placed on the value of the exemption under these provisions. The assessment criteria applies equally to city, regional and rural areas. As part of the 2006-07 Budget the Australian Government announced that from 1 January 2007, Age Pensioners and Carer Payment recipients of age pension age may have the maximum amount of private land that can be exempt from the assets test increased from two hectares to encompass all land on the same title as the Age Pensioner’s or carer’s home. To benefit from this measure, carers and age pensioners must have a long-term (20 year) attachment to the land, the land must be primarily used for domestic purposes, and they must show that it is not reasonable for them to take alternative action that will enable them to use the land to support themselves. Business Services Wage Assessment Tool (Question No. 3811) Mr Gibbons asked the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 8 August 2006: (1) Can he confirm and guarantee that no existing disability employee will lose their place at a business service due to changes taking place to sheltered workshops or business services. (2) Is the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool an appropriate and accurate means of measuring competency and productivity. (3) Is he aware that some assessment workers have been uncomfortable using the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool and that these assessments have led to only approximately 5% of local disability employees achieving satisfactory results with 95% failing. (4) Can he confirm that after assessments are undertaken disability employees will not have their wages reduced, but that their wages will either remain the same or increase. (5) What has been the impact of wage assessments on employees and their families. (6) Will the provision of “meaningful futures” for disability employees be maintained. I can guarantee that no employee will lose their place in a business service as a result of reform to disability services. The Business Services Wage Assessment Tool has been independently assessed as an appropriate and accurate means of measuring competency and productivity.",162,Questions In Writing

204,Mr Brough,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:I am not aware of any discomfort with the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool from trained and qualified CRS Australia wage assessors who have undertaken approximately 9,000 Business Service Wage Assessment Tool assessments. Whether a person’s wage is lowered because of reduced productivity will depend on the industrial arrangements that apply to individual business services. The impact of wage assessments on employees and their families has been generally positive and I am pleased to report that, on average, wages have increased. The Australian Government is committed to building the viability of business services and in turn, providing employment opportunities for people with a disability, enabling them to enjoy the same basic rights and opportunities available to all working Australians.

The answer is detailed in Attachment A. It should be noted that the latest Commonwealth expenditure estimates for the agencies listed in the Question on Notice consist of industry levies and Commonwealth matching of those levies under legislation. The value of the levy revenue is subject to a range of variables, depending on the type of levy, such as production, market prices, seasonal conditions and economic factors. In addition, the value of the levy collections also impacts on the value of the Commonwealth matching. The estimates in the early years are regularly adjusted and accordingly are relatively accurate. The forward estimates are based on industry knowledge at the time which can be, variable.",174,Questions In Writing

The Australian Government’s budget for legal aid has increased over that period. The Australian Government makes payments for the provision of legal aid by State and Territory legal aid commissions in matters arising under Commonwealth law. These are made from two separate appropriations, because payments are made directly to legal aid commissions for some jurisdictionsAppropriation Act (No. 1)-and to States and Territories for other jurisdictions-Appropriation Act (No. 2). Since 2004–05, payments for the provision of legal aid in Commonwealth matters in New South Wales have been made directly to the New South Wales Legal Aid Commission; before that, payments were made to the State of New South Wales. This change in arrangements required a transfer from an appropriation in Appropriation Act (No. 2) to one in Appropriation Act (No. 1). There was no reduction in the total amount appropriated in both Acts: in fact, between 2003–04 and 2005–06, the amount spent under these two appropriations increased by 16.01 per cent.",189,Questions In Writing

(2) The objectives of the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate agreed to in Sydney in January 2006 remain unchanged. Papua New Guinea is not a member of AP6 and deforestation does not sit under any of the Partnership Task Forces. Consistent with our efforts to have the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors, including agriculture, forestry and other land-uses, recognised under the UNFCCC, Australia strongly supports further consideration of this issue within this forum.
