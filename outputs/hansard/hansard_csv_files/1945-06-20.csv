FREE PASSAGES-TRANSPOR T FROM GREAT Repatriation) -by regulations issued in accordance with the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, provision has been made for the grant of free passages to the Commonwealth for the wives, widows and children of members of the Australian forces who, during the war, have married abroad. In view of the fact that honourable members have made frequent representations to me with a view to accelerating the transport to Australia of these wives and children, I have much pleasure in informing the House that 50 wives and 28 children of Australian servicemen arrived in Sydney from the United Kingdom this morning. The majority of these wives and children are dependants of Royal Australian Air Force personnel. ments were made for their reception and entertainment on arrival, and, in this connection, I quote the following extract from a letter I received this morning from the wife of an Australian serviceman who arrived in Tasmania from the United Kingdom:I have received many letters from my folk in Britain since arriving, and it has been a wonderful help to them in the parting to know that the reception we received on arrival in this country was so wonderful and that everything possible was done to enable us to feel welcome here. Soi t is not only my sincere thanks I send to you, but also those of my dear parents back in London. It is considered that, despite shipping difficulties, the flow of wives and children of Australian servicemen to Australia is satisfactory. Five hundred and fifty-four applications for passages have been lodged in the United Kingdom on behalf of wives, and 200 for children. Three hundred and forty wives and 132 children have arrived in Australia. These figures refer to actual applications for passages only, but I am obtaining information regarding all wives and children of servicemen still overseas in respect of whom applications have not yet been lodged. Dependants of servicemen are now coming to Australia in large numbers since the cessation of hostilities in Europe, and we hope that they all will be here before long.

When I asked the repatriation people at Australia House about this, I was informed that these widows must have been Australian born, as Australian-born widows are the only ones who have left the country. Will the Minister investigate this mattei and ensure that the twenty women who were left behind are included in the next draft? matter.

Will the Minister arrange for a reply to be sent to Mr Dunstan pointing out that Tasmania has provided Victoria with 7,000 tons of fodder, Western Australia is providing 14,000 tons and South Australia 8,000 tons, whilst New South Wales has already provided 16,000 tons and is, I understand, to provide another 2,000 tons for Victoria.

Minister for Air inform me whether there as any truth in the report which appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph on the 15th June that members of the Royal Australian Air Force were kept standing in the rain for an hour and a half at Bradfield Park while the Commanding Officer, Wing Commander Sewell, ad-dressed them on the subject of releases? If the report be true, will the Minister take steps to prevent a recurrence of anything of the kind?If the report is not true, will he state the facts of the case? honourable member was good enough to inform me that he intended to ask a -question on this subject. The report in the Sydney Daily Telegraph readMore than 500 returned Royal Australian Air force air crew officers and men who paraded m the rain at Bradfield Park yesterday morning were offered three options. . . . One of the officers said: "" The men were forced to stand for more than one and a half hours on the parade ground, despite several downpours of rain which drenched them. "" Permission to got under cover was refused hy the Commanding Officer (Wing Commander Sewell), despite the fact that he spoke from a sheltered-doorway. This caused considerable unrest among the already discontented aircrew men."" The report purported to give the effect of an address by the commanding officer at No. 2 Personnel Depot, Bradfield Park, Wing Commander F. A. Sewell, D.F.C. It is, however, untrue and deliberately misrepresents what took place at the parade. According to the newspaper, an officer claimed that he and some 500 men had to stand in the rain while the commanding officer addressed them from a sheltered position. This was a gross injustice to Wing Commander Sewell, who has had wide experience in the handling of men. The facts, since supported by voluntary statements signed by numbers of personnel present, and handed to the -commanding officer, were that men had been assembled on their normal parade. To acquaint air crews of a recent Air Board order concerning new conditions of discharge, Wing Commander Sewell read the order aloud to the assembled men. The reading occupied fifteen minutes. Before it was concluded, light rain began to fall. Wing Commander Sewell immediately said: ""Gentlemen, I do not intend you to get wet. I will dismiss the parade and call you in after it ha* stopped."" The men immediately left for their respective messes. There were hundreds of witnesses to testify that they had not been kept in the rain. A t no time was the commanding officer under shelter, nor was he wearing a top-coat. The parade was resumed five or six minutes later, when the weather had cleared. The remarks attributed to Wing Commander Sewell, concerning personnel giving statements to newspapers and the great concern of the Air Board at the adverse publicity, which claimed that highly skilled men were doing nothing around the depots, were definitely untrue. Wing Commander Sewell said : "" Now, gentlemen, Air Force Head-quarters are having a very difficult time at present. It is a period when we should give all our loyalty and fullest co-operation to the Air Force. It is against regulations to make any statements to the press. I ask you not to go to newspapers, for the reason that statements made often become very distorted."" The silence of the airmen was due to the fact that they were on parade. Despite Wing Commander Sewell's advice to the officers about giving statements to the press, apparently an irresponsible officer made a statement which showed that he had completely misunderstood the orders that had been read verbatim by Wing Commander Sewell. Wing Commander Sewell had taken particular care to clarify the position of men placed on reserve. It was false to suggest that the men were annoyed because no pronouncement about discharges had been made. All the officers and men were given a clear, concise statement by the commanding officer when he read the Air Board order detailing the several alternatives open to personnel should they wish to secure discharges or stay in the service. He particularly emphasized that personnel transferred to the reserve in accordance with the order would, for the purpose of all financial and other entitlements accruing from their service, be treated as discharged men. This meant that they would draw their deferred pay in the normal way. After Wing Commander",19,Vegetable Production

My opinion is that men who have returned from operational service should not he expected to go through refresher courses with the object of being disqualified from further flying duties. I know that many allegations that the courses are designed for this purpose have been made in the press. Those statements are not justified by the facts; they have been greatly exaggerated. I agree that the men who are to be disposed of so that they can take up civil occupations should not be subjected to the type of tests, which, because of their lack of refresher training and of experience of the types of aircraft used, are likely to disqualify them from further flying. I appreciate the value of the service rendered by these men. They should be treated considerately, and 3 believe that they are receiving considerate misrepresentation of the facte by the newspapers for a definite purpose. FOOD CONTROL.

72,Mr Bernard Corser (Wide Bay),"£55,557,000 towards the services of the country in the financial year 1945-46. During the preceding year £505,000,000 was appropriated for war purposes. We have not yet seen the budget for next year, and we do not know what the Government proposes to do to reduce war expenditure, and in olher ways to lighten the burden of taxation on the people. The responsibilities of the Government are great in time of war, and it has been clothed with great powers which it has freely used. created, and organizations established which it will be hard to disband unless the Government is firm. We did not make preparation for war, and we were a Jong way behind our opponents when the war started. We do not want to be as far behind in our preparations for peace. Like other overseas countries, we should set about preparing for peace tiow, and one of the first and most important steps is to reduce taxation. A great part of the revenue raised by taxation is devoted to servicing our national debt. At the beginning of this year Australia's indebtedness was £2,367,000,000. This problem of indebtedness is one of the most serious which will face the postago, I urged that 200,000 men should be war world. After the last war, a conference of nations was held to consider international debts, and some progress was made towards solving the problem, when the Government of the United States of America withdrew its delegates, -and the conference fizzled out. I am sure that a safe and equitable solution of internal debts could be found by international agreement if the nations of the world would devote their energy and initiative to seeking it. [t should be possible to relieve the nations of much of the excess burden of debt which is largely responsible for keeping taxes at a high level. Once this problem was solved, it would be possible to resume normal international trade, and a period of peace and prosperity would be ushered in. I hope that Commonwealth expenditure next year will be greatly reduced. I cannot see why it should be necessary to expend £500,000,000 this year on the war because the danger of invasion has passed and no new activity has been started. There is no need to maintain a great military organization with hundreds of thousands of men under arms in Australia, and vast stores of material and equipment, as if we were still expecting to be invaded. The danger of invasion has passed, and if we are to prepare ourselves against the next invasion threat we ought to get back as quickly as possible to normal economic conditions. The Government should appoint a committee, either from outside this Parliament or from inside it, to examine war expenditure New departments have been with a view to reducing it. The service authorities are still retaining the use of great buildings, and are keeping out of use quantities of machinery and great numbers of motor cars, as well as tyres and petrol, for which the community has urgent need. Man-power should be released from the services to embark upon, forms of production which are already well under way in other countries. Only last week, we read in the newspapers that the Nuffield organization at Coventry expected to export 100,000 motor cars by the end of this year. We must look to our laurels if we hope to take our place in the commerce of the post-war world. Eighteen months released from the services, and at that time many honourable members thought my request ridiculous. Since then, about 100,000 have been released in dribs and drabs, and we were informed the other day that it was proposed to release another 50,000 before the end of the year. Many of these men have been engaged in active operations, and in the intervening eighteen months they might very well have been employed in industry. For the lack of their labour we have already, to a considerable degree, lost our place in the markets of the world. Our concern after the war, should not be merely to find work for our present population. We must develop new productive industries which will provide work for an increasing number of our people. Trade is the lifeblood of the country. Our prosperity must rest upon it. Everything possible should be done, therefore, not only to regain the place which wo formerly held in world trade but also to occupy new and more important position*. Only in this way shall we be able to meet our financial commitments. But we are in danger of losing some of tbe markets which we formerly supplied. We know, for example, that France is doing its utmost to increase its output of wines, whereas Australian production has deteriorated due to war conditions and drought. Steps should be taken to revive this industry and many others that have suffered from the same causes. We must do our utmost, also, to increase our water and power resources in order to stimulate industry. After the last war many returned soldiers were established in the wine industry. We shall have to find room for many more in this and other industries in the near future if we expect with the bot-fly and the blow-fly peats, to maintain and develop our trade. The Government should have in mind the welfare of both the workers and the proprietors of various industries which may need assistance. It is particularly important that every effort should be made to associate scientific investigation with our industrial and commercial enterprises to a greater degree than ever before. It will be necessary, in the years to come, for us to produce in greater quantity and better quality and with more ease if we are to hold our position in the world's markets. In the past both Russia and Germany have realized the importance of linking science with industry, and Great Britain, as we know, wa3 in the vanguard in this respect. In Canada between 200 and 300 experimental farms have been established under the control of qualified scientists, and primary producers from all parts of the Dominion visit these institutions from time to time in order to obtain instruction in the latest and most scientific methods of operating their various enterprises. In Australia we have an important production belt in our coastal areas in the east and in the west, but great territories of our inland country have been practically neglected except for raising sheep and cattle. can be done has been given to us by Russian scientists, who have developed a type of early ripening wheat that can be grown in the short summer period in the Caucasus mountain area and even within . its snow belt. Australia, of course, has some achievements to its credit. Not many years ago Mr Remflrd Corser. we had to import all the rice consumed in this country, but by the application of scientific methods and the provision of water conservation schemes, we are now able, in normal times, to grow more rice than wo need for home consumption. Any wise expenditure that we may incur in encouraging the adoption of scientific methods will repay us tenfold and more. 1 advocate that practical men associated with various industries should be sent abroad from time to time to make investigations of the latest scientific developments in other countries. In the past we have sought the aid of scientists to deal but we need to do much more work of that kind than has ever been done in the past. In particular, we need to develop industrial activities on the positive side, and not to confine our attention to the eradication of pests. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research ha? done fine work, and, given due encouragement by increased finance, it could do much more. We shall need to provide new methods of transport to take our surplus primary products to overseas markets, and in this respect I direct attention to the importance of maintaining, in proper condition, the many air-fields and air-strips that have been constructed in different parts of Australia for defence purposes, some of which to-day, unfortunately, are almost deserted and are deteriorating rapidly. We shall need to adopt air transport for goods as well as passengers in the days to come. The dairy-farmers of New Zealand have produced a cheese of low fat content which will be sought after by the people of Europe. They have also developed other delicacies of the dairying industry by the use of fat oils, which can be transported abroad by air without refrigeration. We shall need to engage in investigations of that description, and we An indication of what should be making arrangements now to do so, in order that we may be able to take advantage of markets that will become available immediately the war in the Pacific ends. I trust that the Government will give earnest consideration to these suggestions, apart from any thought of party politics. We shall need especially to give earnest consideration immediately to the land settlement of our ex-service personnel. A great deal has been said in this House lately on that subject, and I shall merely point out that already 60,000 ex-service men and women have returned to civil life; yet, so far, not one agreement has been made between the Commonwealth and State Governments in regard to land settlement. I know that the settling of our men on the land is to a considerable degree a State responsibility. I do not make that accusation against New South Wales, because it was settling servicemen on leaseholds before the agreement was suggested. I urge the Government to ensure that practical men shall direct operations under the agreements which the States have been asked to sign. Theorists and economists may be necessary for some purposes, but they should not have the guidance of the practical operations that are necessary to ensure the prosperity of primary producers. Housing, generally, is being held up. I do not know what provision, man-power and materials, the Government is making. timber, and large quantities of imported galvanized iron, have been used in the construction of buildings throughout the country which are now unoccupied. The whole of that material should he sold for use in the building of homes. Why leave the matter until after the war? Many controls should be discontinued. Only yesterday, I pointed out that the War Service Homes Commission will not make an advance for the building of a home on a miners' homestead lease, despite the fact that that is the only form of tenure that is available in mining areas, small and large, in Queensland. Yet freehold tenure is opposed to the convictions and the policy of the Government 1 Banking institutions, building societies and the like are prepared to advance money for the erection of. homes on miners' homestead leases. Local authorities and other bodies should be empowered to issue permits for the building of homes in their areas. That would be of the greatest possible assistance. Mutual societies, such as the Australian Mutual Provident Society, have millions of pounds available for the purpose of housing, and, if permitted, these funds would enable homes to be built by those who desire to obtain them. I urge the Government to be a little more generous in connection with releases from the Army for the assistance of primary producers. There are still many sad cases, and they are becoming sadder as the days go by, because the parents are becoming older. It is almost impossible to secure on any ground the release of men from the Army. I blame, not the Army, but the regulations, for which the Government must be held responsible. The Man Power Directorate in Queensland has been advised that men may be released for employment in the timber industry and the sugar industry, yet appeals for releases to enable garages to operate fully, so that they may make necessary repairs to combustion engines that are used on farms, are rejected. Persons who desire to do oxy-welding cannot obtain supplies of gas because, so they are told, gas containers are scarce. That excuse was offered two years ago. These containers are made of metal. Hundreds of tons of metal that is useless for other Millions of feet of first-class purposes and is stored and dumped throughout Australia, could be made into containers. Metals establishments are being closed because they have completed their war contracts. Why should they not make some of these containers? A sufficient number could be made in a few weeks to meet demands for the next five years. I trust that the Government will give attention to these practical suggestions. Small though they may be, they mean a lot to the men in primary industries. I believe that the -Government is sincere in its latest plans for the release of men from the services. Yet when men are released, what happens? The Repatriation Department says that it will assist them to become rehabilitated. Take the case of the man who wants to undertake painting work. After a period, he may obtain the paints that he needs; but he then finds that he cannot purchase ladders because they may not be made. If he is able to obtain second-hand ladders, he finds that he cannot get brushes which are in short supply. The Administration should be practical, so that men who wish to follow a trade could purchase the whole of their requirements. received a letter from a man who said that he had exhausted all his financial resources, including his deferred pay, and was now waiting to purchase ladders so that he could undertake painting contracts. The re-establishment of ex-servicemen should be done thoroughly. In primary .production generally, this country would be well advised to revert to producer control, with the greatest possible exclusion of government control. The great dairying industry has been developed by that means. Organizations of producers would be able to find the markets that they need, and they would have a standing in the community. New Zealand is working along these lines. That dominion has a shipping line for the transport of its butter to England and Scotland, and additions to it have been made during the war. The price of New Zealand butter on the overseas market is Id. per lb. higher than Australia can obtain. In every way, it is leaping ahead of us. We' are merely staggering along under conditions which may lead to destruction if they are allowed to continue. I hope that, in the next budget, the Government will prune considerably the war expenditure. With a smaller Army, and the war receding farther and farther from our shores, we should turn our time, attention and money to post-war production, and make preparations for those who are to live in this country in the days of peace. have heard repeated ad nauseam the statement that the Communist party is a part of the Labour movement. There is some truth in the suggestion that thatparty is supported in every way by those who are opposed to the Labour party. In 1934, the Secretary of the Comintern in Russia, Mr Dimitroff, issued a statement that was published in the Australian press, that no member of the Labour party was to be opposed at general elections, but that rather the Communists should support the Labour party and, if the results of a Labour Administration were not to their satisfaction, tell the country openly that the Labour party was not prepared to do what they sugOnly yesterday, I gested. That practice has been followed , 4 throughout the Commonwealth, except in my electorate, where I have had the privilege and honour of being opposed by a Communist on' five occasions. Th<Executive of the Australian Labour party in Queensland has instructed thai all Communist candidates shall be placed; last in the order of preference on the ballot-paper. In my electorate, the Communist candidate on every occasion has been given, by Labour voters, the No. 4 preference, and that only because there have not been five candidates. We are very well aware of the intentions of the Communist party. Excusesfor that party were made by a Mr McCarthy in Townsville, in a debate with a gentleman of the cloth of the saintname. He said: "" We are not concerned about what they do in Russia, or anywhere else. We are going to use our own methods in Australia to achieve our objectives, which may not be similar to those of other countries"". The Communist party, like the Liberal party, twists and turns in every direction. Fronn 1939 up to the present time, it has consistently altered its course. Before Russia was attacked by Germany, its cry was: ""Hands off Russia! This is a capitalist war, and we should not have anything to do with it "" . But when Russia entered the war, the Communist party became an advocate of conscription, and urged that every able-bodied man should be sent out of this country to fight. Before doing so, however, it made sure that its members were in sheltered industries, and thus were not liable to be called up for military service abroad. The most consistent attacker of the Communist party in the Commonwealth has been the. Australian Workers Union, to which I have belonged for many years. At all times, it has been quite open in it. c attacks. During a State election campaign in Queensland about six years ago, the gentleman who had opposed me so often-E . W.

The majority of thein, however, assisted because they wanted to destroy the Labour party. That is the aim also of 'he Communist party. It is of no use for honourable members opposite to "" shed crocodile tears"" about the possible fate of this Government. Their one object in life is to defeat the Labour party, and they are actuated by economic considerations. The honourable member for Gippsland admitted it.

The Communist newspapers were not suppressed, but driven underground. The Communists surmounted the ban in devious ways. Not being able to stand against me as a Communist, as he avowedly is, Mr Patterson, at the general elections before last, nominated as "" independent socialist"", whatever that may be, but, regardless of how he described himself for electoral purposes, he was then, as he is to-day, and always has been, an out-and-out Communist.

It is of no use for workers to say that the Communists have pulled the wool over their eyes, because the Communists have never hidden their intentions. printed or roneoed, issued hy the Communist party in every State of the Commonwealth, clearly states that the intention of the party is to smash the Labour party. Dimitroff, in a printed article, told the Communists to get key positions in the workshops and the shearing sheds, because they could thereby ensure that only the literature that the party wanted to have distributed should be distributed. I know that in my own electorate Communist literature is freely circulated, whereas Labour party literature, including the Queensland Worker, is dumped by the Communists where the workers cannot get it. Dimitroff told the Communists not to worry about paid positions, because the position of shop steward was much more useful. I know what is done. It is difficult to detect the distributors of the literature. Unfortunately, the workers "" fall "" for it. The unions call meetings, and, when the decent men have become disgusted and left, the adherents of communism carry resolutions purporting to represent the opinions of all. To-day a lot has been said about "" E r n i e "" Thorntoii. If the industrial unionists are prepared to elect him to represent them at a world conference. God help them! I would deport "" Ernie"" Thornton and every other Scotsman like him from the. country. The two mines in my electorate are mostly manned by Scotsmen and a worse nest of Communists I could nothad a decent feed until they came to this country; but now they are "" in the money "". I suppose some one will say that (here are also Irish Communists, but they are few. Unthinking people do fall for the Communist ideals. They are forced into that by irksorue things in their daily lives. They believe that many of the restrictions and other conditions of warfare which affect them could be avoided, but, if the Opposition parties much of a fist of their job when they were in office. In order to throw some light on the source of the Comniunisl party's funds I intend to quote an article Every publication, published on the 19th March, 1945, in the Queensland Worker, concerning the Baillieu faniily's association with the Communist party. If it is not true, it is a wonder that Mr John Reed has not taken time off to issue a writ against the Queensland Worker, because it would be a profitable venture, since it has valuable assets in property and plant. The article is as follows.'That Communists have received financial hand-outs from wealthy sections of the community to conduct anti-Labour campaigns has long been the opinion of the Labour Movement. But it is not every day of the week that a wealthy man comes into the open with the admission that he has helped to finance the ""Corns."" Yet that happened recently, when Mr John Beed, very well known in the South.",28,Ciiift Ev

78,Mr Martens,"They did not makeand married to cue of the wealthy Baillieu clan, declared to the world that his wife's money, and his, had been used to back a Communist election campaign. To innocent electors who are taught BO resolutely by the anti-Labour press that the nation would become undone uuder Labour's control, it might appear incredulous that a Baillieu would associate with Communists, even at a lonfr distance. It might also appear very mystifying to the rank and tile oi the "" Coiuinus "", who fire the 'bullets made by the intellectuals in decluded occupations, that money from the wealthy class would be used to break down Labour. There is not one rank and file Communist in Australia to-day who has not been taught to regard the Baillieu group in the financial world as being a group to combat. The name of Baillieu is well known in Australia, Britain and America. The family has been associated with sonic of the largest and most profitable industrial and business undertakings ever launched in the Commonwealth; wealth has simply oozed from the varied paths along which the family has traversed. However, tlie fact remains that Mr John Reed, who is editor of a publication called Angry Penguins, wrote a letter to the Communist paper, Guardian (Melbourne), protesting against an article therein. The Communist article arose out of a hoax which had been perpetrated on Angry Penguins, by two "" poets"". who had trapped Angry Penguins into publishing some faked verses which were hailed as being the work of a poetic "" genius "". It should be explained that Angry Penguins has published verses which nobody can understand except those who claim to have exceptionally rare gifts, and meaningless (to the untutored eye) reproductions of paintings which are in the category of ultra-modern. Possibly, because Angry Penguins was made the toughing stock by the poetical jokers, the Communist Guardian decided to criticize, and in doing so, a writer named Necl Counihan hod the following to say:"" Each issue of Angry Penguins has revealed that wealthy John Reed (married to 4 Baillieu), self-acclaimed genius Max Harris, ' p r i m it i v e ' painter Sid Nolan, and political theoretician. Albert Tucker, have adopted a more and more anti-working class, anti-Soviet position. The bulk of their journal, available for ' red-baiting', remains strangely unaware of the menace of Fascism "". Mr John Reed was naturally up in arms. He wrote to the Communist Guardian, which refused to publish his letter. So he let fly another barrel in a recent issue of his own Angry Penguins, in the course of which he stated: "" I am married to a Baillieu; how terrible! The fact that my wife may be a human being, Hiid a very fine one at that, of course does not enter into the picture at all. No, she has money, and that is the end of the story! "" The fact that her money and mine, too, has been used to support the Communist party election campaign is, of course, quite irrelevant. The fact that our money has also been used to help one of the Country party leaders i.s also, of course, quite irrelevant. The fact that I was treasurer for Malcolm Good's Federal Election Campaign Committee is also quite irrelevant. . . ."" So there we have it . Nothing could be plainer than that bold statement. Rood's remarks clinch the opinion held by muuy Liihorites that the "" Corns."" are beingfinanced by other than members. It is all very fine for the Thornton's, the Miles, and tlie Sharkeys to stump the country breathing fire and brimstone against capitalism. They will have something to explain totlie dupes who have been doing their work for them! They will have something to explain, too. when they come before trade unionists who artloyal to .Labour. None of these men belongs to Australia. I am amazed that so many trade unions are prepared to accept as their leadersand highly paid officials men from other countries who know nothing about Australia. If these men were the saviours of mankind, as they claim to be, they would stay in their native lands wherethere are more people to be helped than in Australia. However, Australians are easy going, and apparently rather stupid: in this connection, and they allow themselves to be led by these people, who are not fit to represent them. If Mr Thornton had to submit his nameto a properly conducted ballot of Australian unionists, I am sure that he would, not be chosen to represent the Labour movement. I regret that tlie trade unions, have been so misguided as to select astheir representative at the Paris conference, a man who has no Australian, outlook, who is opposed to the WhiteAustralia policy, who is a menace to the Labour movement, and whose conduct is very convenient to the Opposition in this Parliament. glad to know that the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Martens) dislikes the Communist party, and I congratulate him on having the courage to rise in this House and say what he thinks of theCommunists.

Another dairyman over 70 years of age, with an only son in the services, has to milk 30 cows and do all the farm work without assistance.. A lady who conducts a small bakery in a provincial town in my electorate has no assistance. She has befouie ill, and it is impossible for her to continue in business without the assistance of her son. A farmer, aged 75 years, is carrying on a dairy farm, with 30 cows, and has no assistance apart from his wife, who also is advanced in years. Another man, aged 70 years, has a farm of 120 acres, of which 35 acres is devoted to potato-growing. He and his wife must do the work. A man condmcting a small grocery business in a town in my electorate has broken down in health, and. he is helped only by his wife, who also is ill . Another case is that of a farms for their sons. If those businesses farmer, aged 73 years, with one son, who has been in the Army for four years. The farmer has just had a surgical operation, and, owing to his state of health, he will be compelled to sell his farm unless the son is discharged from the Army. A blacksmith in a populous dairying district has had. a complete breakdown of health, and his only son, who is serving with the forces, has not been released. This man's business is of the utmost importance to the local community, because he has been maintaining and"" repairing farm machinery; this work is absolutely essential to the prosperity of the district. Another man, over 65 years of age, conducts a grocery business and the local branch of the Savings Bank. Both he and his wife have just had to undergo surgical operations, and they are unable to continue their business, which is important to the populous district in which it is established. Another man, who lives about 10 miles from my own home, is the main storekeeper of] the area, and also runs a dairy farm. He is over 70 years of age and is unable to handle supplies of fodder and chaff without the assistance of a younger man. Unless his son is discharged from the services he will be compelled to go out of business, and the district will suffer as a consequence. A man and his wife on a dairy farm, with about 40 cows, are also in difficulties. The husband has very high blood pressure-judgin g by his appear[116] ance the rating must he well over 200and the wife suffers from diabetes. In spite of their dangerous state of health, and against the doctor's orders, they are carrying on the farm in the hope of saving it for their son. All of these cases which I have mentioned deserve the highest order of priority for discharges from the services for three important reasons. The first reason is that it would be an act of justice to release the sons of these people who, since the beginning of the war, have worked without intermission, many of them for seven days a week and from ten to twelve hours a day, in productive occupations, ruining their health and virtually driving themselves into their graves. The second reason is that they are trying to keep their businesses or go by the board, more problems will be created, for the Government to handle, and, in addition, the sons will lose their patrimony. The third reason is that all of these people are carrying on services which are essential to the community. Their sons should be given priority for discharge. The number is not very large. I have been notified of, and have investigated, only about twenty or 30 cases. All the applications which I have so far made have been refused by either the man-power authorities or the Army authorities. I urge the Government to review its policy in this regard, and to arrange for the speedy discharge of these men. Frequent references have been made in this House to the shortage of wire netting and rabbit traps required for the control of the rabbit pest. In Gippsland-, rabbits' are increasing very rapidly, because labour and equipment are not available with which to cope with them. Damage to the amount of hundreds of thousands ofi pounds is being done every year hy rabbits, particularly to vegetable crops in my district.

86,Mr Fadden (Darling Downs,"Leade r stocktaking with a view to preventingand transfers between jobs and permitted opportunities for misuse of materials. Arising out of the investigation the services of the resident architect were terminated and action taken to establish safeguard to obviate future losses. In many instances expenditure on jobs continued to exceed the estimate of financial authorities. Civil Constructional Corps -It was noted in the Northern Territory that though the volume of work fell off, and a number of employees naturally decreased, the administrative staff expanded. A t A p r i l, 1944, wage employees, civil constructional aliens and free labour totalled 6,21(5 and staff 63T. The figures at January, 1945, were 3,016 and 837. In October, 1944, the Deputy Director General stated that as soon as circumstances permitted a reduction would be made and that with the work in many sections still in arrears, it was not considered advisable at present to dispense with any officer's services. Owing to lack of control and of co-operation between the wage-paying and the allotmentpaying authorities, over payments of allotments amounting to large sums resulted, much of which it has not been possible to recover. The department attributes these over-payments to the abnormal conditions obtaining in the early stages and the constant movement of personnel. Requisitioned cargoes of diverted vessels. The matter of financial adjustment by service departments in respect of cargoes taken over on arrival of vessels is still in an unsatisfacobtain. tory condition. Undue delay has occurred on the part of those departments in the checking and taking on charge of the goods and in furnishing advices to the Division of Import Procurement of goods actually received. No price invoices covering diverted cargoes supplied to the service departments has been furnished by the Division of Import Procurement up to the 30th June, 1944, consequently, no cash adjustment with the division has been made regarding such cargoes. Tea Control Board -An audit of tlie board's account made at the 30th June, 1944, showed the board had not maintained satisfactory accounting records. Food Control -Nett expenditure on emergency stocks si nee the inception of the scheme has been reduced during the year by an excess of receipts over expenditure of £211,775 and now stands at £090,562. Since the close of the year losses have been revealed and further considerable losses are anticipated. Losses arising in the purchase processing and -laics of vegetables to a total value of £144,456 have been reported. Tho main contributing factors were the perishable nature of the products, defective processing specifications and non-observance of specifications. Com pen«Htion payments totalling £24,747 to growers ->f vegetables have been made in special rirnuniptances. Regarding the nitrate of soda subsidy, a .number of unsatisfactory features in regard to these transactions, concerning control and accounting, has been taken up with the department. The appointment of an internal auditor has been made by the department with a view to improving the accounting position. Commerce owed Munitions over £200,000 for nitrate supplied to the agent for distribution. Large amounts which could be paid to Commonwealth public account were held in private hank account for unduly long periods. Financial records of equipment purchase and supplied by the Department of Munitions to training schools have been established to 30th June, 1944, but no departmental action has been taken to verify the existence of the assets by stocktaking or signed inventories. The unsatisfactory position in this respect was referred to in my previous report. It was mentioned in my previous report that departmental officers were investigating unsatisfactory features relating to stores trans7 ferred from the Middle East to Australia. Efforts to remedy the position have been unsuccessful and the department is preparing a report seeking approval to close the investigation. Ordnance Stocktakings -Arrears are still in evidence and delay in presenting discrepancy lists in respect of stocktaking effected still Unit Stores -The standard of accounting at many units leaves much to be desired. Staffs were appointed in the earlier stages without proper training in store accounting and until recently adequate instruction was not available. A t some of these units discrepancies have been particularly heavy. U n it Stocktakings -Stocktaking s are still in arrears. Unsatisfactory features: Delay occurs in assembling courts of inquiry or the appointment of officers to investigate discrepancies following stocktaking. Results of investigation are frequently inconclusive and, although losses may be heavy, the department is usually unable to determine individual responsibility owing to lapse of time, movements of staff and necessary employment of untrained staff. In some cases unit records and documents could not be produced. Australian Electrical Mechanical Engineering Workshops -Accountin g for stores at these workshops in one area was found to be unsatisfactory. In two instances it was not possible to effect an audit owing to the absence of stock records and relevant vouchers. In the majority of workshops a f u l l internal check had not been exercised. No stocktaking results have been made available to audit. Losses on Consignment -Larg e losses of stores and supplies have occurred in consignments to New Guinea and Darwin. Losses were parti -ularly noticeable in "" r a t i o n e d "" commodities and stores of an attractive nature. The department has given the matter much attention and in a recent letter to this office, after reviewing the steps taken to safeguard stores, at ports of loading and discharge and in transit, stated, "" It is considered that the above precautions and the service instructions issued from time to time provide as f u l l safeguards as are possible."" Notwithstanding the safeguards in force losses continue to occur on a considerable scale. Regarding claims for chattels impressed or taken over in evacuated areas, £510,431 was paid to 30th June, 1044, in respect of claims for chattels, vehicles, general merchandise, 4c., left behind in Darwin, Port Moresby and other evacuated areas by the Army, and which were impressed, requisitioned or deemed to have been taken or used by Commonwealth authorities or tlie Allied armed forces. Examination of the accounts paid to date revealed instances where payment has been made for goods left behind by merchants, and which are not a normal issue to the services, for example, pianos, spirits, liquors, soft drinks, tobacco, cigarettes, toilet preparations, &c., nor does there appear to have been any acknowledgment of receipt of, or accounting for, such goods. Boards of Inquiry and Losses by Theft -In my previous report the view was expressed that Commonwealth interests were insufficiently protected under existing military regulations and related procedure in regard to losses of cash and stores by t h e f t and other causes by army personnel. The matter is still under review by the Departments of the Treasury and the Army. Although some improvement is revealed in stocktaking, it is still far from satisfactory. From July, 1940, to June. 1943, 304 stocktakings were effected of which 107 only have been investigated and results submitted to audit. In 1943-44, approximately 250 stocktakings were undertaken and only 33 have been completed and submitted to the date of this report. At Royal Australian A i r Force Head-quarters a small stocktaking investigation section is engaged primarily in cleaning up arrears, but it is evident that a greater effort than that at present being made will be necessazy ' if they are to be overtaken within a reasonable period. Up to the present investigation has been conducted by correspondence from the central office. This has proved ineffective, and in consequence it is intended that units throughout the Commonwealth shall be visited in an endeavour by inquiry on the spot, to clear up arrears. Stevedoring regulations provide for the establishment of waterside employment committees. Mr Fadden. An audit of the cash advances to committees at Townsville and Cairns reveals unsatisfactory features in relation to the collection of public moneys and finance generally, due mainly to the department's failure to issue adequate instructions regarding such matters. The financial control of a hotel which had been taken over at Townsville to accommodate waterside workers transferred from other ports was insufficient and open to abuse. These matters are receiving the department's attention. The financial books of the Salvage Board did not reflect the true position at 30th June, 1944, mainly due to lack of co-ordination between the Department of Supply and the board. The board has not .reconciled the amount shown in the books for equipment and stores with the stock on hand and progressive records of stock have not been adequately maintained. Canteens have been established on the board's ships to provide liquor and tobacco for sale to the crows. The books of account do not reflect the correct position of these accounts, necessary adjusting entries being considerably in arrears. Requests have been made for the reconciliation of ledger accounts with stewards' stocks immediately on tlie return of each operating vessel, but so far without satisfactory results. The financial statements relating to one factory remain uncertified by audit as far back as 1940-41 and for another to 1941-42, as it was considered that the statements presented do not show accurately the factories"" financial position. Statements in relation to 1942-43 for a few factories also remain uncertified pending departmental explanation of audit queries. A matter which attracted attention has arisen from the reduction in the volume of munitions production. The reduced demand required fewer operatives but there were manpower difficulties in transferring the surplus to other employment. Production of stocks of components was therefore continued with excess of service requirements and the cost was charged to production as for service orders. Regarding armament annexes, annexe records and accounts for production costs are examined by departmental investigation officers but the department reconciliation of progress payments is very much in arrears. Many annexes have been in production without the completion of any formal contract document between the Commonwealth and the annexe operator. Advances and progress payments totalling £2,408,361 made to annexe contractors for capital expenditure on buildings, plant, equipment and installation charges to 30th June. 1944, were unadjusted at that date. Such advances w ill be adjusted upon receipt of statements of expenditure examined by cost investigation officers. Pending those examinations no authentic departmental records of the assets of the Commonwealth purchased from such advances can be prepared. The position of outstanding amounts due to the department in respect of machine tools sold and loaned on a rental basis is not satisfactory. The necessity of the prompt selection of the arrears has been represented to the department from time to time. Departmental accounting instructions require the establishment within the trust account of certain subsidiary control accounts, hut action has not been taken to implement the instructions. Until such control accounts are introduced a satisfactory audit of these aocounts cannot be completed. Machine tools are transferred on loan to contractors either on a rental or rent-free basis. Hiring agreements are negotiated in respect of machines subject to rental charges, but to 30th June, 1944, many agreements had not been completed. Delay has occurred in establishing departmental control ' accounts for all approved projects. When -this report was prepared the expenditure incurred in connection with projects for which control accounts had not been established totalled f 1.974,897. Where controls are operatwas made last year. Audit representations ing, tlie accounts have been balanced to 30th June, 1943, only. A satisfactory audit of the transaction of the various projects cannot be completed in the absence of control accounts. Although results of stocktaking of materials in stores throughout Australia have been advised during the year, effective use could not he made of the certificate of stocktaking because satisfactory reconciliations had not been effected between the quantitative records kept hy the stores and transport branch and financial control records maintained by the chief accountant. this regard is being taken. Certain stocks valued at £741,655 as at 30th June, 1943, were held by contractors on behalf of the department pending their being utilized in production. No departmental stocktaking of such materials have been effected and no reconciliations have been made with departmental records, but the departmental intention was to undertake the preparation of stock sheets at the end of March, 1945. Outstanding sundry debtors, amounts owing by government departments, at 30th June, 194.4, amounted to £3,485,872. This figure is £791,248 less than last year. While an improvement has been noted, a disquieting feature in these accounts is tlie large discrepancy-£60,208-disclose d between the control account and the sundry debtors ledger at 30th June, 1943. Representations on the matter have been made to the department. In December, 1940, a directorate was established and orders placed for the purchase of reserves of materials for use in production of armoured fighting vehicles. Tho directorate ceased to function in November, 1943. Total expenditure incurred on the purchase of reserves of materials for the project was £122,261 to 30th June, 1944. Audit examination has revealed unsatisfactory features in the departmental accounting for these stores. There was lack of co-ordination between the directorate and the chief accountant in the control of the movements of stock, and consequently it has not been possible to ascertain whether contractorsengaged on production have been debited with tlie cost of materials delivered to them and whether excess materials supplied have been satisfactorily accounted for. It is understood that the directorate took delivery of many lend-lease items without furnishing the necessary documentary evidence of delivery. Audit has not been able to ascertain the location of the relative accountancy records since the directorate ceased operation about November, 1943. Representations have been made to the department on the foregoing matters but at the date of preparation of this report, the queries had not been satisfied. Regarding the transport section, munition stores and transport branch, Victoria, an adverse report on the activities of this section have been attended to by the department which now claims that past defects have been remedied. In regard to the matter of over-payments, referred to in .last year's report, settlement with the contractor was made on legal advice, and following a departmental examination of the position. The settlement was for a substantial amount in the contractor's favour, and included a large amount in the aggregate previously deducted for discount but found not to have been deductible because of the departDepartmental action in mental delay in passing claims. Financial statement of the munitions stores and transport branch for tlie years ended 30th June, 1943, and 1944 have not been submitted to my officers. I am sure that honourable members will agree that the story told by the Auditor General of the manner in which the taxpayers' money is being used and the lacx of proper accountancy procedure is including extremely serious. In times when the people are subjected to very high taxation, and are frequently urged by every means at the Government's command to contribute to war loans, it is highly regrettable that such a state of affairs 1 should exist. The Government must recognize its responsibility in this matter. The statements of the Auditor-General in his current report are unfortunately similar to remarks that he felt obliged to make in his report for the year ended the 30th June, 1943. The two report? constitute a grave reflection upon thr administration of the Government which is the custodian, for the time heing, of the people's money. The taxpayers are entitled to expect that value will he obtained for all public money that is expended, and that to the greatest degree possible waste shall be eliminated. Owing to the inefficiency and the maladministration of the Government, the expectations of the public have not been realized. Dealing with some comments in the Auditor-General's report for the financial year ended the 30th June, 1943, the Minister for Munitions saidTlie comment of the Auditor-General can be described as exaggerated and giving a distorted picture of the situation. Most of it appears to be directed at the Victorian section. Labour Conference in Paris will be met. The Auditor-General referred to these observations in his latest report and proceeded as follows:The inference is quite correct; the paragraph in question was headed "" Munitions Stores and Transport Branch, Victoria "". X have been greatly concerned at the Minister's statement as it is my invariable practice where comment or criticism is considered necessary, to state the position as moderately as possible and to avoid overstatement in any respect. As regards the branch in question, my officers had been endeavouring for a considerable period to secure improvement in its accounting and control. The Treasury had also taken action. In these circumstances it is most regrettable that, in referring to the latest report of the Auditor-General, the Minister for Munitions saw fit to observe that the Auditor-General was not a production man, and had only a rather theoretical knowledge, and that for those reasons he would prefer to be guided by the production men. It is serious that a Minister should regard so lightly such an important document. The Parliament is entitled to a reply from Ministers to the various statements that the Auditor General has made, but the observations of the Minister for Munitions in regard to criticism of his own department cannot lie considered as satisfactory in any sense of the word. The Auditor-General is a highly responsible public servant who has been charged by Parliament with the duty of examining public accounts and reporting direct to the Parliament on any matters which, in his opinion, reMr Fadden. quire explanation. The Auditor-General is, in short, the examiner, the investigator and the observer in regard to public expenditure. It is his duty to bring to the attention of Parliament instances in which the expenditure of public money has not been properly accounted for, and to report upon waste and inefficiency that have resulted, from inadequate administrative procedure. I notice from the latest report that the expenditure of the Prime Minister's Department was scrutinized. No doubt it will be from the vote for this department that any expenditure necessary in connection with the visit abroad of Mr E. Thornton to attend the World ment will pay the expenses. everybody that the arrangements for such travel will have to be made by the Government. This Parliament is the trustee of the taxpayers, and it is entitled to a full explanation of how certain jiroposed expenditure is to be met. If public moneys are to be used directly or indirectly to meet any expense incurred in connection with Mr Thornton's visit overseas, the people should be informed of it, particularly as this person has been declared by the Vice-President of the Executive Council to be unqualified, by reason of his statements about the White Australia policy, to represent the trade unions of this country or the Australian Labour party. His fifth-column activities make him unfitted to represent Australia in any capacity whatever. That being the position, I emphatically protest against any public expenditure, either directly or indirectly, in connection with the projected visit overseas of this gentleman who has been appointed by the Australasian Council of Trade Unions to represent the trade union movement of Australia. Those who believe in constitutional government, the system of. conciliation and arbitration, and the general principles of democracy, must realize the dangers to which these are being subjected by the growth of Communist activity in Australia. The Labour movement must take",33,Department Of The Interior

88,Mr Fadden,"It is quite obvious tostock, and recognize that it is being whiteanted by the propounding of foreign doctrines, which are of no advantage to Australia and are absolutely opposed to the principles of constitutional authority and parliamentary government. Those who believe in such principles must combat to the utmost degree the cancerous growth of Communism in our community. either 'by remaining silent or by lending encouragement, associate ourselves with tlie granting of facilities to an avowed Communist who proposes to attend a world trade union conference, and undoubtedly will misrepresent the opinions that we hold and the principles that we espouse. The Government should not expend one penny, either directly or indirectly, on the provision of facilities or for any other purpose in connection with Mr Thornton's travels, but must take every step to preserve the parliamentary authority that we all wish to uphold. I reiterate, with all the emphasis of which I. am capable, that the Government should be mindful of its responsibility in connection with the expenditure of public money. The Auditor-General's report is a scathing and mal-adiuinistration. Pages of his report have been devoted to weaknesses in the accountancy methods followed, and the impropriety of certain public expenditure. Because of the manner in which taxation has soared, and the difficulty, which the Government experiences in raising by loan the funds that it needs, we have the inescapable duty of ensuring that there shall be value for every pound expended. The Government must not shirk its responsibility to eliminate waste and inefficiency. There is only one copy of this year's Toport of the Auditor-General. Having regard to the contents of both that document and the report for the preceding year, the Government should appoint a committee of reputable accountants, to investigate the various matters dealt with, and report on means whereby the present unsatisfactory position may be remedied. The Government must not overlook the fact that this latest report deals with expenditure that was incurred twelve months ago. Doubtless, the next report also will reveal an appalling state of affairs in connection w i th the accounts for the present year. As custodian of the public purse, the Government should take the matter in hand as speedily as possible. every sitting, this House has presented to it evidence of the weakening of the Therefore, we should not, Parliament's authority over public finance. The point made by the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr. Fadden) should commend itself to every member who recognizes his responsibility to exercise control over Government expenditure. The right honourable gentleman has stptnd that the Auditor-General, who is the one authority to which this Parliament can look for an impartial and effective examination of public accounts, has presented a most critical report, practically twelve months after the expenditure to which it relates was incurred. That report is not available to either the public or the Parliament in printed form . We have been told that the reason is that the work of the Government Printing Office is congested. I have no doubt that there is a good deal of congestion in that office. My sympathy indictment of inefficiency goes out to the overworked Government Printer, who has had to produce the thoroughly unnecessary publication prepared by the Government: Digest of Decisions and Announcements. So far as I have been able to gather, that is not only a useless document, but also an additional burden on the Government Printing Office and on public finance. digest; it is propaganda. is not a digest in the proper sense, but is propaganda "" blurb "" on behalf of the Government. In a recent issue, the complete text of the banking legislation was reproduced, although the printed bill was available to the public. In either the and prominent practising same or another issue, the f u l l text of the Re-establishment and Employment B ill was printed. It does not appear to give a balanced presentation of the views of the Parliament as a whole.

I have been fortunate in that I have secured a type-written copy of the report, and thus have additional details of one item which, I am sure, has affronted the tax-paying public. Prominence has been given to it in the report, and it provides a further illustration of the casualness with which the Executive is prepared to treat the Parliament and the people in its handling of public moneys. I refer to the use of public funds for propaganda purposes in connection with the referendum campaign. Recently, I asked the Treasurer ( Mr Makin). Chifley) whether he proposed to place before the Parliament a supplementary appropriation to cover expenditure on the "" yes "" case in the referendum campaign. The right honourable gentleman replied that, as ho had not the printed report before him, he was not able to say what would be done. That was a mere evasion of direct criticism by the Auditor-General, who had pointed out that, in the examination of expenditure accounts, he was required by the provisions of the Audit Act to ascertain whether the moneys shown therein to have been disbursed, were legally available for and applicable to the services or purposes to which they had been applied or charged. He went on to say that the opinion had been expressed to the Treasurer that the vote under notice-Post-war Campaign-was the purpose for which it had been used, and was not legally available and applicable to meet the expenditure referred to; therefore, a supplementary appropriation was considered necessary under a clearer and unquestionable description. Between the lines of that comment one can read as scathing a criticism of Treasury action and Executive indifferMr Holt. ence to the rights"" of the Parliament, &s one could imagine. Yet, although the that has passed between himself and the Auditor-General, he is not prepared to state definitely whether or not he proposes to seek a supplementary appropriation. The amount charged against the accounts for the year covered by the The Parliareport was £5,226, but the additional sum of £43,050 has since been incurred in respect of the same activity, and will he included in the accounts that will be covered by the next report; therefore, we are dealing with an expenditure of almost £50,000. According to the Auditor General, parliamentary authority for that expenditure should he obtained. Yesterday, the munitions programme was discussed. 'The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) mentioned the colossal expenditure on, and the infinitesimal results that had resulted from, the production of tanks. He was attacked by the Minister for Munitions ( Mr answered hy the Minister. counter the Minister's reply, and I hope that I shall do so effectively. The Minister claimed that the proposal to manufacture tanks in Australia had been approved by the Menzies Government, and that the bulk of the expenditure had been incurred prior to the assumption of office by the Labour Government. He said that in January, 1942, three months after the present Administration had assumed office, the tanks produced were given their first trials. All of these statements may be correct. But they may give a thoroughly unbalanced picture of what is taking place. I do not criticize the government -in fact, I was a member of it-that Educational decided to manufacture tanks in Ausnot clearly related to tralia when we had no knowledge of what resources would be available to us from other countries.

The Minister, in reply, criticized my attitude, saying that I was faint-hearted and did not have faith in the ability of Australian industry to handle the job. I had enough information to know that the programme was a. failure, and that it represented an unnecessary additional charge upon our resources of labour and material. But the Minister persisted, and now, in order to evade proper criticism, he tries to mislead the Parliament by saying that the bulk of the expenditure had been incurred when he took over the Munitions Department. ton Lewis say about it? in a position to speak for himself. I have a great regard for his capacity and share the gratitude of every Australian for the work that he did in the munitions programme. honourable member criticize him? balanced allocation of national resources does not concern the Director-General of Munitions. He handles his own problem in the best way he can. It is the responsibility of the Government to determine the allocation of men and materials. We were able to see in 1942 that the continuance of the tank construction programme was a wasteful use of our limited resources. more pressing matter is the aircraft production programme. As, at one stage of the war, it was sound policy to manufacture tanks, which policy later became unsound, so toOj early in the war, it was sound policy to manufacture aircraft, but disconcerts me is the reluctance of the Government to make available suflBcient fort, Beaufighter, Mustang and LancasterI t is not desirable to publish information as to the numbers of aircraft ordered by the Government, or of the authorizations of funds and expenditure which are included in the secret estimates of expenditure for defence and war services. However, the information will shortly be furnished privately to the honourable member. I ask honourable members to take a common-sense and realistic view of that reply: The implication is that to publish secret data as to the number of Beaufort, Beaufighter. Mustang and Lancaster aircraft ordered and the expenditure authorized and incurred thereon would in some way benefit our remaining enemy, the Japanese. Every day newspapers report raids on the mainland of Japan by upwards of 500 Super Fortress bombers, and raids on Japanese-occupied territory by carrier-borne ""aircraft. Are we seriously told that to reveal to the Australian public the relatively minute number of aircraft ordered by the Commonwealth does the Government would aid the Japanese? I am' not prepared to accept that for one moment. The only reason, on a realistic view, that can be found for the reluctance of the Government to disclose that information is that it is reluctant to disclose facts which will redound to its discredit. I have reason to believe that the expenditure on the manufacture of those aircraft greatly exceeds the amount authorized by the Government.

How will the enemy be benefited by knowing that the Go vornment has ordered a necessarily small nuaober of Lancasters, when we know that they wall not come off the production lines for another year or two? It is the same with the other types. If this Parliament is to have proper control over expenditure of public moneys the Government should readily make available to it the information on which a sound judgment can be formed. No Government is entitled to use the cloak of national security beyond the extent that the war situation legitimately requires. It is stretching the meaning of ""national security"" to improper lengths to say that disclosure of the small numbers of aircraft called for from our own factories would have a bearing on the capacity of Japan to resist. If , on a balanced judgment of the facts presented to us, we come to the conclusion that the aircraft programme is wasteful of engineering capacity and labour and materials, we should look in other directions for ways in which to use our engineering capacity. We have been told that eighteen months will elapse before we can have an Australian motor car on the roads. ""We know that most of the motor vehicles in use, even for essential purposes, are so old as to be barely roadworthy, but, despite the urgency of building our own motor vehicles, we are postponing the venture in order to carry on a programme which has gone beyond the point of real usefulness. My final words will conceit the subject of; migration, because it, too, links up with the useful expenditure of public money. The Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell) last night announced the opening in Paris to-day of an exhibition called ""Australia at ""War and at Peace"" in which he saidThe .purpose is to publicize Australia iu liberated European countries to assist migration. Apparently, public money is being expended on the furnishing of that exhibition and on labour. I would be the last to criticize any action of the Government to stimulate the migration to Australia of desirable types, but it is quite Mr Molt. clear from what we have been told by the Government and the answers to inquiries sent out by the Department of the Interior that the Government has no policy on migration in respect of Europeans. Who is to attend to inquiries at the exhibition? What policy is the Government going to announce to people who ask if they can come to Australia? Who are to be considered desirable immigrants? Last week I sent to the Department of the Interior a letter on behalf of a man of Norwegian descent living in Victoria asking whether his fiancee, a Norwegian girl, could obtain permission to come to Australia. 1 am sure that we would welcome Norwegians, who are of a very fine type. The first answer to the query was that it was regretted that the application had to be refused. Not one word of explanation! No suggestion that the lady in question was undesirable! No suggestion that there was some policy under which she ishould be excluded at present! We all know there are shipping difficulties which will delay the passage of even those authorized to come here, but it should be possible for the Government to indicate to people who wish to come here and who would be welcome that when shipping is available they shall have the opportunity. If the Government is not able to announce its policy it should devise a better official letter than is being sent to people who are making these inquiries. They are merely told that the application is refused without any indication being given of the reason for refusal. They are not told whether they should renew the application at a later date. made by a person in Australia ? living in Geelong, who is engaged to a Norwegian girl. The man referred th<? refusal to his State'parliamentary representative, who passed the case to me. 1 wrote to the Department of the Interior, and was told that the request had been refused because the Government had not yet formulated its policy for the admission of people from European countries. tive migrants in England apply if they wish to come to Australia?",40,Department Of Munitions

If the department at Canberra which deals with migration cannot inform a member of this Parliament of government policy, how can an official in London be expected to do so? While this situation exists, we are trying to stimulate interest abroad in Australia. Thornton to Paris to represent us. advocated by Mr Thornton does not commend itself to most members of this House. Presumably, that will be the policy which he will express when he goes abroad, not merely as his own but also as that of the trade unions of Australia. I do not wish to impede the passage of this bill, and I hope that later in the year we shall be able to discuss these matters in greater detail during the consideration of the budget proposals. Sufficient has been said in the course of this debate to show that the weakening of Parliament's control over public expenditure, due to large sums being grouped under secret headings because of war-time expediency, leads to a condition in which waste is almost an accepted circumstance. The war is regarded in Government circles as sufficient justification for the unprofitable use of public funds. The Parliament, if it has any self-respect, should be vigilant to safeguard the public purse. That is an historic task, which is being rapidly abandoned because the Executive is treating it casually as a mere rubber stamp. I hope that some honourable members opposite who have a sense of historic value and some regard for the part which Parliament should play in safeguarding public funds will make their own criticisms of the cases of wasteful expenditure which must have come to their notice only too frequently. request for Supply under this bill gives to us an opportunity to discuss governmental expenditure generally and to consider whether it is being carried out wisely or not. Whilst we have had opportunities to speak of government wastefulness on other occasions, we should be recreant to the trust imposed in us if we did not draw attention as often and as forcefully as possible to items of what we consider to be extravagant expenditure. In fairness to the Government, it must be conceded that war-time conditions call for lavish expenditure and therefore we can expect a decrease of efficiency iu the use of public funds. It is natural' that there should be a lack of close supervision in times of grave emergency, because the chief considerasending Mr tion is to obtain results; finance is a secondary consideration. However, most honourable members consider that the time has now come to make a close revision of government practices, in order to prevent the perpetuation of wasteful forms of administration. Representations have been made to the States, on behalf of Commonwealth departments, asking for co-operation in the continuance of special controls after the war. We must watch this trend very carefully. There is a very interesting article on this subject in to-day's issue of the Sydney Morning Herald. It is temperately worded, but very much to the point. It draws attention to a report by Mr Bradley, who was commissioned to inquire into retail shopping practice in relation to rationing problems. Mr Bradley statedI find that after two to four years' experience of war-time organization and controls (and the probability of further continuance for some time) with new departments involving new methods and working under the difficulties of war-time conditions, the time is opportune for a review of the work, organization and co-o.peration in the four following departments: Rationing, Prices, Supply and Import Procurement. Any honourable member who contradicts that statement must be completely careless of the expenditure of the taxpayers' money. We, as well as the Treasurer, are the custodians of public funds. The principle of war-time control is right, but now is the time for us to revise controls. The war position has changed, and trade will soon flow more freely from Great Britain and the Continent. Consider what is happening in Commonwealth departments. We read of numerous prosecutions of small shopkeepers by the Prices Commission.

In Canberra recently a woman conducting a small shop sold a vase for Is. above the fixed price because it happened to be the last one in stock, and she was fined £25 for doing so. Many such cases come to our notice. I do not say that the regulations governing these matters are wrong in essence, but it is wrong that numbers of men should be employed to harass small traders when there are more important jobs to be done. Tho convictions of certain coal-miners have been waived and fines which were imposed on them have not been collected. The Acting Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) was asked to-day whether miners involved in the present hold-up in New South Wales would be prosecuted. He said that tihe Government was waiting to see whether the men would go back to work to-morrow. member always condemning the Australian worker? is a newcomer, and, therefore, we suffer his interjections patiently. I am attacking the strikers, not the workers. I shall give the honourable member a little advice now, seeing that he will not be here after the next elections. I address this also to the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Bryson), who has been interjecting. If he believes in Australia and the Australian worker, he should take steps to see that the worker' is protected from the parasites who prey on him. The coal-miner would work if he were allowed to work. I should like to see all decent members of the trade unions licensed, and protected from such men as the honourable member, who will not fight those who deny to the worker the chance to earn a decent living. I repeat that the Government has important work to do. Instead of employing a large number of public servants to investigate multifarious pettifogging offences, it should concentrate on the bigger issues. Within the Department of Supply and Shipping there are all kinds of. minor departments which cause numerous delays in the handling of requests that come before them. For instance, the section dealing with machine tools and gauges is festoonod with red tape. If a person wishes to buy a certain tool, he must obtain a permit from that section, and that involves delay. That sort of control is unnecessary now, although it was necessary at the beginning of the war when there was a scarcity of equipment. Every sort of; transaction between merchants to-day must be scrutinized by some department or another, and sometimes three months elapse before permission is given for a deal to be completed. For example, a man may import some commodity which he did not stock before the war. He must apply to have a price fixed, and this involves the filling in of forms in quadruplicate or more, and the wasting of a great deal of time. This harassing of business undertakings is likely to create unemployment everywhere but in the -government departments. Although approximately 66 per cent, of; the men engaged in the building trade, one of our most important industries, have transferred to the armed forces and other war-time activities, and only 5 per cent, of them have returned to the trade, there has been an increase of 68 per cent, in government administrative departments. The time has arrived to stop this great expansion of governmental activities. Ministers should tell their departmental heads to dispense with all superfluous regulation, scrutiny, and form-filling which hamper trade. The Government must consider ways of providing employment for ex-servicemen. Any preference which these men may obtain from the Government will be of little importance if private employers are prevented from enlarging the scope of their activities. If the Government hampers small private employers, it will limit the number of opportunities for employment o£ ex-servicemen. The shopkeeper who closes his shop for hours each day because he cannot cope with the regulations which prevent him from handling certain classes of goods will not he able to employ more men. Obstacles to trade must be removed if employment is to be encouraged. Another embarrassment to trade is provided by the Division of Import Procurement, which was set up to regulate the flow of imports. This division",42,Department Of Munitions
107,Mr Fuller,Why is the honourable,43,Department Of Munitions
108,Mr White,"The honourable memberihould now be reduced to skeleton dimensions. As a matter of fact, it has .outgrown its parent, the Trade and Customs Department. I understand that it now employs more persons than does the Trade and Customs Department itself. Merchants wtho wish to import goods must send several copies of their orders to the department and seek permission to buy. What all the copies are wanted for T do not know. The department does the buying, and importers who know what costs ought to 'be tell me that they are sometimes billed for charges which the department is unable to explain. Traders who have not supplies from overseas. I have myself conveyed to the Minister complaints from small traders who did not see the advertisement in the newspapers that applications for goods had to be lodged by a certain time. Frequent complaints have been voiced regarding delays in the distribution of goods actually obtained by this department. Sometimes, goods, including textiles, have not been distributed for months after being received. This is confirmed in the Bradley report previously quoted. A further hindrance to trade exists in the necessity to obtain permits to build. I am not now referring to the Department of War Service Homes, but even for buildings for civil purposes fewer than half of some 30,000 applications have been approved. Even after approval has been obtained, the applicants must take their chance of obtaining supplies, and government departments have preference over private builders. On a previous occasion, I cited the case of the printer in a small way who wanted a stove for his office. He had been trying ever since the previous winter to obtain from the Department of Supply and Shipping an order to buy a stove. I took the matter up, and he got his permit in time to buy the stove for the following winter, but he then found that he had to start all over again to get another permit to buy the piping. This sort of thing is so crazy as to suggest Alice in Wonderland. The time is overdue for a revision of all such controls. Far from doing that, however, the Government has permitted departments to expand. The Rationing, Prices, Supply, and Import Procurement sections should be either cut down drastically, merged, or abolished. Apart from the restrictions which the Government has placed upon private trade, it has itself been responsible for grave extravagance. I quote the following from a report by the secretary of the Federated Chambers of Commerce:Price control should be revised immediately and price stabilization subsidies should be paid without amy examination of profits, the federal secretary of the Associated Chambers of Commerce, Mr Wilkins, said yesterday. Subsidies should be paid without any means test, and disallowance in whole or in part of subsidies by the Prices Commissioner should cease, Mr Wilkins said. Application of a registered are unable to get means test by reference to net profits involved inequity between individual traders. Disallowance of subsidies had forced individuals to sell goods below cost price. If a firm, hy a change of trading methods, or by the exercise of. economy, increases its profits, the Prices Commission immediately concludes that it has been guilty of profiteering, and an examination is made which results in,a serious disruption of trade. There appears to be room for investigation when criticism comes from so authoritative a source as the Federated Chambers of Commerce. I believe that a royal commission should be appointed to inquire into charges of wasteful government expenditure, including waste in the Munitions Department and in the manufacture of aircraft. Reference has been made to the manufacture of tanks. Responsibility for waste in this respect has been denied hy the Minister for Munitions ( Mr Makin), but the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) has pointed out that he criticized the project as long ago as 1942, yet the Government persisted with it . ' Now, there are rows of unfinished tanks at a place not very far from here, and not one of those tanks is capable of propelling itself. Before they would be capable of getting into action the enemy would have to come and attack them, yet £7,500,000 has been expended on their manufacture. which the honourable member was a supporter was responsible for most of that expenditure. responsible for it. I would condemn wasteful expenditure of: that kind, no",43,Department Of Munitions

110,Mr White,"I do not care who wa*matter by whom it was incurred. When complaints were made that workers at the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow were engaged in making pencil sharpeners instead of rifles and machine guns, the Minister disclaimed all knowledge of it. Then he bad the matter examined, and read a long report in which reference wa3 made to tlie manufacture of precision instruments. That sort of thing will not go down with the taxpayers. Tlhen there was the matter of the manufacture of pistole. I do not know what government was responsible for this venture, but I know that only about 400 pistols were made, and dividing that number into the difference between the capital and production expenditure on the project, and the price at which the factory and tools were eventually sold, the pistols cost about £S28 each, or, roughly, the price of a house. When that sort of waste is going on, of what use is it for Ministers to grow lyrioal in press statements about the fact that they control £100,000,000 worth of munitions factories which will be turned over in peace-time to the manufacture of civil requirements? building up of such an enormous estabment out of public money is nothing to boast about, when the people are so heavily taxed in order to provide the money. The real point to be considered is, has the money been expended wisely? The enterprise and initiative of private individuals should be given scope to proof nationalization of banking and intervide after the war the things which the community needs. Those who travel by train between Canberra and Melbourne can see near Wangaratta a wonderful factory, and .1 believe that there is a duplicate of it somewhere in New South Wales. No smoke has ever issued from any of their chimney stacks. The factories were built for the purpose of rolling rods and aluminium sheets. The aluminium ingots have not yet been produced, although the Government has allocated £3,000,000 for the establishment of the industry in Tasmania. waste when aluminium is a drug on the market. moment of panic at one time during the war about aluminium supplies, the Government proposes to embark upon this Mr White. enormous expenditure. I know that the proposal is popular with Tasmanians, because they want to "" boost"" their State, but the fact remains that Canada and the United States of America can supply us with all the aluminium we need for very much less than the cost of producing it for ourselves. For the amount of £3,000,000, which it is proposed to expend on establishing the industry in Tasmania, we could lay in a slock of aluminium that would supply our needs for many years. Repatriation ( Mr Frost) always barracks for his State, but it is a waste of time, money and labour to go ou with this project. I should like to know what was spent on the aluminium rolling factory at Wangaratta, and the other in New South Wales. I should say that the factory at Wangaratta must have cost very little less than this Parliament House, namely, about £750,000. I understand that in the electorate of Wimmera a wonderful factory has been built for The the production of petrol from wheat. It has cost about £3,000,000, but it has not produced enough petrol to take a Minister on one of his weekly jaunts from Canberra to Melbourne in a fluid-drive Chrysler. Expenditure of that kind is a stupid waste. Now the Government is proposing to embark upon a programme state air services. Probably it hopes to make the air services as efficient as the present railway service between Goulburn and Canberra. If there is anything which the Government has not yet made plans to socialize, I have no doubt that it will "" have a go"" at it as soon as possible if they hear of it. Members of the Government are not businessmen, and they are allowing themselves to be unduly influenced by enterprising departmental heads. Government departments have a habit of growing to huge dimensions. The Government is This expenditure is sheer the custodian of the. taxpayers' money, and should see that it is expended, wisely. Just because there was a Recently, I put a question on the notice-paper seeking information about the cost of manufacturing Rolls Royce engines in Australia. The Government",44,Department Of Munitions

112,Mr White,"The Minister forproposes to manufacture 100 such engines, and already £650,000 has been expended on the provision of tools and jigs. The actual production cost of the engiues has not yet been calculated, but [ believe that more than the original amount voted has been expended. Although the chief of Aircraft Production, perhaps in an unguarded moment, has informed the Government that very soon all aircraft will be fitted with jet propulsion units to the exclusion of the internal combustion engine, the Government is proceeding gaily with its project to manufacture Rolls Royee engines. 1 happen to know more about this general subject than can be said in this House, and I know that many millions of pounds have been wasted. The Government has committed itself also to the manufacture of Lancaster aircraft in Australia, and proposes to continue with the project. Why can it not obtain such aircraft from Britain now that the war in Europe is over, and fly them out here as the Americans fly aircraft to the Pacific? The Lancaster manufacturing project might very well be dropped, and the workmen diverted to more useful occupations. We know rhar we can make such aircraft here, but why should we try? T. am an enthusiast for Australian industry, but I cannot see why we should keep about 30,000 men working in the aircraft industry when there is no need to do so. Sitting suspended from li to 8 p.m. stressed that the time has come for a thorough investigation of government expenditure. I have referred to the report of Mr Bradley, KC., into certain governso. Within the last fortnight a small ment activities in relation to traders. The report exposed a serious lack of co-operation and co-ordination between government departments. Mr in some way. It is Gilbertian that such Bradley referred particularly to the Department of Supply and Shipping, the Division of Import Procurement, and the Rationing Commission. Early attention should be paid to those who are really occasioning serious loss to the community but who, hitherto, have been allowed to go unscathed. I refer in particular to those individuals who are causing industrial dislocation in New South Wales. Apparently, the Government is not prepared to visit the penalties of the law upon these individuals, but if it is to administer the affairs of the country impartially it must do so. It would seem that Ministers are quite ready to protect people who are aiding and abetting these industrial law-breakers and forcing other citizens into unemployment. Coal production is absolutely essential to the maintenance of our industrial activities. If coal production declines, serious repercussions are at once apparent in general industrial activities. It is time that the Government curtailed the operations of the Division of Import Procurement which to-day is engaging in merchandizing to a far greater extent than the needs require. This division has done good work in many ways, but the need for its activities is rapidly disappearing. Private merchants could do much more effectively and less expensively a great deal of the work that is at present being done by the Division of Import Procurement. I do not say that all controls can be abolished at once. I say that all controls should be examined to ascertain whether they are still necessary. The Directorate of War Organization of Industry recently advertised in the press that manufacturers who wished to embark upon new manufacturing activities of any kind must still obtain permits to do so. This is a great handicap to people engaged in small businesses. The larger industrial organizations can afford to send representatives to Canberra to present their case, but people carrying on small businesses cannot afford to do manufacturer was fined £5 for making an arm chair, because he had not formerly made that type or it did not conform things are happening in this country where so many are doing so little for so much.

We should give private enterprise the benefit of the doubt, and I suppose about 200,000 our people should be given the utmost freedom, to do the things that they wish to do. We should not attempt to force every activity through a government bottle-neck, such as the Division of Import Procurement. That organization is, to-day, top-heavy, and it is due for a complete overhaul, as also are other departments which I could name. De-control is necessary and urgent.

The manufacturers' of agricultural implements in Australia have advertised', as honourable members know, that farmers cannot expect full deliveries of agricultural impleis now retired from the Royal Air ments until a full re-allocation of manpower has been made. The Government should release workers not needed in munitions establishments for employment where they are badly needed. I have referred earlier to the manufacture of aluminium ingots in Tasmania. It is proposed to spend £3,000,000 on that project -I regard this as quite unwarranted expenditure. fabrication plants have been established at ""Wangaratta and. at a place in ""New South ""Wales at a cost of about £1,000,000 each, but not a rod oP aluminium has yet been rolled there. The proposal to establish this industry was made at a time when there was a scare 'because of the world shortage of aluminium, but, to-day, aluminium is practically a drug on the world's market; yet the taxpayers' money is being wasted on this enterprise. Aircraft manufacturing was begun in this country in 1937 when the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation was established. Wirraway type of machine for training purposes was produced at a fairly economic price. It is a copy of the American ETA 33. Tiger Moths were also produced by private enterprise at a fairly moderate price. In due time also Beaufort bombers were produced at a cost'of about £20,000 in excess of the English price, and they did good service, but they are now practically obsolescent. It is deplorable that the Government should proceed then with the Lancaster programme seeing that these machines could be made available by Great Britain in large numbers. The men now engaged in this work in Australia could be released for more essential jobs. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) make a good case on the subject of immigration. I understandthat an exhibition is to be opened in Paris; within the next few days with the object o'fi encouraging French people to emigrate to Australia. If the Government had a real migration policy, and if wo had the machinery available, T have no doubt that we could obtain many desirable migrants from Great Britain. I have received a letter from the wife of an Australian airman, prominent in both this war and the last war, who Force and serving with a flying air transport auxiliary in England. He desires to come to Australia with his wife and family, but when he made application at Australia House for a permit he was asked the most ridiculous questions, such as had he an Australian passport and the like. The official at Australia House said that he would grant an exit Aluminium permit to the husband for himself and his family only if the Australian Government sent a cablegram to the effect that the man was wanted to do a special job in Australia which no man here was capable of doing. The writer also said she knew of two Australians who were called up in the British Army instead of having the opportunity to join the Australian forces and who could not return. An Australian girl, who had served with the British forces, had also been trying for nearly two years to return to Australia. All of these had been given similar replies. It is almost The impossible for Australians who are in Britain to-day to secure return passages unless they have gone there only recently. This matter should be adjusted at once by an instruction to the High Commissioner. Many hundreds of young aircrew members in Bomber Command would come to Australia if they weregiven the opportunity. They have made friends with Australian air crews, and want to migrate to this country. If Australia does not make it possible for them to come here, they will go to Canada, South Africa or New Zealand. This country needs a much greater population than it has. Statisticians have estimated that, by 1955, our population will be stationary, with the death-rate and birth-rate balancing. The meagre population that we have to-day will not enable us to .hold this country against a determined aggressor. That lesson has been taught us in the present war. Our population is less than two persons to the square mile, whereas that of Britain is about 400 to the square mile. I have had a letter from, an Englishman who, at one time, lived in Australia, but is now in the Indian Army. He has informed me that he is always advocating migration to Australia, and endeavouring to induce many "" tommies "" and officers to come here. His ijommanding officer visited New Delhi to learn what Australia was doing in regard to the migration of British troops to this country after the war, but the High Commissioner could not give any definite information. At Australia House there is a long list of Britishers who have made inquiries with a view to migrating to this country. The Government is lax in not enunciating a policy. Of course, the problem of repatriation is prominent in its mind, and rightly is given precedence. But there should be planning for future migration. We could obtain both adult and child Britishers. Let Australian towns adopt people from British towns. I saw in Coventry huge quantities of clothing that had been sent from Melbourne in the days of the worse disaster which the people of that city had experienced and there is much affection there for the Australian city that helped them. British towns only need to be assured that Australian, towns will take into their community a given number of people, and help them to settle down, and I am quite -sure that those people would come here. There should be a short-term policy for immediate migration, and a long-term policy embracing suggestions of that kind. I mentioned at the outset of my remarks that this bill, which covers every Commonwealth department, should be carefully scrutinized. and departmental head should so organize the departments as to make economies wherever they can be effected. Auditor-General has made strong comments concerning wasteful expenditure. 1 have not read his report, because it has not been circulated, but I have read newspaper excerpts from it. He has paid particular attention to munitions, factories, and has stated that large numbers of men in them are not doing any work. That is not the fault of the men; if the work is not given to them to do, they have no choice in the matter. But it will be the fault of the administration if those conditions are allowed to continue. Mr White. Nor is it fair to the taxpayer, who is the most heavily burdened in the world, that he should be asked to provide revenue to keep men in idleness, when industry and food production are undermanned. The Government should not incur any expenditure on Mr Thornton's visit overseas, as it did on the last occasion. -The honourable member's time ha; expired. [8.20J -This is an occasion when one can discuss almost any subject. I shall make a selection from the large number of grievances which one could parade with a good deal of justification, had one the time and the inclination. I refer, first, to the most unsatisfactory manner in which questions are dealt with by Ministers. A fortnight ago, .1 asked a question in regard to the compulsory dipping of cattle in the Northern Territory, for consignment to the Adelaide market. Fourteen or fifteen day* have elapsed, yet I have no reply to send to my correspondents, indicating to them what is the will of the Commonwealth Government. upon notice? matter was raised on the motion for adjournment, and a Minister promised that he would have it investigated immediately, yet so far nothing has transpired. The matter .may have been settled. If it has been, I have not been informed and am, therefore, not able Every Minister to advise the cattle owners in the Northern Territory, on whose behalf 1 made representations, as to what they The should do. The second matter that I raised on' the same day relates to the action of the Army in forcing people at Katherine to purchase a quantity of margarine with the butter ration to which they are entitled under the rationing law of the Commonwealth. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) promised a hasty inquiry, and gave quite a satisfactory assurance. But good words have not been followed by deeds of any sort up to date. I assure the Minister for the Army, on whose behalf the Minister",47,Department Of Munitions

119,Mr Archie Cameron,"Th espoke, that if such a matter came before rue as a Minister and I did not have an answer within 72 hours, somebody would he looking for a job. 0 Another matter has been under consideration for a fortnight. I had not raised it previously in this House, although 1 had approached the Minister in regard to it. I refer to the complete absence of food supplies at Borroloola, near the Gulf of Carpentaria. After fifteen days, I took the matter up with the Minister for Supply and Shipping (""Senator Ashley), and was informed in a brief note that I received last night that, despite the fact that the wireless message sent to nie yesterday stated that these people are completely out of food, the steamers belonging to the John Burke Company are not running. Apparently, therefore, the whole universe has to stop revolving. I hope to have better advice to-morrow. These people live in out-of the-way parts. The Government, by its own acts-the wisdom of'which I am not questioning at present-ha s prevented the running of normal services. On that account, its obligation is greater to ensure that people in out-of-the-way parts who I-PIV on such services shall receive that to which they are entitled.' I have another ""gem"". About a fortnight ago, 1. mentioned the failure of the Prices Commissioner to determine the prices at which certain utility vehicles should be sold in Australia. I pointed out. that those utilities were in two classes. I. want to raise shortly. If I cannot They were brought to Australia by arrangement with the British Government, to assist in the production of food. I have received letters from persons who have tried to purchase them; they say that they are not able to stand up to the conditions that have been laid down. A man whose avocation is in the stock industry in Victoria determined that he must have a car of some sort. He has been obliged to pay £467 for a small English utility of war-time manufacture and to sign an undertaking that he will pay any additional amount which the Prices Commissioner may fix. I stated recently that, judging by information I had received from men in the trade, I believed that the Government contemplates a loss of from £150 to £200 on each of these motor vehicles. I take no exception io the excellent statement of the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Beasley), who is not responsible for the administration in this matter, that information on the subject would be supplied to me. To-day, I received from the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator Keane) a letter which 3tntedIn the firBt instance, some delay ' was occasioned toy the difficulty in obtaining final costs from overseas. Negotiations have taken place with the United Kingdom Government regarding prices and an announcement a±\ to ultimate prices will be made as soon as the United Kingdom Government has furniivbed its reply to our latest representations. That does not tell me anything. It does not tell the prospective buyer anything. It does not tell the man who has paid a few hundred pounds down and has given a blank cheque for the remainder of the price, what he is to do. It does not enable the merchants, some of whom have 50 of these vehicles in their show windows, to tell the inquiring public what the price is to be. I can merely assume that the Commonwealth Government has imported, as a government venture, no fewer than 2,500 vehicles, and does not know what price it has to pay for them in the United Kingdom. If that is an example of government in business, I hope that we shall have less of it. I trust that before long I shall have definite answers to questions of this description. I could add to those that I have mentioned. There are others that obtain answers, I shall have to move an adjournment motion in order to focus public attention on what is being done. Some acts of administration would tax the patience of Job; even his patience broke down finally. I do not profess to be quite so patient as that Biblical character. There are conditions which demand urgent ministerial attention. Apparently, that attention has not been given. One of the most important matters that will have to be considered in the post-war period is the defence establishment in the Commonwealth. 1 refer to this matter for the reason that, not long ago, the right honourable member for Eremantle ( Mr Curtin), as Prime Minister, made in this House a certain statement and moved "" That the paper be printed"". I understand that he gave an undertaking to the Opposition that, in due course, and not very far ahead, an opportunity would be afforded for a debate. much talk on other matters. sume that the Minister is referring to certain matters in which the interest of -the Government has been greater than it has been in the future defence of Australia. I should not be in the least surprised, in view of the slight interest that it the earnest consideration of all service had in the defence of Australia until it had assumed office. We are being driven speedily into an almost impossible position in relation to defence. In San Francisco, there is an important international conference, the results of which must affect the foreign policy of Australia and must impose upon the Commonwealth certain obligations or certain restrictions, or both simultaneously, in international affairs. Before the Australian delegation went to San Francisco, I pointed out that the members of it were not informed of Australian public opinion; that they were leaving without any debate having taken place in the House of Representatives or the Senate, although they should have an indication of the view of the Parliament on these matters. They will be no better informed as to the view of the Parliament when they return than they were when they went away. I have read as much of the proceedings as I have been able to read. They seem to have been rather peculiar. It would appear that the stage has been fairly well dominated by the intellectual and ex-judicial colossus from the front treasury bench, but to what degree I do not know. Whether it will be as Robert Burns said, "" for Britain's guid -for her destruction "", I do not know, but I have very grave doubts whether even the Curtin Government knows to what the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) is committing Australia at San Francisco. very loquacious Minister for External Affairs. Outside the opening speech by the Deputy Prime Minister( Mr Forde), whose speech, I think, was not his own, we have not heard from him. But what they have agreed to, and the Lord only knows what it is, will seriously affect the defence set-up of the Commonwealth of Australia after the war. In addition, the defence set-up will be seriously affected by tactical and other lessons learned a3 been too the result of operations in which we have been engagedat sea, on the land and in the air over the last five and a half years. These matters Will require the most serious consideration of this House. In fact, on this matter, I think the speech of the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) last night deserves Ministers, and certainly the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman). The first thing that has to be decided is whether the post-war defence system is to be oast into three separate and almost watertight, thought-tight and contact-tight departments of the Navy, the Army, and Air. Experience in this war has shown once again the necessity for the closest collaboration between all arms of the services, each having its own role, which it can play better than can either of the other two, but, nevertheless, none of them able for very long to perform its role independent of the assistance and co-operation of the others. But, as things stand and have stood since thfi war began, the head of the services is a civilian, not >a serviceman at all. I hope that the chief of ' the combined staffs in the post-war defence set-up, the man selected to shoulder the responsibility of advising the Commonwealth Government, will, at any rate, be a man with personal, practical service experience in the command, of the forces of one of, the three arms. The more experienced he is in contact with the other two arms the better it will be. Mixed up with this are not only the considerations to which I refer momentarily, but also considerations of internal policy. Whether the Labour party is to revert to the policy that it espoused when it took office in 1941, or whether it is to lay down, as it is laid down now by this Government, We have a that every able-bodied man in the Commonwealth shall be liable for military service overseas, is a question which will require some resolution on the part of the Labour party if it is to remain in control of the treasury bench when the war ends. None of us can say when that",49,Department Of Munitions
120,Mr Lazzarini,There has,51,Department Of Munitions
121,Mr Archie Cameron,"I prewill be, but we hope that it will be very soon. Those are a few passing thoughts which I put into the minds ofi Cabinet Ministers. Before closing, I have a few words to say about the position that will inevitably face the Government as the result of its failure to deal with -demobilization in a practical and realistic way. Every one of us has a certain amount of correspondence arising out of requests for releases from the forces. Those releases are chiefly asked for on agricultural grounds, namely, that the men, if released, will be employed -on the production of food; but, in my experience, other important grounds are buildings and repairs, and the taking over of businesses which have been run for a number of years by men who came -out of retirement to enable younger men to go into active service. I think that, in -certain quarters, there is a hold-up. I am not quite sure where it is, but I have my own ideas, having had some association with one of the armed services. Once you set up an armed service, there is a ten-deney on the part of those in charge of it, to hate like poison the thought of allowing any man to go outside their control. Matters concerning the strength of the armed forces are matters, not for the service chiefs, but for the Government. I have a strong suspicion that, in too many instances, individual Ministers and the Government collectively have not taken a firm, stand in regard to the laying down of conditions that the country is entitled to expect. We went through a crisis in 1942, and to a certain degree in 1943, but no reasonable man could say that last year this country was faced with any likelihood of invasion, let alone any likelihood of imminent invasion. It was not even a remote possibility from the time that certain conquests took place to the north. UnlessI am hopelessly incorrect, we have scattered round the coast of Australia all sorts of defence installations, manned by men, and, in some cases, women, who have no more hope of rendering service in the defence of Australia than they would have if they were located at the South Pole. I see no sign of the Government taking a stand on these matters and insistintr that spTvif«»« --ndnndant to the defence of Australia shall go out of existence. The policy enunciated by the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) only yesterday docs not contain that assurance and does not contain any implication upon which one could found such an assurance. It said that men would be released who had seen certain service or were required for certain civil occupations. Let us consider the proposal for the release of men with five years' service. I understand that the obstacle believed to exist is the withdrawal of those men from forward areas. 1. was a member of an infantry battalion in 1918 when word came to France that men. with four years' service were to be withdrawn, and they were withdrawn whether in the line or not. battles of the whole war. They were ordered to report back to head-quarters. That happened time after time. Wheni t was decided, that officers and non-commissioned officers were . needed to train recruits they were ordered to train recruits regardless of whether their units were in the line or not. A sergeant-major of mine was ordered on the 19th December at 8 p.m. on the eve of the attack on Polygon Wood, one of the biggest "" scraps "" in which the Australian Imperial Force ever took part, to return to the south of England for training purposes. Notwithstanding that his unit was to be in the thick of the fighting nothing could be done about it and he just had to go back. The position now is that if a man is in a forward area, nothing can be done about it and he just has to stop there. If the state of affairs in forward areas is such that the commanders have not sufficient reinforcements to take the place of such men, something is radically wrong with the High Command. I would not care how many badges he wore or how much red tape he had round his hart, if any officer came to me and said that the exigencies of the military situation did not allow it, I , as one with a low military rank who has seen these things take place, as has the honourable member for Corangamite, another infantry man, would soon let him know otherwise. We who have seen these things say that if the Government is determined that this can be done, it can",51,Department Of Munitions
122,Mr Abbott,During the biggest,52,Department Of Munitions
123,Mr Archie Cameron,"Yes.be done. I have had letters from the fathers of men who went from, my electorate early in the war to England as members of the 9th Division and are somewhere in the north now. If the Government desires to carry out that policy, it can be carried out, and, if certain men in charge say it cannot be done, there is one effective way of dealing with the situation, and I do not need Co go too deeply into that. In regard to agriculture let me tell the ""War Cabinet that we are facing a food crisis, the like of which no Australian Government has ever faced since the days of Macquarie in New .South Wales. Owners have had to kill off poultry because of lack of wheat. Ministers may quote any confounded statistics they like, but men like me, cattle-owners in dairy districts, know how many cows and calves are going to the slaughteryards. reared. Herds are not being kept up to strength. These things are cumulative whether they exist in dairying or fruit, production. We know how orchards have slipped back back because pruning and cultivation have not be carried out. Poultry runs, piggeries, dairies, vegetable gardens-all problem will come to a head before very long. The only remedy is for the Government to give up its tardy policy in regard to releases. For once, let it be on top and lay down the man-power policy that the circumstances of the country require. Ministers are the men who conduct war; they decide what Navy, Army or Air Force shall be raised. If the Government is doing its job, the War Cabinet decides what campaigns shall be conducted. That is not the responsibility of service chiefs. Ministers to tell nie that this lion, that lion or this leopard is in the path. The responsibility is on them and no one else. I warn the Government that when the day comes when the shortage of food can no longer be hidden, excuses can no longer be given and seasonal conditions no longer be blamed, we on this side shall have a little more to say. Bountiful rains are falling in many of the drought stricken parts of Australia, and the prospects for a good season are reasonable. Grass at any rate will be plentiful, whatever the effect of the rain may be on Sir. Archie Cameron. sown crops. Once those conditions apply the Government will find that, as irr. politics, good seasons make good governments, so, in food matters, shortages in good seasons make thundering bad governments. The Government will have to answer next year. It will be called to account. It will have a ticklish task in giving an account. We have had statements galore, torrents of words. If we had had as much rainfall last year as we had words, there would have been no drought and no food shortage, but,, unfortunately, that is not so. I do not intend to say anything more at ithemoment, because I believe that certain matters may come up in committee. 1 leave it at that in the hope that the things I have said have penetrated the minds of the responsible Ministers.

124,Mr Fadden (Darling Downs,"""provided by the Commonwealth Government to Mr Thornton on another -occasion, when public money was expended in order that he could attend, as the accredited representative of the Labour movement in Australia, a con'ference from which he only recently returned. It will be necessary for Mr Thornton to have a passport, and this w ill involve certain clerical work in the Department of the Interior. It will also be necessary for him to satisfy the Taxation Commissioner that he has paid :all taxes due by him, and this will involve a certain amount of governmental expenditure, which will be provided' from funds proposed to be supplied under this bill. -of the Acting Attorney-General( Mr Beasley) Thornton's trip abroad will necessitate -certain expenditure by the Attorney General's Department. consistent with the forms of Parliament, in which I can protest against Mr Thornton being sent overseas to represent the Australian trade union movement is by the means which I have adopted. It is important that Australia should be adequately represented overseas, and it is essential that the Australian Labour movement, in particular, should be represented by a man whose views are those of a majorit y of members of the trade unions. On the authority of the Acting Attorney-General, wo know that Mr Thornton cannot possibly represent a general consensus of Labour opinion. Also, we have evidence of a protest against Mr Thornton's selection made by tlie Australian Workers Union, one of the most powerful trade unions in Australia, which stands foursquare for arlbitration and conciliation as opposed to the revolutionary methods of the Communist party, with which Mr Thornton is so actively associated. It is vital, not only in the interests of the Labour movement, but also in the interests of our national integrity, that the man sent abroadto represent Australia at this important conference should hold' views and principles in harmony with those of the average Australian worker. The Acting Attorney-General has said that Mr Thornton, by his outspoken opposition to the White Australia policy, has disqualified himself from the right to represent the trade unions of Australia. Thi3 is what the Minister said, according to the Sydney Morning Herald of the 18th JuneWarning the annual conference of the Australian Labour party yesterday that if there svas to be a "" new order"" there must be discipline, the Vice-President of tlie Executive Council, Mr Beasley. said: ""You must not think that because , you have a Labour (lovernnicnt vou can do as you damn well like"". Mr Beasley bitterly attacked .the Commmiists without actually naming them, and said he was amazed that Mr Thornton, who had criticized the White Australia policy, should be selected to represent Australian workers at the Trade Union Council Congress Furthermore, if the statements abroad. The honourable gentleman also said'are to be credited, Mr Recently, they had had an attack on the White Australia policy. It amazed him that the man who made these utterances should The only way, be selected to represent the Australian worker* at a trade union congress abroad. Such an appointment would put Labour men and women in a bad light in the eyes of their fellow unionists in other parts of the world. If it had not been for the White Australia policy, the Japanese would have been able to infiltrate into the country as they had done elsewhere. Because of the White Australia policy they did not have to fight an enemy in their roar: they were able to go forward and do the job. According to to-day's issue of the Sydney Morning Herald, the Acting Attorney General also made the following further comments:Speaking particularly of the White Australia policy, Mr Beasley asked "" in whose corner"" Mr Thornton was going to be, if the views of the Australian Labour movement .clashed with the views of the international communism, to which Mr Thornton, was one of the senior Australian apostles? "" It is opportune that Mr Thornton should talk of fifth columnism in trying to evade the inevitable consequences of having shown his party's full anti-Australian hand on the White Australia policy,"" Mr Beasley said. During the war two major pieces ot attempted fifth colnmnism in this country have been the work of the Communist party, and in each of them Mr Thornton has been the party's eager spearhead. These facts cannot be denied or ignored. Every member of this Parliament has a responsibility to ensure that public money, which represents contributions fro m the earnings and savings of the people, shall not be dissipated: in sending overseas a man whose activities at all times are opposedto tlie general therefore, must set about preparations for desires of the average Australian citizen. does This is what Mr J.

That was a. month ago. Why should the taxpayers of Australia pay the fare of a revolutionary to attend a congress in London, when he is the representative of a party which is the enemy of democracy?

The citadel will be stormed under the banners of liberty and democracy; and once the apparatus of power is in the bauds of hrotherhood, all opposition, all contrary '-unions, must he extinguished by death. Democracy is but a tool to bo used and afterwards broken. Thornton is the representative of such an organization, and honourable members opposite must be familiar with its machinations, and must know how Communists have infiltrated into trade Unions and captured key positions. They have even entered the schools and universities, where they are poisoning the minds of the young by indoctrinating them with alien ideas. Questions have also been asked about the proposal to send representatives from Australia to a youth organization congress abroad. That, of course, is nol connected with the present matter, but the Government should adopt towards it the same attitude as towards the representative of the trade union movement. It should refuse to issue travel permits and priorities. It should insist that if this man goes to the conference, he goes for what he is, and is not sponsored by the Commonwealth Government, nor paid for by it. Minister for Labour and National Service) [9.8] -Whethe r or not there is any merit in this amendment, it is well that we should know exactly what we are talking about, and that we should have in our minds a clear idea of what we are being asked to vote for. It is generally known that, some time ago, an invitation was received from Sir Walter Citrine and Mr Walter Bevin to send trade union representatives to an international trade union congress in London. The Commonwealth Government recognized that; the purpose of the conference was a good'o one, namely, to promote united action, among allied nations with a view to ensuring a better war effort. It wasdecided to accept the invitation from the British Labour movement, which wasworking hand in. hand with the .British two delegates, and we told the trade unions in Australia that we would pay,, not all their expenses, but their fares.. that representatives would be sent. Nodecision has been made as to who the representatives would be. Eveutually the representatives were chosen according to the methods laid down in the Versailles Treaty for the selection of delegates to the conference of the International: Labour Office. At first the British Government had it in mind to invite delegates from neutral countries, but it wasfinally decided to receive delegates only from allied nations. As I have said,., when the Government agreed to pay thefares of the delegates it was not known, who the delegates would be. I do not suggest that it would have mattered, at that stage if we had known. Something has arisen since then. All we knew was that the delegates would beelected from, and by, the largest industrial organizations in the country, in. accordance with the principle laid down for the International Labour OfficeYears ago, the Bruce-Page Government tried to depart from this principle, and to exercise a veto in respect to the delegates chosen. When I was sent to Geneva, we had to defy the Bruce-Page Government on this point. At the same conference of the International Labour Office,, the Japanese delegates asked the international labour group not to accept their credentials as a protest against the action of the Japanese Government in choosing: the delegates rather than allowing themto be chosen by Labour organizations.. All that the Government did in this case' is to give its blessing to the proposal to send representatives of the Australian trade union movement to the congress in London.

The first question I ask is: Does the Government give an assurance that no fares or expenses of any kind will be met for this man by the Australian Government? If that question is answered with a resounding "" no"" then the amendment becomes utterly necessary. member would be very glad, for he could make some political capital out of it. this: If the Government does not propose to meet his fares or expenses, does it give the assurance that no overseas currency will be provided for him by o: through the Treasury?-because , as appeared to-day at question time, no man can go abroad on a task of this kind unless he is able to have funds in dollars, sterling, or whatever the overseas currency may be; and he cannot have that without the permission of the Treasury of this country, unless, of course, it is found for him by somebody outside Australia. The question is very simple: Does the Ciovernment give the assurance that no such provision will be made? for the Government to decide? mean to tell me that that is a matter which the Government ought to decide in secret, and which ought not to be communicated to tlie Australian people? cated at the proper time. which the Australian people are to be heard. This is the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. All of U3 veyresent scores of thousands of Australians. If there is one place in which these questions may legitimately be put and properly answered it is the Parliament of Australia. vernment would choose the time. perfectly well, because he has had a long experience iu both the industrial movement and the Commonwealth Parliament, that if the Government does not propose to meet the expenses or iprovide the financial facilities to which I have referred, it can quite easily say "" no "" ; and if that be done, and it is added to the repudiation of Mr Thornton's capacity to represent the trade union movement, offered this morning by one Minister, then at least the position will be clarified to that degree. Buti f the Government says, "" We shall consider that matter at the proper time. We are not disposed to tell you people in Parliament what we are going to do about it "" , then the people of Australia will come to the conclusion that Mr Ernest Thornton is going abroad to represent the Australian trade union movement, to some degree at the expense of the Australian taxpayers. It is no use our imagining that the Australian trade union movement is a negligible body.. There is not one honourable member opposite who would not say at once that it is a very great association of organizations. Erom their point of view, it is the greatest and most representative body of men that is to be found in Australia. And the man who represents it in. the eye of the world at a world conference is going to be regarded as the Australian representative. If Australia is to be represented abroad by a man whose activities have been subversive, by one who looks forward to revolution, and does not even speak the same language as the genuine members of the industrial movement of Australia, then it will be the Government's responsibility. This is not a matter of building up a man who is negligible, and giving to him publicity that he would not otherwise achieve. Wc might have considered at one time that the Communist movement in Australia was negligible. But no man, and certainly no trade unionist, can have doubt any longer that the Australian Communist movement is the enemy not only of Australia, but also of the genuine Labour party and of genuine industrial activity for industrial ends. I have put my two questions. All that I desire is to have a clear answer to them. In the light of those answers, the Parliament and the people of Australia will be able to judge. -With the ""soft answer that turneth away wrath"", the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) appeared to smooth the ruffled feelings of the committee.

163,Mr Harbison (Wentworth) [9.35].,"mentioned Sir Walter Citrine in connection with a previous conference of trade unions in London. I remind him that at that conference a remark was made to Sir Walter Citrine, or alternatively it was made to him privately, that might have a hearing on the Government's refusal to give an undertaking that it will not pay any of the expenses of Mr Thornton, or make sterling available to him. Mr Thornton remarked to Sir Walter Citrine, "" The unions are not controlled by the governments, but the governments are controlled by the unions "". dent of the Executive Council( Mr break, the Communists should seek to Beasley) has quoted Mr Thornton as having said that the Government had to be careful, otherwise the unions would withdraw their support from it. Possibly because these statements are true, there is an absence of eagerness on the part ofi honourable members opposite to engage in this debate. The Minister assisting the Treasurer ( Mr Lazzarini) accused the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) of having given prominence to this man. A senior Minister, and not the Leader of the Australian Country party, (first gave prominence to Mr Thornton in this connection. It is rather significant that the Vice-President of the Executive Council was at one time the Leader of the Non-Communist party in this chamber. It would appear that he is running true to form. Perhaps the evasion of the Minister assisting the Treasurer, who was not a member of the JTon-Communist party, indicates a desire to defend the Communists. man is telling an untruth. asked for are given, the matter will end. The Government paid the fares of Mr When he was asked whom he meant, Thornton when he last attended a trade union conference abroad, and if it is not prepared to assure honourable members that it will not use public funds to pay his expenses on the present occasion, we shall be entitled to suspect that it intends to do so. of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) has informed the committee that this man approached as close as was possible to treason at the beginning of the present war. If the money of the taxpayers is to be used to send abroad such a man to represent Australian trade unionism, the Government will have a heavy accounting to make for its misuse of public funds. It seems to be poetic justice that the Communist party should challenge the Government as it has done. The object of the amendment is to give to the Government the opportunity to state its position in regard to that body, which was banned by the Menzies Government, and released from the ban Iby the present Administration. It is significant that, having been given that fortunate bite the hand that lifted from their shoulders the burden of being declared an unlawful organization. The matter should be placed in proper perspective. I have no doubt that those who succeed us will be interested to see how such matters were determined by a Labour Government. I quote from the Sydney Morning Herald of the 5th June a portion of a report headed "" Attack on 'White Australia' Policy""Criticising tlie "" White Australia."" policy, Mr E. Thornton, national secretary, toad the national conference of the Federated Iron workers Union yesterday that no working class organization could tolerate discrimination based on colour or religion. . . .

The Sydney Morning Herald of the 7th June reported the Vice-President of the Executive Council in these termsThe Acting Attorney-General, Mr Beasley, said to-night that in his attack on Monday on the White Australia policy the general secretary of the Federated Iron workers Association, Mr K. Thornton, displayed a. basic iion-Australianisan, which was not however, surprising when it was encountered in Mr Thornton. Yet that man has been selected to represent Australian trade unionism overseas! It wild be recalled that when he previously went abroad on a similar mission lie Was responsible for the invitation that was issued to enemies of the Allies to attend the conference. Although he has been challenged by the Vice-President of the Executive Council on account of his "" basic non-iAustralianism "", he is to have bis fares paid by the present Government or at least will have sterling made available to him.

It seems to me that a lot of honourable members can and do understand how he can represent Labour as a whole. Continuing, Mr Thornton saidMr Beasley says we had no f if t h column 'ir enemy in the rear in this country. We did, but it was composed of some Germane, some Italians, and some Australians, who wer«"" violently anti-Communist-as Hitler was. They shared Mr Beasley's views in this respect, anyhow.

The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) read extracts regarding Mr Thornton's views, and that is what is involved in this amendment. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN OrderI What is involved in this amendment, is the question of Mr Thornton's views on the White Australia policy, and his "" fifth column "" activity. Russia is not involved in any degree. involves Mr Thornton's views on the White Australia policy, and, whether we agree or disagree, he has the democratic right, as well as the honesty and courage, to express' those views. That is what is involved. It is wrong to try to deprive him of his right to express his views. The White Australia policy affects millions of Asiatics, among whom are our allies, Honourable members opposite are prepared to raise any issue, racial or religious, to split the workers of this country. Australia's right to maintain that policy We are trying to create goodwill with our allies, but the intolerance, suspicion and mistrust that honourable gentlemen opposite are creating may bring about a situation similar to that which caused this war. I very strongly support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden). The two speeches made by Ministers in reply to the right honourable gentleman were the most astounding that I have heard in [117] this chamber. The issue is not Mr Thornton's work as a Communist, but the fact that the Labour Government is permi tting to go overseas to represent the Australian trade union movement a man who, on the evidence of the Vice-President of the Executive Council( MT . TSeasley), has twice been guilty, during the war, of acts which he, in a kindly way, described as the acts of a fifth columnist, but which history will judge as the acts of a traitor to his country in its hour of direst peril. In 1940, when Great Britain's fortunes were at their nadir, and when the Empire was the only bulwark standing between the forces of Germany, Italy, and Japan, and the rest of the world, Mr Thornton, at a trade union conference in Sydney, moved an amendment which would have taken away the support of those unions from the war effort of the Empire, paralyzed Australia's war effort, and reduced our capacity to assist Russia when it was later attacked by Germany. That was his first act of treachery to the country which he has adopted as his home. As the Acting Attorney-General( Mr Beasley) said, in answer to a question which I asked earlier to-day, that is past history. The second act of treachery to Australia, as the Minister pointed out, is a very recent one. It was his betrayal of that principle which alone can maintain the integrity and living standards of Australian workers and prevent this country from disappearing in a yellow sea, a principle to which all true Australians subscribe-the White Australia policy. When this subject was under discussion at the United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco, was in the balance, as it has been before. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) pointed out recently that he had to fight with all his energies to convince the assembly of the League of Nations that it was essential that Australia should maintain that policy. Australia is a small and weak country, and it cannot maintain this vital policy without the support of the rest of the Empire. At the very moment when its fate hung in the balance at San Francisco, Mr Thornton brought",63,Department Of Munitions

174,Mr Abbott (New England) [9.59].,"out his declaration that the ""White Australia policy should be abandoned. As the Acting Attorney-General rightly pointed out, he is a traitor to his country. submits the most specious and plausible This man is to be the representative of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, the most powerful trade union organization in the Commonwealth, and he is the president of the Iron workers and Munition Makers Unions. His appointment was backed by all the prestige of those important positions. The Minister for Home Security( Mr Lazzarini) complained that we were giving to him a prominence which he did not deserve. Nothing that I or any other honourable member can say would give him any more importance than that already given to him by virtue of his position in tlie trade union movement. He is to be sent to Europe to express Australia's point of view at the International Conference of Trade Unions. He is bound to no policy, he has denounced the White Australia ideal, and he gives complete loyalty to an un-Australian organization. Nothing bhat we can say can add to his importance. Both Ministers who have spoken on this motion salved their consciences, and, like another gentleman, Pontius Pilate, they washed their hands of the affair, and said that Mr Thornton would not go abroad as the representative of the Australian Government. They admitted, that on a previous occasion, a part of his expenses had been paid by the Government, but they said that on this occasion his fares might or might not be paid by the Government. The point was not clarified. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) said that Mr Thornton, because he had been chosen according to section 13 of some convention signed at Versailles at the time of the Peace Treaty, had been elected according to law as Australia's representative, and that ipso facto, the' Government must give every facility to Mr Thornton to enable him to go abroad as the representative of the Australian trade unions. not been asked to give assistance yet. knows that the Government will be asked. The honourable gentleman has a charming personality. He is suave and his manner is delightful. His voice is never raised above a normal pitch. But he arguments that I have ever heard in this chamber. He did not say that facilities would not be made available to Mr Thornton. He merely said that the Government had not been asked to make them available. We know that it will be asked, and we know what its answer will be, if it runs true to its previous form. It will make every possible facility available to Mr Thornton to enable him to attend the conference in Paris. Another point made by the Minister was that the selection of the union's representative had nothing to do with the Government. I say that the Government should be closely concerned with the choice of a representative to express the views of the Australian working people at such an important conference as that which will be held in Paris in September. I am not unsupported in my views, because the central executive of the Australian Workers Union, at a meeting in Sydney on the 19 th June, resolved unanimouslyPublic utterances of Mr Thornton showed that his views on working class philosophy and policies were diametrically oppoBed to those of the Australian Labour movement and the majority of Australian unions. Mr Thornton was not a fit and proper person to represent, and, in fact, could not represent Australian unionists at the conference or any oversea trade union talks. On the evidence submitted by the Acting Attorney-Oeneral, this man is a traitor to his country. In effect he is not one whit better than the man who is being tried for treason in London at the present time, "" Lord Haw Haw "". Why should Mr Thornton be permitted by the elected Government of the people to leave the country in order to make treacherous and wickedly harmful statements to the detriment of the Australian people? If Mr Thornton goes overseas as the representative of the trade unionists of Australia, who number over 1,000,000, he will speak with a voice of great authority. If he utters at that conference statements such as he has made in this country with regard to the White Australia policy, his words will be seized upon by every representative of the coloured nations and of coloured workers of the",64,Department Of Munitions

[10.24] -The Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) has given an undertaking that the Government will not use public money to defray the expenses of Mr Thornton on his trip overseas. It puts us in a position different from that disclosed by the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) who admitted that on the previous occasion the Government had given an open cheque to certain people who went abroad on certain missions. He said that the Government had agreed to pay half of the expenses of delegates on {hose missions, but did not know, and did not care, who the delegates would be. I am amazedat the attitude adopted by the honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan). He reminds me of the man who was washed up on the shores of a cannibal island and, entering into a discussion with the cannibal chief, said, "" I believe in democracy. I admit that you represent the majority. I am in a minority, but even if you do not agree with me, I have the right to express my views; and you, being in the majority, have a perfect right to carry out your policy"". Under that system we know what the end of the honourable member would be on a cannibal island, and we know what will be the end of the Labour party in its association with Mr Thornton. Sooner or later the Government must recognize certain principles with respect to overseas delegations, particularly as these delegations are becoming more numerous and are being arranged for all sorts of purposes. The first is that any public money expended in respect of such delegations must be expended in terms of the Constitution. Parliament has the right to expend It has no other legal or moral right to expend public money.

198,Mr Harrison (Wentworth) [10.40j.,"Apparently, Mr Pellow, Acting Production Manager of the Coal Commission, was to he appointed Controller of Millfield Colliery. This, of course, was not asked for by the deputies. The action was taken by the Government in order to placate persons who had broken the law, and it is in accord with the weak-kneed policy of this Government. The mine owners did not break the law, yet the Government goes out of its way to appease the workers! The result has been, of course, that the leaders of the men have said, ""Boys, the Government is on the run. We have got more than we asked for. Let us not wait until the matter comes before the tribunal. It cannot decide in our favour, because the management had the right to suspend Wilson. The finding of Mr Justice Cantor showed that that is so. Therefore, let us strike again immediately, for, of course, the Government will settle the matter out of court in the usual way as soon as pressure is put upon it and Wilson will be reinstated "". That is exactly what happened. Everything that Judge Cantor said, and what the Acting Prime Minister himself has said, proves that the management was right in the action which it took; yet the Government continues the policy of appeasement which it laid down in the early days of its term of office. At present 24 mines are idle, and 20,000 tons of coal is being lost each day. The Acting Prime Minister admitted in his statement to-day that the deputies had broken the law and were liable to prosecujudiciary, and the actions of Ministers in tion; but the Government will not prosecute. These men have been off work since last Wednesday, yet the Government proposes to wait and see what further action the men will take before it decides what its course will be. The case against the miners is clear. The management of the mine acted within the law, but the mine was taken over by the Government; the deputies acted outside the law and have not been prosecuted. They are being given another chance. Notwithstanding the Government's intervention, they are on strike, and will remain on strike because of the Government's weakness. If the strike continues, notwithstanding the statement by the Acting Prime Minister, will these men be prosecuted? I do not think that they will. Already they have been on strike for four working days during which production of coal amounting to 80,000 tons has been lost. That is the price that the Government has to pay for its policy of appeasement. At one time, 80,000 tons of coal might have assumed gigantic proportions in the eyes of the people of this country, but it is a mere bagatelle compared with the tonnage that has been lost this year. During 1945, 800,000 tons of coal, or an average of 34,800 tons a week, has been lost to industry through disputes on the coal-fields. The position is much worse than it was last year, when the average weekly loss was 30,000 tons. Last year there were certain small reserves of coal, but to-day 'there are practically no reserves. The Coal Commissioner said this morning that gas rationing would be introduced in Sydney on Friday unless the miners resumed work immediately. It is only a step from gas rationing to the rationing of electricty, which may result in a hold-up of vital war industries. I deplore the growing practice of this Government of encouraging the flouting of the law by militant trade unions. This weakness is bringing about a state of industrial chaos and anarchy, as the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) himself admitted. Such action in time of war can only be described as treasonable. I warn the Government that statements made in this chamber and elsewhere by responsible Ministers criticizing the interfering with the course of lawI refer particularly to the now famous Commonwealth railways case in which certain directions were given to Mr Gahan, and to the overriding of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in the Connolly case-ca n result only in the complete destruction of the democratic system, which, of course, is the objective of the Communists. The Government, in effect, is supporting the Communists by permitting courts and other democratic institutions of this country to be brought into disrepute and held to ridicule. It is time that this flouting of the law was regarded seriously. Knowingly or unknowingly, the Government is playing into the hands of the Communists. Either the law must be supreme or we /shall rever.t to the law of the tooth and the claw, which is the law of the jungle a state of affairs which we are rapidly approaching. I appeal to the Acting Prime Minister to take action, even at this late hour, to uphold the law of this country, otherwise we can say goodbye to democracy. Prime Minister) [10.53] I do not propose to reply to the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) at length. Earlier to-day I made a statement on this matter which I think was a fair account of what has happened. As I said, the Coal Commissioner, Mr Parliament might well be consulted, with Mighell, made certain recommendations. He hoped that certain meetings would be held to-night. So far, I do not know what are the results of those meetings and I do not propose to form any judgment, or to make any further statement, until I have that information. I repeat that if work is resumed to-morrow and coal is produced-afte r all, that is the main concern of the Government and the country-prosecutions will not be launched. That is a fair and honest statement. If the meetings do not decide on that course, I shall consult my colleagues to-morrow in regard to the action which will be taken by the Government. Service Ministers might well look at a Treasury instruction which readsIn all cases, it is tlie responsibility of the purchasing department to decide upon the purchase which will best serve the interests of the Commonwealth. The price to be paid will be a question of primary consideration, and in some cases it may be outweighed by such further consideration as suitability, quality or the time of delivery. That paragraph may explain some of the deficiencies in regard to the quality, or the rate of delivery, of equipment purchased for the services. The instruction continuesA service department may indicate the capacity of an individual firm to meet a requirement, but that should be used only as A helpful guide and not as any subtraction from the responsibility of the purchasing department to determine the placing of orders. It should be patent to service Ministers that, in the purchase of necessary equipment-smal l arms, guns, aircraft, or anything else-if the purchasing department and not the services themselves is the principal authority, and can decide matters of price, quality, and time of delivery without consulting the services, there will be wrong deliveries. There should not be a Treasury outlook when purchasing war equipment. A few pound? may be saved, but lives may be lost. The Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act contains anomalies, which will be admitted by every one who has a knowledge of its provisions. There is need for an overhaul. The all party committee of ex-servicemen in this a view to amendments being made within a reasonable time. In considering an application for a dependant's pension, the means test is applied to the parents of serwicemen. One or two sons of a family may have been killed. They may have been contributing to the upkeep of the home, but if the' parents have an income which exceeds £1 19s. a week each, they are not entitled to a pension. That is the cause of bitter disappointment to many parents. The wife of a service pensioner who was married to him subsequent to 1932, is not entitled to a pension. That matteT needs adjustment. The entitlement tribunals are too static. It is too difficult to get a case before one of them. They have the stock answer, "" This is not relevant, and we cannot heaT it "" . I have had that experience. It ' would be better to abolish those tribunals, and allow cases to be referred quickly to a court, than to give dissatisfaction to any ex-serviceman. The assessment tribunals are doing their work very well. But a soldier from Western Australia, for example, may state his case to an entitlement tribunal in Victoria. He may not be able to call witnesses. The department has the file, and his claim is refused. He must apply again within twelve months. If the department merely says that the further evidence is not relevant, his case is struck out. That is scarcely democratic. Although the Minister has no power to make an alteration, or to direct a tribunal, he could at least ensure that substantial justice would be done.",69,Chairman Mr W J E Reasonable Man Exercising His Rights As An

I informed it that in no part of the act were men such as exrprisoners of war covered. When appearing before an entitlement tribunal on behalf of the widow and family of an ex-prisoner, I have taken cognizance of unusual difficulties. There is room for alteration of the act, which is not by any means perfect. Representations on the subject have been made by many organizations. Amendments to modernize the act would have the support of honourable members on both sides of the chamber, and the Minister might well consult with the all party ex-servicemen on the subject.

There is absolutely no reason why the press or anybody else should indulge in mis-statement or exaggeration. The allegation that 60 per cent, of the regular crew of HMAS. Australia were replaced before she sailed for England is not correct. In actual fact, of those previously serving on Australia, approximately 1,000, only 151 were drafted elsewhere before she sailed, leaving 85 per cent, of the personnel that returned from an operational area on the ship when she left for the United Kingdom. The /press report also alleges that, "" Permanent base officers, especially those stationed at Flinders Naval Depot, comprised the nucleus of the officers on board "". On the contrary, Naval Depot, and only one of them has not had sea service in this war. In any case, it is a mistake to assume that because an officer OT rating is at Flinders Naval Depot, he has never been to sea or in action. A point disregarded in the press report is that HMAS. Australia is going to waters which are no longer personnel-for example, some of her higher gunnery ratings-were not required for the voyage. We should remember that Australia is still at war.

What is the present ration, including special ration, to miners and other industrial sections? 5. W ill he also ascertain whether a special ister for Defence, upon noticeissue of beer, cigarettes and tobacco has been assigned to 300 delegates to the Australasian Council of Trades Unions' Congress in Sydney this week? If this is correct, who authorized the allocation and can such authorization be taken as a precedent whereby approval will be granted for a special issue of beer, cigarettes and tobacco to other organizations when conferences are being held? and Customs has supplied the following answers:1. There has apparently been some misunderstanding as to tlie purport of a letter written by Mr Warren to the Australian Comforts Fund on the 30th May. The letter explained that, owing to the shortage of tobacco packed in air-tight tins, the whole of the available supplies would, of necessity, be absorbed in maintaining the quota of 13 oz. per man per month in combat areas. It was explained, therefore, that the Comforts Fund free issue of 2 oz. per man per month in airtight tins could only be continued by obtaini n "" that quantity from the Army Canteens Service. 2. Present issue through Australian Army Canteens Service to servicemen in New Guinea, were prePacific and Darwin ureas, is 3 oz. of tobacco or 105 cigarettes per man weekly in addition to free issue by the Australian Comforts Fund. On Australian mainland, present issue through Australian Army Canteens Service is 2$ oz. tobacco or 85 cigarettes per man weekly. 3. Present ration to prisoners-of-war is identical with that for troops on Australian mainland, as stated in reply to a previous question This basis is in accordance with the terms of the Hague Convention. 4. No special ration is made available for individual civilian smokers or miners, but in certain instances privileged supplies are made available to munition and other war workers on maximum basis of 2 oz. of tobacco or 60 cigarettes per smoker weekly, and in other instances, small supplementary supplies have been authorized for certain war workers. 5. The issue of special quotas of beer to three hotels and of cigarettes and tobacco to a tobacconist in the vicinity of the Trades Hall, Sydney, for the duration of the recent Australasian Council of Trade Unions' Congress, was authorized by me upon the fact being established that the supplies available of the regular customers and of the delegates to the Congress, more than a third of whom had come from other States. It is not unusual for special quotas to be authorized without creating a precedent, to overcome difficulties such as this, but, in each case, it must first be established that a necessity for special treatment exists. 1. Has he any confirmation of the new scale of leave granted to members of the British Forces in Europe, which it is reported works out at three days' home leave for each month of service? 2. W ill he submit to War Cabinet a recommendation that home leave to Australians on their return from forward areas should be increased accordingly? 3.

FOOD CONFERENCE IN LONDON . Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Eaddcn) asked a question relating to the representation of' Australia at a food conference held in London last week. As the right honourable member is no doubt aware, conferences took place in Washington in April last between the United Kingdom and the United States of America on the world food position, and in these the dominions were consulted in detail. In London, the Secretary of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Murphy) was frequently in consultation with the Ministry of Pood. He left this country with ful l information of the Australian position and has been kept up to date by cable. An assessment of world demand relative to supplies that could be provided was arrived at and the result showed a serious deficiency. The United Kingdom then thought it advisable to explain the position direct to representatives of a number of European countries with a view to bringing home to them the extreme gravity of the food situation and impressing upon them the urgent necessity for doing everything possible to increase home production and so reduce their import requirements. The meeting, which commenced on the 14th June, was expected to last two days. The Commonwealth Government was informed of the meeting. No suggestion was made that the Government be represented and it was not deemed necessary to take any action in this respect. COAL-MINING INDUSTRY: STRIKE ON I then promised to have a statement cumstances, including the attempts that have been made to remove the difficulty A deputy named Wilson was suspended from his employment because it was alleged against him that he had placed his initials together with the date of prc-shift inspection on certain working places in the mine in question at a time earlier than that permitted by the law. Under the Coal Mines Regulation Act a deputy is compelled to make an inspection of tlie mine and of all working places between 3 a.m. and 7 a.m., and it is generally admitted that it would be a serious offence for a deputy to make an inspection before the hour stipulated, particularly as the safety of employees is involved. Wilson, the deputy in question, denies having committed any breach of the Coal Mines Regulation Act, and further denies that the markings in the mine are his, and states that' he knows nothing 'of them at all. Industrial matters relating to deputies are within the jurisdiction of the Industrial Commission of the State of New South Wales and the dispute which arose following the suspension of Wilson came before Mr Justice Cantor of that Commission. In a lengthy judgment, His Honour stated that he was ""not satisfied that Wilson did not place the markings where they were found before 3 a.m. on 6th April. I am satisfied that the management acting for the employer in good faith and as a reasonable man exercising his rights as an employer, suspended Wilson. I find no evidence of victimization of Wilson in the offence alleged or of failure on the part of those concerned to apply their minds fairly to the facts"". The judge concluded that portion of his judgment by stating that it was not a matter in which the commission should intervene, and he refused to make an order for Wilson's reinstatement. Following on this judgment, the members of the Deputies Association in the Maitland district held a meeting and resolved that none of the mines in that area would work until Wilson had been reinstated. As a result of that resolution, some 24 mines were idle on Thursday and Friday of last week, with a loss of about 20,000 tons of coal each-day. On Saturday morning an officer of the Commonwealth Coal Commission met the representatives of the Deputies Association in conference with the Minister",73,Australia Narmy Leave

Officers of the Coal Commission were tremendously concerned as to their ability to supply eual to essential consumers if this stoppage was to continue into the following week. Roprcseii.tati\-es of the deputies indicated that they had further evidence which could be produced to support Wilson's claim that he had been unjustly dealt with, and asked that the whole matter be reviewed. In an effort to ensure the smooth running of the colliery pending the production of such further eviden.e, it was decided that the colliery should operatu under an authorized controller until such time as the judge of the Industrial Commission hud considered such further evidence or for 30 days if no such further evidence was produced. Wilson was to remain suspended and no permanent appointment was to lie made to fill his position in the meantime. A written agreement embracing the terms of settlement was signed by the executive officers of the Deputies Association representing each' district in the State, and all mines in the Maitland district resumed work on Monday. In pursuance of .the agreement arrived at, the Coal Commissioner took all steps necessary to take over control of the mine and appointed Mr G. Pcllow his assistant production malinger, as the authorized controller, whilst notice in writin g of this action was posted to the secretary of the company owning the mine on the same day, Monday. On Monday night the deputies employed at the Maitland mines held a further meeting and refused to accept the terms of agreement referred to, although advised to do so by their responsible officers. Tliey resolved to again cease work until Wilson had been reinstated, and as a result the mines were thrown idle ami in yesterday and to-day. The State Council of the Deputies Association immediately convened a meeting of all councillors in Sydney and yesterday carried a resolution ordering a resumption of work on the terms of the agreement arrived at on Saturday, and the meeting of thoseconcerned is to be held to-night at which all officials of the association w ill attend. It is true that in ceasing work the deputies have broken the law and are liable to prosecution. I notice that the Coal Commissioner has made a public statement drawing attention to the splendid record of mine deputies during the whole course of the present war mid expressing his regret that the foolish attitude of the Maitland men should have tarnished their otherwise excellent reputation in such matters. The Government is advised by the Coal Commissioner, ond I have his permission to say that he will not recommend prosecution against the deputies if they accept the advice and d rection of their officials to : resume work without delay. Tn reaching this decision, the Commissioner informs me that lie is influenced not only by the high regard he has for the past service given by the deputies to the industries dur'ng the war, hut also berait°e he firmly believes th:it suuh a decision will he in the best interests of future production.
