But, as with so many issues of position. this kind, there are subsequent issues that Going to the very heart of the concerns the process of the IVF program many more raised by those opposed to the bill is the embryos are created than are ever used. It is question: at what point is a new life created? a fact that in the normal operations of the This is a complex question both in science IVF program those that are referred to as and morality. At the end of the day we all ‘excess embryos’ are destroyed. If indeed it have to arrive at our own view in answering is life, for those who hold that view, it is a that important question. At what point does a rather moot point whether or not that life in cell become more than simply a living cell or their view is destroyed by being poured a collection of cells? At what point does it down the sink in a laboratory or by being become an entity in its own right-a human used in research such as the stem cell relife, a human being to be protected by the search.

For some in this debate clearly that is the There is a consistent view, which I have point of fertilisation, even if that fertilisation had put to me, and I know some of our colis outside the human body.

The report is the result of a survey that was distributed to year 10 students and people aged 18 to 20 years living in the federal electorate of Newcastle. It details the views and opinions of over 1,000 young Novocastrians about the issues that matter most to them. The results show that young Novocastrians overwhelmingly consider education and employment to be the two most important issues for the federal government to address. Calls for better funding for education at all levels were made loud and clear, as was the need for government to create more jobs and provide more opportunities and assistance for those looking for work. The disturbingly high rate of unemployment in Newcastle was also noted by many of our young respondents. When asked to rank a set of eight issues in order of importance, health, education, employment and the environment were the four most important issues for young people in Newcastle, each issue drawing more than 100 responses as the single most important item. In response to the question ‘What do you most like about Newcastle?’ an overwhelming majority of young people nominated the beaches as the single most loved feature of Newcastle. But they nominated as their second most important feature the strong community spirit in Newcastle. When asked if there were enough opportunities for young people in Newcastle, 67 per cent said no. The question ‘What would you most like to change about your city?’ drew a range of responses but the two most popular were a strong desire to reduce the unemployment rate and a need to make our community safer, including a reduction of drug and alcohol abuse. They showed great wisdom. With regard to current levels of employment, 50 per cent had some form of paid job but 93 per cent of those were employed on a casual or part-time basis; only seven per cent had full-time work. Notwithstanding concerns about high unemployment levels in Newcastle, the vast majority of young people-88 per cent, in fact-remained overwhelmingly optimistic about finding full-time work in the future. Sadly, though, many young people anticipated having to leave Newcastle to find those jobs. Finally, almost all respondents nominated a range of activities that they are involved in. Music and sport dominated but it is significant that one in eight of 1,000-plus Novocastrians who responded do some sort of voluntary work for their community. I pay tribute to them for that great effort. One respondent said: ‘Ensure youth opinions are counted. We are the future.’ I therefore call on our government to make the best possible use of young people’s imagination, their energy and their indomitable spirit in building a better future for their city of Newcastle and for this country.

After much hard work by the Somerville Secondary College Steering Committee, I am thrilled that they have been successful and that, along with others, I may have been able to play a small part in bringing to pass the building of this school for the future. In particular, I want to congratulate the members of the secondary college steering committee led by Phil Brake and comprising Fiona Prentice, Scott Holmes, Bruce Buchan, Rob Hansen and many others, all of whom have contributed over the last two years to a goal that they were initially told was impossible. That is a great feature of the democratic process. They were told that it would be impossible to, firstly, retain the land on which it was proposed the school would be built; and, secondly, to win support for the building of the school. But, through very hard work, and in conjunction with my state colleagues Neale Burgess, Robin Cooper and Ron Bowden, we compiled the figures from the latest census, which proved unequivocally that there was a desperate need for a school within that area. The consequence of that was a rock-solid pledge from the Liberal Party to build the Somerville Secondary College. These figures were initially rejected by the state government, but the force of weight behind them was ultimately accepted and we now have bipartisan support. No matter what happens, the school will be built and it will have a great impact on the future of the town. It will be a centre of excellence in education for the children of Somerville and Tyabb. It will be a centre for community activities, and above all else it will focus on the town no longer being a dormitory. It will be a destination in itself. It is not the end of the work; it is only the beginning. Together with Neale Burgess, we now turn to work on three things: additional police resources for the town of Somerville, additional basketball resources for the children and youth and a second chemist for the town of Somerville on the eastern side of Eramosa Road. All of these factors mean that the town will grow and go forward. In conclusion, I am delighted to announce that the Somerville Secondary College will be built. I congratulate all of those members of the steering committee, who have contributed so much over the last few years. Tasmania: Weather electorate in the month of July, as I usually do. Comments made to me seemed to come from the fact that there had been an unusually wet winter on the west coast of Tasmania. For west coasters to notice a slightly unusual weather pattern is odd, but to say that it is wetter than usual is very odd, because everybody knows the west coast is wet, particularly in winter. I know that your area needs rain, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, and I have been talking to Mr Cobb, the member for Parkes, on the other side of the chamber, about other parts of New South Wales that are in need of a lot of rain. Nevertheless, as I wandered around Queenstown and other parts of the west coast, I was accosted by people complaining bitterly about the weather. ‘Tell the Hydro to stop seeding clouds,’ they said. ‘Have they been seeding them?’ I asked, unaware of any such situation. There are no catchments to fill on the west coast. The reply from the people of the west coast was, ‘We hear those aeroplanes. They can’t fool us. They come over every night.’ So, whatever was going down, I had to find out. I rang the Hydro and asked, ‘Have you been seeding clouds lately?’ They said they had, but not during the recent period. There had been some planes sent up to look at clouds but, as far as they were aware, no seeding had been done since June. So had it been a particularly wet season on the west coast of Tasmania?",100,Representatives Main Committee
208,Mr Adams (Lyons) (9.46 A.m.),"An interesting problem confronted me as I toured my5534 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 August 2002 I recently read a report by an independent scientist who was looking at cloud seeding in Tasmania. The findings indicated that it has not been a particularly bad, wet winter. There have been a number of really bad ones, including 1980 and 1988, with the wettest October on record. It seems that the months of September and October provide more rain than July and August, so perhaps the rains are coming earlier than before. The figures did not tell me what the averages were for June and July; they concentrated on the higher rainfall months. So, no, I do not believe it is wetter on the west coast than usual. It might be more concentrated and more forceful, but can that be said to be wetter? There is another side that I am sure will not cheer people up: predictions from the CSIRO study indicate that Tasmania will tend to be drier in all seasons except winter and that this ‘wet’ may be confined to the west coast, with stronger winds contributing to greater evaporation in the rain shadow in the east. (Time expired) New South Wales: Drought attention the incredible disaster that is happening in western New South Wales. The fact that we have already had enormous droughts in Queensland and that drought is spreading to Victoria should also be noted. In the last two weeks, I have travelled extensively in my electorate and gone to the places that seem to be the worse affected. I have gone from Nyngan through to Warren and to places as small as Coolabah and Girilambone, where the crops are dead in places. This is going to have an incredible effect, even thought this drought so far has had more of an effect upon the ability of farmers in the far west to manage their stock-and I will talk about Cobar and places like Ivanhoe in a second. I note that it is disastrous that over 50 per cent of the crops in New South Wales have not been sown or should not have been sown and are probably not going to produce anything. When you go to Girilambone or to Hermidale and see 25 farmers turn up at the drop of a hat-and this is an area that has not had crops for the last two years-you see that they are in a desperate situation. The state government has been very slow in acting, but the Commonwealth does have a duty now to look at those who have a long-term future and to keep them on that land. I went about 50 miles north of Cobar on the Wilcannia Road and met with a group of farmers to find that not only is this drought cutting their wool cut back by some 30 per cent on the previous year-which had been a difficult year-but also the winter rainfall in the Cobar region is the lowest it has been in some 50 years. It is certainly the lowest in recent times, following rainfall way below average in summer, autumn and spring last year. There are areas that have not had 12 months rainfall in almost two years. If you go between Cobar and Ivanhoe on that road, you will see a group of nine properties totally destocked; there is no stock on them. Within the Wilcannia Rural Lands Protection Board area we have a similar situation, with huge areas destocked. There are the odd places around the west that have fodder for stock, but this is the first drought that I can remember where water and feed are running out together. The Commonwealth government has a duty to keep people on the land where it is possible to do so. Industrial Relations: Employee Entitlements Ms CORCORAN (Isaacs) (9.52 a.m.)-I rise today to recount an alarming story of a constituent in my electorate, Veronica Kearney, of Cranbourne. Veronica has had a drawn-out and most frustrating experience over the last 13 months in trying to obtain wages owed to her by her ex-employer, Australian Ophthalmic Suppliers Pty Ltd, trading as Merringtons Optometrists. Veronica is a mature person with a long track record as a reliable employee. In June 2000, she undertook a retail traineeship, signed a training agreement and became an employee",101,Representatives Main Committee
209,Mr John Cobb (Parkes) (9.49 A.m.),"I would like once again to draw to the House’sThursday, 22 August 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 5535 of Merringtons. Merringtons operates around 50 shops nationally and has taken on many trainees under the Commonwealth government’s traineeships program. Veronica proved a valued employee-so much so that Merringtons awarded her a company paid holiday to Northern Australia in recognition of her strong work performance. When Veronica and Merringtons parted company in July 2001, after the 12 months of her traineeship had expired, she believed she was owed around $1,200 in wages and holiday pay. Veronica is still waiting for her pay 13 months later. Veronica is not alone; apparently there are many other Merringtons workers having trouble with their pay. On a broader canvas, Veronica’s story illustrates the lack of industrial protection for literally hundreds of thousands of Victorian workers in this era of so-called workplace reform. The situation is a legacy of the Kennett government’s abolition of the system of state industrial awards and slashing of workers’ terms and conditions. In 1996, Victoria ceded its industrial jurisdiction over these workers to the Commonwealth government under the infamous schedule 1A of the Workplace Relations Act. The Commonwealth Department of Employment and Workplace Relations has investigated Veronica’s case and determined that Veronica is owed well over $900 by Merringtons. However, this department appears to have extremely limited powers to force Merringtons to fulfil its responsibilities as an employer. After nearly 12 months of negotiations, the department still cannot make Merringtons pay up for Veronica or for any other of the cases on its books with Merringtons. Veronica’s only recourse now is to personally take Merringtons to court, which she cannot afford to do. On the one hand, the Commonwealth is subsidising Merringtons to take on new traineesand they are still being signed up by this company, which puts its hand out for the cash straight away-and, on the other hand, the Commonwealth Department of Employment and Workplace Relations is literally spending hundreds of work hours and taxpayers’ dollars chasing the company to pay the wages it owes to its workers. This is a disgraceful situation, complicated by the way this government has chosen to administer the traineeship program through outsource brokers who have no brief to make sure employers live up to their responsibilities. I am making representations to both the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the Minister for Education, Science and Training to try to get this matter resolved as quickly as possible and get Veronica paid. Nobody should have to wait for 13 months to get their pay.

I want to praise today a local organisation which has worked hard over many years to establish itself as an international charity group. Helping Children Smile Inc -and I am the patron of that organisation-was established some six to seven years ago. The organisation sends volunteer medical teams to the Philippines and to developing countries to conduct reconstructive surgery on children and occasionally on adults who suffer from cleft palate and lip abnormalities which are caused by malnutrition in mothers while pregnant. Helping Children Smile sends volunteer medical teams of 12 to 14 people to these developing countries and to the Philippines for a year. During the year, approximately 60 operations are conducted. To pay for reconstructive surgery like this, it would cost the parents of these children some five to seven years of wages. Funding to send the medical team of 12 to 14 costs $23,000 per annum.

Also, last week I officially opened the organisation’s first charity shop in Queen Street, Nambour, that will continue to raise funds needed each year. Laurie Rowe is the manager of the charity shop, and she has put in long volunteer hours to get the shop up and running. The great thing about Helping Children Smile is that every dollar paid goes to assist people overseas. Nothing is lost in administrative costs. This, of course, is great encouragement to people in the community to support this small group of Sunshine Coast residents who are trying to make and who are indeed making a very real difference. Valerie Smith-Orr, the president and founder of the group, who attends my church, St Mark’s Anglican Church at Buderim, has made a great contribution to the Sunshine Coast and the organisation. On behalf of the parliament and on behalf of the community, I want to applaud the outstanding work carried out by Helping Children Smile and the selfless way that so many people give so much of their time. I hope to join one of these volunteer teams, at my own expense, and go to the Philippines to assist in this wonderful work. der 275A, the time for members’ statements has concluded. Second Reading Debate resumed from 27 June, on motion by Mrs Vale: That this bill be now read a second time. (No. 2) 2002 includes a number of amendments necessary to make some minor improvements to the operation of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. For the record, I will quickly summarise the changes, all of which are supported by the Labor Party. Part1 of the bill corrects a minor anomaly where a small number of veteran pensioners in receipt of the age pension are in double jeopardy, to the extent that compensation for physical injury from a third party is taken to offset both the veterans’ disability pension as well as their income support payment where it is currently being treated as ordinary income. This drafting oversight has resulted in an unfair outcome. In short, compensation for pain and suffering should only be offset against like compensation for the same injury. Where an element of economic compensation is involved, an offset against income support is justified. But this is not the subject of this provision. This amendment removes the element of double counting of third-party compensation and is, therefore, supported. The amendment in part 2 is also a minor one. In brief, amendments were made in 1997 to prevent lump sum settlements to the partner of a veteran being applied to the means test of the veterans themselves. It seems that at the time the operative date was not made clear. Hence, we have the clarification here that the previous amendment applies only to lump sums paid after 20 March 1997. Part3 contains a more substantial amendment as it seeks to close a loophole which has been exploited by some who have succeeded in having retirement village entry contributions in excess of the threshold treated as rent. Hence, they qualify for taxpayer funded rent assis-",103,Representatives Main Committee

212,Mr Edwards (Cowan) (9.59 A.m.),"The Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment BillThursday, 22 August 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 5537 tance. The amendment necessary to close this loophole created by a Federal Court decision has already been made to the Social Security Act but, as usual, it seems the Veterans’ Entitlements Act lags behind. Part4 simply extends the facility of telephone allowances to be available for mobile phones as well as fixed telephones. This is a practical amendment needed to make the benefit relevant. Part5 is more complicated. Currently, a person cannot be paid rent assistance under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act where there is a child for whom the family tax benefit is payable. This is because FTB already has included in it an element of rent assistance, but not for everybody. Those who have a right to receive maintenance for that child-if he or she is over 16, still at school and not in receipt of Youth Allowance-only get the base rate FTB which does not include rent assistance. This amendment will allow the latter class of people to claim rent assistance and so remove the unfairness of the current provision. It is understood that very few people are affected but, nevertheless, the amendment is worthwhile. Part6 of the bill seeks to correct an error in the provision of the Pension Loans Scheme to those who inadvertently became eligible at the time when provision was made for those on the income support supplement-namely, a small number of people on a partner pension. This oversight is corrected and is accordingly supported. Part7 relates to the provision of a Commonwealth seniors health card to war widows and widowers between the ages of 57 and 62 who are currently not eligible due to a lack of provision for their lower age eligibility. This has not been an issue until recently, as the benefits of the CSHC were not of significance to widows. Additions to the CSHC, however, such as discounts on Great Southern Railway, have created a demand for the card and, hence, the need to remove this unintended limitation. Finally, part 8 of the bill contains a simple change to clarify the definition of a non-illness separated spouse, which to date has assumed that such a person is a veteran; whereas, in fact, it could also be the veteran partner. This has some flow-on consequences such as the telephone allowance. Mr Deputy Speaker, we support the bill. brate Vietnam Veterans Day, formerly called Long Tan Day. much as I can because you meet so many of our very special people. Many are down to earth and you feel that you can talk plainly and honestly with them and get an honest answer in return. Because veterans have seen some of the most unpleasant things in life, which many of us have not, they have a different perspective of the world. That is why I have so much time for the veteran community, their families and carers and why I think they deserve all that we can give them. The Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 is a reflection of this government’s continuing commitment to veterans and that is why I gladly support the provisions. Whilst the provisions are certainly not dramatic or headline grabbing, they are nevertheless important in terms of the cumulative effects towards benefits. Each provision and amendment means something to someone and as such has to be addressed. The evolving and changing needs of the veteran community mean that we, as a government, need to keep abreast of changes to ensure that we do not inadvertently create a disadvantage. For instance, the provision to rectify the compensation recovery provisions of the act means that veterans will not be treated unfairly but in line with community expectations. It is not acceptable that situations",104,Representatives Main Committee

Although a small number of veterans will benefit, it is nevertheless an anomaly that we have corrected-as is the provision for addressing the issue of a partner’s lump sum compensation payment impacting on the other partner’s pension. I also welcome the amendment concerning the entry contributions to retirement villages so as to prevent the misuse of provisions to obtain rent assistance. Whilst this has no direct impact on anyone personally, it is an aspect that needed to be tidied up to make sure veterans are not brought into disrepute. The provision also brings the legislation into line with the Social Security Act, again ensuring equity with the rest of the community. As part of the process of keeping up with modern developments, I note that mobile phones have been recognised for the purpose of eligibility for telephone allowance. A number of veterans prefer this option because of their choice of lifestyle mobility. Such a choice should not disadvantage them and this amendment seeks to prevent this. The provision clarifies policy to ensure a disadvantage is not introduced because of a vagueness of language. I know of cases where individuals have missed out on entitlements because they were not certain of provisions and therefore did not apply. It is not always possible to get to those caught in that situation so we have to make the law as understandable as it can be. The government has introduced a number of initiatives in this direction to ensure that information is accessible in terms of being understandable and readable. Recently, veteran groups in the Shoalhaven have been given a grant to buy computer equipment to make veterans’ services information more accessible. These grants were well received, as was the service by the primary users, the welfare officers. I know of two hard working veterans’ welfare officers in my area that are thrilled with the acquisition because it helps them with their work, and I would like to mention them today to acknowledge their son and Mr Gage would welcome the news that this bill will also advantage veteran pensioners receiving family tax benefit with no rent assistance component. The provision will bring them into line with other social security recipients to make sure veterans pensions are treated equitably. Lastly, the extension of the eligibility criteria for the pensions loans scheme to certain persons who are not a veteran or the partners of a veteran will assist by allowing access from the time of qualifying age rather than pension age. It benefits those who might be on income support but have not yet reached pension age, because the definition of qualifying age is five years earlier. It will benefit war widows and widowers particularly. It will also enable war widows and widowers early eligibility for the Commonwealth seniors health care card. These provisions, although seemingly small, are nevertheless important and I applaud the government’s initiative in introducing them. There are still a number of issues to be worked through, and we will continue to explore them under this government. The electorate of Gilmore has a proportionally large veteran community, who take an active interest in issues affecting Australia, particularly in respect of our commitments overseas. Having two naval bases means we see veterans of modern conflicts passing through our doors. Despite the age differences between veterans, they hold similar values and outlooks because of the common bond that service to Australia has brought them. I look forward to further initiatives from this government to benefit the veteran community. on the Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 because it deals with a group of people in the community who are very dear to my heart.

217,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (10.08 A.m.),"I am particularly pleased that I am able to speakThursday, 22 August 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 5539 community deserves generous support, care and compensation through a simple, fair and responsive system unique to their needs. It is vital that the service of our veterans continues to be honoured publicly and proudly by their fellow Australians, particularly by the generations who have never known or witnessed the harrowing experience of war. Never before have we had so much support for our veteran community, with record numbers of people coming out to support our veterans on occasions such as ANZAC Day and Remembrance Day. Just last week, 10 World War II veterans were guests of honour at a ceremony in Papua New Guinea to mark the 60th anniversary of the battle of the Kokoda Track. There the Prime Minister unveiled a new memorial at Isurava, which overlooks the Kokoda valley and the site where the Australian forces dug in to face the Japanese invasion. The memorial features four sentinel stones engraved with the words ‘courage’, ‘endurance’, ‘sacrifice’ and ‘mateship’. The words have a special significance to our national identity and have been embraced by young and old. Still on matters overseas, I take this opportunity to mention how pleased I am by the recent decision by the French government to abandon plans for an international airport in the Somme region. The proposed site for the new airport included an area which contained war cemeteries containing the war graves of 61 Australians killed during the two world wars. It is a credit not only to federal ministers from this government who made personal representations on this matter but also to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. This year we have also seen the passing of a number of fine veterans. Australia’s last Light Horseman, Albert Whitmore, passed away at the age of 102. World WarI veteran of the Royal Australian Navy Lesley Sykes passed away at the age of 103. World WarI digger and Australia’s oldest man, Jack Lockett, passed away at the age of 111. World WarI veteran Raymond Durston passed away at the age of 102. World War II veteran and Victoria Cross recipient Sir Arthur Roden Cutler passed away at the age of 85. In the last year, we have also seen the passing of the last known ANZAC, Alec Campbell. These men are to be honoured. BeforeI speak on the various amendments to this bill, I may take the opportunity to recognise those in my electorate whom I caught up with at recent ceremonies for veterans. Last Sunday was Vietnam Veterans Day and the anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. The Great Lake Vietnam Veterans Association had planned to march on the day but, when I spoke to them, they were struck by the problem of affording public liability insurance. The association was told they could not march unless they increased their insurance cover, which was a sum too high for the association to afford. Spiralling premium increases have affected so many in our community, and I was appalled that an association like the Vietnam Veterans would be facing a problem like this that threatened to leave them out of the march. Thankfully, the matter was sorted out before the Sunday march, but it certainly brings home the impact that the insurance problem is having on our community-and it needs a quick resolution. I met with the association to present them with a cheque from the government’s Building Excellence in Support and Training program, and I caught up with members, including Robbie Campbell, Bill Olson, Peter Craig and Robert Allport. On the same day, I also presented a cheque to Forster Tuncurry Legacy, which is one of the biggest in the region, where I caught up with Lyn Middleton, Alan Dreyer, Joe Dawson, Brian Lennon and Geoff Yarnold. I was also able to meet with some of the members of the East Maitland RSL sub-branch recently when I presented them with a cheque for $1,500. I met with Peter Harvey, Fred Goddard and Harold Jackson. This money was used to assist the branch with the regilding of letters on the honour roll of the cenotaph. The cenotaph itself was dedicated in 1923 and, over time, some 5540 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 August 2002 of the names on the roll have weathered. It is important that we honour these people and keep their names in the public eye. I also presented a cheque to Ted Gurry from Karuah RSL subbranch, because that sub-branch also needed to clean up their war memorial after years of weathering. I have been in contact with residents in Morpeth community, including Pam Misner, who is now working to bring a war memorial to this historic town. For years, the residents in Morpeth have had to travel to other towns or simply go without a memorial during ANZAC and other commemoration ceremonies. I am happy to be able to assist them and work with the community to try and bring a memorial to life in their town. This bill will assist veterans in my electorate. It contains a number of minor measures to clarify the legislation and to correct a number of anomalies in the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986. These measures include the removal of the inequity in the way in which various compensation recovery provisions of the act operate. The removal of this inequity will ensure all vet pensioners subject to the recovery provisions are treated fairly. The measures will also ensure that the pension of the partner of the person receiving lump sum compensation payments will not be taken into account in determining the amount to be recovered directly from a compensation payer or insurer. It will prevent the misuse of the provisions relating to the payment of entry contributions to retirement villages or for the purposes of obtaining rent assistance. It will provide for pensioners who operate a mobile telephone instead of a fixed telephone line, such as those living in caravan parks. They will be eligible for telephone assistance. It will align eligibility for rent assistance for veteran pensioners receiving family tax benefits with that of social security pensioners in similar circumstances. It will extend the eligibility for the Pension Loans Scheme to persons who are not veterans or the partners of veterans. This extension will mainly benefit persons eligible for, or in receipt of, the income support supplement. The measure will also enable persons eligible for, or in receipt of, the income support supplement to be eligible for the Pension Loans Scheme from qualifying age rather than from pension age. It will also enable war widows and war widowers to be eligible for the Commonwealth seniors health card from qualifying age rather than from pension age. Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, as you would know from your own electorate, all of these measures demonstrate a strong commitment to our veteran community and the need to provide the best system of support possible. That commitment to making sure that government gets it right when it comes to veterans pensions and other benefits is clear. When the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs announced the independent inquiry into anomalies in the system earlier this year, there was an overwhelming response to this inquiry from veterans, including from those in my electorate. Some travelled to Newcastle when the inquiry was on and spent a day in the area, just for the opportunity to put their views forward. I am looking forward to the results of this inquiry and I hope that any changes that are proposed to streamline and iron out any problems with the system are quickly implemented by this government. Our service personnel, our veterans, the people who laid it on the line for our country-for your freedom and mine-deserve the best that this country can possibly afford to give them. These are fine men and women and they deserve simply the best. Ms HALL (Shortland) (10.16 a.m.)-I join the member for Paterson in saying that it is extremely important that we honour our veterans. Their contribution to Australia has been enormous. I honour every veteran within the Shortland electorate and thank them for their commitment to Australia and for their ongoing commitment to the community that they live in. The commitment that the veterans made at their time of service continues. They were prepared to make sacrifices for their country, but now they make sacrifices for their communities Thursday, 22 August 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 5541 and they constantly work within their communities to ensure that those communities are better places for everyone who lives in them. I join with previous speakers in recognising the role that veterans have played in protecting Australia, the service that they have given for their country and the ongoing service that they give to their communities. The Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 has been introduced to rectify drafting problems in the original legislation. It is unfortunate that so often in this place we have to come back and revisit legislation that has gone through the House and alter it in order to rectify problems. I think that it is a problem that the government should look at. It should ensure that legislation is properly drafted when it is introduced. More emphasis should be placed on looking at the implications that that legislation has. When I was a member of the state parliament, I was involved in the Joint Parliamentary Regulation Review Committee. One of the things that we did there was to ensure that a regulatory impact statement was prepared for every piece of legislation. That tended to pick up a lot of the problems that we constantly see being put before the parliament. I do not remember us having to revisit legislation to the degree that we do in this parliament. I really believe that that is something the government should take on board. It should put more effort into ensuring that it gets it right the first time. The amendments to the original legislation should be supported. They remove double counting, whereby third-party compensation paid to a veteran for the same injury currently receives both the disability and the service pension, and reduce both of those. Obviously, this should not happen; obviously, it should have been picked up in the first instance. I think it is important that this amending bill is passed. The previous bill that went through in March led to a reduction in pensions as a result of third-party lump sum payments. It was restricted to the number of couples to whom the lump sum was paid without affecting the pension which was previously received; however, it was not clear that any necessary recalculations were limited to cases that were after 20 March 1997. Once again, it is purely a technical matter, and it is something that would have been taken care of if the proper steps had been taken when the legislation was introduced. This bill also deals with rent assistance for people in retirement villages; once again, that is something that needed to be fixed. There is a technical amendment that allows payment for mobile phones under the telephone allowance, and I can assure the House that a number of pensioners are now using mobile phones. They are a viable option and they are actually a cheaper option for them than having a land line, and they should not be penalised because they are trying to balance their budgets. Once again, this is something that should have been addressed initially. The bill deals with an entitlement act for the payment of rent assistance to families who receive a family tax payment where a veteran is disadvantaged compared to others. Talking about rent assistance, I think there is another issue that relates to war widows. War widows who are renting and who have a gold card are being denied rent assistance through Centrelink. This is another issue that the government needs to have a look at because I think it is an unintended consequence. It is a consequence that is causing hardship to a number of people and one that needs to be revisited, just as the government has revisited access to a range of welfare benefits for those people who reach the minimum requirement of 57 years of age but are restricted from eligibility for the seniors health card until they are 62 years old. The issue of rent assistance is one that really needs to be looked at. It is pleasing to see that the payment of the partner’s pension to partners of veterans has been fixed up, because it is not right that they 5542 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 August 2002 should be ineligible. Finally, it was important that the telephone allowance was amended. As I have already indicated, these are matters that we should not have had to revisit. There is another issue I feel I should raise in relation to veterans. It is an issue that has started to become quite a problem and one that a number of veterans are contacting my office about. Veterans can no longer use their gold card. General practitioners and specialists are rejecting their gold card when veterans go to see them. I am sure that members on both sides of the House are extremely concerned about this. I believe it is part of a campaign. Doctors are lobbying for an increase in the fees for treatment of veterans under the Repatriation Private Patients Scheme. I am sure that members on both sides of the House have received letters from the AMA setting out why there should be an increase in the fees that are paid. I also understand that the minister has been meeting with doctors. This is something that needs to be resolved immediately. It is having an enormous impact on veterans in communities such as mine. The Shortland electorate has the second highest number of veterans in a Labor-held electorate in Australia, so I am very aware of the implications for those veterans and of the hardships that it will cause and is already causing them. I surveyed 24 doctors in the northern part of my electorate and found out that 21 per cent of those doctors are no longer accepting the gold card for our veterans. That really is not good enough. Our veterans deserve to have the medical treatment that they are entitled to. They were prepared to make sacrifices for our country, and the least that this country and this government can do is ensure that they get the treatment that they deserve. I would have thought that members on the other side of this House would be prepared to join with me in this campaign. It is not about naming one doctor or another; it is about ensuring that our veterans in our communities can use their gold cards in the way that they have been promised they can use them. Doctors argue that they can no longer afford it, that the rates are too low and that the medical indemnity insurance premiums are adding to their costs, but these are not good enough reasons. The government needs to talk to them in order to resolve the problem, and they need to ensure that our veterans can get the medical treatment that they have been promised with that gold card. The problem is exacerbated in areas such as mine because there is a considerable distance between Medicare offices. The government chose to close a Medicare office which necessitates a number of older people having to drive or catch buses that take them over an hour to get to a Medicare office. There is not an appropriate level of Medicare easy claims for them to be able to access their payments through pharmacies. This problem with the gold card is causing hardship to people throughout my electorate and throughout the country. I have received phone calls from a number of veterans from the Central Coast part of my electorate. There is already a chronic shortage of doctors and poor access, as I have mentioned, to Medicare offices. The fees that doctors are charging are increasing, and that relates to the medical indemnity insurance crisis which the government really has not worked on solving. There are a number of really severe problems that our veteran communities are facing. They continue to face them, and the government continues to refuse to act to solve these problems, even to the extent of increasing the problems and hardships that they have. I urge members on the other side of the House to actively campaign within their party room to see that this issue with the gold card is resolved because it is hurting veterans and it is hurting them now. I think it is one of the priorities for the government. I support the amendments that this bill seeks to make to the existing act. In doing so, I urge the government to take more care Thursday, 22 August 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 5543 with their initial legislation to ensure that we do not have to continually come back and revisit legislation. Maybe they should make a little bit more use of regulatory impact statements. a.m.)-I am here at the request of the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, who is detained on other business in the House, and I am pleased to be involved in the second reading debate of the Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 and to sum it up. I would like to thank the members for Cowan, Gilmore, Paterson and Shortland for their contributions. The members for Gilmore and Paterson gave very fine addresses which offered tremendous insight into their commitment to the veterans in their communities. We appreciate the support of the members of the Australian Labor Party on the legislation contained in this package but note the contrast between the member for Cowan and the member for Shortland. While the member for Cowan offered us brevity and credibility, the member for Shortland did not. I, like the members for Gilmore and Paterson, have a lot to do with the veterans in my community. I will delay the House a moment to acknowledge that the Saluting their Service initiative that Minister Vale offered Australia the other day, which is a continuation of a long standing tradition of good government packages of celebration and commemoration-celebration of the spirit of the people involved and commemoration of the service that they gave so that we can enjoy the freedoms we have in this country-is an initiative worth getting behind. The Stephens RSL is my electorate last week had yet another Victory in the Pacific Day commemoration. It was a very short ceremony where, sadly, this year the numbers were down to just 20 people. Norm Ballard, the president, and Jim Clarkson, the secretary, offer the stewardship they have offered for years. It was saddened by the passing of Keith Boyling, who, after 55 years, was one of the long standing members of Stephens RSL. It is worth noting also Sherwood RSL’s Kokoda Track Memorial, which I had the high honour of opening the other week. President Ron McElwaine, his predecessor, Miles Farmer OAM, Graeme Loughton and others associated with that club ensure that the saluting of service takes place in the grassroots of our community, and that is something worth recording in this place. It is right, as all members in this debate said, that we take time to consider our responsibilities to uphold the commitment we gave service personnel of many years ago and of more recent years that we shall remember them, that we will always honour them and that we will assist them. This Sunday, the Brisbane South branch of the National Servicemen’s Association are having the second event of the conferring of National Servicemen’s Medals, and they have asked me to come and participate in that. As a representative of the government and as somebody who assisted them in their fight for that medal, it is an extremely high honour that they pay me-as somebody who has never put on the uniform, who has never fought for this country and who has never been prepared because the opportunity has never availed itself due to their efforts. I grew up in an environment where the Vietnam War was on the nightly news and I breathed a sigh of relief when national service was ended and the war itself stopped. The bill before us, while very important specifically to the veterans’ community-whether or not it is part of the ongoing effort of government to finetune arrangements and to continue to make them relevant and up to date-is relevant for Australians of all backgrounds. The veterans community share with children. They show children so much of what they have done; they relate to children. In my electorate, Wellers Hill State School now have a wonderful memorial in their grounds where veterans come and tell the tales of what they did when they were in their late teens and early 20s. The kids of today greatly appreciate that service. They do have a greater understanding than many might give them credit for.",106,Representatives Main Committee
218,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton,"Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs) (10.305544 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 August 2002 Acknowledging that it has been the work of governments of both sides of the political spectrum, I suspect that, along with the member for Cowan, the member for Bowman on the opposition side would have a high level of credibility, as he was a fine veterans’ affairs minister-as, indeed, the member for Maranoa was and the member for Hughes is now. In paying tribute to the member for Hughes as the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, I acknowledge the way in which she and the RSL President, Peter Phillips, are trying to involve those who have come from other cultural backgrounds to live in Australia. I believe very fine efforts are being made these days to involve all Australians of all backgrounds in this sense of commemoration and honour. This government and its predecessors have, over the last eight decades, developed a comprehensive repatriation system that recognises the special standing and the needs of the veterans community. The Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 is further evidence of this government’s continued commitment to improve the compensation and assistance that is provided to veterans and their dependants through the repatriation system. The system provides a wide range of benefits to compensate veterans and their dependants for injury, disability or death resulting from their service during wartime or other conflicts. This bill includes minor policy changes that will improve the operation of the repatriation system by removing some anomalies to ensure that all veterans and their dependants are treated fairly. Other changes included in the bill will improve the delivery of the benefits and services that are provided under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. The bill also includes amendments to the VEA to reflect legislative changes to the social security system that will ensure that both systems continue to operate consistently and fairly. The bill amends the compensation recovery provisions to remove the anomaly that has caused some civilian compensation payments that had been offset against a disability pension to also be counted as income for the purposes of the income test. The compensation recovery provisions are also being amended to provide for the direct recovery of debts from compensation payers and insurers in respect of the partner of a person who has received lump sum compensation. The bill will also clarify policy in relation to telephone allowance to ensure that eligible persons with a mobile telephone service and no traditional fixed line telephone service are eligible for the telephone allowance. The bill also contains two measures that will align the eligibility provisions for rent assistance for veteran pensioners with those of the Social Security Act 1991. The first will ensure that pensioners who receive a base rate family tax benefit with no rent component will also be eligible for rent assistance under the VEA. The second measure will ensure that the treatment of retirement village entry contribution payments under both acts is consistent for the purposes of being eligible for rent assistance. Further anomalies which will be removed by measures contained in the bill are those that relate to the eligibility criteria for the Pension Loans Scheme. The Pension Loans Scheme provides additional income support to eligible persons in the form of a loan. Included in the amendments are changes that will enable certain persons who are not a veteran or the partner of a veteran to have access to the scheme. Other changes will enable eligible income support supplement recipients to be eligible for the scheme from the earlier qualifying age rather than from the pension age. Similar amendments to the eligibility criteria for the Commonwealth seniors health card have also been included in the bill to enable war widows and war widowers to be eligible for the Commonwealth seniors health card from qualifying age rather than from the pension age. During its six and a bit years in office, this government has had a demonstrated commitment to veterans and their families to improve the repatriation system to ensure that it continThursday, 22 August 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 5545 ues to meet the needs of those who have served our country. The Howard government continues to demonstrate that commitment to veterans and their families with the initiatives contained in this bill. No group in our community is more deserving of our admiration and gratitude than those men and women who have served Australia in times of war and conflict. The passage of this bill will therefore be yet another step forward in meeting the changing needs of the veteran community. The bill will ensure that greater numbers of the veteran community will be able to enjoy the high standard of compensation and care that the repatriation system provides through increased access to its generous benefits and quality health care serviceswhich are, indeed, the envy of the rest of the world. I commend this bill to the chamber. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Debate resumed from 27 June. Second Reading Ms WORTH (Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing) (10.41 a.m.)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill contains two classes of amendments relating to the Health Insurance Commission. The first class of amendments modernises the financial regime applying to the Health Insurance Commission. The commission has been operating under a much less flexible investment, budget estimates and borrowing framework than that which applies to other non-GBE Commonwealth authorities. The effect of the amendments will be to apply the general provisions of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997, applying to such authorities in the areas of budget estimates and investment of surplus moneys, to the commission. In addition, the commission will be able to borrow money for the purposes of its functions, with the written approval of the finance minister. Currently the commission is unable to borrow moneys at all and has only a limited ability to invest surplus moneys. The commission will better be able to deliver quality outcomes and substantial savings both to itself and to the Commonwealth with the application of a more flexible and modern-but still properly transparent and accountable-financial regime. The amendments will also remove the ‘hedging’ provisions of the act, reflecting the position that ‘hedging’ is no longer an appropriate feature of the commission’s financial regime, given its current functions. The other class of amendments concerns the number of commissioners of the Health Insurance Commission. This proposed amendment relates to legislative changes made at the time of the separation of Medibank Private from the Health Insurance Commission. Under the Health Insurance Commission (Reform and Separation of Functions) Act 1997, the number of commissioners, in addition to the chairperson and managing director, increased for a five-year period from seven to nine, but then was to decrease to five. The amendment contained in this bill will operate so that the number of these additional commissioners will be seven, rather than five. Originally it had been thought that the optimum number of commissioners, in addition to the chairperson and managing director, beyond the transitional period covering Medibank Private’s separation from the Health Insurance Com5546 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 August 2002 mission, was five. However, it is now clear that the commission’s continued effective functioning, particularly in terms of its committee structures, will require a complement of seven additional commissioners, looking beyond November 2002. I present the signed explanatory memorandum to this bill. 2002 seeks to amend the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 to increase the number of commissioners from five to seven, remove the ability of the commission to enter into hedging arrangements, allow the commission to invest its surplus moneys and to borrow money, and modify the budget estimates provisions applying to the commission. Labor recognises the need for the Health Insurance Commission to have a sufficient number of commissioners to adequately conduct its work. The Health Insurance Commission has acquired the responsibility for managing measures, including the private health insurance rebate. For this reason, we on this side of the chamber support an increase in the number of commissioners from five to seven. Given the record of the Howard government and the Treasurer’s flippant attitude to his previous gambling losses-an attitude you can only afford when you are gambling with taxpayers’ money and not your own-Labor is happy to support the provision that would prevent the Health Insurance Commission from engaging in financial hedging. Earlier this year, Treasury figures showed that under Mr Costello’s management of the currency swaps program the government lost $4.8 billion over the past four years. As a result, Australian taxpayers have been landed with Peter Costello’s gambling debts. A Productivity Commission report found that Australia’s 290,000 problem gamblers lose $3.5 billion a year. Casino Costello single-handedly cost Australian taxpayers even more than that. So we support the measures that remove the capacity of the Health Insurance Commission to enter into hedging arrangements-unless handled with care, it would have the potential for sustained significant financial losses. Provisions that would allow the Health Insurance Commission to borrow moneys for the purpose of its statutory function and which remove the special budget estimates provision applying to the Health Insurance Commission have caused Labor some concern. We have had a number of detailed briefings on these two measures and the HIC has advised us that the commission, not the Department of Finance and Administration, requested these changes. With respect to the provisions which allow borrowing, the commission has indicated that there are no specific projects identified for which borrowings would be made. While the borrowing provision is uncapped, the commission has indicated to the opposition that any single loan would not exceed $30 million, with interest rates fixed at the 10-year bond rate. It is claimed that such borrowing provisions provide efficiencies to the Commonwealth. On the basis of the detailed advice from the government on these matters we are now satisfied that borrowings made under this provision would be required to be adequately reported through the Senate estimates process. During that process we will monitor any implementation of this borrowing authority. The opposition believes that the Health Insurance Commission-with its role in Medicare, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the private health insurance rebate-should be subject to strong and detailed reporting requirements. The opposition has every right to be concerned about the accountability of government spending within the health portfolio. In particular, the government has moved the costs of the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate into the contingency reserve, where it can no longer be subject to detailed scrutiny as to future projections. As a result, it will be impossible to know just how much the government is",111,Representatives Main Committee
219,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (10.43 A.m.),"The Health Insurance Commission Amendment BillThursday, 22 August 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 5547 spending on a measure which it says is designed to ease the burden on the public hospital system. When the government says it is doing something to ease the burden on public hospitals-something the government in fact rarely says-it is always very difficult to believe. The explicit justification given by the Howard government for the private health insurance rebate initiative was that it would help take the pressure off public hospitals. But the latest figures on hospital admissions seem to indicate that the private health insurance rebate has not taken any pressure off public hospitals. In its first full year of operation, its effect on the rate of public hospital admissions was negligible and the median waiting time for elective surgery in public hospitals nationally was unchanged at 27 days. Labor’s ultimate view of the rebate and our policy position on it in the run-up to the next election will be guided by a number of considerations, not the least of which will be an aversion to putting more financial pressure on Australian families. For families, the rebate is not a health issue but a family budget issue. With respect to the changes to the special budget estimates provisions, the bill applies to the Health Insurance Commission and the general provisions of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 that currently apply to the other non-government business enterprises such as the CSIRO. On the basis of the briefings provided to the opposition by the government we have been satisfied that the new reporting requirements which will apply to the Health Insurance Commission are no weaker than those currently in place. Accordingly, Labor does not oppose the bill. Commission Amendment Bill 2002. I wish to speak on three issues: firstly, how the bill relates to my electorate of Flinders and, in particular, the need for an action plan for health facilities in Rosebud and on the Mornington Peninsula; secondly, the government’s general package of reforms for the Health Insurance Commission and how it will assist with the quality of health services in Australia generally; and, thirdly, the specific provisions of the bill and how they will help with the administration of the Health Insurance Commission’s work and the quality of health care throughout Australia. I now turn to health facilities, the first of those elements. I wish to focus on the problems and challenges that face my electorate. RecentlyI have been fortunate to contribute to-and I have announced-a number of initiatives for the Gippsland side of my electorate, all of which have had a profound effect on health services. The first of these is the allocation of 40 aged care beds to Warley Hospital, on Phillip Island, and 27 home and community care places to the magnificent San Remo and District Health Centre. In addition to that announcement, a second medical practice-the Hazelwood Medical Practice-has opened and is a beneficiary of the government’s regional health program to assist doctors from regional areas, which has led to the increase in bulk-billing through the Hazelwood practice and through its competitors, which have now adopted bulk-billing. There has been a great improvement in the numbers of doctors, the choices available to patients and the capacity for patients to have their concerns met immediately. Only last week I was at the San Remo and district health and community centre to announce an additional package of approximately $500,000 over three years for mobile services in towns such as Grantville, Corinella, Coronet Bay, Pioneer Bay, San Remo and Rhyll, as well as many of the other small towns in the area, such as Bass and Woolamai. Under the government’s Regional Health Services Program, this will bring health services to all of these small towns.",114,Representatives Main Committee
220,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (10.49 A.m.),"I am delighted to speak today on the Health Insurance5548 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 August 2002 On the other side of the electorate, within the areas of Rosebud, Rye, the Mornington Peninsula coastal area and Hastings, we have made significant progress. But it is my view that there are still three challenges that need to be met: firstly, there is extreme difficulty attracting doctors to the southern portion of the Mornington Peninsula, which has been evidenced by the closure of two practices and the likely closure of a third practice in the near future; secondly, there has been a consequential decline in competition, the result being a decrease in the availability of Medicare bulk-billing facilities, which impacts particularly on the elderly and on low-income families. The point that has been made by many of those is that they accept the notion of a copayment but the challenge they face is that, if they pay the whole amount at the time of consultation, they need to be able to get the money back in as short a period of time as possible. So work needs to be done on that. I met last week with the general practice division of the Mornington Peninsula. We are making progress, and I have a number of recommendations. The third challenge we face on the Mornington Peninsula side of the electorate is the imminent closure of the Rosebud emergency services ward between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. due to the Peninsula Health Service’s inability to attract doctors to staff the emergency service centre during those hours. That is a matter for the state government, and I urge them to work on it immediately as a matter of priority. I understand from the director of the Peninsula Health Service that progress has been made, but there are significant challenges and risks to the community if the state government does allow the closure to occur. The interim solution is welcome, but we do need a permanent solution. It is my view that there are up to five steps that we can take to help with the fulfilment of the Health Insurance Commission’s objectives for the Mornington Peninsula. The first is the inclusion of the Rosebud coastal strip in the outer metropolitan doctors scheme. This strip is more than 60 kilometres by road from the Melbourne GPO. The second is the creation of a special training regime for Rosebud hospital to help attract doctors to the area and to the hospital. I urge the state government to take that on as a priority and to work with the federal government in that area. The third is some form, if it were possible, of direct allocation of provider numbers for the Rosebud area. The fourth, and this is an interesting one, is to approve the capacity of the Australian Locum Medical Service to provide telephone advice without having to directly charge patients referred by their doctors for such action. At present the director of the Australian Locum Medical Service has indicated to me that he would be delighted to offer the service to Rosebud residents. However, due to the lack of a dispensation to do so from the Health Insurance Commission, he is forced to charge patients directly, and this has a massive impact in decreasing the attractiveness of the service and therefore decreasing the ability of local doctors to provide an out-of-hours service. The fifth item in the action plan for discussion with the Health Insurance Commission is the establishment of a Medicare claims desk in the new Rosebud Centrelink office, which is about to be built. Rosebud is having a purpose-built Centrelink office, and it is my belief that, given that there are no Medicare claims offices within the entire electorate of Flinders and given that Flinders has suffered the greatest decline in bulk-billing over the last two years of any electorate nationally, it would be fair and appropriate to include a Medicare claims desk within that new purpose-built facility. I will be seeking the support of both the minister and the parliamentary secretary for this initiative, although I am aware of the challenges that the government are facing. All of those are positive steps which we propose to take in conjuncThursday, 22 August 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 5549 tion with the HIC, which brings me to the specific elements of the bill and the HIC more broadly. The HIC plays an important role in administering the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register, the Australian Organ Donor Register and the Medicare program, above all else. These programs are vital in the provision of health services to all Australians. The bill’s financial amendments are required because it is necessary to increase the flexibility of the HIC’s financial arrangements so that it will be better able to meet its health objectives and be able to bridge operational shortfalls if necessary. The bill will allow the HIC to control its borrowing appropriately. It is part of a wider plan to improve the HIC and its programs. In this year’s budget, the 2002-03 Commonwealth budget, there is $30 billion for the Health portfolio for this financial year. This compares with $18 billion in the period 1995-96-the last year of the Labor government. On that basis, there is a 60 per cent increase in the total budget. In addition, we have had a real increase of 28 per cent on the last agreement negotiated by the previous Labor government in relation to the provision of funding to the states and territories under the Australian Health Care Agreement. In the 2001 budget, we spent $22 million to support the Council of Safety and Quality in Health Care, which was itself a creation of the current government. Recently, under the 2002 budget, $300 million was provided for increased Medicare rebates for GP visits, $120 million was provided for GPs to allow them to develop their mental health expertise, $72 million was provided to increase the rates of women being screened for cervical cancer and $43 million was provided to increase the availability of after-hours and emergency care. All of these elements, I believe, are critical. In that context, the current Health Insurance Commission Amendment Bill 2002 contains two principal classes of amendments. The first is to improve the financial arrangements of the HIC and the second is to expand the number of commissioners. In looking at the financial arrangement amendments, it can be said that the current financial arrangements have significant room for improvement. That is the very reason why the government is seeking to make the changes. They operate under a position which is less than it should be in terms of flexibility for investment, budget estimates and the borrowing framework. They have no power to borrow moneys, they have very limited investment power and they may only invest surplus moneys for the performance of Medicare functions. The bill would enable the HIC to borrow for the purpose of their functions. However, there will be important legislative and internal controls. On the legislative front they will only be able to borrow with the written approval of the finance minister, and only for the purpose of the HIC’s functions. In terms of the internal HIC controls, the HIC policy and procedures will declare that there must be formal financial delegation processes. They will be benchmarked against best practice and there will be external audit reviews. By doing those things, the HIC will be in a more flexible position to deal with the financial requirements of a massive budgetary situation. I want to leave the bill itself at that level and, in my concluding remarks, return to my overview. Significant strides have been made within my own electorate of Flinders and within the country more generally in terms of the operation of the HIC and the practical delivery of services to individuals. From Phillip Island, I have had clear explanations from people that they have found it easier to obtain doctors’ services in the last year. They have found that there is more choice and that they have more flexibility. I also make the point that there are challenges, that we live in a time of scarcity. On all of these occasions, we are expanding the range of services. In doing that, I look to my own electorate and say that we have had some challenges. But I have had genuine representations 5550 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 August 2002 from people who look for greater flexibility. We look to achieve those results through the HIC and expansion of Medicare facilities. My final point is to make a plea to the doctors of the Mornington Peninsula to work with me and Bruce Billson to introduce the HIC online system. This is a system that allows patients to have immediate access to their rebate, paid directly to their own accounts. In that situation, I would urge the doctors of the Mornington Peninsula to adopt this system in their practices and surgeries, to work with us and to outline any challenges they face in implementing it. As a consequence of so doing, they will provide their patients with a service that will mean they will be able to input their Medicare rebate claims from the surgery and have them paid out immediately. It gives me great pleasure to commend the Health Insurance Commission Amendment Bill 2002 to the House. Ms WORTH (Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing) (11.02 a.m.)-in reply-In my role today as parliamentary secretary, I will sum up on this bill. Firstly, I thank the opposition for its support and for the timely passage of this bill through the House of Representatives-obviously, because of the lack of opposition. I thank the members for Lowe and Flinders for their contributions, although I am not sure that the member for Lowe spent much time speaking about this particular bill. It was good of him to take part in the debate. The member for Flinders as usual not only spelt out what was in the bill but also spoke passionately about his electorate, in which I know he has a great interest because of the number of letters he writes to both the minister and me about health related issues in his electorate. I compliment him on his contribution this morning and also on his very conscientious work for his electorate. As I said earlier this morning in the second reading speech, this bill relates to two aspects of the operation of the Health Insurance Commission: firstly, the financial regime under which the HIC operates, and, secondly, the number of commissioners which comprise the commission. The bill modernises the financial regime applying to the HIC in the areas of investment, budget estimates and borrowing. The other class of amendments concerns the number of commissioners of the HIC. From November this year, there will be seven commissioners in addition to the chairperson and the managing director. Again, I thank those who have contributed to this debate and commend the bill to the chamber. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Shortland Electorate Ms HALL (Shortland) (11.05 a.m.)-Shortland electorate is the 12th oldest electorate in Australia. Unfortunately, the resources within the electorate do not meet the needs of the people. As well as being the 12th oldest electorate in Australia, Shortland also has the 10th lowest median income, which I really think reflects to some degree the fact that it is such an ageing electorate. I have been so concerned about this issue that I decided we needed to introduce some local initiatives. For some time. I have been holding forums for older people within the electorate. This year I will be holding two. I feel that we still need to do a lot to improve things. Unfortunately, the government has not been making an effort within Shortland elector-",115,Representatives Main Committee
221,Mrs Deanne Kelly (Dawson) (11.04 A.m.),"I move:Thursday, 22 August 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 5551 ate. It has failed to ensure that there are adequate places in nursing homes and hostels. It is quite ridiculous that in Shortland electorate we get 1.8 community care packages per thousand people over the age of 70, while the national average is 10.3. Here you have the 12th oldest electorate in the country so far below the national average. It is very apparent to me that, despite the pleas, the many letters I have sent and the submissions that I have made to it, this government is determined to ignore the people of Shortland electorate. As I mentioned, I have been very concerned about the lack of resources and initiatives in Shortland electorate for some time, and about the fact that it is an ageing electorate. Over the last few years, I have been working with the Department of Social Work at Newcastle University and have been offering placements in my office to social work students. This year I have a fourth-year student in my office, Jenny Boddy, who is undertaking some research for me. It all comes from the fact that we have this ageing population in Shortland which has special needs and that we do need special programs and initiatives. In light of this, I believe it is important to understand what the community sees as important for the quality lifestyle that they need and deserve. Jenny Boddy is working from my office, conducting research into what over-55s in the community see as important for outstanding quality of life-the quality of life they deserve. The research is also seeking people’s ideas for projects in the community. It is a unique opportunity for people in Shortland to express their views and their ideas on what is important to have an enjoyable lifestyle. The ideas and suggestions will result in a community development project that probably a social work student from Newcastle University will undertake next year. To date, the research is indicating that an overwhelming number of participants see good health as essential for quality of life. Along with that goes access to health care and doctors; in fact, 85 per cent of the respondents said that it is very important, whilst the remaining 15 per cent said it is important. So obviously health is tops, as far as that issue goes. Along with good health, access to shops and services is also seen as essential, as are mental stimulation, exercise, healthy eating, financial security, financial support and companionship. This is not the first time. I have done this, as I mentioned. This follows on from research done by another social work student, Michael Whiteside, who did a project on the needs of older people in the electorate. I would also like at this stage to pay credit to Margot Kerley, who is here in the chamber. She is the secretary of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Ageing. That committee is doing some fine work. I thank her very much for meeting with Jenny Boddy yesterday and for giving her the benefit of her expertise in that area. This is an important project and it is essential that it be successful. (Time expired) Ryan Electorate: Small Business mittee room about small business and about the things that I am doing for small business in the community of Ryan. In particular, I had the pleasure of having the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Tony Abbott, visit my electorate a couple of weeks ago to launch the Ryan Small Business and Employment Advisory Committee which I have established to advise me, as the federal member for Ryan, on the major issues affecting local small businesses and the concerns of local operators in Ryan. This committee includes 16 small business people from Ryan. It is made up of small business owners and operators from a range of different backgrounds. It is an initiative that is consistent with my campaign promises during the election to support small business if I were to have the pleasure and the privilege of being the federal member for Ryan.",118,Representatives Main Committee
222,Mr Johnson (Ryan) (11.10 A.m.),"It gives me pleasure to say a few words in this com5552 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 August 2002 One of the most important things for our country is small business because it is the small businesses of our country that employ people and give the local communities and local suburbs throughout the country community support. I think that it is imperative that all governments at all levels, in particular the federal government, give full support and full weight to all that small and medium sized businesses do in our country. I know that this government, the Howard government, certainly does that and it is a great pleasure to be involved in supporting that as a junior member of the parliament and the federal member for Ryan. As I said, we had the pleasure of the workplace relations minister coming to launch the small business advisory committee, and he had the opportunity of meeting some of the members of that committee. I want to mention a few of those members, the backgrounds that they come from and the sorts of small businesses they have, because these people-the Australians in small business-are the people who are at the coalface, who are at the grass roots base of small business. They and their experiences will help all governments of whatever persuasion and at whatever tier in our system of government to develop good ideas, good outcomes and good policies. The workplace relations minister was certainly very enthusiastic and very supportive of this initiative. One member of the committee, Mr Tony Everett, is from The Gap and he has a business that has two employees. He established his business about 10 years ago, with his wife, and it is called the Safe-T School of Motoring. What he does is teach young people how to drive. This might seem to be an innocuous business but it is very important because he is imparting good habits to and good skills amongst the young people of our community who are beginning their driving lessons. Before he began his own small business, he had many other backgrounds and areas of interest and expertise, particularly with young people, which led him to establish this particular business. It seems to me that he is someone, with his experience of employing two people, who can impart to me as his federal member some of the difficulties, some of the challenges and some of the issues that he faces as an employer of two individuals. Of course, as an employer, he is giving a livelihood to two families, and it is very important that we listen to someone like him in terms of his small business. Someone else who is involved in the committee is Kay Gallagher. She runs The Gap Village News as well as a newsagency and comes into contact with many members of the community. She has all the credentials to be someone that can inform her federal member about the issues that come before her. I am delighted to be able to support small businesses in Ryan and assure them that they have my full support in promoting the issues that come before them into the national parliament. I look forward to working with them very closely to develop good solutions for their businesses.

Assistant principal and teacher, Miss Saitlik, writes: We hope that you as our Honourable Member of Federal Parliament may be able to relay these thoughts to the powers that be, simply to heighten their awareness that the young citizens of Australia have grave concerns and fears for others who share their world. Enclosed are letters from my students and additional information that will hopefully allow you to further your understanding of the significant contributions that our leaders of the future feel they can make in assisting the plights of those less fortunate than themselves. I will read the letters because I think they speak volumes. Sadly, I cannot read them all. Thursday, 22 August 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 5553 Dear Anna, At the beginning of this year we researched Afghanistan. But it was not until we watched a BBC documentary called The Silent Scream that we realised how Afghanistan has been torn apart by war and corruption. The documentary was about Afghan women and how their rights had been taken away from them. We felt great pain for Afghan women when we saw footage of them being beaten and humiliated in the streets. We were even more distraught when we were shown an execution of a woman who was accused of murdering her husband, yet she was only accused of it. She had been living in a small rundown prison cell with two children. She was killed in a stadium, men filed in by the dozen to watch. But as she lay dead on the ground they simply walked out showing no emotion as if it was no more than a movie. This just isn’t right. It is inhumane and unjust. We felt angry, angry that our country has turned away people in such helpless situations. So what that they did not become legal refugees, most of the people sold their homes and most of their possessions to come to Australia under the impression that they would be welcome and kept safe, but instead they have either been turned away and sent somewhere else like unwanted luggage, or sent to detention centres which are by no means any different from what they were living in. They have been insulted by their own religions, so what do they do? What do they believe in now? Is there anything left to believe in? We hope that you will take what we have said into consideration. We may only be twelve year olds, but we are entitled to our opinions and we are not the only ones who feel this way. Yours sincerely, Eleanor Simcoe, Kimberley Phillips and Erin Marsicovetere. Dear Anna, We are writing to you to inform you of the abuse of Afghan women. Recently we have been researching Afghanistan and have uncovered the harsh life of women in Afghanistan. A BBC documentary called The Silent Scream really made us feel angry. It is heart wrenching to think that Afghani women can be treated so awfully. The women in Afghanistan are treated like flies. They are beaten. They are some sort of life size punching bag. They are accused of crimes that they didn’t even commit. The Northern Alliance told them they could take off their burquas but only the bravest women do. In Afghanistan animals are treated with more respect and dignity than women. Some of the women follow the Muslim religion and in believing in that religion they get beaten. They get beaten for the tiniest things. They get beaten for not being with men, they get imprisoned for wearing bell bottom trousers. To add to that, would it be so hard to let the Afghanistan women in detention centres become Australian citizens? As the young girl said in the detention centre, ‘You send us back to Afghanistan, you send us back to die!’ We hope you thoroughly read this letter and get it as far as you can to John Howard. From Jaydie and Anita Dear Anna, Yesterday in Literacy our teacher put on a BBC documentary. She warned us before we saw it that it was cruel and harsh but that does not even start to describe it. The documentary includes scenes of starving women, beggars and widows. The documentary was about Afghan women. Some of the scenes were taken from hidden cameras underneath women’s burquas, and were not light hearted. We have a question for you. How come when some women in Afghanistan who finally escape the torture and seek help in our country are turned down by the government, when towns are advertising land and jobs and need people? Recently, we have been researching all different areas of Afghanistan and we read a book called Parvana. Parvana was a girl who had to pretend to be a male and dig up bones just for a job, and that was before her father was imprisoned. The book didn’t have a happy ending as most books do. This was partly what inspired us to write to you. How heartless would you be to walk into a town, shoot all the men then just leave like nothing happened? This is why we feel so strongly about this topic. Please reply. Yours sincerely, Julia Kathro and Courtney Spreen. These letters go on and on, and I will read from the last one: Dear Anna, At the start of this year our literacy group looked into and researched everything including Afghanistan. To accompany our research, we read a book called ‘Parvana’, the story of an 11 year old girl, struggling to survive all the day to day battles of living in Afghanistan. We also watched 2 documentaries called ‘Tales from a Suitcase’. They were interviews of Afghan people who moved to Australia and how they got through it all. 5554 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 August 2002 As I say, these letters go on and on, and they are absolutely heartwrenching. It is just so beautiful that the students of our country can grasp the torture that these people have gone through-but our government cannot. Paterson Electorate: Hospitals in my electorate of Paterson. That issue is the need for a public hospital in Forster-Tuncurry, which is at the northern end of my electorate. At the end of July, a newspaper in the ForsterTuncurry region called the Great Lakes Advocate published a very interesting story. The front page had the headline, ‘Grey power grows-NSW’s oldest median age’. The story gave details of the median age of local government areas according to the 2001 census, and the Forster-Tuncurry district had the highest. The census found that the median age for the Great Lakes area was 47.3. This is the highest median age of any local government area in New South Wales. It also showed the increase in population from previous census figures. In 1996, the population in Great Lakes was 28,722. In 2001, at the time of the census, the population had risen by 2.6 per cent from the 1996 figure to 32,598 people. What these figures also reveal is the need to plan for the future and the lack of planning for health needs in this area. Clearly, the evidence is there to say the Great Lakes area is a growing area, with many pensioners and self-funded retirees moving into the region. And why wouldn’t they? The Great Lakes area is one of the most beautiful areas in the nation. But one of the problems facing the region is the need for a public hospital in the Forster-Tuncurry area. Residents currently have access to private hospital facilities at Forster, at the Cape Hawke Community Private Hospital. I need to inform the House that this is an outstanding facility which provides a high quality of care for its patients. But, for residents without private cover, many are finding the trip to the public hospital extremely difficult because the closest public hospital to Forster-Tuncurry is the Manning Base Hospital in Taree, some 50 kilometres away. For some, without a car or a partner to drive them to the hospital, the journey to Taree can be a long, frustrating and expensive exercise. It is an issue, just like the need for 24-hour policing in the town, which will gain momentum in the lead-up to the New South Wales election in March next year. And, with the responsibility for setting up hospitals, it is an issue that the state government cannot ignore. With a growing ageing population, it is clear that the New South Wales government must start planning for the future in this area. They must start providing some funds outside of the Sydney area and to this coastal region, where the funds are needed. These census figures are a blueprint for how the area is growing demographically and how government needs to start spending to cater for services in the future. Failing to recognise these important needs in the local community will cause extreme hardship to elderly Australians, who have paid their taxes throughout their working life and deserve quality care that is affordable. Planning for the future is good government. The New South Wales government must look at these census statistics and carefully plan for the health needs of the Great Lakes area, including provision for public hospital services. One option that has been put to me by a member of the community is whether the state government can lease beds from the Cape Hawke Community Private Hospital. This position is not being rejected by the hospital, but the state government seems reluctant to embrace it. Although this is not a long-term solution, it may help those in Forster-Tuncurry who have difficulty travelling to Manning Base Hospital. The point, though, is that the future health needs of the area must be seriously looked at by all levels of government to make sure the provision of services is fair and affordable.",119,Representatives Main Committee
223,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (11.20 A.m.),"I rise today to speak on an important health issueThursday, 22 August 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 5555 I also take this opportunity to congratulate the volunteers who raise money for the palliative care unit at the Cape Hawke Community Private Hospital, known as Laurel Cottage. This unit provides great services to the local community because there is no public hospital and the unit is funded entirely by community donations. Since the unit first started over 12 years ago, volunteers have raised over $450,000. Every year they hold events such as movie screenings or fashion parades to raise the $40,000 to keep the unit going. There have been many volunteers who have generously given their time to this cause, and I would like to make special mention of the president of the group, Elizabeth Fisher, and Elizabeth Clarke, Robin Fisher and Frank Pushee on their achievements. Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, why is it that the things that are most important to us in life are funded by fetes and community fundraising rather than by governments? Aviation: Essendon Airport fringe of my electorate, has for some decades now been a quite controversial topic, largely because of perceptions in the local community of conflict between the residential character of the area and aviation operations. That is evidenced by a number of fatal accidents and tragedies over that time. Nonetheless, despite the residential concerns, the government has over recent times agreed to continue, at a diminished level, the aviation operations at the airport and has negotiated with a consortium involving Linfox and Becton to operate the airport. There are some positive features in those proposals in that the consortium obviously has a very strong commercial interest in intensifying commercial activity and development and hence jobs on the site, so this particular part of Melbourne is likely to benefit from that. However, there are serious problems in that process, the most notable problem being the exacerbation of very difficult traffic conditions, particularly at the interchange next to the airport between the Tullamarine Freeway leading on to City Link and the Calder Highway at that point. Already anyone who travels into Melbourne or out of Melbourne, particularly at peak hour, through that area knows just how difficult those traffic conditions are-and it is at the edge of a growing part of Melbourne. Intensification of activity associated with Essendon airport is going to really make that problem increasingly difficult. Regrettably, the Commonwealth government, in the process of negotiating management arrangements at the airport, has not done the very obvious thing of excising a portion of the airport land to enable improvement of the interchange at that point. It seems to me fairly negligent not to have done that, because there have been plans around for some considerable time to improve that interchange involving, as it would, the taking of some of the airport’s land, but it has not happened. It seems that a very essential step now for the Commonwealth to take is to recognise work needed at that interchange as being part of the Commonwealth program for roads of national importance. The Calder Freeway, as my colleague the member for Burke would be only too well aware, is recognised as a road of national importance and considerable work continues further north and west of Melbourne along that highway. But, at the end of the highway, where the highway reaches the Tullamarine Freeway and ceases to exist as a main road, it is absolute traffic chaos. Frankly, there is a need for the Commonwealth to recognise its need, in partnership with the Victorian government, to sort out the mess, particularly as its policies in relation to the development of Essendon airport are going to make the issue even more important. The state government talks about a figure of some $250 million being required to rebuild the interchange. WhilstI am not an engineer and would not want to second-guess engineering estimates, that seems to me to be very much at the upper end of what one could reasonably",122,Representatives Main Committee
224,Mr Sercombe (Maribyrnong) (11.25 A.m.),"The Essendon airport, which is at the5556 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 August 2002 expect. Land acquisition costs, which are presumably built into that, ought to be minimised because it ought to be possible for the Commonwealth and the state to negotiate a satisfactory arrangement with the airport operator because the airport operator will substantially benefit from improvement of the traffic conditions around the site. Frankly, the configuration of the airport and the roads into it at the moment are a bit of a mess, but, by some basic clever design, it may be possible for the airport operator to get a substantially better utilisation of parts of the sites which are presently landlocked by some effective design. I would expect land acquisition costs associated with road improvements would dramatically reduce that $250 million estimate and, in fact, depending upon the route across the airport that was agreed, it may be possible to significantly reduce construction costs as well. In this situation, whilst the local community undoubtedly loses through the Commonwealth’s determination to continue aviation activities at Essendon Airport, everyone expects that those aviation activities will significantly diminish over future years. With that caveat, a win-win-win situation is possible: a win for the Commonwealth in terms of getting much better access to what is Australia’s largest curfew free airport, Melbourne airport, by road improvements; a win for the operator of the airport in getting a better result; and a win for the local community in solving the very substantial problem of traffic congestion. (Time expired) Dunkley Electorate: Mature Age Unemployment occurring in the Dunkley electorate. A number of key stakeholders, training providers, participants in a Job Network program and I are putting together a project called the Mature Aged Career Collaboration. It is aimed at assisting and supporting local unemployed people who are over the age of 45. We know that economic and social drivers will, over time, increasingly promote mature age employment. However, more immediate action is required to ensure that the talent and capacity of the current mature age job seeker is not lost to the economy and to abate the significant personal costs of their joblessness. In 1976, Australia had 1.3 million people over the age of 65, which represented nine per cent of the total population. In March last year, there were 2.3 million people over the age of 65, or 12 per cent of the population. By 2016, there will be 3½ million people over the age of 65, representing 16 per cent of the total population. That will rise to 6.03 million by the middle of this century, meaning that 25 per cent of our entire population will be over the age of 65. Work is a key defining element of an individual’s character. As the Nelson committee recognised in its Age Counts report in the year 2000: Work puts us in a social context, defines the framework of our lives and gives each of us a sense of belonging and meaningful purpose. Being without a job not only devastates personal finances but also exacts a heavy social and human toll. In 1997, the ABS reported that nearly half of all men over the age of 45 were out of the workplace through retrenchment, redundancy or retirement. The unemployment rate for mature age people is lower than that for the general population, but the rate of long-term unemployment is much higher. This represents what the Nelson committee described as ‘the tip of an iceberg of quiet anguish’. Access Economics reported at the start of last year that the working age population currently grows by about 170,000 people but that, if current population trends continue, by the year 2020 the entire working age population will grow by just 125,000 people for the whole decade. Clearly, we need to be cleverer, smarter and more engaged as a nation in ensuring that mature age people are able to fully participate in the workplace.",123,Representatives Main Committee
225,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (11.30 A.m.),"I rise today to talk about an exciting collaborationThursday, 22 August 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 5557 In Dunkley, we are bringing the players together to try to support the re-employment and re-engagement of mature age job seekers. We have found that, in addition to tackling the unjustified bias that many employers have against employing a mature age person, there are things we can do to work with, to support and to encourage the mature age job seeker. Computer literacy is increasingly recognised as a core competency without which it is very difficult to gain employment. We are putting in place an IT skills program for job seekers so that they can display a level of computer competency, or at least the absence of fear of computer technology, to prospective employers. In terms of positivity and self-confidence, there is the need to project an engaging character that is worthy and valued in the workplace. Also, the labour market has changed. Some mature age job seekers have not sought employment in the workplace for about 20 years and find that the tactics, the choices and the opportunities that were appropriate 20 years ago are now not part of the labour market. The last issue, which is the most important one, in my view, is the concept of workplace mobility. A lot of people who have worked in traditional areas of employment only see work opportunities in that area, whereas the skills and competencies they have are quite transferable. We will be working with those job seekers to recognise their abilities and to make sure that they are fully engaged in the workplace. Tzvi Lachman and Melody Rewakowski are working with us, and they have done a lot of good work in the state of Oregon. We also have Your Employment Solutions and Barry Smith helping us. SkillsPlus Peninsula are helping with the training venue, IT capacity and the mentoring that is needed for these mature age job seekers.
