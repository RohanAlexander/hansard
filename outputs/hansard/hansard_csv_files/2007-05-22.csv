(2) In respect of each Commonwealth-funded program identified in Part (1), how many (a) community organisations, (b) schools, (c) businesses or (d) individuals received funding in (i) 2001, (ii) 2002, (iii) 2003, (iv) 2004, (v) 2005 and (vi) 2006.

In respect of question 1 the information about the programs administered by the department and their aims and objectives is contained in Portfolio Budget Statements and other publicly available documents. In respect of questions 2 and 3 the department does not manage program funding along electorate lines and providing the information would be resource intensive and not consistent with appropriate allocation of Departmental resources. Information regarding the department’s funding expenditure can be found in the Department of Families, Communities Services and Indigenous Affairs Annual Report which is also available on the FaCSIA website at: http://www.facsia.gov.au/ Treasury: Staffing (Question No. 5038) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 7 December 2006: (1) For the remainder of the 2006-07 financial year, how many additional staff does the Minister’s department and agencies expect to employ. (2) For the 2006-07 financial year to date, what efficiency gains have been made by the Minister’s department and agencies.

198,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) The Treasury administers one programme, the HIH Claims Support Scheme, that community organisations, businesses and individuals in the federal electorate of Throsby can apply for funding from. In order to qualify for support from the scheme individuals and not-for-profit organisations must have held an HIH policy at the time of the collapse of the company and have suffered an insurable loss or have been receiving salary continuance or other payments from HIH at that time. Eligibility for assistance is also means tested for some types of claim. Small businesses in Australia may also qualify for claims assistance in some circumstances. The scheme closed to new applicants in February 2004. However late claims may be made in limited circumstances.

199,Mr Brough,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Aviation Security (Question No. 5528) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 20 March 2007: Did the Wheeler Report recommend that criteria be established to determine the conditions under which an airport should become, or cease to be, a Counter-Terrorism First Response (CTFR) airport; if so, has his department established such a review and if so, (a) when, (b) by whom was the review conducted and (c) what are the criteria. Yes. In response to the recommendation of the Wheeler Report a review of the criteria for CTFR airports was undertaken by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the Department of Transport and Regional Services (DOTARS). The Government considered the review in April 2006 and has decided that the determination of any new airport that requires AFP resources will be informed by a risk assessment undertaken by AFP and DOTARS. Aviation Security (Question No. 5529) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 20 March 2007: When was the Wheeler Report received by the Government and, since the release of the report, has his department reviewed which airports are to be Counter-Terrorism First Response airports.

No. Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (Question No. 5547) Mr Georganas asked the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 21 March 2007: Following recent changes to superannuation legislation, are self-funded retirees whose retirement income is a product of savings strategies funded from after-tax income at potentially greater risk of exceeding the income test threshold and not qualifying for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card due to loss of tax rebate. Eligibility for the CSHC is based on a person’s adjusted taxable income, which is not affected by a tax rebate.",127,Questions In Writing
203,Mr Vaile,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,128,Questions In Writing
204,Mr Brough,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:From1 July 2007 superannuation benefits paid from a taxed source to a person aged 60 or over will no longer be considered to be part of a person’s taxable income. Therefore after this time, some people who are currently unable to qualify for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC), who have income from a taxed superannuation source, will be able to satisfy the income test for the CSHC. That is, contrary to the inference in the question, the measures are more beneficial to self funded retirees. Tourism Australia (Question No. 5559) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, in writing, on 21 March 2007: (1) What was the official title of Tourism Australia’s $180 million international campaign at its launch in February 2006. (2) Has the name of Tourism Australia’s international campaign changed; if so, why and when did this occur. Fran Bailey-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Tourism Australia’s international tourism campaign which was launched on 23 February in Sydney is titled ‘A Uniquely Australian Invitation’ with the tag line ‘So Where the Bloody Hell Are You?’ A copy of the Tourism Australia press release issued on 23 February is attached. (2) The name of the campaign has not changed. Defence Capability Plan (Question No. 5564) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 21 March 2007: (1) What assumptions were used to produce the diagram on page 1 of the 2006-16 Defence Capability Plan. (2) What are the reasons for the differences between the two Projected Capability Plan series and the two Total Major Capital Equipment series, and what method was used to smooth the results of these four series. (1) The graph shows the cumulative funding that the Government planned to provide for the Major Capital Equipment Program over the relevant 10 year planning period. For 2004-14, this refers to the 10 years between 2004/05 and 2013/14, while for 2006-16 this refers to the 10 years between 2006-07 and 2015-16. No assumptions were made as the graph reflects the actual planning provisions. (2) The 2006-16 Total Major Capital Equipment Series is higher than the 2004-14 series due to the continuing increase in planning provisions the Government has provided Defence since the 2000 White Paper. For much of the timescale where the two series overlap, the figures are generally similar. However, there are two key differences. The first is that towards the end of the overlap period (2011/12 to 2013/14), the 2006-16 series benefits from the Government’s 2006/07 Budget decision to extend the three per cent growth that was originally only agreed until 2010/11. The second difference is that the 2004-14 series contains the two earliest and hence smallest figures, while the 2006-16 series contains the two latest and hence largest figures. The major reason for the difference between the two Projected Capability Plan Series is the continuation of the three per cent growth to 2015/16. This increased the DCP planning provisions by around $2 billion over the period 2011/12 to 2015/16. There was no particular attempt made to smooth the graph. It was produced using a series of straight lines joining annual funding figures. The scale, however, makes irregularities difficult to see. Defence Capability Plan (Question No. 5582) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 22 March 2007: In respect of each project listed in the Table titled “Proposals by Estimated Expenditure”, pages 141 to 144 of the Defence Capability Plan 2006-2016, what is the estimated expenditure for each project for each financial year from 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2016. (1) For commercial reasons, it is not in the Commonwealth’s interests to disclose the total estimated cost of unapproved projects or details on the future established cashflows.

On6 June 2005, OATSIH received advice that the Office of the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations (ORAC) was conducting a review of the Goreta Aboriginal Corporation under s60 of the Aboriginal Associations and Councils Act (Cth) 1976 (the Act). On5 July 2005, at the request of the Goreta Aboriginal Corporation Board, OATSIH commenced negotiations with Wakefield Health seeking their agreement to continue the delivery of the health services previously provided by the Goreta Aboriginal Corporation, including the transfer of On 20 July 2005, ORAC advised OATSIH that on 13 July 2005 it had issued a s71 notice requiring the Goreta Aboriginal Corporation to give reason why an Administrator should not be appointed due to breaches of the Act.

(2) Does the Government plan to phase out DEN providers. (3) How can DEN providers plan for the future when the anticipated growth that they were established to meet has not occurred. (4) Will the Government acknowledge the set-up costs of DEN providers and offer compensation for lack of revenue. (5) Is he aware that current clients of DEN providers may be (a) sent to a Job Network agency that does not have the capacity to provide the requisite level of support, (b) put on a waiting list for a Personal Support Programme or (c) forced to seek work beyond the limits of their capabilities and paid a benefit of lower value than the DSP. (6) How does the practice outlined in Parts (1) to (5) encourage people back into the work force, in line with the Welfare to Work Reforms. (1) Job Capacity Assessments determine a job seeker’s work capacity and the most appropriate Australian Government Employment Service to assist him or her return to work. This includes referring job seekers to the Disability Employment Network, Job Network, Vocational Rehabilitation Services, the Personal Support Programme or the Job Placement, Employment and Training Programme. Not every person with disability requires the specialist assistance available under the Disability Employment Network.

The Department is always willing to discuss any concerns individual providers may have. (5) As per (1), Job Capacity Assessments refer job seekers to the most appropriate Australian Government Employment Service to assist them return to work.

212,Dr Stone,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(6) The Australian Government provides a range of services to assist job seekers with disability. These programmes are tailored to the different needs of job seekers and include Job Network, Disability Employment Network and Vocational Rehabilitation Services. These services are highly successful in assisting people with disability to find employment. For example, Job Network records over 50 000 job placements for job seekers with disability each year. Between1 July 2006 and 20 April 2007, over 6 200 Disability Employment Network participants and 5 900 Vocational Rehabilitation Service participants have achieved a 26-week outcome. New Uncapped streams of the Disability Employment Network and Vocational Rehabilitation Service were also introduced on 1 July 2006 to assist all job seekers with a partial work capacity affected by the changes to the Disability Support Pension under Welfare to Work. Between1 July 2006 and 20 April 2007, over 17 500 job seekers have accessed these new services.
