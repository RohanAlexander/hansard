That system of registration gives specific case which arose recently in the building unions a large number of very considerable industiy. I suppose I should declare my interest advantages. It is sometimes not realised just how in this matter. I appeared in the case when it was extensive those advantages are.

That is only right and proper that the Government an enormous and very valuable advantage to should take steps to ensure that the union acts unions which are registered under the Act.

Hence, if advantages of some quite stringent provisions for the keeping these sorts are to be given to unions which apply of accounts and for the auditing of those for preference or which obtain this exclusive accounts.
