It being 5.00Thursday, 16 August 2007 ----Paige Robertson Dr EMERSON (Rankin) (9.30 am)-I want to speak today about a special Australian, Logan City student Paige Robertson. At the tender age of 14, Paige has a greater appreciation of life than most people in our generation. Paige has a congenital heart defect and has had open-heart surgery four times. She has had closed-heart surgery twice. She has survived bacterial endocarditis, which is a life-threatening infection that attacks the heart. Not content just to be a survivor, Paige has made it her mission to help other kids with heart conditions. Paige is the founder and president of Heartkids Queensland support group, Kidz4 Heartkidz, and was Logan’s Young Citizen of the Year in 2007. Paige raises funds to assist children suffering with congenital heart complaints, to help them fulfil their own little wishes. Her latest initiative is called Wish you Well. It raised enough funds to present Julian Summers, a Groves Christian College year 1 pupil, with a laptop computer to help him work while away from school due to his condition. Paige is a true visionary. She is an example of what one young person can do to make a difference to so many young lives. When I say ‘many lives’, I mean it. We need only look at the facts. One in 100 children is born with a congenital heart defect. That is just over 2,000 children a year. Congenital heart defect is the No. 1 cause of child death. Congenital heart defects can never be completely cured and, sadly, for many they can never be treated. Paige has been through the system and wants to make a difference to kids’ lives. She has initiated several programs for kids and their siblings to make their struggle just a little bit happier. One of these initiatives is Heartkidz cams. Paige wants to supply every CHD kid with a Heartkidz cam so they can interact with their teachers and friends while in treatment at home. Contact with friends and, yes, even teachers gives kids the hope that they are not alone in their struggle. I would recommend that if the government is prepared to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on marginal seats in the lead-up to the election it could afford to spare the money to make one girl’s vision come true. At 14 years of age, Paige Robertson is truly an inspirational young Australian. Recreational Fishing Community Grants Program government funding of close to $100,000-in fact, $97,500-which will be put towards a state-of-the-art fish cleaning station at Mooloolaba on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast. The Maroochy Shire Council facility, to be located near the Parkyn Parade boat ramp, is expected to include a refrigerated bin for fish waste. This will reduce the dumping of fish frames into the Mooloolah River. Of course, as we know, those fish frames can potentially attract sharks, creating problems for the people who use the waterways. Fishing is very popular activity on the Sunshine Coast for both locals and tourists. These new facilities will add an extra level of hygiene and safety to those who wish to clean their catch before they head home or to their accommodation. Importantly, the new facility will also reduce the unwanted problems caused by the dumping of fish waste into the river. MAIN COMMITTEE",125,Adjournment
177,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ir Causley) Took The Chair At 9.30 Am.,,126,Statements By Members
178,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (9.33 Am),"I am particularly pleased today to talk about AustralianThe Mooloolaba fish cleaning station is among 110 projects across the nation that are sharing some $4.4 million from round 5 of the Australian government’s Recreational Fishing Community Grants Program. The Commonwealth contribution of $97,500 will be about 50 per cent of the cost of the facility, and the rest of the cost will be put in by the Maroochy Shire Council, which is also designing the fish cleaning station. Around $14.1 million has been provided under this program for projects such as boat ramps, fishing platforms, jetties, educational programs, fishing clinics and rescue activities. Groups such as fishing organisations and other community groups and clubs will benefit from the grants, as will keen anglers and those who only fish occasionally. This is not the first of these grants that we have been able to obtain for the electorate of Fisher on the Sunshine Coast. Last October we got close to $40,000-in fact, $39,422-for six new fish cleaning stations at popular Caloundra city fishing sites. These are dividends to the Australian community from 11 years of sound economic management by the Liberal and National party government. We would not be able to put in these positive community initiatives if we had not been able to grasp the nettle, repay Labor’s debt and manage the economy well. I know that the member for Moncrieff, which is on the Gold Coast, shares my sentiments with respect to that because I know that fishing is also a recreational activity in his area-but the fish catches there are not as good as those on the Sunshine Coast, which is much more pristine! Having said that, I am very pleased to applaud this Australian government project. It will benefit tourists and locals, and I hope that we will be able to obtain further grants of a similar nature. (Time expired) Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (9.36 am)-A few weeks ago I met with Bernie Banton, from the Asbestos Diseases Foundation of Australia, about the government’s failure to list Alimta on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for people with mesothelioma, the most debilitating and aggressive asbestos related disease. The life expectancy of such a patient is just five months from the time of diagnosis. Recent studies show that patients who take Alimta and Cisplatin live longer than those treated with Cisplatin alone-significantly, up to three months longer or more. Alimta not only increases life expectancy, by inhibiting tumour growth, but improves the sufferer’s quality of life in its final stages through reduced fatigue, cough pain and loss of appetite. The governments of France, Sweden and Japan subsidise the drug for sufferers in those countries and the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recently approved the use of Alimta in the treatment of mesothelioma. In Australia, it is approved for sufferers of lung cancer caused by smoking but not for sufferers of mesothelioma caused by asbestos fibres. As the drug costs $18,000 for an 18-week course, it is out of reach for many sufferers. We are particularly aware of asbestos related disease in my electorate because the James Hardie plant in Camellia was a major employer in the region for decades. Whole families worked there, and we all know someone who is suffering. After my meeting with Bernie Banton, I took the unusual step of writing to the federal Minister for Health and Ageing asking him to reconsider the decision not to list Alimta on the PBS for mesothelioma sufferers-unusual because in general I support arms-length decisions by medical experts but this is an unusual case caught between state and federal responsibility: MAIN COMMITTEE health services caught up in blame shifting, cost shifting and demarcations which makes Alimta available to some people in some states, depending on how they contracted the disease, but leaves no access for others. People who contract this disease because they played on the floor as children while their father demolished a fibro wall are not covered, but, thankfully, people who were exposed to asbestos at work are covered in some states. We in government sometimes think it makes sense to separate responsibilities. Sometimes it does, but only if the purpose of dividing responsibility between state and federal governments is to improve the effectiveness with which we address the problem, not, as in this case, if dividing responsibilities becomes a way to avoid addressing the problem, to make it someone else’s responsibility and to avoid the cost, or inadvertently leaves glaring holes and inequity for sufferers. We are talking here about health and the quality of life of people and their loved ones who have just a few months left to share. Australia has the highest reported rate of mesothelioma in the world. All reports indicate that the rate will grow in future decades before declining. I am still waiting for a response to my letter to the Minister for Health and Ageing. I am aware that his letter to the Asbestos Disease Foundation suggested that this is a state matter, but while I am waiting I would like to remind the whole government that before the last election the Minister for Health and Ageing made a commitment to support cancer treatment for sufferers of asbestos related disease. Perhaps it was not a core promise, but for whatever reason sadly we are still waiting for the commitment to be honoured. (Time expired) Gold Coast Hospital engulfing the Gold Coast Hospital. It is a crisis because the simple facts are that the Beattie Labor government has underfunded, understaffed and ignored the Gold Coast Hospital for far too many years. Unfortunately for what is Australia’s sixth largest and fastest-growing city, we are now faced with the consequence where our Gold Cost Hospital, despite the best efforts of staff and the best efforts of doctors, is constantly shackled by a lacklustre state Labor government that has simply under-resourced that hospital. The consequence of that for my city is profound. What is clear is that we have front-page article after front-page article talking about the absolute shambles that is the public health system on the Gold Coast. The question could be asked: what has the Howard government done about it and what have I done about it? I am pleased to say that I am part of a government that has provided record funding to the Beattie Labor government-some $8 billion under the Australian Health Care Agreement-to ensure that they have at their disposal the kinds of resources necessary to provide the citizens of our city, the constituents in my electorate, with the kind of first-class health care that they are they are looking for. Unfortunately, despite the $8 billion record funding that the Beattie Labor government have received, the Gold Coast is simply not getting its fair share from the state Labor government, because they would rather choose to spend that money elsewhere in the state. The consequences are front pages like this one that I have seen in my local newspaper, talking about hospital patients walking away from the hospital. We have seen a carry-on where ambulances line up outside the emergency ward at the Gold Coast Hospital with patients waiting to be treated. The Gold Coast Bulletin editorial from 26 July this year stated: MAIN COMMITTEE",126,Statements By Members
179,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff) (9.39 Am),"I rise today to talk about the crisis that is currentlyAlready the Gold Coast Hospital regularly goes on by-pass, while patients being kept in ambulances in the street waiting for beds to become vacant are not unheard of. If an epidemic were to occur, the prospect of patients lined in the street as is the case in third-world countries may be the next we see on the front page. It simply is not good enough. I have got to say that we are growing tired of the Beattie Labor government’s false promises. I have here a photograph of a sign erected on the proposed site of the new Gold Coast Hospital. It says at the bottom: ‘Project commencing early 2007’. It is the middle of August, and the state Labor government have not even turned a sod of soil on that site. With the $8 billion investment provided by the Howard government to the Queensland Labor government, it is time Labor stopped pretending they really are concerned about health and actually started delivering for my constituents and for the residents of my city. Newcastle Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (9.42 am)-Yesterday the developer General Property Trust released a $500 million redevelopment plan for the Newcastle CBD, which it is hoped will lead to a significant revitalisation of the city centre and the creation of around 3,000 direct jobs. The plan involves opening up the Hunter Street mall, the main thoroughfare, and redeveloping the surrounding site to include residential, commercial, retail and entertainment outlets. For some time the CBD of Newcastle has been a missing link in the revitalisation of our city. Now this development has the potential to complement the successful work that has been done in the Honeysuckle precinct and create a new retail heart to our city. Under Labor’s Better Cities Program, the waterfront at Honeysuckle has been transformed into a vibrant cafe, commercial and residential area. I am proud to say that, having been a board member for almost five years of the Honeysuckle Development Corporation, the results are excellent. Similarly, the GPT proposal looks like an opportunity to capture retail, business, tourism and entertainment opportunities for our growing population. There has been much debate in Newcastle recently about crime and antisocial behaviour in the inner city and about the balance between development and protecting heritage. This proposal by GPT can be a great opportunity for community discussion about how our city moves forward, how we balance a vibrant nightlife with a growing number of residents and how we create modern amenities while remaining true to our heritage values. I look forward to assisting at all levels of government the smooth progress of this development so that its potential is optimised and the right balance is struck. By working together, I am confident we can get a great outcome for the city of Newcastle. I also know that hypothetical designs by Newcastle University architecture students for the civic precinct just west of the Hunter Street mall are currently on display and there are discussions and plans afoot for the redevelopment of the west-end itself. A revitalised CBD, served by rail into the heart of the city, with the Honeysuckle precinct and the civic cultural precinct to the west, plus the Coal River Heritage precinct and the Newcastle Hospital redevelopment site to the east, presents an exciting prospect and vision for a new beating city heart. Such a heart could also spread new energy and, we would hope, reinforce the links, both physical and knowledge based, to our new centres of learning at the university, TAFE and CSIRO; to our innovative manufacturing, industrial and sustainable energy centres; to our air and seaports; and to our growing suburbs and residential centres. These are MAIN COMMITTEE very exciting times for the city of Newcastle and an opportunity to create a very modern and vibrant liveable city. With climate change upon us, of course, the challenge of creating sustainable cities is great, but, in the wake of the long weekend storms in Newcastle, creating survivable and liveable cities is also essential. We can meet these challenges with a vision of creative energy, and certainly this proposed investment is a mark of confidence in the future of Newcastle. I congratulate GPT on its commitment and I look forward to examining the details of the proposal and helping to ensure we get the best outcome for our city. (Time expired) Rural Health Services Australia, and particularly in regional Wakefield, South Australia. Stephen Holmes, who has been very actively involved in the RDAA and is a GP in Clare, in the north of Wakefield, describes very passionately and accurately the demise of rural communities when health services are wound back. He uses as an example what happened in the township of Blyth when their hospital was closed down a number of years ago. Unfortunately, there are moves around Australia to reduce services. On TV just this week on The 7.30 Report, Professor Leeder was advocating a reduction of services and further centralisation of regional health services, claiming essentially that rural people could not deliver safe health services. The RDAA certainly contests that and highlights a deal of research that shows that rural communities can in fact deliver safe health services. I am disturbed at this time to see that the South Australian government continues its program of merging hospital boards, taking elements of control away from local communities and closing things like obstetric services at the same time that we have groups like SARRAH, who represent allied health professionals; RDAA and others calling for increased services in rural communities. At the same time, the federal government is increasing obstetric support by having additional payments to provide obstetric services in country areas. In Wakefield we are providing things like the out-of-hours services in Gawler and additional positions for doctors. There are a range of things happening to make these services more viable and effective, so I am disappointed to see actions which are closing these down. The future of our communities is good in regional South Australia. The Adelaide Plains area around Balaklava is an example. There is a hospital there, and there is a great deal of growth in Port Wakefield, with the Wakefield Waters development. Primo have just decided to reinvest there. There is a huge potential for that area, but what people are calling for is not only things like adequate education but also adequate health. So, at a time when our communities are looking to expand, they are looking for this certainty not of having heart surgery but, the basic things like obstetrics and primary care following an emergency. Those kinds of services need to be preserved in our country hospitals so that our communities can grow and prosper as they clearly can do and wish to do. I welcome the federal government’s initiatives to support this and I call on Minister Hill in South Australia to revisit some of his thinking about downgrading rural health services.

181,Mr Price (Chifley) (9.48 Am),"Again in the local papers the New South Wales TeachersParliament House-this, of course, is incorrect: there is one teacher and one parentexpressing keen disappointment that I have not been prepared to take up their issues. It is true that a number of schools have written to me about funding. I think the Teachers Federation have run one of the most dishonest public campaigns that I have ever witnessed. They suggest that public schools receive less funding than private schools. The truth is that public schools overwhelmingly get money from the state government and from the federal government and private schools overwhelmingly get money from the federal government and a small component from the state government. No public school-high school or primary school-receives less taxpayer funding from both sources than the private schools in my electorate. I refuse to campaign on the basis that private schools in my electorate should get zero funding and all taxpayer funding should go to public schools. Mr Newbold, who is the federation rep at Rooty Hill, has said that there has been a long campaign to get a library at Rooty Hill High School, and that is true. But I am pleased to say that we-that is, Richard Amery, me, the principal, the former school captain Patrick Keating and the students in the community-have been very successful, and it is well underway. Mr Newbold never mentions in his press release that the federal government has contributed $2.343 million or 60 per cent of the funding for that particular project. I value what is done at Rooty Hill High School. I was recently there for the induction of the new school leaders. I was particularly pleased that Sylvester Aben, whom I had seen in a detention centre, has now been given a leadership position at that school. Indeed, the school principal has been recognised with an award for the leadership she provides. I will stand by public schools and I will advocate for public schools, but I am not going to do it to the detriment of private schools. Royal Australian Air Force Base Richmond nouncing last Saturday that the Royal Australian Air Force base at Richmond will remain open permanently. There will be no more uncertainty for those who serve on the base and for the people of the Hawkesbury. RAAF Base Richmond is an institution. The base was established in 1925 and was the first for New South Wales and the second in Australia. The base has been part of the Hawkesbury for over 80 years. The base served a major role from 1923 through to 1925 and now is a hub of logistic support for the Australian Defence Force in Sydney. Richmond RAAF base provides support for specialised defence units, including the Tactical Assault Group (East), the 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, and the Incident Response Regiment. It is also the home of the C130 airlift fleet. I was privileged to be present at the Richmond RAAF base on Saturday when the Minister for Defence, the Hon. Dr Brendan Nelson, announced to Air Force personnel; local council representatives, including the mayor; and local chamber of commerce representatives that the Richmond RAAF base was to remain there permanently. There are many businesses in the Hawkesbury which rely on the base and the income generated. I spoke first hand on the weekend with many of the families and Air Force personnel, who welcome the announcement. The base provides over $400 million annually to the economy and approximately $390 million to the annual household consumption in the New South Wales region. It also provides approximately 14 per cent of the gross regional product, and over nine per cent of total reMAIN COMMITTEE",130,Statements By Members
182,Mrs Markus (Greenway) (9.51 Am),"I wish to congratulate the government on angional employment comes from the base. The base is estimated to directly and indirectly contribute to over 6,000 jobs in the region. I would like to particularly make mention of Mr Kerry Bartlett, the federal member for Macquarie, who has worked long and hard lobbying for the past 10 years to ensure that the base is secure for the region. I was passed the baton late last year and have been working hard since then to ensure that the Australian government committed to the ongoing operation of the base. After meeting with the Minister for Defence on many occasions and also having meetings with Air Commodore Jack Plenty, Base Commander Tracey Simpson and Chris Young, of MBF/Airspace DF Richmond, I was delighted to hear the minister on Saturday commit to retaining the base. I would like to thank the minister and also the Prime Minister for considering the future of Richmond RAAF base and our region and weighing up what is best for our region and for the broader community. Richmond RAAF base plays a pivotal role in Sydney, which is why it is imperative that it remains open. It is the only secure point of departure in the Sydney basin for large-scale operations. Having lived and worked in the Hawkesbury, I know first hand that the base is significant not just to the Hawkesbury but also to the Western Sydney region. The permanent commitment will enable people to move forward and plan for the future with absolute confidence. The job of a good federal member is to listen to the needs of the community. (Time expired) League of Historical Cities: City of Norwood, Payneham and St Peters Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide) (9.54 am)-We spend a lot of time in this parliament talking about problems, and it is my great pleasure today to instead be able to share yet another success story from the electorate of Adelaide. In 1994 in Kyoto the League of Historical Cities was born. This league recognises the contribution that significant and historical cities have made to culture and heritage throughout the world. Last month the City of Norwood, Payneham and St Peters, in my electorate of Adelaide, was admitted to that prestigious international list. I would like to congratulate the city and its 34,000 residents on this wonderful achievement, which sees Norwood, Payneham and St Peters join just 71 other cities around the world-cities which include Rome, Prague, Jerusalem and Montreal. The city represents not only the people within these suburbs but all of South Australia and indeed the country, becoming just the third Australian city, alongside Melbourne and Ballarat, to join the league. Let me tell you a little about the City of Norwood, Payneham and St Peters. Like much of South Australia, it is a city rich with heritage, culture and passion for its history. In fact, more than that, it is a city full of very important historical firsts. The City of Norwood, Payneham and St Peters holds the honour of being the birthplace of local government in Australia. On7 July 1853, the former City of Kensington and Norwood became the first suburban municipal town council to be declared in Australia. In addition, in that same year the city held the first secret ballot in Australia, believed to be the first documented example conducted in our country’s electoral history. I believe that all of us who like to celebrate the joys of our democracy can be grateful for this. There are a number of other important firsts for this city-far too many for me to list here today-but another significant one is that the settlement was where the first electric tram service began operation in Australia. The admission to the League of Historical Cities highlights the City of Norwood, Payneham and St Peters as a leader in cultural heritage and the conserMAIN COMMITTEE vation of built heritage. I have no doubt it will live up to the league’s aims to encourage opportunities for the exchange of ideas about how to preserve historical and cultural assets and integrate them into the fabric of modern societies. I would like to particularly take the time to congratulate Mayor Robert Bria and the current council on doing a fantastic job in gaining the recognition which this city so deserves. They work tirelessly within the local community and to get recognition on a global stage. It is a wonderful achievement when Australians either as individuals or as communities are recognised on a global scale, and I think that we should all once again congratulate the city on this remarkable achievement. South-East Queensland: Water Southern Brisbane Bypass birthplace of democracy and local government. Let me tell you that the death of democracy is taking place in Queensland right now because of the arrogance of a state Labor government whose majority is so large that their concern for the views of everyday Queenslanders has long gone. It has evaporated. They have this belief that all power and all knowledge resides in the executive office boardroom in George Street. The decline of democracy has meant that Queenslanders are being thrust into an amalgamation of local government authorities. Whilst it does not directly affect people in my area, it is this style of government that is of enormous concern to electors in the southern suburbs of Brisbane. They are greatly concerned about the Queensland government’s plans to grab the water from their water tanks, which are now being installed in record numbers around houses in my electorate. In many cases, people have received state government and Brisbane City Council rebates to install those water tanks. The Queensland government have the power now to seize control of that water, put a meter on that water and control that water. There is no legal impediment to stop them and the plan is writ large in the aspirations of the Queensland government. Water which comes off the roofs of peoples’ houses and drains into their tanks is to be stolen by a Queensland government that have failed to invest in the infrastructure to provide the water that south-east Queenslanders need and deserve. South-east Queenslanders and people in the electorate of Moreton are greatly disserviced also by a Queensland government that show no care or concern about the fact that people in my electorate are the only Queenslanders who pay a toll to access the best road. I have spoken about it in this place many times before. I have been told by Labor Party state members and by Labor Party city councillors in my area that my ambition to have a traffic plan built around the postcode of 4109 to stop the trucks from using local roads like McCullough Street and Beenleigh Road is not possible. I have also been told by state members that it is impossible to take the toll off the southern Brisbane bypass. Why is it that the residents of south-side Brisbane are the only Queenslanders who pay a tax to use a road? Because the Beattie government do not care. Their simple ambition is writ large and plain for everybody to see: get rid of local government, work tirelessly to try and stop federal Liberal and National Party members from being returned in their seats and deny them access to local schools to communicate freely with P&Cs, principals, teachers, students and constituents. They stand in the way of our access to schools. It is only with the permission MAIN COMMITTEE",131,Statements By Members

I can assure you that I stand very firmly in the corner of everyday Queenslanders against the Beattie Labor government. (Time expired) 193 the time for members’ statements has concluded. Debate resumed from 9 August: Second Reading and Regional Services) (10.00 am)-I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and move: That this bill be now read a second time. I am pleased to introduce the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill 2007. The amendments provided for in this bill are necessary to allow many devices currently marketed in Australia that are essential for patient treatment and for the ongoing provision of healthcare services to be supplied beyond 4 October this year whilst under reassessment by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. The amendments provided for by this bill provide great certainty for patients, for healthcare providers and for the medical device industry in Australia. In 2002, the government introduced a new regulatory system for medical devices which allowed a five-year transition period, ending on 4 October this year, for previously marketed devices to comply with new legislative requirements. These requirements are based on principles developed by the Global Harmonisation Task Force for Medical Devices, which comprises regulators and industry representatives from Europe, the United States of America, Canada, Japan and Australia. Under the existing terms of the transition period, sponsors who wish to continue to supply previously registered and listed therapeutic devices after 4 October 2007 are required to have their products re-entered in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods as ‘included medical devices’ following assessment against the new legislative requirements by the TGA by 4 October this year. The framework introduced by the government was and continues to be at the vanguard of medical device regulation globally. The framework is one that is in line with international best practice and ensures that products newly available to the Australian community comply with current internationally accepted requirements. However, when the scheme was introduced it was estimated that in excess of 30,000 devices would need to make the transition to the new scheme and consequently require reassessment by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. This has posed significant challenges for both the medical device industry and the TGA to ensure there is continued supply of vital medical devices after October 2007. A belated influx of applications and the likelihood of further last-minute applications means the TGA may not be able to complete its assessment of all outstanding transition applications in time for the 4 October 2007 deadline. Many sponsors who have submitted applicaMAIN COMMITTEE",133,Statements By Members

185,Mrs Deanne Kelly (Dawson,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transporttions to transition their products are now faced with uncertainty about whether they will be able to continue to supply those products after 4 October 2007. Similarly, purchasers and end users of devices are faced with uncertainty about continued access to transitioning products. Disruption to the supply of medical devices due to failure to transition by 4 October this year could have a significant impact on consumer access to vital medical devices, the supply of medical devices to healthcare facilities, the operation of healthcare facilities, consumer confidence in the health system as well as the economic viability of Australian medical device companies. The amendment provided by this bill substitutes the existing requirement for medical device sponsors to have their products entered in the ARTG as ‘included medical devices’ by 4 October 2007 with the requirement to lodge an application with the intention of transitioning their products to the new scheme by 4 October 2007. Under these amendments, sponsors and end users of medical devices will have certainty of continued supply and access because it will depend solely on the sponsors submitting an effective and successful application to have their product transitioned by 4 October 2007. The government places a high priority on the availability of and access to important treatments by Australians and the presence of a strong, vibrant medical devices industry in its therapeutic policy planning. This new amendment is an important part of that planning, for it allows for continued access to important treatments by Australian consumers and healthcare providers whilst ultimately ensuring that all medical devices available in Australia comply with current internationally accepted requirements. Ms ROXON (Gellibrand) (10.05 am)-I rise to speak on the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill 2007. Labor supports this bill. The purpose of the bill, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services has outlined, is to amend the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 to effectively extend the transition period enabling therapeutic devices currently listed or registered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods to be entered in the ARTG as medical devices under the regulatory scheme introduced by the government in 2002. The bill also makes consequential amendments to two other acts. Labor will support passage of the bill through the parliament. By way of some background, the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods is a computer database of therapeutic goods established under the Therapeutic Goods Act and administered by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Therapeutic goods listed on the register are divided broadly into two classes: medicines and medical devices. The new regulatory framework for medical devices is contained in chapter 4 of the act, which commenced operation on 4 October 2002. The new regulatory framework provided for two transition periods to enable therapeutic devices currently listed or registered on the ARTG under the old regulatory scheme, set out in chapter 3 of the act, to be entered on the ARTG as medical devices under the new scheme by 4 October 2004 or 4 October 2007. The first transition period that ended on October 2004 required sponsors of previously exempt medical devices and some medical devices that were no longer excluded from the operation of the act to have their devices included on the ARTG. The second transition period, established in section 9B(2) of the act, is due to expire soon-on 4 October 2007. The effect of that current section is that therapeutic devices registered or listed under chapter 3 will be taken to have been cancelled on 4 October 2007 or, if entered on the ARTG as an included MAIN COMMITTEE medical device under chapter 4 of the act before that date, the date on which the inclusion takes effect. The effect of cancelling the registration or listing of a therapeutic device under chapter 3 would be to prevent the sponsor of those devices from being able to market them to the general public. The need for the amendments before us today arises because of delays in implementing the new regulatory scheme for medical devices introduced by the government in 2002. The introduction of that scheme necessitated that more than 30,000 medical devices be reassessed by the TGA in order to transition from the old to the new scheme. We understand from both the government and industry groups that this requirement for reassessment has posed significant challenges to both the TGA and the medical device industry, with the result that it now appears that all of the necessary reassessments may not be completed by the 4 October transition deadline. The amendment in this bill seeks to effectively extend the transition period to allow for that to happen. The bill replaces the existing requirements for medical device sponsors to have their products entered on the ARTG as included medical devices by 4 October 2007 with the requirement to lodge an application with the intention of transitioning their products to the new scheme by 4 October 2007. These amendments effectively allow for the continued supply of devices until such time as the TGA has completed its assessment of the compliance of the device, rather than mandatory cancellation on 4 October 2007. In the absence of these amendments some medical devices would be prevented from being marketed for public use, not only adversely affecting the commercial supply of medical devices to the general public and interrupting access by patients and health practitioners but also potentially undermining the domestic medical devices industry, with particular commercial disadvantage for sponsors of such devices. Labor have sought the views of industry representatives and understand that they do support this legislation. The bill is due to commence, if passed, on 3 October 2007 and will, therefore, provide protection for those in the industry who have not been able to fulfil the earlier process that was in place. According to the explanatory memorandum, there are no significant financial implications. We support this legislation because we understand, firstly, that the potential disruption to the supply of medical devices could undermine consumer access to vital devices. This sort of disruption should obviously be avoided if possible. Secondly, we support the bill because it will also ensure certainty of continued supply of such devices in healthcare facilities and help maintain consumer confidence in the system. Finally, we support the bill because it will remove uncertainty within the industry and ensure that the economic viability of the very large Australian medical device industry is not undermined by delays in the new regulatory scheme. I commend the bill to the chamber. Ms HALL (Shortland) (10.10 am)-I would like to make a quick comment on the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill 2007. The bill before us today-as the shadow minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services have statedamends the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. It effectively extends the transition period presently ending on 4 October 2007 to enable therapeutic devices currently listed or registered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods under an old regulatory scheme to be entered in the ARTG as a medical device under the new regulatory scheme introduced by the government. Labor, as the shadow minister has already stated, support this legislation-particularly beMAIN COMMITTEE cause we do not want any potential disruption to the supply of medical devices, which could have a significant impact on the supply of medical devices to healthcare facilities and on consumers’ access to vital medical devices. With those few words, I will end my comments. and Regional Services) (10.12 am)-in reply-I acknowledge the contribution of the shadow minister for health on the bill. Because the opposition cannot organise themselves in opposition-let alone hoping to organise themselves in government-we had additional comments from the member for Shortland, and I welcome them. The amendments provided for in this bill are necessary to allow many devices currently marketed in Australia that are essential for patient treatment and for the ongoing provision of healthcare services to be supplied beyond 4 October this year. Under the existing provisions in the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, registered and listed therapeutic devices that have not been assessed against new legislative requirements introduced in 2002 and entered in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, the register, as ‘included medical devices’ by 4 October this year can no longer be supplied commercially in Australia. The amendment provided for by this bill substitutes the requirement for medical device sponsors to have their products entered in the register as ‘included medical devices’ by 4 October this year with the requirement to lodge an effective application with the Therapeutic Goods Administration with the intention of transitioning their products to the new regulatory scheme by that date. The scope of the amendment covers two broad situations. The first is where an application for inclusion of the device in the register has been lodged with the TGA. The second is where an application must first be made to the TGA for its certification of a product’s compliance with quality, safety and performance requirements set out in the legislation. This second situation has been covered because of the importance of this certification as a prerequisite to a valid application for inclusion in the register for devices specifically identified in the Therapeutic Goods (Medical Devices) Regulations 2002. Without this bill, the cancellation of the entries in the register will affect not only those products that sponsors do not intend to transition to the new regulatory scheme but also products that are the subject of an effective application undergoing review by the TGA but not completed at the time the transition period ends on 4 October. The consequence of cancellation of the latter group of devices from the register will be a hiatus in commercial supply of those devices leading to commercial disadvantage for the sponsor and an interruption of access by patients and their practitioners to important healthcare services and treatments. Under these amendments sponsors, practitioners and their patients, and healthcare providers will have certainty of continued supply of medical devices while the TGA completes its assessment to ensure the devices comply with the current internationally accepted standards. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.

The bill gives force of law to a renegotiated tax treaty with Finland by inserting the text of the treaty signed in November 2006 into the International Tax Agreements Act 1953, which is a prerequisite for the treaty’s entry into force. The bill updates the tax treaty with Finland to help increase trade and investment between Australia and Finland and provides for greater cooperation between tax authorities to prevent fiscal evasion and tax avoidance. The Finnish tax treaty replaces the existing treaty with Finland signed in 1984. The new tax treaty is largely based on the current OECD model and the United Nations Model Double Taxation Convention between Developed and Developing Countries. The key changes in the new treaty include reductions in the royalty, interest and dividend withholding rates; improved integrity measures; and the allocation of capital gains taxing rights over property.

Tax can be paid on interest in the country of residence and the country of source of the interest. In relation to the dividends themselves, the bill reduces dividends withholding tax from 15 per cent to zero for intercorporate dividends on non-portfolio holdings of more than 80 per cent, subject to certain conditions, and five per cent dividend withholding tax for other intercorporate non-portfolio holdings. A maximum 15 per cent withholding tax applies to all other dividends. The bill allocates taxing rights between Australia and Finland to prevent tax discrimination against Australian nationals and businesses operating in Finland and vice versa. Business profits are generally to be taxed only in the country of residence of the recipient unless they are derived by a resident of one country through a branch or other prescribed permanent establishment in the other country, in which case that other country may tax the profits. These rules also apply to business trusts. Profits derived from the operation of ships and aircraft in international traffic are generally to be taxed only in the country of residence of the operator. Profits of associated enterprises may be taxed on the basis of dealings at arm’s length. Income, profits or gains from the alienation of real property may be taxed in full by the country in which the property is situated. Subject to that rule and other specific rules in relation to business assets and shares or other interests in land rich entities, all other capital gains will be taxable only in the country of residence. Income from employment will generally be taxable in the country where the services are performed. However, where the services are performed during certain short visits to one country by a resident of the other country, the income will be exempt in the country visited. Directors’ remuneration may be taxed in the country in which the company of which the person is a director is resident for tax purposes. Income derived by entertainers and sportspersons may generally be taxed by the country in which the activities are performed. Pensions and annuities are taxed only in the country of residence of the recipient, other than government service or social security pensions paid to an individual who is a citizen or national of the paying country. In these latter cases, the paying country may also tax the payment, with the country of residence of the recipient providing double tax relief. Income from government service will generally be taxed only in the country that pays the remuneration. Payments made from abroad to visiting students and business apprentices for the purposes of their maintenance, training or education will be exempt from tax in the country visited. Other income not dealt with by other articles derived by a resident of one country from sources in the other country may generally be taxed in both countries, with the country of residence of the recipient providing double tax relief. Source rules in this agreement prescribe for domestic law and treaty purposes that the source of income, profits or gains derived by a resident of one country may be taxed in the other country. Double taxation relief for income which, under this agreement, may be taxed by both countries is required to be provided by the country of which the taxpayer is a resident under the terms of this agreement as follows: in Australia, by allowing a credit for the Finnish tax against Australian tax payable on income derived by a resident of Australia from sources in Finland; and in Finland, by allowing a deduction against Finnish tax for the Australian tax paid on income derived by a resident of Finland from sources in Australia. However, diviMAIN COMMITTEE dends paid by a company that is an Australian resident to a company that is a Finnish resident and which controls at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the paying company will be exempt from Finnish tax. In the case of Australia, effect will be given to the double tax relief obligations arising under this agreement by application of the general foreign tax credit provisions of Australia’s domestic law and of the relevant exemption provisions of that law, where applicable. The bill also introduces improved integrity measures. The new rules allow for the cross-border collection of tax debts and updated rules for the exchange of information on tax matters. To conclude on this most interesting and vital of bills-to ensure that between our two nations the proper tax arrangements, liabilities and due responsibilities of residents of both countries are met-the bill will align tax agreements with modern business practices, the respective tax systems and modern tax treaty practice; all of which are good things. Modernising the tax treaty with Finland should help increase trade and investment between Australia and Finland and provide for greater cooperation between tax authorities to prevent fiscal evasion and tax avoidance. As such, Labor lends its support to this bill and will allow its passage. start by thanking those members who have taken part in the debate. The people from the electorate of Oxley will look back on the speech by their representative in this place and have a quiet chuckle to themselves, as, no doubt, will I. The first five minutes of filibustering always demonstrate to this place the people who do not have the capacity to speak for the time allotted to them. bill as well. ernment undertook to implement a package of reforms that will improve the competitiveness of Australian companies with offshore operations and maintain Australia’s status as an attractive place for business and investment. This bill will give the force of law to the renegotiated tax treaty with Finland. Once again this demonstrates the government’s commitment to these outcomes by progressively modernising Australia’s tax treaties. This bill will insert the text of the agreement between Australia and Finland into the International Tax Agreements Act 1953. The agreement between Australia and Finland was signed on 20 November 2006 and will replace the existing tax treaty with Finland. Details of the new treaty were announced and copies were made publicly available following signature. The agreement will assist trade and investment flows between Australia and Finland, strengthening our economic relations with Finland. It will provide a positive economic environment for Australia and contribute to a larger and faster-growing Australian economy. The agreement will broadly update the taxation arrangements between Australia and Finland. It will substantially reduce withholding taxes on certain dividend, interest and royalty payments in line with those provided in our tax treaty arrangements with the United Kingdom and the United States, and more recently with France and Norway. This will provide long term benefits for business, reducing the cost for Australian based business to obtain intellectual property, equity and finance for expansion. The new agreement achieves a balance of outcomes that will provide Australia with a competitive tax framework for international trade and investment, while ensuring the Australian revenue base is sustainable and suitably protected.

The agreement serves as another step in facilitating a competitive and modern tax treaty network for companies located in Australia. The agreement will also satisfy Australia’s most favoured nation obligations under the existing treaty with Finland. The agreement will also facilitate improved integrity aspects of administering and collecting tax from those with tax obligations in either/or both countries. The agreement reflects the government’s decision to incorporate enhanced information exchange provisions which meet modern OECD standards and to provide for reciprocal assistance in collection in future tax treaties where appropriate. The government believes that the conclusion of the agreement will strengthen the integrity of Australia’s tax treaty network through bilateral cooperation between countries to help ensure taxpayers pay their fair share of tax. The agreement will enter into force after the completion of the necessary processes in both countries and will have effect in accordance with its terms. I note that the agreement has been considered by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which has recommended that binding treaty action be taken. The enactment of this bill, and the satisfaction of the other procedures relating to proposed treaty actions, will complete the processes followed in Australia to bring the treaty into force. On that basis, I commend this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. (OHS) BILL 2007 Second Reading Debate resumed from 15 August, on motion by Dr Stone: That this bill be now read a second time. the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (OHS) Bill 2007. This bill represents the Howard government’s commitment to take positive action to return the rule of law to construction sites and bring about improved safety in the workplace for the protection of all employees working in the building and construction industry. Occupational health and safety on our building sites is a major issue and the Commonwealth has a responsibility to play its part in driving change to make the industry safer. The minister’s second reading speech refers to the findings of the Cole royal commission into the building and construction industry with regard to accidents and injuries. Commissioner Cole found this industry to be one of the most dangerous, with more than 12,500 compensated injuries in the year 2002-03, or 34 injuries per day. Almost one in five compensated workplace fatalities that year were in the construction and building industry, representing a total of 37 workplace deaths. Victorian WorkCover statistics show that during last year, 2006, there were 29 workplace deaths in Victoria of which five were in the construction industry. This was the equal highest number of industry fatalities. MAIN COMMITTEE",140,International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill No 2 2007
200,Mr Mcarthur (Corangamite) (10.29 Am),"I am pleased to rise to speak in favour ofI come from the farming industry. We have a bad history as well. I think we have about 12 deaths per year caused by tractors and other things-so the very sad fatality statistics of other industries do compare with that of the building industry. There is also a long way to go to make Australia’s workplaces safer. That is why the government has introduced a bill to make amendments to the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005. I note the opposition will be supporting the bill despite having opposed the initial introduction of the original act. With one breath the Labor Party say they support these amendments but with the next they complain about the original act-and they have a policy to abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission, the ABCC, which has been a major force for improving conditions on Australian building sites, improving construction industry productivity, raising national living standards and keeping interest rates low. A report has been produced by independent economic analysts Econtech on the ABCC. Econtech is a firm which is respected by the Labor Party and has been employed to do work for state Labor governments. The Econtech report has found that, as a result of the ABCC’s activities since 2005, housing costs are three per cent less expensive than would have been the case without the ABCC. National growth is 1.5 per cent higher as a result of the ABCC performing its function than would otherwise have been the case. This is because the ABCC has implemented the law with the result that productivity in the construction industry has increased. With higher growth, living standards have also increased. The other important finding is that inflation is 1.2 per cent lower than it would otherwise have been due to the existence of the ABCC-and that means that interest rates are also lower. The Labor Party want to abolish the ABCC and introduce other backwards-looking industrial relations reforms that would put Australia’s current low inflation and low interest rate economic environment at risk. I challenge the Labor Party as to what their long-term position is. I note the member for Batman is here. He might be able to enlighten us as to what the Labor Party’s long-term position on the ABCC is. Leighton Group chief executive Wal King, representing the Australian Constructors Association, said that we are experiencing a ‘golden period’ of record low disputation under the ABCC. He said: You can’t dispute the fact that the construction industry today is more stable, more peaceful, more productive and more effective than five years ago. He said that in the Australian Financial Review of 2 August 2007. Upon the release of the Econtech report, Wilhelm Harnisch, the CEO of Master Builders Australia, had this to say: ... the ABCC has had a positive impact in boosting Australia’s economic growth, has reduced the cost of living and has led to a significant fall in construction costs both for commercial and residential building. That is in a media release of 25 July 2007. The ABCC has been overwhelmingly positive for the whole of Australia. The Labor Party pays lip-service to economic management and to health and safety in the workplace but will do the bidding of its union masters by promising to abolish the commission that is helping to restore law and order to our construction sites. AgainI ask the member for Batman what he is going to do. Is his party going to leave the ABCC for another five or 10 years? Is it going to abolish it? It will be interesting when the member for Batman makes his contribution. This bill improves the safety of construction and building worksites across Australia by making all sites involved in Commonwealth projects comply with Australian laws. This is a quite commendable objective. These measures will achieve this by using the considerable MAIN COMMITTEE financial influence of the Commonwealth government to ensure construction projects that the government is funding comply with the Australian Government Building and Construction Occupational Health and Safety Accreditation Scheme. Importantly, the scheme requirements are extended to building work ‘indirectly funded’ by the Commonwealth. The bill requires head contractors who are contracted to undertake building work for the Commonwealth, or for Commonwealth funded projects, to be accredited persons who maintain effective occupational health and safety management policies and systems. The bill is quite specific. Clause 35(4) of the bill prohibits the Commonwealth, including Commonwealth authorities, from funding construction work unless contracts are with builders who are accredited. I think the member for Batman and I well recall the argument over the construction of the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The bill also makes sure that the intention of the government’s reforms is observed over the life of the construction project by requiring accredited builders to remain accredited for the duration of the Commonwealth funded project. Therefore, builders cannot become accredited to obtain a government contract or accreditation will lapse. These reforms are important because they are about ensuring the Commonwealth drives a cultural change in the building and construction industry to embrace safe work practices. I emphasise that it is a cultural change. The government wants builders to understand that if they want to work with the Commonwealth, they will need to adopt safer occupational health and safety practices. Australia’s builders, head contactors and their employees should not view these reforms as an imposition. It should be automatically accepted as part of the work environment that building workers, employees, contractors, apprentices, engineers, architects, plumbers, electricians and everyone else with a role on the building site expect a safe working environment within the practicalities of the industry and also expect safe working practices. There is no room for bullying or unsafe practices on a construction site and the high-fatality statistics in the industry are chilling proof of this. The Labor Party should be enthusiastically supportive not only of this amendment but also of the original act. The unions should also be supportive, but instead we have seen nothing but constant attacks on these measures and threats to do away with the Australian Building and Construction Commission. I look forward to the member for Batman advising us exactly what the Labor Party’s attitude is because, at the moment, their attitude is unclear. The hypocrisy of the Labor Party on this issue is astounding. I note with interest the member for Gorton’s second reading contribution when he said: Labor has opposed the Howard government’s approach to the regulation of industrial relations and health and safety in the building and construction sector because it provides a separate set of laws for the industry and has created in excess of 200 pages of new legislation. The Labor Party oppose additional regulation of the building and construction industry which is designed to help save lives and protect workers from injury, but, in contrast, they support a more heavily regulated system for determining wages and conditions. So Labor’s policy, as expounded by the member for Gorton, is more regulation of wages and conditions and less effort on OH&S. The Australian people will remember that the Howard government established the Cole commission of inquiry to investigate the building and construction industry and, as I noted MAIN COMMITTEE earlier, found the sector to be one of the most dangerous with a high rate of fatalities and injuries. For these reasons, it might be argued that a separate set of rules might need to apply to ensure a more safety conscious culture is allowed to develop. The Cole commission report identified some specific incidences where senior building industry officials failed to consider appropriate OH&S conditions on building sites in Victoria and in other states. IfI can take just a few moments to mention a few cases from my home state of Victoria. On 18 April 2002, a CFMEU shop steward breached Victorian OH&S legislation by: ... placing himself between the concrete truck and the pump, thereby creating a dangerous situation in which he might have been injured and preventing work continuing normally whilst negotiations were undertaken to resolve the dispute ... The dispute was between the union and Grocon. That is from the Cole commission reportvolume 12, page 153. There we have an interesting use of the OH&S conditions to negotiate industrial mayhem. Further, a CMFEU organiser engaged in unlawful conduct on 15 August 2002, coordinating CFMEU members from another site to trespass on Grocon’s Queen Victoria Hospital worksite, putting safety at risk during a concrete pour. Victoria Police, who attended the incident, were not asked to remove the men out of fear of provoking a violent incident. Again, that is from the Cole commission report. Also, the commission found that Mr Chris Kessaris threatened to assault and later threatened to kill Mr Derek Fries in September and October of 1998. Again, that is from the Cole commission report. Another case will illustrate the disregard displayed at times by the unions for the health and safety of others. On 16 February 2000, the CFMEU construction branch secretary, Martin Kingham, and assistant secretary, William Oliver, were involved in a raid on the offices of the Master Builders Association of Victoria. The Cole commission reported that Kingham, Oliver and others ‘forcibly attempted to break through locked, one-inch-thick security glass doors at the MBAV offices. The unionists violently pushed against the doors, forcing them to bow inwards’. That quote is, again, from the Cole commission. MBAV staff negotiated to allow five union representatives to enter out of fear that the doors would be broken down, but when the door was unlocked an estimated 200 workers stormed into the premises. MBAV staff members were ‘pushed aside’ and were ‘verbally abused and threatened’. Some of the intruders were heard to say to these MBAV staff, ‘We’ll fix you up one day.’ That is a clear indication of the difficulties on building sites that have been endemic in Victoria over the last 30 to 40 years. Commissioner Cole concluded that this case study demonstrated: (a) the willingness of union officials and members in Victoria to engage in violent demonstrations in order to pursue industrial objectives; (b) the tendency of union officials in Victoria to encourage unlawful industrial action by misleading the members ... and (c) the willingness of union officials and members to disregard the rights of others. So in this case the union leadership were responsible for violent activity, damage to private property, physical violence against MBAV staff who were completely unrelated to worksite activities, threats and a complete disregard for the personal safety of employees working for another organisation. This clearly demonstrates the need to change the culture within the building industry to better respect OH&S, and that is why the government have introduced the ABCC and why we have brought forward this measure to extend the Commonwealth’s influence to all building projects in which we are involved. In this regard the Howard government MAIN COMMITTEE are recommitting to the safety of workers in the construction industry and we are committing to implementing the recommendations of the Cole commission. Commissioner Cole said that all participants in the sector must contribute to furthering an attitudinal change in the industry to safety and to create an attitude where: ... projects are completed safely, on time and within budget rather than just on time and within budget. So the key element emphasised is the safety component of these projects, particularly in Victoria. The Howard government accept responsibility in this regard. Government have a responsibility, contractors have a responsibility and employees have a responsibility when it comes to safety, and so too do the unions. It is disappointing that the opposition opposed the original act and that Labor are threatening to abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission, the industry policeman, if they are elected to office. AgainI raise that with the member for Batman: what is the true position of the opposition? Are they going to abolish the ABCC, or give it an extended life? Safety and law and order on our construction sites are big issues within my electorate of Corangamite, and in Geelong and the surf coast. There are a number of construction projects planned for the region, reflecting the economic growth and prosperity which have been fostered due to the strong economic management of the government. Unfortunately, Geelong is a widely renowned black spot when it comes to union activity, particularly in the construction industry. Unions are very active in the Geelong region and are very active in opposing the member for Corangamite. Last year the ABCC hosted a series of free information seminars across Australia in order to educate contractors and workers about the national code of practice for the construction industry. These meetings were held at 11 locations across Australia, including in industrial towns like Geelong and Newcastle. The Geelong forum had to be abandoned because approximately 100 CFMEU protesters barged into the forum and disrupted it, yelled abuse and intimidated those in attendance. They destroyed information kits and plastered union stickers on the wall of the hotel venue. Out of all the places the ABCC visited, Geelong was the only site where the unions refused to allow contractors and workers to learn about the new code of practice and where they forced the forum to be abandoned-and those who wanted to attend had to travel to a session in Melbourne. The CFMEU and ACTU through their actions and deeds are opposed to cultural change in the construction industry. The union leaders want to go back to the days of lawlessness and risk that existed prior to the Cole commission, the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act and the establishment of the ABCC. The Labor Party have capitulated to their union masters by promising to abolish the ABCC. Never has there been an opposition party or an opposition leader as indebted to the sectoral interests of the union movement as the current Labor Party and Kevin Rudd. The unions have been promised everything they wanted from the ALP. AWAs will be abolished lock, stock and barrel. The building industry policeman, the ABCC, will be abolished. Total control will be handed back to the unions to interfere in workplaces in a way we have not seen since before Keating. The unions are looking forward to Labor’s election, and they are doing all in their power to ensure that Labor gets elected. The ACTU has placed field officers in marginal seats to doorknock residents, mislead people about workplace laws and infiltrate the churches, Meals on MAIN COMMITTEE Wheels and other community groups in order to get Labor candidates elected. The ACTU has spent tens of millions of dollars on misleading TV as on industrial relations laws. To ensure an elected Kevin Rudd government does what the union tells it, they have replaced current ALP MPs with union bosses, without a preselection, such as Greg Combet in the electorate of Charlton and ACTU Assistant Secretary Richard Marles, who has moved from Melbourne to Geelong to overthrow Gavan O’Connor in Corio, because Gavan O’Connor is an independent, and the hard right wing have stacked the branches in Corio. So now we have Richard Marles in Geelong. We will just see how he gets on, whether he gets up in Corio. I am not sure whether the member for Batman will be down there giving him a hand-he might; we don’t know. AWU boss, Bill Shorten, has been imposed on Maribyrnong. There was no preselection there; he just moved in and took it over. Dougie Cameron is going into the Senate. He is certainly a free trader if ever I met one. Even in my electorate of Corangamite, the faceless union bosses on the ALP selection panel ratted on Councillor Peter McMullan, my opponent, and preselected an out-of-towner, a Ballarat based union organiser who is not even committed to the region. He is coming down to have a go at Corangamite. He does not live in the area. He has his union mates tracking around Corangamite trying to win the vote, and we will see how he gets on. If he is elected to office, Kevin Rudd will be forced to keep his promise to hand over power to the union movement because the unions will hold most of the seats in the Labor caucus. The unions are desperate to get their patsy, Kevin Rudd, elected, and they are happy to tell the people. We know Dean Mighell, the Electrical Trades Union guy-he is a good sort of fellow. He said it was ‘going to be fun’ coercing employers under Labor’s industrial relations policies. Finally, of course, the Western Australian CFMEU boss, Kevin Reynolds, told the Australian in May 2007: We’re going to put our shoulder to the wheel to assist the campaign to unseat the Howard Government and then we’re going to have the biggest celebration that we can have on the night he was defeated ... He is very keen to get into the Labor Party. We know what his position is. Kevin Reynolds’s mate and deputy Western Australian CFMEU leader, Joe McDonald, has explained why the militant unions will be happy to see Labor elected, because Labor will abolish the ABCC for them. He said: I live for the day when [the ABCC staff] are all working at Hungry Jack’s, Fast Eddy’s or Kentucky Fried Chicken. That is what’s waiting for them. They’re all ex-policemen and they can go and do whatever ex-coppers do. I’d suggest that John Lloyd and his mates will be unemployed before I will be. That was sourced from the Australian on 26 May 2007. That is what the real attitude of the Labor Party is to the ABCC. Strikes in Australia are at their lowest level since 1913 as a result of the Howard government’s industrial relations reforms and the introduction of the ABCC. Illegal and unsafe practices on our building sites have been challenged, and the unions do not like it, as we see in Victoria. The CFMEU are so committed to the election that they have handed over $6.3 milMAIN COMMITTEE",141,Building And Construction Industry Improvement Amendment

He has been subjected to this.lion of their members’ subscriptions to the ALP over the life of the Howard government, including $1 million paid by the Victorian CFMEU. The opposition leader pulled a media stunt to expel Dean Mighell from the ALP but has been weak in not forcing Joe McDonald out for his outrageous behaviour in Western Australia. I support the thrust of the bill. I support the thrust of my comments. I look forward to the member for Batman’s response. I put on the record what the ALP, if they were ever elected to government, would do with the building commission. It is their intent to restore union power on building sites. We know that the building sites are now safer and more productive. We know that in Victoria they are now working well. (Time expired) a second time. I remind members in the chamber that, in accordance with standing orders, rather than interjecting they are entitled to properly ask questions of members while they are speaking. the Committee today on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (OHS) Bill 2007. In doing so, I also propose to make a few historical comments about the nature of the building and construction industry, about where we might have been 40 or 50 years ago, as referred to by the member for Corangamite, and about where we are today. CanI say at the outset that the opposition will support this bill because it seeks to address deficiencies in the drafting of the original bill debated in 2005 and in doing so will make some improvement to occupational health and safety arrangements in the building and construction industry. I totally support that particular objective. But, having said that, I am also going to use this debate to raise some other matters that are not included in the bill and the motivation of the government when it comes to industrial relations, including occupational health and safety provisions. Firstly, I am totally opposed to any suggestion that occupational health and safety provisions should be linked to broader industrial relations objectives by any party to the industrial relations process. The motivation of the labour movement has historically been and should continue to be genuine improvements in the prevention of workplace injury and illness before all other objectives. People should understand that, when surveys have historically been conducted of workers and their families about the key issues with respect to going to and from work, the No. 1 priority has not been the rate of pay and the conditions of employment. The No. 1 priority amongst ordinary working people has been health and safety at work. All workers want to do is go to work in the morning in the knowledge that they will work in a safe environment and will be able to return home that evening, without fear of being maimed and critically injured at work or-as in many instances, unfortunately, historically in the building and construction industry-killed on the job. So let us be clear at the outset: no-one is suggesting that health and safety be used as a bargaining tool in industrial relations, which is what the Howard government would like the Australian community to think. We should also have a sharper focus to achieve stronger responsibilities and arrangements for rehabilitation and compensation for work related injury and disease. People should not forget that historically it was building workers who were exposed first hand, more often than any other workers in the Australian community, to the problems of asbestosis. Only after decades of neglect did we finally start to front up to our responsibilities for what ordinary buildMAIN COMMITTEE",146,Building And Construction Industry Improvement Amendment
203,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Bk Bishop),The question is that this bill be now read,147,Building And Construction Industry Improvement Amendment
204,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (10.49 Am),"I welcome the opportunity to addressing workers and their families confronted on a day-to-day basis. For the Howard government to come here and suggest that any section of the Australian community would seek to use health and safety for industrial processes is just simply ignorance and a misunderstanding of the best intentions of all Australian workers and their families. Having said that, it is about time people also understood that the process of industrial relations in the building and construction industry has been an evolutionary process. I agree with one thing the member for Corangamite said: yes, the building and construction industry has been a battleground for decades-for 50, 60 or 70 years-and why shouldn’t it have been? Let us deal with a few of the issues that building and construction industry workers and their families have had to confront over the history of building and construction in Australia. I might also say that on all international indicators the building and construction industry in Australia has one of the most productive workforces in the world. That is only because over the last 50 to 60 years we resolved some of the fundamental problems that confronted building and construction workers and their families historically. I know that first hand because of my father. He might have ended up a politician but he actually started out as a bricklayer, having left school at 13. I will go through some of the things that building and construction workers did not have when I was a child. These led to a campaign over decades to decasualise the building and construction industry, to give building workers and their families the entitlements of every other worker in Australia. Why wouldn’t building and construction workers have, for example, struggled to achieve ‘wet money’ when it rained rather than being stood down without any compensation? It was pretty tough when it rained over extended periods and building workers, without any social security backup, went home, having had to attend at work each day to be told, ‘There’s no work today because it’s raining.’ That made it pretty tough for building workers and their families. Then there is the question of sick pay. They are regarded as casual workers. Injured workers get very little compensation for sick pay, let alone make-up pay in the case of a very serious long-term injury caused by an accident. Then there is the question of job and finish. Historically, yes, in some instances they did extend the lives of jobs because when a job was coming to completion they had to try and look at where the next start was. They wanted some continuity of income so as to maintain their capacity to put food on the tables for their families and to educate them. Members on the other side want to belittle the historical achievements of the Australian trade union movement and the building and construction industry. AllI can say is that I am exceptionally proud of the fact that historically they have decasualised the building and construction industry and given building and construction industry workers the same rights that every other worker in Australia had. Then we go to the issue of holiday pay. There was no holiday pay. If you were not at work, there was no pay. There was no long service leave because you went from one employer to another chasing jobs from month to month and from week to week. We had to achieve a portable long service leave scheme by which, throughout their working lives, they were able to accumulate an entitlement to annual leave and long service leave. We also had to achieve 26 weeks make-up pay in the case of a serious accident on the job. MAIN COMMITTEE The crowning achievement over the last 15 to 20 years has been superannuation. Superannuation was the privileged right of only a minority of the Australian community. On1 July this year we achieved the 15th anniversary of the superannuation guarantee legislation, and the building industry was at the forefront of the campaign to make superannuation a universal right in Australia. More importantly, not only is superannuation today a universal right of all Australian workers; it has also proven to be the most important savings vehicle ever put in place by any government of any political persuasion. The savings in those industry superannuation funds now represent $1 trillion over a period of 15 years. They are going to grow exponentially because of the capacity of well-managed industry funds to make wise investment decisions, not just to the benefit of their own members but to the benefit of the Australian community. Who do you think owns the privatised airports in Australia at the moment? Who do you think is investing in the BOOT schemes and the public-private partnerships with the New South Wales government to create new school infrastructure? Who do you think is investing in the toll roads that are resolving the problems of urban congestion in Australia? It is the industry superannuation schemes put in place as a result of the leadership of the building industry unions and the ACTU. I simply want to say on the industrial relations front that it has been a long process of change, but the starting point for changing the culture in the building and construction industry would be giving building workers the entitlements of all other workers in the Australian community. The process of cultural change did not start under the Howard government. It actually started in 1993 under the Hawke and Keating Labor governments. They are the ones who actually put in place a process of workplace reform. Here is one of the booklets issued by the Australian government-a very young Minister for Industrial Relations, Laurie Brereton, appears in that booklet. It was a program supported by employers. I refer, for example, to an employer of not insignificant standing in the Australian community, currently the Chairman of Queensland Rail. I quote what he said in that book-and I can understand why the member for Corangamite wants to pack up his books and run away now: because he does not like a few facts and a bit of an historical perspective. If he would just listen to what John Prescott said, because all the Howard government has done is build on the reforms that were started under Labor in government-reforms that meant, for example, that the Holmes a Court empire of John Holland was saved when Mr Holmes a Court unfortunately died all of a sudden. Who put in place the program that built Toyota’s new project at Altona on time and on budget? Who built the second runway at Sydney airport ahead of time? Who built the new ABC headquarters in Melbourne ahead of time and ahead of budget? It was a program of industrial reform, put in place under the umbrella of the Hawke and Keating Labor governments, and improvements in productivity that have continued to go from strength to strength over the last 15 to 20 years, because that is what everyone in the building and construction industry wanted. That is why John Prescott said in this 1993 booklet Creating Productive Partnerships that the key to workplace reform in Australia was not legislation but a cultural change in the workplace. This is what John Prescott said: MAIN COMMITTEE I am convinced that effective enterprise agreements will arise from a process of evolution rather than one step of dramatic change. How right he was. He then went on to state: We need to be realistic and recognise that achieving fundamental change in people’s attitudes to work, productivity, workplace relationships and so on is a painstaking process. It is about taking the building industry workforce with you; it is about taking the whole Australian community with you. Belting people up and sending them to jail does not change the culture. That is why the focus of this strategy was about enterprise agreements. It was about a step-by-step approach to actually reduce accidents on the job. Change was vital to the future, as was increasing the size of the skilled workforce-I wish this government had actually focused on that challenge and the unnecessary decline in traditional apprenticeship training in Australia. It was about best practice. It was about flexibility with respect to shiftwork. It was about how much overtime is appropriate. They were all issues that had to be confronted workplace by workplace. The building and construction industry is no longer about industry agreements; it is about project based enterprise agreements producing the results and the productivity. I raise these issues today because what I believed then is what I believe today. If Labor wins the election, there is no return to centralised wage fixing in Australia. The only central component that would exist is what any decent employer in Australia currently accepts and accepts publicly. We require an industrial relations system which guarantees the weakest in the Australian community a fair set of wages and conditions-a core set of minimum conditions-side by side with a capacity to regularly review the minimum wages paid to those workers, predominantly women employed in industries such as child care, hospitality, cleaning and security. That is the nature of the system. That is because companies have to understand that they will not survive unless they are efficient, flexible and have a high-quality approach to guarantee their capacity to compete in the future. As I have said, the days of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission setting wages and conditions centrally for all Australian workers are long gone. Labor put that in place. Enterprise bargaining has and will continue to deliver significant productivity gains in the construction industry. There should, appropriately, be minimum wages and conditions for the less well-off in the Australian community, who are predominantly women, and there is a role, as is currently the case, for a central agency to review and set those wages and conditions. Unions should continue to be involved where appropriate in enterprise bargaining-not just about wages and conditions but also about their enterprise being competitive and productive so as to guarantee the future of their employer in what is a very tough domestic and global market. The issue of health and safety is only one of the issues. There is a multitude of issues that have to be confronted on an enterprise-bargaining front in the building and construction industry. DareI suggest: the biggest barrier to an efficient building and construction industry in Australia at the moment is not industrial relations; it is actually a shortage of skilled workers. You can go to every city and regional community in Australia at the moment and you can find billions of dollars ready to be invested, but we cannot get the construction crews in place to actually undertake that investment. That is what is holding back Australia at the moment: lack of a skilled workforce because we failed to invest in our future with respect to the traditional trades. For example, in Western Australia at the moment construction costs are going up by MAIN COMMITTEE about 1.7 per cent to two per cent per month-not because of industrial relations but because of a shortage of skilled labour in Australia. So, yes, the industrial relations debate is important, but productivity in Australia is far bigger than industrial relations. It is about a range of issues, including how you deliver projects, the nature of the tendering process-whether, for example, you bundle on the Pacific Highway in three or four projects over a distance of 100 kilometres so that you have continuity of delivery and you maintain the same construction crews. It is all there to be done, but it requires a bit of government leadership in Australia. Where are the Howard government on those practical fundamental issues? Missing in action. All we get is rhetoric about their hatred of the union movement, which has a proper place in the Australian community-the same place everyone else is entitled to in the Australian community, provided you know how to conduct yourself in a fit and proper way. That is what a mature Australian community expects. That is why, in the context of this bill, we say up front that we support improvements in the health and safety regime but also that health and safety should never be used for industrial purposes. Productivity in the construction industry has come a long way over the last 20 to 30 years, but we can also make further progress if we confront some of the fundamental problems that are a real barrier to investment in building and construction in Australia at the moment-the types of issues that were actually delivered on by Labor in government in its process of construction industry reform Creating productive partnerships. It was that report that set the foundation for the productivity growth of the last 15 to 20 years in the building and construction and civil-engineering industries in Australia. To my way of thinking, this government has squandered the opportunities created by that foundation, and productivity has stalled. The building and construction industry knows it and so does the civil-engineering sector in Australia. Productivity in Australia has stalled since 2005. That is the truth of the matter. I want to raise these issues because I know my responsibilities as a former President of the ACTU and because I am sick of the tired old rhetoric from the Howard government that every problem in Australia is down to union militancy. The building and construction industry shows that you can make progress if you are prepared to invest in doing the right thing. The projects speak for themselves. All the big projects underway in Australia at the moment have union input into them. They have adopted the culture of enterprise bargaining we put in place. Enterprise bargaining is about safety at work. It is about flexibility at work. It is about improving apprenticeship training at work. It is about how you go out of your way to guarantee a competitive place for the employer that you have the right to go to work for and produce a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work. In conclusion, the federal Labor Party has in the past been, and continues to be, absolutely committed to a workplace culture that promotes productivity and competitiveness. In recent times Wal King, as the Chief Executive of Leighton Holdings, has had something to say about industrial relations. AllI can say is that he wants to have a look in the mirror with respect to the performance of some of his managers over the years and how they have conducted themselves. Promoting a culture that is focused on long-term improvement in the quality of performance is far more important and enduring than simply appointing a policeman in the form of the Australian building and construction industry commission. I only wish it was so easy. You do not change the culture by having a policeperson standing at the gate each morning. MAIN COMMITTEE You change the culture by a proper engagement at a workplace level, with people wanting to work together for the right reasons-to guarantee their future and their continuity of employment and a capacity of their employer to get further contracts in the future. The opposition, I simply say, will support this bill. But I also state very clearly that it falls a long way short of addressing the reform that is necessary in the building and construction industry to put in place the next round of productivity growth that is needed to maintain a vibrant building and construction sector in Australia in order to guarantee the position of the Australian economy for the future. That is the challenge. The next wave of productivity growth in Australia is the only thing that will be the key to Australia’s future-not an industrial police officer but continuing to change the process of workplace reform in Australia by practical engagement, putting in the hard yards to take the community with you. I commend the bill to the House, but I say to the Australian community: confront the real issues, not the side issues based on ideology and hatred. (Time expired) Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (11.09 am)-I rise also to speak on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (OHS) Bill 2007 and to give it my qualified support. I say ‘qualified’ because, while any measures to improve occupational health and safety law are welcome, it has to be noted that the improvements in this bill are improvements to what is already a very unsatisfactory set of regulations. I will come back to those regulations later. Firstly, though, why is it so important to improve occupational health and safety in this important industry? In my city, Newcastle, and my region, the Hunter, we do some of the heaviest lifting in the Australian economy. We are a centre for mining and energy production, manufacturing and engineering, and transport and shipping. That is the hard, often dirty, and dangerous work that the people of our region have been doing for generations. It has been a testament to the role that the advocates of working people, in particular the union movement, have played that conditions of work and safety standards have been steadily built and improved over time. In the newer and growing areas of our economy, in our services industries, tourism, viticulture and health and education sectors, to name just a few, occupational health and safety standards are just as important. These working environments pose their own safety hazards, and we do need to be aware of those in a changing workforce. However, this bill relates to the occupational health and safety in the building and construction industry. It is my sad duty to bring to the attention of the House a work site fatality in my region this year. Mr Robert Watson, a Central Coast man well known and liked around the industry in the region, was killed at a Wyong work site in March. It was a tragic accident, and I would like to take this opportunity to put on the public record once more my sympathies, and I am sure the sympathies of the whole region, to the family of Mr Watson. It was a tragic event to have a husband and father taken away from a family like this. Mr Watson leaves behind a grieving widow, Kathy, eight children and 10 grandchildren. He was working on the Kooindah Waters Residential Golf Estate construction site at Wyong on 29 March when a wall collapsed on him. Tragically, his co-workers-including, I understand, his son-in-law-were unable to save him. At the time, questions were raised about safety standards at the site, including that the newly constructed wall had not been adequately braced. That occurred before the accident. Those questions were raised. They are being investigated, of course, by WorkCover. MAIN COMMITTEE There are about 50 deaths at work on building sites each year in this country-almost one a week. That is 50 too many. I would like to read to the House the statement made by Mrs Kathy Watson following the death of her husband. She said: I would like to express my concern and grief at the unnecessary loss of my husband Robert. I am now a widow and my eight children no longer have a father. I want to speak out to express my concern at the deterioration in safety standards on building sites. Too many workers are being killed or seriously injured and the new Federal Workplace laws undermine workers rights to work in a safe environment, and workers are too scared to speak up about safety matters because they fear losing their jobs if they do. The tragic death of my husband should have been avoidable, and if we just sit back and accept this deterioration of safety standards and workers rights and we allow this unrelenting push for profit at all costs even over the safety of workers I fear that the number of widows of building workers and fatherless children will increase. I would like to appeal to all workers on building sites to refuse to be pushed into unsafe situations like my husband, think about their families and don’t be quiet, stand up against the system that is letting them down and demand better safety and fight for workers rights. I think most of us, particularly the opposition, would fully endorse those words. The whole community-employers, workers, unions and government regulators-all have a role to play in ensuring workplace safety. Unfortunately, I do not think the government has got it right with many aspects of this regulation, including the Australian Building and Construction Commission, but I will come back to that. I would first like to put some further information before the House about the circumstances of Mr Watson’s death, which sadly highlights the real pressures being placed on workers and their families at the moment. Less than a week after Mr Watson’s death, it emerged that his family’s life insurance payment was in jeopardy because his employer had not been up to date with its superannuation contributions. I know you will be interested in this, Madam Deputy Chair. We raised this with the Commissioner of Taxation. The anguish that this must have son’s widow and his eight children were left in severe financial distress-indeed, it was left to the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, the CFMEU, to their credit, to assist in organising money for the funeral and other expenses. The union also offered and is still providing ongoing support and counselling services to the family. I understand that the union also helped to negotiate ex gratia payments from the contractor and the subcontractor, and that was the right thing to do. However, it should never have come to this. No worker should have to worry whether his superannuation guarantee is being paid. No grieving family should find out under these circumstances that the employer had not been meeting its obligations to its workers. It shows that while the government’s approach is to come down hard on union activity and workers’ rights in the construction industry, it does not necessarily come down hard on employers that do not meet their obligations to their workers. The ACTU briefed some of us last night and gave us some very interesting figures on Comcare and the number of actual visits, the number of actual prosecutions and the number of actual outcomes being pursued, and they fell far below any state’s statistics. I raised the issue of superannuation with the Commissioner of Taxation in a hearing of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit in April. The commissioner reported that each year 11,000 comMAIN COMMITTEE",147,Building And Construction Industry Improvement Amendment
205,Caused An Already Grief,"stricken family is almost too much to imagine. It meant that Mr Watplaints are being made about the superannuation guarantee not being paid. That is a significant drain on families. As the commissioner pointed out, these are only the complaints received from employees. Many employees, such as in the tragic case of the Watson family, would not know that their superannuation guarantee is not even being met by their employer. This is a significant issue when it comes to the obligations that employers have to their workers. We also know that, under the non-union agreement in place at that site, workers got no holiday pay, no rostered days off, no public holidays and no overtime. They were being paid an all-in rate that cashed out all award entitlements, including ordinary time and penalty rates, special rates, allowances and entitlements to paid leave. Good working conditions and workplace safety are clearly linked. Workers need a day off from time to time. They need reasonable hours and they need rest breaks. We cannot expect safety on building and construction sites if we have in place a culture where people are being worked to the bone. We cannot expect to take the Howard government seriously when it imposes crackdowns on unions and workers but does not ensure employers are meeting their obligations-not only in the area of safety but also in other areas. For example, in March this year a 15-metre section of wall from an apartment building construction site in Newcastle collapsed onto a church building next door. Thankfully, in this case no-one was injured. I raise this incident in particular because, as I mentioned, it is not just in the area of safety that some employers are not meeting their obligations. The development in question in this incident is being carried out by a company called the Hightrade Construction group, the parent company behind several companies which collapsed last year with collective debts of more than $80 million. My colleague the member for Hunter has raised concerns about this industry collapse in this place previously-as we both have about the collapse of another building group in our region, Bay Building. This is not the time to go into the details about those financial collapses, apart from making the important point that it is often the workers and contractors who lose out because the company has gone into liquidation and there has been nothing put aside to cover the outstanding entitlements of these workers. All of the points I have made lead us to the nub of the issue when it comes to workplace laws under the Howard government. The workers’ needs obviously come last. Whether it be in terms of pay and conditions, bargaining power, unfair dismissal protection or, as in the case we are discussing, occupational health and safety, the workers’ needs always come last. Let us look more closely at this bill and at this government’s approach to safety in the building and construction industry. The Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act establishes the powers and functions of the Federal Safety Commissioner and establishes the occupational health and safety accreditation scheme covering this particular industry. The bill before us amends the legislation to cover situations where building work is indirectly funded by the Commonwealth or its authorities. It seeks to ensure that people who accredited under the scheme at the time of entering into a contract are also accredited while the building work is being carried out. It makes other amendments, including extending the accreditation to other funding arrangements, streamlining the appointment process for federal safety officers and allowing people working in the Office of the Federal Safety Commissioner to disclose information on the scheme to the minister. MAIN COMMITTEE These seem fairly innocuous amendments-and they are, as far as the current scheme goes. But we have learnt to be suspicious of any bill proposed by this government to regulate the building and construction industry. One immediately casts one’s mind back to where the scheme began, the 2003 report of the commission of inquiry into the building and construction industry-a commission of inquiry that cost the taxpayer $60 million with very little to show for it. One of things, though, that we do have to show for it is the original legislation that the bill before us is amending. That was the legislation that established the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Labor opposed that legislation, and it continues to oppose the Howard government’s overall approach to the regulation of industrial relations and health and safety in the building and construction sector. Labor does not believe that there should be an industry-specific approach to industrial relations, with different sets of laws for each industry. There is a vast amount of regulation in the building and construction industry, with the Howard government having created more than 200 pages of new legislation for this sector alone. Labor have announced that we will replace the Australian Building and Construction Commission in 2010. Instead, we will have an industry-specific division in our proposed Fair Work Australia which will address health and safety issues across the board. What the Howard government is doing is coming back to the parliament to correct elements of its industrial relations platform-making bad alterations to bad policy. Why do we see the Howard government coming back on this legislation? Why do we see it seeking to change its extreme Work Choices laws, and not just by changing the name? Because on industrial relations the Howard government gets it wrong time after time. I was interested to hear the Prime Minister say in question time on 8 May, and I quote: I can inform the House that between now and the caretaker period, whenever that may begin ... there will be no bad policies from this government ... Well, thank goodness; the days of bad policy from this government are apparently behind us. Unfortunately, for working Australians all the Howard government’s bad policy in the industrial relations portfolio is already bad law. That is why it comes back and changes its building and construction bill; that is why it tweaks at the edges of Work Choices with a fake safety net and attempts to introduce fairness-because they are bad laws. And the community outrage about Work Choices has demonstrated that. Working Australians continue to shy away from these changes. No matter what tinkering around the edges is done, come election day they will not forget. They do care about job security, dignity in the workplace and safety in the workplace for all Australians. The problem with this government is that its response to the fundamental unfairness of its workplace laws is not to fundamentally change those laws. Its response has been twofold, and it is very revealing of the psychology of this tired and arrogant government. The first response is secrecy. We have had an unprecedented attempt by the Howard government to cover up the details of the true impact of its Work Choices laws. When the statistics coming out of the Office of the Employment Advocate showed just how many rights and conditions were being stripped away by Australian workplace agreements, the government ordered it to stop issuing those figures and statistics. It shut down the flow of information to the public. Since then we have had to rely on leaks to get updates on AWAs. Unsurprisingly, those leaks show that the rights of workers continue to be stripped away every day. MAIN COMMITTEE How else do we get information from this government? We do try in estimates. For instance, we found out that since November last year the Office of Workplace Services and the Office of the Employment Advocate have refused to provide a single answer to questions on notice put to them in Senate estimates. Almost 300 questions have gone unanswered-an amazing level of secrecy when it comes to detailed questions about this government’s policy in an area that is vital to all Australians: workplace relations. Perhaps those two agencies have been too busy implementing a government-ordered name change-part of the process of trying to make the words ‘Work Choices’ disappear-to get around to answering any questions. This leads me to the government’s second response to community outrage about Work Choices. After covering up the substance, it is spending up big on the spin. When it comes to publicising the glossy, ad agency generated key lines, the government is certainly no shrinking violet. Its fake fairness test, you will remember, was being advertised in full-page as in the daily newspapers and through $4.1 million a week in TV advertising space before the legislation was even passed. But no amount of advertising is going to address the basic unfairness of being forced to sign an AWA to get a job, or of not being able to reach a collective agreement when a majority of the workplace wants one. Because the Howard government does not believe in equality, with its individual contracts it is picking off workers one by one-each time diminishing the voice of the whole until it can no longer be heard. If the government were really serious about restoring fairness in the workplace, it would take up the proposals Labor has adopted in the Forward with Fairness policy. I do not believe the government’s approach to occupational health and safety in the building and construction industry is the right approach. I do not think it is going to avoid tragedies like the one that occurred for a Central Coast and Newcastle family. It is a political approach that, in combination with the National Code of Practice for the Construction Industry and the Work Choices legislation, is more focused on heavy-handed regulation than on actual safety outcomes. It also does nothing to address some of the wider issues in the construction industry which I have outlined, including the protection of workers’ entitlements and the avoidance of employers’ obligations. I commend to the House the approach that Labor is proposing in this area, which is to replace the Australian Building and Construction Commission in 2010 with a specialist division within the proposed Fair Work Australia. I earlier mentioned the company Hightrade, a Chinese company that is operating in our city redeveloping a site called Latec House. It is particularly concerning to know that many of the workers on that site are Chinese workers brought in on 457 visas. The City itself has been quietly worried about their safety conditions. The union is not allowed on that site for inspection, and that company has unfortunately not established a good record in standards or in safety. We will pass this legislation because we will not stand in the way if the government is trying to repair some of the damage its bad policies have already done, but it is disappointing that the legislation will not go far enough to address the real needs of occupational health and safety of people in a very high-risk industry. We will continue to advocate for Labor’s alternative approach, an approach which places occupational health and safety in the building and construction industry within the context of a comprehensive plan to restore fairness and safety in all Australian workplaces. MAIN COMMITTEE Improvement Amendment (OHS) Bill 2007 contains important provisions relating to occupational health and safety issues in the building industry. It is on this basis that the bill will be supported by the opposition. The historical reasons for the formation of the Australian Labor Party relate simply to the quest by working people for better wages and conditions, and the issue of improving the occupational health and safety of workers is always foremost in the minds of Labor members when considering any legislation that comes before the parliament. We on this side of the House may have real issues with the operation of the government’s Australian Building and Construction Commission; however, we will on this occasion support the attempts by the federal government to use its influence as a client and capital provider to improve the construction industry’s occupational health and safety performance. As all members of this House know, the building and construction industry is a dangerous one to work in. Introducing the bill, the Minister for Workforce Participation quoted statistics from the Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry which indicated that, in the year 2002-03, 37 compensated fatalities occurred in the building industry. That equated to some one-fifth of all compensated fatalities. There were 12,500 compensated injuries. That is at a rate of 34 per day, which is the third highest incidence overall. The latest statistics I have been able to access indicate that in 2003-04 there were 41 deaths and in 2004-05 there were 25 fatalities. This corresponds to a fatality incidence rate of 4.7 fatalities per 100,000 employees in 2004-05, which is almost twice the rate for Australia of 2.5 fatalities per 100,000 employees. There are various reasons given for that level of fatalities: long-term contact with chemicals or substances, which accounts for 28 per cent of fatalities; vehicle accidents, which account for 11 per cent of fatalities; and falls from a height, which account for 10 per cent of fatalities. These statistics do not reveal the pain and trauma to building workers and their families as a result of accident and death in their industry. One death or one accident is one too many. The collective effort of all in this House, all employers and all workers ought to be directed at all times to reducing death and accidents in this industry to the lowest level that is humanly possible. Every building worker-indeed, every worker-who leaves home of a morning has the expectation of coming home at the end of the day to be with their family and friends. This expectation is shared by employers and workers in all industries, but all of us know that because of the nature of some work there are real dangers present in workplaces and accidents do occur. These accidents have to be minimised at all cost. Unfortunately, some employers do not reasonably apply the expectation they hold for themselves-that is, that they will come home safely to their family and friends of an evening-to the workers employed in their enterprises. For reasons of profit, they cut corners and compromise on safety, and the inevitable result is accidents and death. The Howard government cannot have it both ways in this debate. It cannot on the one hand under its Work Choices legislation make a worker feel insecure in their employment if they report unsafe work practices and unsafe work sites and, in some cases, penalise them for doing so while on the other hand coming into this chamber mouthing a lot of platitudes about using the Commonwealth’s influence to improve occupational health and safety performance. I would have thought the best place to tackle occupational health and safety issues would be in legislation that applies across the board and is not sector specific. The best way to ensure MAIN COMMITTEE",153,Building And Construction Industry Improvement Amendment
206,Mr Gavan O’connor (Corio) (11.27 Am),"The Building and Construction Industryvigilance on safety at the workplace level is not to penalise workers for raising occupational health and safety issues or when they take industrial action on those matters. In the case of the building and construction industry, the government has created some 200 pages of new legislation and, through various legislative initiatives, has created an astonishing level of regulation and bureaucracy in this industry. Regulation to protect the safety of workers in their workplaces we on this side of the chamber will accept. Regulation to give effect to conservative, ideological and political prejudice we cannot and will not accept. While the government tinkers with these issues, it is failing to take substantive action on a number of significant other issues that relate to illicit practice and malpractice in this industry-phoenix companies, tax avoidance and the need to protect building workers’ entitlements. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act to change the process of appointing federal safety officers and to extend the application of the Australian Government Building and Construction Occupational Health and Safety Accreditation Scheme administered by the Office of the Federal Safety Commissioner to cover situations where building work is indirectly funded by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority. The scheme was designed to allow the government to use its influence as a client and as the provider of capital to improve the construction industry’s occupational health and safety performance. The bill also ensures that persons are accredited under the scheme at the time of entering into a contract for building work funded by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority and that the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority takes appropriate steps to see that such a person is also accredited while the building work is being carried out. It extends the accreditation requirements to direct and indirect funding arrangements and preconstruction agreements as defined, widens the definition of ‘builder’, clarifies that section 35(4) of the act only overrides Commonwealth provisions to the extent of any inconsistency, and allows the Federal Safety Commissioner and persons working in the Office of the Federal Safety Commissioner to disclose protected information gathered on the scheme to the minister. As I stated previously, we on this side of the chamber will be supporting these measures in the bill. On a more general note, let me restate that Labor will abolish all agencies used by the Howard government for its Work Choices laws. These agencies will be replaced by a single agency, Fair Work Australia. The Australian Building and Construction Commission will be abolished by 2010 and its functions and operations will be reoriented and relocated in a specific division within the Fair Work Australia inspectorate. We on this side of the House believe that this nation can enjoy economic prosperity and, at the same time, achieve the fundamental fairness that we all tout as being an important Australian value. Put quite simply, our IR system will be fairer, simpler and more productive. These measures will apply to building workers as they apply to workers throughout industry. We will provide a decent safety net for all working Australians that includes regular hours of work, flexible work for parents, public holidays, overtime and penalty rates. We will balance the unfair dismissal laws to protect hard working Australians from unfair dismissal and businesses from paying go-away money to unsuitable employees. We will institute a flexible system based on collective enterprise bargaining, modern simple awards and common law arrangements. We will not allow unfair take-it-or-leave-it AWAs which have been used to cut the take-home pay of working Australians on building sites and elsewhere in the economy. MAIN COMMITTEE We will establish a new independent umpire which is accessible to all Australians and has appropriate powers to resolve disputes. Of course, we know that the building and construction industry has in the past not had the best of records in this regard. However, it would be erroneous to lay all of this blame at the feet of building and construction unionists and workers because we know for a fact that in this industry there have been unscrupulous employers that have not met their responsibilities to their employees. We will establish a national industrial relations system for the private sector, which will be developed in cooperation with state governments, and we will get a simpler system to make it easier for Australian employers and employees, including the building industry, to understand their rights and entitlements. That is the nub of the industrial relations policy which will be instituted by a future Labor government and which will apply to the building and construction industry as well as others. Let me conclude by touching on a matter I have raised before on the floor of this House, and that is the persistent denigration of construction workers and their union representatives in this place by government members. I make these remarks on behalf of all those workers in Geelong’s construction industry who not only have supported families affected by death and injury in their own ranks but have extended that hand of support to others in the general community. In a speech in 2005 on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005 in the HouseI outlined the very real community involvement of Geelong building workers in supporting the disadvantaged in Geelong. I mentioned the breakfast program at the Whittington Primary School, rebuilding a school canteen when the school could not afford it, a house renovation for an injured building worker’s family, a memorial pergola at a school for two children who were killed in an accident, ongoing support for the family of a building worker killed in an accident, support for unionists from other industries who have fallen on hard times-and the list goes on. I draw the House’s attention to an article that appeared in the Geelong Advertiser of 11 August concerning a Geelong family that was suffering because of another accident. This related to Charlene Cavanagh, who was allegedly hit by a drunk driver. According to the report, she may well have thrown herself in front of her very young child, Jadan Cavanagh, to protect the child in the accident. This particular story warmed the hearts of members of the Geelong community as well as those of people in the construction industry. According to the report, construction workers working on the Westfield development went into gear and in two days raised $3,000 to support the family through this traumatic time. The report said: The occupational health and safety representative for the site, Darren Brockway, plumbing union representative Russell Menzies and electrical union representative John Long unloaded $700 worth of toys and clothes for Jadan and also presented Ms Fraserthat is, Jadan’s grandmotherwith $1780 cash and a $1000 Champions IGA voucher. That is a not unsubstantial amount raised in two days by building and construction workers in Geelong for another Geelong family facing difficulty. I cannot count the number of times that government members have got up in this place to drive the boot into construction industry workers, and I want to put on the public record here today my opposition to their comments and my commendation of the actions taken by construction workers in Geelong on behalf of the disadvantaged on many occasions, including this most recent one. We will be supporting this bill. MAIN COMMITTEE Ms HALL (Shortland) (11.42 am)-I commence my contribution to this debate on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (OHS) Bill 2007 where the previous speaker, the member for Corio, ended. I record my support for the construction workers in the Shortland electorate and acknowledge the fine contributions that they have made in my community and surrounding communities. In doing so, I acknowledge the work that they put in for disadvantaged people and the projects and the campaigns that they get behind in supporting people that have particular problems within the community. I will quickly go through the bill. The bill before us extends the application of the Australian Government Building and Construction Occupational Health and Safety Accreditation Scheme, which is administered by the Office of the Federal Safety Commissioner, to cover situations where building work is indirectly funded by the Commonwealth or Commonwealth authorities. It ensures that persons are accredited under the scheme at the time of entering into a contract for building work funded by the Commonwealth or Commonwealth authorities and that the Commonwealth or Commonwealth authorities take appropriate steps to see that such persons are also accredited while the building work is being carried out. It also extends the accreditation requirement to funding arrangements beyond those currently contemplated by the legislation. It clarifies that section 35(4) of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 only overrides Commonwealth provisions to the extent of any inconsistency. It streamlines the process of appointing federal safety officers and allows the Federal Safety Commissioner and persons working in the Office of the Federal Safety Commissioner to disclose information on the scheme to the minister. I support the legislation that we have before us today, but in doing so I have some comments that I would like to make. Not all of those comments are supportive of the government and the government’s approach to this piece of legislation. EarlierI listened to the member for Corangamite reel out an ‘expose’ of every union official that has ever worked or been elected within Australia. He spent a lot of time denigrating those people. Those union officials, some of whom will be in this parliament after the next election, have made an enormous contribution to their industries and to our Australian community. I do not step away from the fact that in the Labor Party we have members who have ensured that workers have good conditions and safety within the workplace and who were there to look after them. In this current environment, where we have this harsh Work Choices legislation that this government foisted upon the Australian people, there really is a very strong need for workers to be protected. This legislation that has been forced on the Australian community is putting workers at risk and has the potential to put workers further at risk. I will talk a little bit more about that later. The building industry, as we all know, is a very dangerous industry and a lot of evidence has been submitted to show that there have been very unsafe practices used within the building and construction industry over a number of years. A number of injuries have happened that should not have happened. Workers have been injured because they were pushed to a level beyond that to which they should have been pushed and because workers had not been trained properly in safety. I think there are a number of issues within that industry that will not be resolved by going out and attacking the union. Many of those problems have been brought about by employers, and the majority that I hear about are the result of employer driven activities. MAIN COMMITTEE Within the last couple of years a young man lost his life close to where I live. It happened purely and simply because he was forced to do things that a person should not be forced to do. When the government talks about the building and construction industry we hear a tirade of attacks on union officials, but we do not hear anything about the good things that they have done or the changes that they made to make those workplaces safer. I think any legislation, or any argument on a piece of legislation, should have some balance in it. Whilst the government commissioned the Cole inquiry and it brought down its findings, I think the terms of reference it was given were very limited and the report reflected those limited terms of reference. Occupational health and safety is something that I am passionate about, having worked for many years with people who have been injured purely and simply because of unsafe work practices. Whilst supporting this legislation that we have before us now, I do not think that it is going to be the ultimate answer to improving safety within the building and construction industry. I believe that the government can either address occupational health and safety issues purely and simply by bashing unions or really look at the underlying issues, which go across many areas within this industry and other industries. The building and construction industry is an unsafe industry and has been for many years. I do not think that the legislation that we are debating today will solve that problem. I see that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has entered the chamber and I say to him: I listened to a lot of what you had to say. There was a lot of bluster and attack. But, Minister, I implore you, when you are looking at some of these issues, to look at them from the person’s perspective, from a whole-of-community perspective. When you are looking at the building industry, don’t just approach it from the perspective of attacking the union. When you look at safety, look at safety for the whole of the industry. Look at putting in place actual changes that are going to deliver a safe industry, a safe working environment. Good employers do the right thing; bad employers do the wrong thing. Good employees do the right thing; bad employees do the wrong thing. Over the years, unions have made enormous contributions to safety in the workplace. Over the years the unions have done things that have improved our working environment. Minister, instead of always attacking, sometimes if you can sit down and talk and try to work together to resolve issues and don’t just make it a slagging match I think you get the best outcomes. Workplace safety is obtained by people working together and trying to bring all parties in and lead them forward so that you create a safe workplace and a safe environment. With those few comments, I will state once again for the record that I, along with other members on this side of the House, am supporting this legislation. Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (11.52 am)-I thank members who have contributed to the debate on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (OHS) Bill 2007 and I note members’ support for the bill. First and foremost, I would like to make it clear to members what this bill is and what it is not. For all the predictable ranting from the members opposite, this bill is not related to workplace relations issues in the building and construction industry and it is not about the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner. This bill is very simply about saving lives. It is about ensuring that workers in the building and construction industry make it home safely to their families and friends at the end of each day. MAIN COMMITTEE",157,Building And Construction Industry Improvement Amendment
207,Mr Hockey (North Sydney,"Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations andThe government is committed to improving the occupational health and safety performance of the construction industry and to developing a culture where workers perform safely as well as being on budget and on time. Cultural change takes time, effort and, most importantly, leadership. The government is providing leadership to the building and construction industry through the Federal Safety Commissioner, through the Australian Government Building and Construction Industry Occupational Health and Safety Accreditation Scheme and by acting as a model client. This government will not do business with builders who do not hold safety in the highest regard. Through this bill, accreditation under the scheme will become a requirement not only for builders on directly funded Australian government construction projects but also for builders on construction projects to which the government has contributed significant funding, such as AusLink road projects. These amendments are not made to address deficiencies in the BCII Act, as the Labor Party would have us believe. It was always the intention of the government that the scheme would be implemented in a staged approach to allow a suitable adjustment period for affected companies-and that is exactly what the main amendments of this bill deliver. The government has driven stunning improvement in the building and construction industry with the establishment of the ABCC and the Federal Safety Commissioner. What the Labor Party proposes now is to wind back the clock by abolishing the ABCC and to enable the union bosses-people like Kevin Reynolds, Kevin Harkins, Joe McDonald and all the friends of the honourable member opposite-to use occupational health and safety as part of their industrial relations strategies. A study into the impact of the ABCC, which was released in July 2007 by Econtech, found-and the honourable member should pay attention to this-that labour productivity in the construction industry is 9.4 per cent higher as a result of the creation of the ABCC. That is a good thing. You would agree, wouldn’t you? As a result of the creation of the ABCC, GDP in Australia is 1.5 per cent higher than it otherwise would have been. Inflation in Australia, the CPI, is 1.2 per cent lower than it otherwise would have been if we had never created the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Compared with the 1994 to 2003 period, when costs in the commercial building sector were 10.7 per cent higher than in domestic residential building, the cost gap between these two sectors of construction has fallen to just 1.7 per cent. Further, working days lost per 1,000 employees due to industrial action have plummeted from 37.4 in the September 2005 quarter, immediately before the creation of the ABCC, to just 1.5 in the March 2007 quarter. So that is 37.4 working days down to 1.5 working days lost to strikes. Why would anyone abolish the initiatives and the body that have delivered these improvements? It is pretty simple: the Labor Party wants to abolish them because that is what the union bosses want. That is what the CFMEU and the BLF in Queensland want: they want to abolish the watchdog that has brought about sanity in the construction industry. These amendments strengthen the already strong base for improving occupational health and safety in the construction industry. I encourage my colleagues to continue to support this bill, commend the bill to the House and recognise that the ABCC, together with all of the surrounding infrastructure, is helping to deliver a more stable, a more successful and, even more importantly, a safer building and construction industry in Australia. MAIN COMMITTEE Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (11.58 am)-I move: That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Economy Ms HALL (Shortland) (11.58 am)-I would like to take this opportunity to examine the Prime Minister’s assertion that Australians have never been better off. I am constantly contacted by constituents within the Shortland electorate who advise me that they have never found it harder to make ends meet. They talk to me about the price of their groceries, their meat, their fruit and their vegetables. In recent times we have had another interest rate rise, which is the ninth interest rate rise in a row and the fifth since the last election, when John Howard promised to keep them at a record low. This was done in commercials that the government ran at the time. I have never heard anyone try to move further away from it quicker than John Howard has in recent times. To demonstrate the fact that Australians are not better off than they have been in the past, I would like to refer to a letter that I received from one of my constituents. This gentleman has now retired. When he first started working, he was earning the equivalent of $9 a week. He purchased his first house for £1,200 at the time. He has equated that using a formula of multiplying his house price by 58, which brings the figure to $139,200. He has recently had his house evaluated, and it is now valued at $800,000. His council fees have gone up at a much steeper curve and are much higher than he was paying initially. What this demonstrates very clearly is that the income that he was getting at the time made it much easier for him to purchase a house-it cost a lot less than it does now. You now need a much higher income to purchase the house that he purchased-a house that cost the equivalent of $139,000 but that you would have to pay $800,000 for now. You would have to be on quite a sizeable income these days. This person was on a pretty much average income. What these changes have meant to people like my constituent is that they have a lot of difficulty making ends meet. Another example he gives me is the cost of having a tooth extracted. Believe it or not, it was 25c in 1938. If you multiply that by 58, that is $14.50 now. If anyone has been to a dentist recently, they will find that to have a tooth extracted costs a lot more than $14.50. In fact, I had a constituent come into my office the other day. She had just had her tooth removed and it cost her $250. I would argue very strongly that what these figures demonstrate is that Australians are not better off than they have ever been in the past. What they show to me is that the Prime Minister is really out of touch. He does not know the issues that are affecting the Australians that I represent in this parliament-pensioners, people who have jobs where they just earn the average income. People living in the Shortland electorate have a very low median income. The government and particularly the Prime Minister seem to have lost touch with people. He seems to have lost the ability to connect with them and the issues that are affecting them. My constituent also highlights the fact that the government is very quiet on the high wage rises for MAIN COMMITTEE CEOs but very active in arguing against workers getting increases in their wages from the Fair Pay Commission. Adelaide: Roads Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (12.03 pm)-Adelaide used to pride itself on being the 20-minute city-it was possible to travel anywhere within Adelaide in 20 minutes. One of the issues that constituents in the electorate of Boothby now contact me about is the fact that infrastructure has not kept pace with the growth in population with newer housing subdivisions. We still have very much the same infrastructure that was laid out in the 1960s. There was a plan, a MATS scheme, which was developed by the Hall government in the 1960s. It proposed a number of arterial roads, including a north-south arterial road. One of the missed opportunities is that much of the land that was set aside for this scheme was sold off by the Bannon government in the 1980s. But the RAA have come up with a proposal for a north-south expressway, 22 kilometres of non-stop traffic from Wingfield to Darlington along South Road. The state government are already doing some grade separations. They have announced a grade separation-an underpass at ANZAC Highway. They have also announced a number of other projects at Port Road, Grange Road and Sturt Road. For such a project to occur in my electorate would require grade separations at Daws Road and at Ayliffes Road. One of the things I am very keen to see is an additional part of Cross Road and South Road put on the AusLink network. This project is vital for the future economic prosperity of South Australia. It has the support of a number of key groups, including the RAA, the South Australian Freight Council, Business SA and the South Australian Road Transport Association. The benefits of such a project are that it will help the economy of the region and it will help to reduce traffic flows. One of the problems is congestion, so to have a smooth, flowing expressway going along South Road will be of great benefit to people who are creating jobs and opportunity in southern Adelaide. Cross Road was upgraded for freight traffic about 10 years ago by the state government. My understanding is that it does not require additional work for that purpose. It does make a lot of sense to add Cross Road and South Road to the AusLink network. One of the frustrations I have as I travel around Australia is seeing the quality of the infrastructure in other states, and it is very clear as you go to Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland that the infrastructure is far better than the infrastructure we have in South Australia. This is a very important priority for me. It is an important project and it is one that I will be continuing to push for to see that Cross Road and South Road are put on the AusLink network. It will enable federal funding for what is estimated to be a $1.5 billion to $2 billion project. It does involve tunnels, underpasses and overpasses. It is an important project and one that there is enormous support for in southern Adelaide. It has been identified as a key priority for the southern economic development council, and it is something that I am very keen to see happen. Box Hill North Primary School Kerrimuir Primary School Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (12.08 pm)-The other day I had the absolute delight and pleasure to visit the students in grades 5 and 6 at Box Hill North Primary School to talk about my MAIN COMMITTEE role as a member of parliament. The students in grade 6 have all written back to me, and I would like to share with you some of the views of our next crop of leaders in this world: Dear Anna Burke, Thank you for being able to come to our school on Monday. We learnt a lot about government, politics, your job and your leadership skills. I was surprised that you were so relaxed in every day life most of the time. A job as a politician seems tiring and difficult with all the travelling you have to do and the hours you work every day. We learnt that with politics, you don’t have to have any special qualifications, you just need to be elected into parliament. We also learnt that if you lost your seat in parliament, you could be out of a job as Federal Member for Chisholm. We can relate your leadership skills to being a leader at our school. With my leadership role, I help check the weekly school newsletter for mistakes and deliver notices around the school. Thanks for teaching us more about politics and giving up your time to be able to speak to us. Yours sincerely, BenjaminI can attest to Benjamin’s fantastic spelling and incredibly neat handwriting. He must do a great job as the checker of his school newsletter. Then there is this: Dear Anna, Thank-you so much for coming to our school. It was interesting to hear about your experiences as a politician and what you do every day. It was good to talk to a real politician since our inquiry topic is government and was good to learn about a politicians life, and duties. You are a great leader and I learnt a lot about being confident and being yourself. I will try and use some of these skills with my leadership role, being school captain. You are so lucky to be able to have a say in what happens in Australia. I would love that. Thanks again. You were great, hope to see you soon. Ruby. There is also this: To Anna, Thank-you very much for coming to our school and sharing about what you do as a politician. We really appreciate that you gave up your time to come and visit us. I learnt lots of things such as you represent Chisholm. You are much different than I thought because you are a happy and cheerful person to have around. I expected you to be a lot more serious. I also learnt that you represent the Labor Party. Listening to you was very interesting because you used lots of expression and you spoke very clearly. I think you are a great speaker. Being House Captain it was a good experience to listen to a great leader. Once again thank-you very much for coming. From Eliza. This is another letter: Dear Anna, Thanks a lot for coming. It might have caused some trouble in your daily schedule, seeing that you have got a lot to get through in one day. I have two questions to ask. How many schools do you usually visit in a week. How many people have a federal seat of Chisholm or is it the 150? MAIN COMMITTEE I am not sure I got myself clear on that one, but anyway we will go back and answer his question. He writes: At our school we (the grade 6’s) all have a role. Mine’s Technology captain with my friend Ken. I have learned to confident and try every option, instead of trying the most likely. We all learnt something. I didn’t think politics had to get through so much in a day. I also didn’t know they had to get someone to organise their diary. Life as a politician must be almost as hard as running an auction. (My mum runs one and she is mad now) Thanks again for coming. We appreciated it and we were intrigued by your experiences. BenI hope Ben hasn’t shown this to his mum. This is another: Dear Anna ..., It was an honour to have you visit our school to educate us about the life of a politician during your busy timetable. It is such a rare occasion to have a federal member of parliament visit our school and talk about what they do for a living. At B.H.N.P.S Box Hill North Primary Schoolsince year 6s are almost EXTINCT, every single year 6 gets a ‘leadership role’, and I’m the ART about. I’m sure that all those leadership qualities you passed on will come in handy a lot as art captain and in the future ... Once again, we thank you so much for coming and sharing, and we wish that you shall never quit (until you decide to retire a long way down the track) or lose an election! (10 years sleep surely can’t be too good for you!) Kindest Regards, JasmineI have another one here. It is from Pat, who also drew me a fantastic picture of myself, which you can’t really appreciate. Dr Southcott interjectingDear Anna ... How are you? We are fine. Thank you very much for coming to our school, sharing about you, making time with us, giving lots of information about you. And book marks, books for us. Also be nice to us too. I hope you have a good time every days. Bye Bye From Pat. On and on the letters go. The grade sixers put a lot of time and effort into doing this and into writing back to me. I also want to commend the teachers in our state system for doing such a fantastic job and for educating the next generation about government and politics. We witness so many people going into polling booths who actually do not understand the system of government. So to actually educate people at a young age about how the system works and what the levels of government are and to demonstrate that politicians are human beings-that they are accessible and that it is our job to be there-is a delightful experience. I really enjoyed my day at the school and want to thank the students so much for their fantastic letters. MAIN COMMITTEE",161,Building And Construction Industry Improvement Amendment
208,Ms Burke,"It is a very good likeness. She took a lot of effort to do that. She says:I also want to thank the very cheeky PrepC children at Kerrimuir Primary School. Kerrimuir Primary School is having a competition to create the best garden area. Each grade is in the competition and PrepC has had the brains and the wit to send me a fantastic poster asking if I will help in their endeavours to create the best garden plot at Kerrimuir. I think this is a terrific idea, and I really want to commend this school. (Time expired) Dobell Electorate: Services Crime and Vandalism issues in my electorate of Dobell. Local residents have already won a concession from Energy Australia for powerlines to be placed underground from Willoughby Road to Wamberal Cemetery in Wamberal. However, I have recently been inundated with letters from local residents concerned that Energy Australia has not included the northern section of Wamberal from the cemetery, past the Jehovah’s Witnesses church and around the new preschool site, to Wamberal Public School and Wamberal Fire Station. While it is a great concession that Energy Australia has listened to the Wamberal community by conceding to put four kilometres of powerlines underground, parents are anxious about having high-voltage powerlines passing directly in front of Wamberal Public School. Concerned local residents and parents of students have signed a petition calling for this important extension to be made, ensuring that these high-voltage powerlines are all underground. Energy Australia really needs to go that extra step and include the northern part of Wamberal in the underground route. It is the right thing to do. The installation of these high-voltage powerlines is part of a project that will deliver a bulk electricity supply upgrade to Wamberal, Terrigal, Erina, Erina Heights, Holgate, Matcham, North Avoca and Picketts Valley. The powerlines will link Energy Australia’s bulk supply point in Yates Road, Ourimbah, with a new substation proposed for Willoughby Road, Wamberal. Energy Australia expects construction of these powerlines to begin in September. Placing these high-voltage powerlines underground would remove the fear of them passing in front of more than 300 houses. As the federal member for our local area, I am committed to protecting our way of life on the Central Coast, and I want to ensure that Energy Australia listens and responds fully to the concerns of the Wamberal community. The health and safety of our children is very important. I intend to meet with Energy Australia management to discuss local residents’ concerns. I congratulate the Wamberal community, led by Mr John Holt, on their win and encourage them to continue lobbying Energy Australia to ensure the job gets done properly. Another important issue I would like to raise here today on behalf of my constituency is crime on the Central Coast. We have had enough of hoons, vandals and graffiti. It is simply not good enough that the New South Wales government is failing in its responsibility to ensure that our community is adequately protected. People have a right to feel safe in their homes and on their local streets. That is why, as a result of community feedback, I am working to get federal funding for CCTV cameras in The Entrance town centre under the National Community Crime Prevention Program. These cameras would be installed in problem areas and would be monitored around the clock by local police. By identifying repeat offenders, we can help to stop the cycle of crime in The Entrance. This is an initiative which is also being considered by the Toukley Chamber of Commerce to reduce crime in Toukley. I have been MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Captain You Inspired Me Along With Everybody Else Especially Year 6s On What A Good Leader Is All
209,Mr Ticehurst (Dobell) (12.13 Pm),"I rise today to speak about a couple of importantfighting hard to ensure funding and support for these projects to help stop crime before it happens. We have already received $148,000 in federal government funding for Family Child Services Central Coast to support and mentor vulnerable families with the aim of decreasing family violence in our community, and $50,000 has also been secured for Uniting Care Burnside to educate young people on sexual violence. But there is more to be done, and I am committed to continuing to work with our local community because together we can help put a stop to unacceptable behaviour in our local area and make our community safer. Telecommunications: Online Services Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (12.17 pm)-I note the member for Chisholm’s earlier comments about the role of members of parliament. I suppose the case that I wish to talk about today illustrates what individual members of parliament do and can achieve. Two years ago I raised in the House a constituent’s case to do with online marketing and suspected predatory behaviour against that constituent’s small business, Stickybeek, by Trading Post, the online marketing arm of Sensis and Telstra. My constituent had found that when potential customers were searching on Google for his brand, Stickybeek, to access car sales, a search page would come up with Stickybeek’s car listings. But on the right hand side of the screen the word ‘Stickybeek’ would come up, spelt in the same corrupted way as my constituent’s registered trademark-with a double ‘e’. If you clicked on that word on that page, you would be taken straight to the Trading Post site and their list of cars for sale. My constituent was concerned about a decline in his business from loss of sales and sought my assistance. On my advice, knowing full well that to take on Telstra through the law courts would be a horrendous task for a small business person, the complaint was taken to the ACCC for a suspected breach of the Trade Practices Act. The enforcement committee of the ACCC investigated the actions of both Google and Trading Post in relation to my constituent’s complaint. Their judgement was that the Trading Post conduct may have contravened sections 52 and 53D of the Trade Practices Act and therefore may have constituted misleading or deceptive conduct and misrepresentation of an affiliation or sponsorship that Trading Post did not actually have in suggesting that it was indeed Stickybeek. However, the ACCC concluded that, as the offending practice had ceased and as they had received undertakings from Trading Post to that effect, there would be no further action. In the ACCC’s investigations Google were approached. Google stated that as soon as they were told of any such problems they deleted the offending keyword or sponsored link but took no further responsibility for the actions of its customers. My constituent and I were both very disappointed with this outcome. A rap on the knuckles for big business preying on small business did not seem a satisfactory or adequate outcome. Two months after that decision in 2005, further complaints were made by Newcastle car sales companies indicating that Trading Post was again using the names of competitors in the title of its sponsored links. These competitors were Newcastle companies, Kloster Ford and Charlestown Toyota. I pay tribute to the involvement of Michael Garnham of Stickybeek, my original constituent, for again bringing that repeat practice to the public attention. As a result, the ACCC undertook new investigations which ultimately led to the ACCC enforcement committee recommending the institution of legal proceedings against Trading Post and, interMAIN COMMITTEE estingly, against Google. The ACCC in its decision clearly noted Trading Post’s failure to meet the commitments it had made to the ACCC in my constituent’s original case. On 11 July 2007, the ACCC instituted proceedings against Trading Post and Google in the Federal Court, seeking declarations that the two companies contravened the Trade Practices Act and seeking injunctions prohibiting either party from engaging in similar conduct in future. The purpose of this action, according to the ACCC, is to clarify the application of the law in a new and expanding advertising medium and obtain a legal precedent that the use of a competitor’s business name in the title of sponsored links amounts to a contravention of the Trade Practices Act. This is an extremely important case. It is one that tests a new area of law, a new area of marketing behaviour and a global area of marketing behaviour. I applaud the ACCC for taking this brave action. It is one that has captured attention around the world. The Wall Street Journal condemns the ACCC for this action, claiming that everyone knows that, if you use Google, you will find an advertisement on every page and, therefore, you just have to accept that. But you do not expect to see a registered trademark being used, just as you would not expect in the traditional markets to set up a business and call it David Jones or a supermarket and call it Coles. The Wall Street Journal fears that this will be disruptive to the market, that it will create a monster, but I think it is a brave action, and it is not the first action taken against Google. As policymakers, we have concerns about the responsibility of search engines to control predators on children, paedophiles and pornography. Where does the responsibility lie? I applaud the ACCC for this test case and look forward with interest to its outcomes. (Time expired) Greenway Electorate: Roads tance in my electorate: Richmond Road. Richmond Road has been the scene of many accidents, including fatalities, and it has been a source of contention for many years. Just recently we heard of another unnecessary death when an elderly lady trying to make a right-hand turn was hit from behind and pushed head-on into a truck. Having lived and worked in the Hawkesbury and Western Sydney, I frequently use this road and have also had experiences and near misses. How can a road which is such a major thoroughfare between Blacktown and Richmond have been neglected for so long? We hear the state members for Riverstone and Londonderry saying that they are spending money on Richmond Road. The money they are spending is on one intersection, so what can we do with the other 27 kilometres? Richmond Road-Blacktown Road is approximately 34 kilometres in length. Seven kilometres of this is from Blacktown and is at least dual carriageway. The remaining 27 kilometres from the M7 overpass to Richmond is a single lane, a goat track. It is unacceptable. The New South Wales Labor government treats the people of Western Sydney and the Hawkesbury like second-class citizens and expects them to drive along a road you would never see in other parts of Sydney. Unfortunately, Western Sydney is neglected by the New South Wales Labor government. You just have to look at Richmond Road, Camden Valley Way and Northern Road. All of them are like goat tracks, single lane for most of the way. All of these roads are close to, if not part of, the state Labor government’s plan for south-west and north-west sector developments, which will see hundreds of thousands of people move into MAIN COMMITTEE",167,Captain You Inspired Me Along With Everybody Else Especially Year 6s On What A Good Leader Is All
210,Mrs Markus (Greenway) (12.22 Pm),"I rise to speak about a matter of great importhese areas. Maybe they are hoping the developers, or indeed the landholders, will pay for the upgrades. If Richmond Road were located in the middle of Sydney, or maybe in a marginal state Labor seat, I am quite sure that the New South Wales Labor government would have committed to upgrading it fully by now. Eric Roozendaal in February said that there is no timetable to convert the road at present. Tell that to the people who have lost a mother, a father, a brother, an uncle, a sister or a friend. I want to congratulate the Hawkesbury City Council on tackling the issue head-on and erecting signs along Richmond Road demanding that it be upgraded now. I would like to ask the New South Wales Labor government why the RTA then came along and pulled them down. Was it because the truth hurts? Was it because the state Labor government does not like being reminded that, yet again, they have let the people of Western Sydney and the Hawkesbury down? Richmond Road cannot remain in its current state. You will hear the local state Labor members saying that the upgrading of one intersection is a start. A start is not good enough. There are several other intersections where there have been facilities: where St Marys Road meets Richmond Road and at the Garfield Road intersection. The intersection at Grange Road, which I come out of quite frequently, has also seen a number of near misses and fatalities. How many more people have to die or be seriously injured before Richmond Road is upgraded? Over the years, the New South Wales government has moved the cost burden of infrastructure for new estates off itself and onto new home buyers through taxes. Surely a portion of the hundreds of millions of dollars the state government has saved by slugging new home buyers could be set aside and invested in the upgrade of Richmond Road. It needs to be an upgraded dual carriageway. I have spoken to councillors, local residents and businesspeople who support a petition I have been asking people to sign demanding that the New South Wales Labor government upgrade this road. I have asked how state Labor members and the state Labor government-who claim to represent us, the people of Western Sydney and the people of the Hawkesbury-can sit on their hands day after day and allow this road to remain in its present state. I call on the New South Wales Labor government to stop treating the people of Western Sydney and the Hawkesbury like second-class citizens and commit to upgrading the remaining 27 kilometres of the road before another life is lost. People in the area and the region are tired of travelling along Richmond Road in its current state. I am demanding that the New South Wales Labor government commit to a date when they will undertake a review of the road and then commit to fully upgrading this road to a dual carriageway. Climate Change year has an article by Professor Lawrence Krauss of Case Western Reserve University that warns voters to swiftly reject any candidates that flaunt their scientific illiteracy. The article questions whether a scientifically illiterate individual can be expected to properly assess the complex scientific and technological issues that now form the basis of significant policy issues, such as global warming or weapons of mass destruction. MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Captain You Inspired Me Along With Everybody Else Especially Year 6s On What A Good Leader Is All
211,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (12.27 Pm),"The journal New Scientist published on 28 July thisAcknowledging that this advice is directed towards electors in the United States, I believe that the same warning should be heeded by voters in our country, particularly when it comes to deciding which major party has a realistic policy regarding climate change. As Professor Krauss stated: Science is not mere storytelling. It makes predictions that help us control our destiny. It now appears that the destiny of the Howard government is to be decided in part by its members’ abject failure to acquaint themselves with a basic understanding of the science behind climate change. Science is not ideology-a point that the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources has yet to comprehend. Recently, we have seen members of the Howard government repeatedly reject the mass of overwhelming scientific evidence that demonstrates a direct connection between carbon dioxide emissions and climate change. Now it seems that, driven by the evidence of the polls, not the science, the government has begun to accept the possibility that greenhouse gas emissions could just see them expelled from their comfortable ministerial offices. Major countries and states, with the exception of the United States and Australia, have already set carbon dioxide emission reduction targets for the short and longer terms. The United Kingdom government has called for emissions to be reduced by 32 per cent by 2020 and by 60 per cent by 2005 based on 1990 levels. Sweden will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 25 to 30 per cent by 2020 and aims to reduce emissions by between 50 and 75 per cent by 2050. It will also stop importing oil by 2020. California, which by itself would be ranked as the seventh largest economy in the world, has passed a bill that requires reductions in carbon dioxide emissions by 25 per cent by 2020 and 80 per cent by 2050. While the rest of the world is following the California lead, the Howard government continues to ignore this most pressing issue. The Labor Party has set a target to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 60 per cent by 2050, which is the same as the United Kingdom, similar to the Swedish target and less than the Californian target. These targets are based on science, not prejudice or opinion. The continuing growth in Australian emissions from fossil fuels has to be arrested and reversed quickly if Australia is to have any chance of avoiding the consequences of increased droughts, extreme weather events and rising sea levels. Coal-fired power stations are the largest single source of Australian emissions, responsible for 290 million tons of carbon dioxide, or 48 per cent of the total, in 2007 and increasing by approximately two per cent per annum. While the government flounders with geosequestration, effective, cost-competitive and proven technologies for reducing emissions from coalfired power stations already exist. Modern combined-cycle power plants that join coal gasification with gas turbines and steam plants have the potential to halve emissions per unit of electricity generated, yet the government has no plans to encourage the uptake of this working technology. There is also the realistic possibility of using solar energy to replace a very substantial part of Australia’s coal-fired electricity generation, yet disinterest-if not outright hostility-from the government has driven one of Australia’s leading solar scientists, Dr David Mills, to relocate his company to California. Carbon dioxide emissions from transport have grown almost 10 per cent under the Howard government and now total over 80 million tons per annum. They are growing at the rate of 1½ per cent per annum, significantly because of increased subsidies to road transport combined MAIN COMMITTEE with cuts to support for publicly owned railways. If we are to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, it is clear that energy efficiency has to become a guiding principle of public policy, and this is nowhere more obvious than in the transport sector. As NASA physicist Dr James Hansen of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies has warned, we have no more than 10 years to act before serious climate change becomes irreversible. I can see no evidence that the Prime Minister even vaguely comprehends the magnitude of this threat to our nation and the planet. The citizens of Australia must do their bit by voting the government out at the coming federal election. (Time expired) Hospitals Tasmanian Government week in the House, to raise the dastardly situation where the Tasmanian government have prevented the Launceston General Hospital from purchasing a flow cytometer. I raised this matter publicly on the weekend. I am today pleased to advise that that decision has now been overturned. I learned on Tuesday morning that staff at the Launceston General Hospital were advised that approval was now given, only to find that later that day the state government, through its health minister, Lara Giddings, implied that that was not the case. So we now have this challenge going on between some eminent oncologists and haematologists in Launceston and the state Labor health minister. I know for sure whom our community believes in this matter. We look forward nonetheless to the purchase of this flow cytometer because it will be very valuable for our community in the early diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of blood cancers. It is needed and it is warranted because the community raised the funds that were needed to purchase it-some $100,000. It is mean-spirited, to say the least, to have seen the community’s own initiative thwarted because of political reasons. I say ‘political reasons’ because I want to highlight right now to all members that there is a Tasmanian government agenda to centralise as much as possible health services in the south. If the equipment that I have been speaking about is approved, it changes little in the sense that the overall challenge continues. This issue is symbolic of the wider concerns of gradually downgrading and defunding the Launceston General Hospital in order to boost the Royal Hobart Hospital. There is a need for more continued improvement in northern health services. That requires political will, dollars and the Tasmanian government to prioritise northern health services. We still need to see, having made the purchase, the approval for the LGH to administer bone marrow transplants using the new machine. We still need to see the employment of more medical oncologists at Launceston’s Holman Clinic. We still need to have overall proper resourcing of our wards. We still need to see the freeing up of surgical theatres and the reinstatement of LGH as a tertiary level hospital rather than just a regional hospital. The fight continues unabated. The good thing about the Howard government’s intervention at the Mersey hospital is that it will relieve the Tasmanian government of its funding for that hospital, which will free up resources in a way which could mean as much as $40 million to $45 million every year being made available to other hospitals. I am certainly looking for improvements for Burnie and Launceston. MAIN COMMITTEE",170,Captain You Inspired Me Along With Everybody Else Especially Year 6s On What A Good Leader Is All
212,Mr Michael Ferguson (Bass) (12.32 Pm),"I rise, having risen on Monday of thisI also wish to raise an issue which again puts into question the honesty and the integrity of the Tasmanian government. I am very concerned that political games are being played out by the Tasmanian government in my home community. They want to put at risk very, very valuable education opportunities. We have two issues running here. We have the Australian government supporting an Australian technical college at the Inveresk site, which is in the flood zone. The Launceston City Council have been rallying to raise the necessary $39 million in funds to repair the levy system. Repairing the levies will mean that the whole suburb of Invermay and the precinct of Inveresk will be protected from a one-in-100or 200-years flood. It is quite necessary to achieve this, and we have achieved in the sense that three levels of government have each committed $13 million to the overall cost. So, Mr Deputy Speaker, you may ask me: what is the problem? The problem is that the Tasmanian government have now placed conditions on the acquittal of those funds. They are saying to the Launceston City Council: ‘We no longer wish to participate in helping you to restore flood protection for the city of Launceston until you take the Australian technical college off the books, move it away and refuse to allow it to be built.’ These bullying tactics are disgusting, ought not to be tolerated and have to be exposed. Members opposite who will stay silent and Labor candidates who will stay silent ought to hang their heads in shame for deliberately provoking a city council to hold back educational opportunities for young people. I have not had time to speak about the University of Tasmania, which has been placed in the same situation, but I say the Tasmanian government ought to back off. Support Launceston’s flood protection but support worthwhile education opportunities for our young people. Queensland Roads Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (12.37 pm)-I want to speak today about my concerns over the false claims made by the Deputy Prime Minister yesterday when he insinuated that enough is being done to fix Queensland’s road network. The amount of funding into Queensland from the federal government for improving my state’s road network is, in fact, completely inadequate. We in Central Queensland know that our highways are a vital link to services and job opportunities and particularly important given the region’s huge coal production and export facilities. But federal government road funding has not kept pace with our growth and, as any regional driver will attest, our road networks in Queensland are feeling the strain. I am particularly concerned following yet another tragic death on the Eton Range in my electorate and yet another report showing that not a single section of the Bruce Highway in Capricornia is up to scratch. The poor state of our roads is reinforced further by an AusRAP report showing that not a single section of the highway is of suitable standard. In fact, the report points out that half of the network in Capricornia is at medium-high risk of traffic fatality and most of the other half is at medium risk. This is an appalling legacy of neglect that this government is now finally waking up to. It is high time the Prime Minister took my state seriously. We are the fastest growing state in Australia, with 1,500 new arrivals coming across our border each week. Combined with the massive wealth my state brings to the national economy, the facts are clear: Queensland deserves a better go than it is getting-and you would be hard-pressed to find any Queenslander who disagrees. It is high time the Australian government stopped the blame game with the state and fixed these important roads. These roads bring billions of dollars to the national MAIN COMMITTEE economy and are hugely important to the budget surplus that the Treasurer insists on claiming is all his own work. I would also like to point out the vast differences between the federal coalition government and the state Labor government on this issue. This year Queensland Labor will embark on the biggest capital works program of any state or territory. On a per capita basis, the Labor state government will be investing more than any other state or territory. Queensland will spend six per cent of gross state product on capital works, compared with only one per cent of gross domestic product spent by the Commonwealth. The coalition government has ignored the needs of Queensland for years. But now, after 11 years in government and 11 years of neglect, Queensland is finally being wooed in earnest by the Howard government, as it is desperate to cling to power. It has announced $83 million in regional roads funding on top of the roughly $7 billion in AusLink II funding that Queensland will receive from the federal budget. And of course, while most people would accuse the government of pork-barrelling for this year’s federal election, I welcome any money we Queenslanders can pry from the hands of Canberra. But, as always, the devil is in the detail. While the government has still only released some of that money, the RACQ, the peak motoring body in my state, says that Queensland’s national highway has been so fundamentally neglected over the last decade-the decade in which this government has been in power-that the network needs at least $12 billion just to get it up to scratch, let alone to a standard that the people of Queensland can be proud of and can rely on. I am of course aware of a number of projects locally-such as the Peak Downs Highway, which connects Mackay to the mining towns of Nebo, Moranbah and Claremont-that will make a real difference to locals and commuting mining traffic. But $6 million, when the RACQ says billions more is needed from the federal government, is simply a drop in the bucket. I am also greatly concerned, as are many in Queensland, with changes to AusLink funding that mean state governments and councils will need to find billions of dollars for roads traditionally funded by the federal government. It is plain that the Howard government is shirking its responsibility to fund their roads, including the Bruce Highway, a national highway whose current state, at least in my electorate, is inadequate and downright dangerous. Moreton Electorate Member for Fadden since late 1970, moving in as a young lad back in the days when there was not even a stop sign at the corner of Mains Road and McCullough Street at Sunnybank. In fact, the biggest improvement to take place in that intersection was the Market Square Shopping Centre, which opened in 1971 or early 1972. In those days Mains Road came to a dead-end at the Mount Gravatt cemetery. The creation of the South East Freeway saw Mains Road connect and become a very busy thoroughfare for traffic from the south of my electorate and for the growing Beaudesert Shire region and Logan City. There was nothing more than a rickety old timber bridge over the railway line, which now extends to the Gold Coast. Now we have a bridge with something like 10 lanes being built over the railway line near Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic school. I used to go over that bridge riding my bike up to Runcorn Primary School each day.

213,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton) (12.42 Pm),"I have lived in the electorate that I representPardon the reminiscences. I simply want to establish a couple of clear facts about the motivation I have as the member for Moreton with respect to an area that I have lived in and been concerned about since I was a young bloke-an area which has created all that you see today. My greatest credential that I bring to this place is my love and affection for the area. The connection that I have with the people in the area means that, as they bump into me in local shopping centres, they kick me in the shins if I am doing the right thing and pat me on the back if I am doing the wrong thing-or vice versa-and that sense of ownership and partnership is very important to me. The style of representation that I have tried to bring to the parliament as the member for Moreton has very much been honed by the influences of the member for Fadden. I have known Mr Jull since 1974, when I was a young lad. He was a TV personality and he was a radio personality before that. The member for Fadden was very committed to the radio and television industry, and he put his hand up to run as the member for Bowman in the 1974 election, which took in parts of what is now the electorate of Moreton. He ran again on 13 December 1975 and was elected. I want to say that we greatly appreciate the member for Fadden’s service and commitment to the area that I now represent. He is a true man of the people in every possible way. He taught me very early on that politics is a very humbling experience. I must say I had not realised how humbling it was until all that has occurred during the course of this year. David Jull, as a member in this place for some 30 years, has gone on to be the longest serving member of the Queensland Liberal Party in history. Yes, a predecessor of mine, Josh Francis, was here for 33 years, but for really only the last few as a Liberal. He was a member of parties that led to the creation of the Liberal Party. And, yes, the late Sir James Killen was here for 28 years, and all of them as a Liberal. But David Jull has more than passed their record of service, and there is something special about this man. He has always said to make yourself available, to be seen to be available, to be out in the shopping centres talking with people, and I think that has been a practice that has stood me in good stead in the community service that I have tried to bring about. Back at Macgregor High School, when I first met him, we started a school radio station, 4MG, which ran for about 25 years. When it opened, on 24 November 1974, David Jull, the member for Fadden, was there as a Channel0 personality. In fact, he was the first face on Channel0 in Brisbane. He brought an enormous amount of radio and television experience and influenced me enormously to seek that same career. It is a bit of personal indulgence, but I am sure my electorate would accept that it is right to praise the member for Fadden in the final weeks of his time as a member in this place. It is important that he knows that people like me appreciate greatly the great sense of service he has brought and the decency that underpins it. His parents were strong Anglicans. His father was a canon in the church and his mother ran the Anglican women’s committee for many years. David Jull has made a difference. I think all in this place should hail David Francis Jull, the member for Fadden, the former member for Bowman, a very good friend, an enormous mentor. I wish him very good health in the years ahead. MAIN COMMITTEE Member for Fadden Local Government ton. David Jull has been a friend of mine for many years, and he has certainly given distinguished service, first to the electronic media, at Channel0 and at numerous stations in Brisbane, and more recently as a member of parliament and a minister. I, for one, will lament his leaving this place, but I realise he has had a pretty rugged time with his health and I hope that leaving the stress of this place will give him the opportunity to have a happy and relaxed retirement. I want to call today for a constitutional convention on local government. I do not do this lightly. Although the constitutional recognition of local government was the subject of a referendum some years ago, I think it probably did not get the attention it deserved because it was lumped in with three other issues. I think if it had been the sole issue it might have resonated better with the community. The sort of constitutional convention I envisage is the convening, in the first instance, of a national conference of local government which would discuss these issues. From that conference we would have an elected body of people to come to the convention-perhaps six people from each state government, representatives from the federal government and distinguished Australians who have been associated with local government in the past. It would be something akin to what we had with our constitutional convention before the referendum on the republic. At this constitutional convention, we should be looking at things like the parameters of local government, the authority of local government and, more importantly in the light of what has happened in Queensland in recent times, the genuine autonomy of local government. I do not know how you can have autonomous local government when councils are prevented from conducting a simple poll to get the ideas of their constituents. To me, that is an anathema to the whole idea of government and good governance. We need to look, too, at the sorts of things that are best handled by local government and the extent to which cost shifting has been moved to local government. We complain at the Commonwealth level sometimes that the states cost-shift to us. But there is a good case to say that both tiers of executive government do pass on to local government an added burden, if not in the form of capital cost then certainly in extra work. Then we need to look at a commission to look at boundaries-not to radically change boundaries but to look at anomalous boundaries so that the more modern community of interest of each particular area is reflected. If the constitutional convention were to say that there should be constitutional recognition of the financing of local government then I think those things should be the subject of a referendum, and once and for all we would take this uncertainty of the role of local government right out of the agenda. We would all know then what the relationship of the Commonwealth would be with local government; what responsibilities the states would have; which tier of government would supervise local government-be it federal or state-how it would be financed; what authorities, as I said, it would have to raise taxes and levies and rates; and, certainly and most importantly, what level of autonomy it should have and what authority it should have to prosecute the things that it needs to do. I put that in a bipartisan way to both MAIN COMMITTEE",174,Captain You Inspired Me Along With Everybody Else Especially Year 6s On What A Good Leader Is All
214,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (12.47 Pm),"I endorse the comments of the member for Moresides of this Committee. We really need, in the light of what has happened first in Victoria and New South Wales, and now in Queensland, to do something about it. (Time expired) Herbert Electorate pm)-I thought it might be instructive to let the parliament know today of my fortnight on foot. During the July break of the parliament I walked around the electorate for a fortnight. I walked right around-150 kilometres around-the electorate. The member for Hinkler should note that I am fitter for it and tougher and slimmer and whatever. It was an extraordinarily good experience and something that was very worthwhile doing. Not many members are able to walk around their electorate-they do not find the time or the electorate is too large or they stay in their office. I can say to the parliament that it was a wonderful experience for me, because you see a lot more and you meet a lot more people than you would otherwise meet by driving around the electorate. I think that stands to reason. I started up in the Upper Ross in Thuringowa, the city that is soon to disappear foreverTownsville. I started off in the Upper Ross up at the Rassmussen school. I might pay a tribute to the Rassmussen school and its teachers and students. I was with the year 6-7 class and the students were invited to ask me questions. They were not primed by their teachers as to what they should ask. Members of parliament know that you normally get asked what your salary is, what sort of car you have, or what the Prime Minister is like. This group at Rassmussen school, which is in a low-socioeconomic area, asked the most intelligent questions that I think I have ever been asked. It was most impressive and a tribute to the teachers that the students were able to ask them. I saw the local childcare centre; I visited the local shopping centre; I went to the Upper Ross Community Centre and presented some volunteer certificates there, and then I walked on to Carlyle Gardens-a retirement village which is turning itself into a green village. It is quite extraordinary. They are going to run their own sewerage system and recycle their own water. I helped at the council with some problems they were having there, and then I went on to the Salvation Army in Beck Drive and then through to the Willows Shopping Centre. The next day I was walking along Thuringowa Drive and went to some of the mortgage brokers. I said, ‘What is this thing called “mortgage stress”? Does it exist?’ They said, ‘Too right it does.’ I said, ‘Why does it exist?’ This was their explanation: in years gone by, when young people were buying a home, they would buy within their means. If that meant that they had to sit on milk crates in their lounge room until they could afford some lounge chairs, that is what they would do. These days people go to the biggest and best house and say, ‘I think we’ll have that one,’ and it might be $400,000. And, of course, they say, ‘We’ll have a new car, a new plasma television and a big sound system.’ They just borrow beyond their means and then find themselves in mortgage stress. This was the advice the mortgage brokers were giving me. That was a very sobering thing to hear as I went along. I visited the Bohlevale School, which is part of the Investing in Our Schools Program, and Bushland Beach-where the community needs a new primary school. I went down to Rose Bay for the opening of a hospice down there.

I met a lot of great people-really nice people. I was able to do a lot for the community and I was able to understand, even better, a lot of the local issues. Out of it came some great future plans. We have done a lot already, and there is a lot more to be done.

MAIN COMMITTEE Human Services: Electricity and Water (Question No. 5225) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Human Services, in writing, on 7 December 2006: (1) For each financial year since 1 July 2004, what sum has the Minister’s department spent on (a) electricity and (b) water. (2) Since1 July 2000, what measures has the department instigated to reduce electricity and water usage. the honourable member’s question: The Department (excluding the Child Support Agency and CRS Australia) (1) (a) Electricity: 2004-20051, $ 2,937.72, 2005-20062 $21,387.80, 2006-20073 $15,129.90. 1 Department created in October 2004 with a total of 54 staff at 30 June 2005. 2 Total staff at 30 June 2006 was 94. Electricity costs were direct and not covered under a gross lease arrangement. 3 Costs for approximately 140 staff located in Computer Associates House to end March 2007. Other electricity costs are covered in a gross lease arrangement with Medicare Australia for the Canberra Avenue building. (b) Water: The Department does not meet water costs directly as the building owner meets these costs. (2) In the course of lease negotiations, the Department has always sought environmentally supportable solutions in relation to water and electricity usage. These include: dual flush toilets; the reporting of all leaking taps; regular staff notices about reducing light and water usage; energy efficient lighting; after hours air conditioning requirements; and current whole-of-government contract for electricity is for 8% GreenPower (renewable energy). Child Support Agency (1) (a) Electricity: 2004-05 $391,086.84, 2005-06 $437,669.93, 2006-071 $230,186.95. (b) Water: CSA is unable to monitor the cost of water as these costs are included in total leasing costs for tenancies. (2) Since1 July 2000, CSA has undertaken the following initiatives to reduce electricity consumption: recognised electricity consumption as a major environmental aspect in CSA’ s Environmental Management System; undertaken energy audits in CSA’s sites to identify where efficiencies can be made; monitored energy usage in sites to provide benchmarking information; incorporated EEGO policy initiatives into leasing and fitout construction activities;",177,Captain You Inspired Me Along With Everybody Else Especially Year 6s On What A Good Leader Is All

(b) Water: It is not possible to accurately quantify expenditure on water usage, due to the broad variation in charging methodologies in shared tenancies and differing commercial leasing arrangements, that may or may not be inclusive of outgoings. (2) Since1 July 2000, CRS Australia has instigated the following measures to reduce electricity and water usage as new offices are fitted out or existing offices refurbished: installation of energy efficient T5 fluorescent globes in new office fitouts; replacement of the small number of incandescent globes with fluorescent globes; window blinds and solar film on western windows to reduce radiant heat transfer; and automatic timers on lights and hot water units. The following initiatives have also been implemented: identification of highest use offices for detailed energy audits; and staff awareness campaign through management communication, intranet resources and environmental champions. No specific water consumption reduction measures have been taken. Water usage is limited to personal hygiene and limited dishwashing.
