I have had correspondence with the Premier of that State! Is he able to say whether ox not additional teachers can be made available to meet very pressing needs! Mr HO0jLOiW""AY -Acting on the advice of the Prime Minister, I have had correspondence with the Premier of Tasmania and others in regard to the shortage of school teachers in all States. As the result of negotiations, Cabinet will be asked at its nest meeting to take steps for the special release of 1,000 school teachers. When they become available, they will be allocated to all States, including Tasmania, according to needs. rect that the Acting Attorney-General has received a telegram from, the secretary of tbe Balmain Municipal Labour Council, asking him to stipport the request by certain strikers for a ballot to decide the issues involved, and that his reply included an endorsement of the views expressed by these representatives of a political organization in his electorate? If so, will he arrange to have drafted a national security regulation providing that when industrial strikes are held or threatened because members of a union distrust, or lack confidence in, their officials, the Government will intervene and direct that, on the condition that work be resumed in the meantime, a compulsory ballot of members, supervised by the Arbitration Court, shall be taken? Will he also instruct the Security Service to investigate the activities of Communists, including Mr E. Thornton, in connection with this strike? from the Balmain Municipal Council a. telegram containing a number of requests, and asking particularly that an opportunity be given to theso men to hold a branch meeting in order that they may determine who shall represent them, not only as officers of the Balmain Branch of the Federated Iron workers Union, but also as delegates in the various workshops. In my reply, I endorsed the sentiments that had been expressed. There is a precedent for directing that a ballot of union members shall be taken, in the direction issued a few weeks ago by the Industrial Registrar that a ballot of the members of the Tramways Union be taken to decide -whether or not there should be a stop-work meeting. That ballot was conducted by the Industrial Registrar.

As the residents of the Australian Capital Territory have not a vote for the election of representatives to this Parliament, can the honourable gentleman state the reason for the publication of this advertisement in the Canberra Times, and the source of the funds which enable those responsible for it. to have it published?

These propaganda advertisements obviously are designed to mislead the people, and to prepare a political atmosphere that will be favorable to the Liberal party at the elections that are to be held approximately eighteen months hence.

16,Mr Dedman,"This instruction reBalaclava, and all other honourable members, are concerned about the shortage of housing and of many goods that are essential to the civilian economy. The lifting of this control at the present juncman-power, and it is of such a nature ture would lead to the dissipation of a large volume of man-power, because it would be engaged in the production of a wide range of non-essential goods and servicesat a time when the production of essential goods and services is urgently required. That is the reason for its continuance. It does not operate to the detriment of small manufacturers more than large manufacturers. man has killed all small industry. not true. I want to make it quite clear that the Government wishes to relax this control as soon as possible. I repeat that if it were removed to-morrow, the net effect would be the utilization of manpower in the production of a wide range of non-essential goods and services, to the matter. detriment of the more essential goods and services required by the community. small businesses where there has been a falling off in government orders, it is not always practicable readily to divert the labour from those industries to other purposes. Therefore, in dealing with applications for new manufactures, will the Minister issue an instruction that such industries shall be permitted to maintain the degree of activity prevailing in those enterprises at their previous turnover level ? Will the Minister inform the House whether one of the requirements of government factories is that they, too, should apply to his department when they desire to embark on new manufactures of a civilian character, as distinct from their munitions production? For example, was application made for such authority to manufacture pencil sharpeners at a munition factory in New South Wales? all about the manufacture of pencil sharpeners in New South Wales, or anywhere else. I do not need to issue any instructions to my department on the matter to which the honourable member has referred, because, in the consideration of all applications for permits for new manufactures, all of the circumstances of the individual cases are taken into consideration. If a firm has the necessary that it cannot be diverted to the production of more essential goods, then automatically the applicant receives a permit from my department. During war-time, many firms, large and small, have had their total staffs built up to a large degree, sometimes perhaps doubled, in the production of goods for war purposes. As the demand for those goods declines, obviously we do not want all that man-power in those establishments simply to remain there and continue to produce goods for war purposes -, we must divert it to other industries producing goods more essential to the civilian community. Every application is examined most carefully. If the honourable member can give to me an example of the refusal of a permit, which, in his opinion, ought to have been granted, I shall have the greatest pleasure in investigating the new manufactures by government instrumentalities, I understand that the Minister has a general supervision over new manufactures throughout the Commonwealth. Is the matter left to the Minister in charge of those instrumentalities, or does it come within the supervisory activity of the Department of Post-war Eeconstruction ? mits for new manufactures extends only to private industry. I am not aware that other government departments undertake manufactures for the civilian economy. If the honoraible member desires any information on that aspect he ought to mention specific cases. I have told him that my control extends only to private enterprise, and not to any other government department. into consideration any of the manufactures carried out by government factories as a potential factor in the absorption of labour in the period of post-war reconstruction?

A M E N D M E N T ( B Y Mr Dedman ) Pro,"Substantial sums of public money are being wasted in tbe payment of re-employment allowances, because tbe department is so dilaitory in re-establishing servicemen in civil life. I have here a letter from an ex-serviceman who says that he waited a long time before obtaining employment, and all the time he was waiting the re-employment allowance was being paid to him. He says that he went through certain "" d r ill "" , as he but was advised that he could not accept calls it, in order to be rehabilitated. Setting out to look for a job, he applied to an Air Force officer in charge of rehabilitation, and was told to fill in a form and report to man-power. At the Man Power office he filled in other forms. In return, he received a card with an instruction to present it for stamping three times a week. After a time, the first card was filled up, and he was supplied with another. The total number of stampings was well over 50. This soldier has an excellent record. He is not the sort of man who never did a decent job in the service, and would not be likely to do a decent one in civil life. He has served in both this war and in the last. His decorations are the Distinguished Conduct Medal with bar; Mons Star, with bar; mentioned in despatches three times; Russian Gross of .St. Georgie-the Czarist V,.C.; the French Croix de Guerre; the Territorial Efficiency Medal; and a medal awarded to the champion rifle shot of the Fourth Arm.y in France during the last war. He was a regimental sergeant-major in the last war, and rose to the rank of acting captain. One of his commanding officers, Lieutenant-Colonel O'Flaherty, wrote a testimonial, in which he s a i d He is a capable, intelligent and reliable man, quick at bis work and with figures. I strongly recommend him for any position of trust. In this war he enlisted in 1939 and served for 2S0 days in an infantry training battalion. He then volunteered for the Royal Australian Air Force, in which he served for four years. He was discharged from the Air Force as permanently medically unfit. His certificate of discharge bears the words ""character VG."" On the back of this document is the printed informationExemplary is the highest character whicb can be awarded in the Royal Australian A i r Force; but is only awarded to an airman with more than five years' service. For others, VG is the highest award. This serviceman says, "" I find I am a misfit as far as government rehabilitation plans are concerned"". He was offered a job in the American forces, it because the department wanted to give him another job. After a long delay, he was placed in a job as cook in a private hospital. He had to leave his home at 5.30 in the morning and start work at 6.30 a.m., and went on working right through the day, cooking all meals. Actually, he had to do the work of two men. His medical certificate said that he'Should avoid heat, yet he was sent to take a job as a cook. This is a glaring example of maladministration and waste of public funds. The man carried on in the job for five weeks, and then his health broke down. Twice during that period he reported to the department that his health would not allow him to carry on. Then, on the 16th May, the department wrote to him to this effectWith reference to your application for further unemployment sustenance, I have to advise that, after due consideration of the circumstances in which yon left the last position, your application is declined. While working as a. cook he was paid £5 a week, and it cost him 7s. a week to travel backwards and forwards to work, so that he and his wife and family were required to live on £4 13s. a week. Thie serviceman's name is Edward Dymond, A. R. and he is a resident of Queensland. I ask the Minister to look into the case, and to take steps to ensure that such things shall not happen again. I have the highest regard for the executive officers of the Repatriation Department, but this is a rehabilitation matter as well. If this is the best that the Rehabilitation Department can do, it should be closed down altogether. -Onc e again I protest against the Minister's refusal to explain to the committee the meaning and purpose of amendments.

They have no interest in it beyond getting the bill through for their own purposes. At present, there are only five Government supporters in the chamber, and two Ministers. This shows how much interest they take in a measure which was described by one Minister as the serviceman's charter. This amendment provides that, for the purposes of the bill, a person who, although not legally married, was substantially dependent for his or her support upon another person, and was recognized as the husband or wife of that person, shall be deemed to be the spouse of that person. In another clause it is provided that children under 16 years of age, including stepchildren, illegitimate children, shall be entitled to benefit under Wentworth referred to the Minister for the bill. It is no wonder that the Minister did not offer any explanation of these provisions. He is an elder of the Presbyterian Church, and no doubt he finds it difficult to approve of provisions by which the Government encourages the birth of illegitimate children. The bill makes no difference, so far as benefits are concerned, between a child born in lawful wedlock and an illegitimate child. further than that. It encourages unlawful liaisons between men and women. It says that a woman living unlawfully with a man is entitled to greater consideration than a lawful wife. You, Mr had an illegitimate child should be Chairman, with your strict church upbringing, must frown on such a provision, as must the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction. However, caucus has forced this on the Government, but honourable members oppositGj being ashamed of what they have done, run out of the chamber, leaving only five of their number behind. This .indicates the depths to which the Labour party has descended. These provisions in the bill strike at the roots of morality and right living, and for that reason the amendment should not be agreed to. No doubt, the Minister feels ashamed of the proposal, and that is why he has failed to explain it.

As has been pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies), the amendment confines the benefits of this division to one person; the de facto wife may be given, all the benefits, to the exclusion of paid to the widow of a soldier. The comthe legal wife. Such extraordinary drafting shows the slip-shod manner in which many of the clauses of this hill have been prepared, and the lack of knowledge on the part of responsible Ministers as to the meaning of various provisions. I believe that the Minister for Repatriation spoke in good faith, but he completely misconstrued the meaning of the clause. Whether he spoke impromptu, or after receiving advice, I do not know, hut without wishing to trespass in a field of which I know little, I should say that the Leader of the Opposition is a better exponent of the legal aspects ofi various clauses than is the Minister for Repatriation. A provision to protect the legal wife against the adulteress is required. The honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), speaking on the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Bill"" on the night of the lSth-19th March, 1943, saidBecause of the minimum I support tlie amendment moved by the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott). There ia a growing tendency in this .Parliament of males to derogate dangerously from the status of tlie married woman. J believe that if there were a woman member of this Parliament, u voice would have been raised which would have impressed honourable members and the public outside with the importance of the status of married women. The Minister for Repatriation saidI cannot agree to pay the pension to two women. I cannot see why the country should be I remind honourable saddled with the responsibility to provide for two widows, one de jure and the other de facto. . . . I think that this would make too wide an opening. It is enough that the country should be'required to pay £2 10s. to one woman in respect of the death .of her breadwinner. It should not be saddled witb £5 a week to be divided between two women in respect of the death of the same man. He was completely hostile, and his attitude to-day indicates that he still is. The honourable member for Cook( Mr Sheehan) made the most ingenious suggestion that, because the Army was paying dependants' allowances to certain entitled to benefit under this bill. That was the proposition made in the Repatriation Bill. The Minister said that because in his pay-book a soldier had nominated a certain woman to receive his allotment she was entitled, in the event of his death intestate, to the pension mittee very clearly expressed its opposition.

The proposal is that a woman who perhaps only two or thret-. months before a man's death has deposed in his affections the lawfully-wedded wife, who reared his family and helped him to build his home, shall be entitled to all the privileges and benefits provided by this legislation, to the exclusion of the of the members of the forces.

It would bring this legislation into line with the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. That is what the Minister for Repatriation said he was desirous of doing. I intend to move That the following new sub-clause be added:"" (H.) The provisions of sub-section (2.) hereof shall not he construed as taking any the rights of any person mentioned in subsection ( I . ) of this section. If that, were inserted, the de facto wife wotild not be given a position preferential to that of the legal wife or any of the other adult dependants mentioned in the clause. I ask the Minister to accept it. Otherwise, I will divide the committee on it, because I shall want the people to know that the Minister is so stubborn that he will not bring this legislation into line with tbe Repatriation Act and other social service legislation of this country merely because the move was made from this side. I stand the Government right, up to this. Eit.hei it accepts the amendment or admits to the people of Australia that it is extending the principle of preference contained in this measure to the extent of giving priority to the adulteress over the legal wife. point to a strange anomaly. The Government intends to extend the benefits of this bill to de facto wives and, as the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) has shown, even do facto husbands of members of the forces and, as the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) has shown, of persons who have not served in the forces. Yet, under the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, the wife of a service pensioner married after 1931 is not entitled to a pension at all. It is tragic that this bill, called ""the serviceman's charter "", should be in the hands of the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) and the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Frost). If only an all-party committee had been formed it could have evolved a measure which would have given justice and equity instead of this bill, which is a betrayal Minister for Post-war Reconstruction has been obtuse, obstinate and selfsatisfied, and has sneered or laughed at or ignored anything put forward by the Opposition. I am glad to see behind him honourable members who have risen iu their places and voiced their opinions, however mildly, in support, of our views. I refer to the honourable member for Perth( Mr Burke), who supported me on vocational training last night, and the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen), who said a word on another matter. The Minister is so impervious that he will not listen to those who know something about the matter. I ask the Minister for Repatriation whether it is not a fact that the wife of a service pensioner married after 1931 does not get a pension, even if he is a V.C. winner. it, but here we have a Government providing a pension for loose-living men and women, even including enemy aliens, regardless of whether they are member*, of the forces. One would think that we were living in a Mormon or Mohammedan community. I say in favour of the Mohammedan that he may have as many wives as he can afford to keep; but here the Government is going to keep womrn for men regardless of their marital status and yet deny a pension lo the legally married wife of a service pensioner, perhaps even decorated for bravery in the service of his country, if the marriage occurred after 1931.

It was considered that sub-clause 2, as originally drafted, was not in line with the provisions of the Repatriation Act and we wanted to bring it into line. That is why this amendment was moved. I am advised that the interpretation put on the amendment by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) is not necessarily correct. It was not the intention of the Government that under this bill persons termed de facto wives should obtain an allowance to the exclusion of the legal wives, and I propose to move a further amendment in order to make the meaning more, explicit. I am advised, however, that the clause as it stands would not be interpreted in the way in which the right honourable gentleman has interpreted it. I am glad that I drew attention to this matter because it has given rise to a discussion from which have emerged an amendment and. an admission by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) that the points I made were correct. He is not prepared, however, to accept the amendment to be moved by the honourable member ""for New England( Mr Abbott), and proposes himself to move a further amendment. That is characteristic of the Minister. Whenever we have drawn attention to defects, the Minister has capitalized on our perspicacity and moved amendments to correct them in order to try to create the impression that the Government itself had discovered them. But the Minister has not dealt with the point that this does not apply only to members of the forces. The re-employment allowance as-such will cover all people who are out of employment.

Apparently, the Opposition cannot be content any longer to lead the Government by the hand, but must take more drastic action, and make the Government stand up to its responsibilities under the measure. The Minister has not clearly explained this provision. Therefore, we ean only conic to the conclusion that it will embrace any section of the community prescribed, or any person who applies to the Rehabilitation Committee, or the Preference Committee.

On that ground then, women are entitled to the same rate of sustenance as the male receives. Housing is the third category to which [ desire to refer. A woman requires as good a roof over her head, as good a bed in which to sleep, and as eomfortable conveniences and appurtenances in t'he house, as a man does. Her requirements in that respect are not less than those of the male, and no case can be made for differentiating between them. In the Unemployment and .Sickness Benefits Act, we have already established the principle that sustenance rates for men and women 74. 3hall be the same. On reference to that legislation, honourable members will find that men and women will receive the same allowance, namely 25s. a week, when they are unemployed. As that principle has already been established, I find it quite impossible to understand why differentiation in the rate of re-employment allowance should be made in this clause. In Great Britain, this matter has been the subject of a good deal of discussion during the last three years, but finally, the decision was taken to place men and women in the same category regarding the payment of sustenance. For the various reasons which I have adduced, the committee should unhesitatingly accept the principle of the amendment. I make a further appeal to the Minister. In the course of this discussion, honourable members on this side of the chamber have submitted many amendments. I did not expect the Government to accept some of them whicli affected the principle of the bill, because I appreknow why the Minister desires to have ciate that the Government desired to maintain the principle intact; but other amendments have been submitted affecting various details of the bill, and if adopted, would definitely have improved it. Not one such amendment li:-.s the Minister accepted.. Certainly, he has given us assurances, but the committee knows that assurances do not mean anything. What really matter are the words contained in the bill. As the case which I have advanced on behalf of the honourable member for Darwin is unanswerable, I ask the Minister to give to this matter his full attention, and for once to approach the matter in a reasonable manner, and accept the amendment. support the amendment which the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan) so eloquently moved on behalf of the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons). I also ask the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) to consider the advisability of increasing the amounts of re-employment allowances proposed to be paid in clause member the support of his party in making this request? has been unanimous regarding every motion that it has submitted in this chamber. For months, the party has examined this bill with a view to improving its provisions on behalf of ex-servicemen. Night and day this party has fought the inane proposals of the Government, and all its supporters have been constantly in attendance. That cannot be said for supporters of the Government. This party knows the contents of the bill thoroughly, and to date, the Minister has shown clearly that he does not understand it. I desire to help him with this problem. The honourable member for Flinders, who explained his case so clearly, indicated that the purpose of the amendment is to provide a uniform rate of re-employment allowance for male and female members of the fighting forces. I cannot see any objection to it, and should like to this differentiation. The position is curious, because the Government has already accepted in the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Act the principle, of uniform payments. In Great Britain and other dominions to-day, sustenance allowances paid to male and female members of the fighting forces are equal. The Government's proposal has been examined",27,Employment Bill 1945

96,Mr Francis,"The Liberal partyby ex-servicemen's organizations in Australia, and so far as I am able to ascertain, they are unanimously in favour of a uniform allowance. This payment will not be in return for services rendered; the question whether the female has the ability to produce the same output as the male in a given time does not arise. The re-employment allowance will be paid for a limited period until ex-service men and women have resumed their normal civil life. I appeal to the Minister to . make the rate of re-employment allowance uniform, and reserve until a later stage any further comment on the advisability of increasing the amount. -The committee should see this clause in its proper perspective, because it presents some extraordinary features. iSub-clause 1 readsSubject to this Division, the rate of a re-employment allowance shall be(a) in the case of a man-Tw o pounds ten shillings per week; (6) in the case of a woman who is, in the opinion of the prescribed authority, capable of wholly or substantially maintaining herself by her own efforts-Tw o pounds per week; and (c) in the case of a woman who is, in the opinion of the prescribed authority, capable of partially maintaining herself by her own efforts-suc h proportion of the amount specified in the last preceding paragraph as the prescribed authority determines. That provision immediately differentiates between male and female when they are maintaining themselves during the period in which they are waiting for employment. But let us examine the anomaly. Sub-clause 2 .providesThe rate of a re-employment allowance payable under the last preceding sub-section shall be increased, or further increased, as the case may bo(a) in the case of a person with one oi more adult dependants-by One pound two shillings per week; and (b) in the case of a person with one or more dependent childreu-by Nine shillings per week in respect of each dependent child, but not exceeding in the aggregate One pound seven shillings per week in the case of a person (not being a widower or widow) with an adult dependant or Two pounds five shillings in any other case. Although the Government differentiates between the rate of re-employment allowance payable to an ex-service man and woman,. it pays a uniform rate to their dependants. In other words, the Government says: "" A dependant, male or female, of an ex-servicewoman is entitled to the same allowance as the dependant, male or female, of an ex-serviceman. But the ex-serviceman himself shall be paid a higher allowance than the exservicewoman."" That does not make -sense. In one instance, the Government differentiates between the sexes, but in the other instance, it does not. The Minister might be able to tell the committee the reason for this differentiation. I have no doubt that he will say that the reason is partly the differing rates of pay to servicemen and servicewomen respectively, and that the re-employment allowance has been determined on the basis of remuneration of male and female workers in industry. He will have a yard-stick with which to measure these rates. But the yard-stick of common sense and logic should be applied in this matter. The woman will require for her maintenance the same amount of money as will a man. She must maintain a similar standard of living. She does not eat less, and the cost of her wardrobe is more than that of a man. She does not require fewer amenities than he does. All these arguments support the contention that she requires the same treatment as does the man. Great Britain and other dominions make no differentiation between the sexes. In this clause an extraordinary anomaly has arisen, and I hope that tlie Minister will correct it.

The only reason for the differentiation in these rates is that there is a difference between wage rates paid to females in industry and those paid to males. I assure the committee that should female wage rates be raised to the level of male rates the unemployment allowances paid to females will be made equal to those paid to males. However, I shall have a further investigation made to see if any amendment can be made. matta) [12.21] -During the last couple of days the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) has cut a sorry figure in his handling of this measure, and I am sure that all honourable members will agreeI am sorry that there are only eight honourable members on the Government side-that to-day the honourable gentleman has cut a sorrier figure than ever. He has reached a record low. The Minister attempted to justify this provision in two ways: First, he argued that the object of these allowances was to prevent men and women from starving while awaiting employment. Surelyi f £2 10s. a week is necessary to prevent a man from starving, £2 a week is not sufficient to prevent a woman from starving. The MinisterI t is from those interests said also that the allowances must have some relation to wages rates payable to men and women in industry. To be logical he should also differentiate between the allowances payable to a former private, sergeant, or officer of the armed forces, because all these men received different rates of pay in the services. The Minister has made a pretence of being in favour of equal pay for the sexes. I confess that I am an unrelenting advocate of that principle; and whilst I regret that so far I have been unable to have it brought into being, if I can do anything to achieve it in the realm in which I have some influence, I shall be happy to do so. The Minister said that he could not control the Arbitration Court; but he has some control over this measure. If he believes that men and women in employment should be paid equally, surely the same principle should apply when they are out of work and are in receipt of unemployment allowances.

It is claimed for instance that a man has to prepare to undertake marital obligations; but none of these arguments, fallacious though they may he, can possibly be applied to the situation which this bill contemplates. said, the purpose of this provision is to provide sustenance, and to prevent an unemployed ex-service man or woman from starving while work is being found for him or her. I cannot understand why a lesser amount is required to prevent a woman from starving than is required to prevent a man from starving. That is not the only differentiation between men and women in this measure. Clause 73 also discriminates distinctly against women, and so does clause 75, inasmuch as it enables them to receive only a part of the unemployment allowance if it can be proved that they are receiving sustenance from any other source. No doubt many men who will benefit by this provision will also be in receipt of income from another source. Why not apply the same principle in each case? I do not suggest, howpart of the Labour party's platform. ever, that equality should be established simply by doing that; my view is that it should be reached by providing equal unemployment allowances. glad that the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan) has moved this amendment, and I support it wholeheartedly. I regret that the Minister will not accept it. There is an important principle involved in this clause, namely equal treatment for the sexe3. The honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons), on whose behalf the honourable member for Flinders. has moved this amendment, dealt with the matter fully in her second reading speech. The bill proposes, and the Minister supports, a differentiation. The clause provides that an unemployment allowance of £2 10s. a week shall be payable to an ex-serviceman while he is awaiting employment, but that an ex servicewoman shall receive only £2, or even less if the prescribed authority so decides. all. none at all. Why this differentiation? What becomes of the Labour party's declaration that it believes in equal treatment for the sexes? Provision is also made in this clause for the payment of additional allowances As the Minister truly for dependants. In view of that fact also, the prescribing of a lower unemployment allowance for females than for males cannot be justified. As the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan) pointed out this provision postulates that the cost of living ia cheapei for women than for men. It presupposes that board and lodging, and clothing for women are 20 per cent, cheaper than for men. I say definitely that these costs do not vary with the sexes. Mention has been made of humbug. I say that the utterances of the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) this morning are pure humbug. Surely the Labour Government, Labour Ministers, and Labour supporters, are not going to eat their words. How often have they declared their belief in equality of the sexes? I believe that the principle is a should know. ber deny it? Apparently the Minister and all his supporters are prepared to vote against the Labour party's platform; yet the Minister talks of humbug. No greater hypocrisy has been heard in this chamber than the statement hy the Minister that he is prepared to vote against the plank of the Labour party's platform relating to sex equality. Honourable members opposite are betraying their own party. If the Government proceeds with its proposal, it will be guilty of mere pretence and will be known in future as the "" make-believe"" Labour Government. orable memlbers opposite wiho have spoken on this clause have shown great mental agility. iSome of them have worked themselves into a frenzy about the payment of benefits to the sexes on an equal scale.

We have not yet reached the stage where equality of the sexes is generally recognized. I had the privilege and pleasure last year of attending a conference of the International Labour Offic<3 at which this and allied subjects were discussed at considerable length. We talked about equality of the sexes, equality the rates of contribution. of opportunity for the sexes, and equality of rates of pay for the sexes. Finally, it was agreed, unanimously that we should aim at equality for all without regard to sex. Whilst the principle was accepted by the whole conference, it was agreed that at the present time it could only be an objective at which to aim. Six FREDERICK STEWART -Ha, ha! member has attended International Labour Office conferences and should know something about this subject. He must know perfectly well that complete equality of the sexes has not yet been achieved. The conference which I attended was realistic enough to admit that. Honourable members opposite are not prepared to accept the Minister's pronouncement that women should not receive equal benefits with men for the period of. transition from one occupation to another. When I said that the Opposition had shown great mental agility, I had in mind the provisions of the National Health and Pensions Insurance Act, which was guided through Parliament by the parties now represented in Opposition when they held office some years ago. The bill received assent on the 5th July, 1938, hut was never put into operation. The honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) sponsored the measure with a great deal of enthusiasm. Is that right? was not completely satisfied with it. member said that it was a mighty good start. Let us consider the rates of benefit provided in that act. This will answer the arguments of honourable members opposite, who have worked themselves into a frenzy about equality of allowances for the sexes. The following rates of sickness benefit were provided:Adults and married minorsPer we»k. 8. d.

I know that women had to contribute to a fund in order to qualify for these benefits, but we are now talking about benefits only. The National Health and Pensions Insurance Act provided that the sickness benefit for unmarried minors should bo 15s. a week for males and 12s. 6d. a week for females. The disablement benefit and old-age pension rates were as follows:Per week. s. j a.

It may not please honourable members opposite, but at least I am telling the truth. Honourable members opposite have been 1 arguing on a matter of principle.

Sir under the National Health and Pensions Insurance Act were distinctly related to rates of contribution. were related to, the facts remain as I have stated. The Government of the day and its supporters decided that females should receive less than males. Of course, we have advanced considerably since that time, one reason being the change over to a Labour government. Whatever may be said on the principle of equality of the sexes, the fact is that the rates stipusupporters to pretend that women have lated in this clause are commensurate with the responsibilities and obligations of the people to whom they will apply. receive less than men. orable member was not here when the National Health and Pensions Insurance Act was passed, he supports the party which embodied in that measure differential benefits for males and females. Honourable members apposite seem to think that this Government should be able, within a very short time, to reform the world and to do things which they, when they were in office, never attempted to do. The International Labour Office Conference to which I referred earlier considered the subject of remuneration of the sexes very carefully and agreed that the world had not yet reached a stage at which complete equality of the sexes could be recognized. I agree that there ought to be equal opportunity for the sexes; we can balance up the benefits paid under this bill when equality of opportunity is finally achieved. Whatever members of the Opposition may say about this measure, they cannot honestly deny that they approved of differentiation between the sexes when they agreed to the benefits proscribed in the National Health and Pensions Insurance Act. I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Flinders( Mr application to the matter we are now Ryan), which provides for equal allowances for men and women. I listened with amusement to the arguments of the Minister and the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard). They said to ua in effect, ""Because same other Governtake advantage of the fact and will do nothing to equalize the positions of the sexes"". Surely there would be no injustice in paying to ,a woman under this provision the same rate as will -be paid to a man. In connection with the basic wage, consideration must be given to a man's imaginary wife and child but that factor does not arise on this clause. Dependants will be provided for in another part of the bill. It is sham and hypocrisy for the Minister and his no right to receive equality of treatment with men under this bill. I do not see why a woman should be penalized. Surely as much food is needed to nourish a woman as is required to nourish a man.

I have urged that, in the matter of allowances, men and women should be on an equality. I believe that they should be, and the facts that I have stated support my contention. The Minister endeavoured to bolster his charge of insincerity by saying that honourable members on this side do not believe in equal pay for the sexes.

Nevertheless, he has been discourteous, dishonest the honourable member to withdraw the -expression "" dishonest"". Minister has also been obstinate and supremely unintelligent. Up to date, this attitude has been due largely to a bad liver, and to the fact that he has been handling a matter of which he has no knowledge. The stand that he has taken to-day convinces me that this is not a temporary, but a permanent manifestation of his character. He advanced certain specious arguments in an attempt to refute those put from this side of the chamber in favour of equal treatment to males and females under this clause, and said that, because there is discrimination to-day in the wages of men and women in industrial life, it -should apply also to the allowances for sustenance. Not long ago, we passed the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Bill, which provided for equal benefits for men and women, irrespective of what wages they received in civil occupations. The benefit we are now discussing is almost identical with that; consequently, the principle of equality should be applied in this instance. In defence of the Government, the honourable member ""for Bass( Mr Barnard) referred to the National Health and Pensions Insurance Bill of 1938. That is history, and ""what was then said does not . necessarily apply now. the circumstances then were entirely -different from those of to-day. The Minister should review his decision, -and show himself in a slightly better light than that in. which he appears at the present time. particularly concerned in this matter, 'because for years I have been an ardent -advocate of equal rights for men and women. I am satisfiedthat throughout the ages the efforts to achieve that end 'by those who were similarly minded 'were nullified by big industrial exploiters for their own profit. Women have always been slaves in industry, and men were, too, many years ago. During a time of war, women are drawn into branches of industry to do work of a character which they have not previously undertaken. In the present conflict, they I ask were educated very quickly to do the work of welders, mechanics, fitters and turners, and no one can deny that they I withdraw it. The have done a magnificent job. Probably, as the Minister has said, the present proposal is merely political propaganda. The arguments advanced by honourable members opposite savour of political hypocrisy. the honourable member to withdraw the expression "" hypocrisy "". say that they are political arguments. I have yet to learn that a woman can live more cheaply than a man. If she enters a milk-bar for a glass of malted milk she must pay the same price for it as a man would have to pay. She cannot purchase a pound of steak from a butcher at a cheaper rate than that paid by a man. She receives no reduction of the charge for board and lodging because she is a woman. In recognition of the services whicli women have rendered during the war, the Minister should at least ensure that they shall not be paid a lower re-employment allowance than is paid to men. This allowance will be given only during the comparatively brief period of rehabilitation, and the Government would not lose a great deal by equalizing the payments. In any event, support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan) on behalf of the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons), because the cost of board and lodging is as great for an adult female as for an adult male. Acceptance of the amendment would not establish a precedent likely to prove embarrassing in future.

The allowance will be provided only as a subsistence payment during the period of waiting for work or re-establishment, and I cannot understand why in the name of common justice the Minister wishes to defend the clause. I consider that the cost of living of a woman is considerably more than that of a man. Her clothing at least costs more than that of a member of the opposite sex. I urge the Government to do what is obviously fair and accept the amendment. Minister seems to have no sound reason the benefits under that measure were corfor refusing to grant an equal payment rectly related to the contributions.

During the regime of the previous Government differential rates of pay for the sexes in the services was introduced, the female rate being approximately three-fifths of the male rate-and the female rate was not £2 a week, either, but varied from 28s. to 35s. a week. Every time an application for equal rates for women comes before the Women's Employment Board it is opposed by the employers' representatives, even in the case of women who have taken over men's jobs. Honourable members opposite have never been prepared to place women on the same basis as men. They have done everything possible to keep women down, and when the Labour party has tried to improve th»ir conditions, they have been met with the hostility of honourable members opposite and those whom they represent. Now honourable members opposite set themselves up as the champions of women's rights. If I could think of another word for hypocrisy, I would use it. [2.41] -The honourable member for Bourke( Mr Bryson) said that we on this side of the House have never previously advocated equal pay for the sexes, and that in advocating it now we are playing the part of hypocrites. Well, .STEWART -That is honourable members on this side of the chamber are prepared to vote for it, as will be seen when the division is taken. The honourable member for Bourke claims that the Labour party has consistently advocated improved conditions for women, but now, when the opportunity occurs, for the first time in his political life, he is not prepared to vote for an amendment which would have the effect of improvclear who is sincere. We are now supporting a principle which is embodied in the Labour platform, but the honourable member for Bourke will not support us. When he was appealing foT the support of women at the last election, he made them all sorts of promises. We made no attempt to buy their votes with promises; yet it is we who are sponsoring a proposal foT equal pay for the sexes.",35,Frederick Stewabt Benefit S Ment Did Not Grant Equality We Shall

151,Mr Bernard Corser (Wide Bay),"Prime Minister and Treasurer) ['2.43], The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) discussed this matter with me earlier in the day, and I said that he could give an undertaking to the committee that this provision would be re-examined by Cabinet and, if necessary, by the Labour party-whos e decision it is-befor e the bill is considered in the Senate. No amount of talk here this afternoon would alter that decision. Honourable members opposite have expressed great solicitude for women, but the conditions under which women had to work, as shown in evidence in the Arbitration Court, are such that no Parliament could be proud of them. either. sincerity there is in this sudden interest displayed by honourable members opposite in women's conditions. It occurs to me that it may be due to the fact that this provision affects servicewomen, and honourable members hope to obtain some support from them. I do not think that members of the services will allow themselves to be gulled by this sudden solicitude. The matter requires some investigation. It is true that women serving with the forces are paid rates which differ from those paid to men. That has been the accepted principle in the services as it has been in industry, although the present Government has improved the conditions of women who are taking the place of men in industry. I rose chiefly to repeat the assurance given by the Minister in charge of the bill that the matter will be examined further. I do not say that lightly in order to dispose Prime Minister was that Opposition of the matter now. Before the bill goes to the Senate this matter will be earnestly considered by the Government. speech of the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) would have given much more satisfaction to the committee had it contained only the first few sentences. He gave an assurance that this matter would be examined by the Government, and I take it that he meant that it would be given sympathetic consideration. But he then went on to make an entirely unnecessary reflection on the Opposition and our arbitration system. He said that the part played by political parties in connection with the fixing of rates of pay for women was something of which this country had no reason to be proud. That is not only an unnecessary interpolation in the discussion of this measure, but also a reflection on a body of men who have given much thought to the problem of rates of pay to females. I suggest to him, and to the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Bryson), that that question does not arise in connection with this clause. The courts have fixed rates of pay for women on a number of grounds; their task has not been the same as fixing a sustenance rate. The courts in setting out to fix rates of pay for women would take into account not I wonder how much only sustenance, but also the need for recreation, and other matters which are additional to the bare bones of subsistence. It is, therefore, confusing to point to what has been done in connection with wage rates in industry, and to say that that is a guide to what should be done in connection with sustenance under this measure. When the Government has decided whether or not there shall be equality between the sexes in this connection, it should place beforethe committee details of what it considers is necessary for sustenance. iSo far, we have not had from the Government any details to show on what basis the allowance was decided. The Ministersaid that if the rate were too high, it would discourage people from seeking regular employment because they would get sufficient sustenance to keep them going. A final point made by the Acting parties were trying to gull members of the services into giving to them their support. That statement was'unworthy of the generous spirit shown by him in his opening sentence. My colleagues will bear me out that this matter was raised in the party room by the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons), who saw what an unsatisfactory situation was being created for women members of the services. For any one to suggest that the honourable member for Darwin was out to gain cheap popularity among: women members of the services is to say",36,Frederick Stewabt Benefit S Ment Did Not Grant Equality We Shall

The Government should not require the breathing-space which the .Acting Prime Minister indicated was necessary. This matter has been canvassed sufficiently for the Government to say now whether or not it is prepared to accept the proposal of the Opposition. should not have risen again but for the remarks of the honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart), who referred' to the National Health and Pensions Insurance Bill, which, as a member of a previous government, he introduced, but was not sufficiently courageous to put into operation. He said that the rates prescribed by that legislation were not intended as sustenance, but were to be supplemented by grants from the States, and that, in any case, they were being paid for by contributions to a fund. I suggest that the payments which are made are being provided by the masses of the people, who contribute to the National Welfare Fund. the contribution is service; and women have given the same service as men. they have given that service on. the understanding that there would be different rates of pay, including junior rates. The National Health and PensionsI n surance Act provides for differential rates. society benefits. member for Parramatta refers to benefits provided by friendly societies. I have been a member of a friendly society for most of my life, and I have never known the benefit to be less than £1 a week for females. My point is that the amount proposed as sustenance is approximately four times the amounts provided under the National Health and Pensions Insurance Act for both males and females. It is misleading to say that that act did not provide for sustenance, and that the amount was to be supplemented by the States. The principle of differential rates was accepted in the first place, and the provision was the best that the Government could make. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) has effectively answered complaints that the proposed allowances will be inadequate by pointing out that it is not intended that they shall do mare than tide people over periods of difficulty in transition from one job to another. Officers from New Zealand in evidence before the Social Security Committee said that unemployment allowances could not be high because that would deter people from seeking work. said that months ago. it. This is stone-walling. knows it. Opposition supporters have the right to express their views without being accused, of stone-walling. I ask the honourable member to discuss the clause. seeking to us© this clause as a political stalking horse to. influence the electors. They will not be tricked. I agree with the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) that differential rates df» payment to men and women are not an innovation. They apply under the Superannuation Act and another legislation. I shall agree that differential rates should not be paid when there is absolute equality of the sexes and women receive the same wages as men. I have no apology for my support of this clause. I do not believe that it is the last word, because I believe that, if circumstances alter, it will be amended in consonance. I regard tihe clause as an excellent start. We shall see how it works. If it needs to be altered it will be altered in the light of experience. -During the second-reading debate,.

The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) has also given very careful consideration to each clause so far debated. I resent his statement that honourable members on this side are only stone-walling. At the moment, eleven Opposition members have spoken compared with eight honourable members on this side. From, that fact it should be clear as to who is responsible for any delay in the consideration, of this clause. This provision Aderinmin, C. F. is of the utmost importance. From my experience in industry I am not surprised at the sham-fight which honourable members opposite are putting up on behalf of females covered by the clause. The interests represented by honourable members opposite have always been opposed to the treatment of males and females on an equal footing in respect of wages or sustenance payments. I remind the committee that under the National Health and Pensions Insurance Bill passed by the Lyons Government, which honourable members opposite supported, notably the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart), a similar discrimination between the sexes was made in respect of pensions. Under that measure the rate of pension for a single man was 20s. a week, whilst for a. female it was only 15s. a week, and the sustenance payment was fixed at 20s. a week for a male and only 15s. a week for a female. The Acting Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) and the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) have given an assurance to the committee that the Government will review the points raised on this clause. That assurance is genuine if only for the reason that this Government was elected by a record majority and, therefore, has the interests of the masses of the people at heart. I am certain that w\hen the measure is returned from the Senate, the points raised will be covered in a manner which will be acceptable to all parties. Tbe CHAIRMAN"" -Order!

The purpose of this bill is to regulate life insurance business conducted in Australia, and to protect the interests of persons who have effected life insurance policies. Life insurance business ha9 been developed extensively and there are now about 4,500,000 policies in force in Australia. It has long been recognized that some form of public control is necessary over a business which affects such a large proportion of the people, and in fact various enactments with this object in wealth and State Parliaments. It is generally admitted, however, that the control exercised by existing legislation is not completely satisfactory, and the object of this bill is to consolidate and extend .the provisions of those acts. To explain the type of control proposed by this bill it is necessary to refer briefly five years surance business. The business was the last century, and after the failure of one or two companies had attracted public attention, a system of legislative control",40,Paihs
187,"Bill Presented By Mr Chiflbt, And",,41,Second Reading
188,Mr Chifley (Macquarie,"Actingwaa instituted in 1870. Under this system, the principles of which have been described as ""Freedom with publicity"", a company is required to lodge a relatively small deposit with the Government as security for policy-holders, but otherwise it is allowed considerable freedom in the management of its business, provided that it publishes its accounts and statistics in a standard form. The publicity given to a company's results,. and the competition between various companies has, in the past, been relied upon to ensure a minimum standard of protection for policy-holders. Life insurance in Australia is carried on mainly by local mutual companies on lines very similar to those adopted by British companies, and the British system of legislative control, i.e., "" Freedom with publicity "", was adopted by all the States, with the important exception of New South Wales, before the Commonwealth was founded in 1901. As these State enactments differed in details, though not in principle, the need for uniform life insurance legislation was foreseen when the Commonwealth Constitution was drafted, and power was taken accordingly. As a step to implement this power, a royal commission was appointed in 190S. The commission reported in 1910, and since that date there have been several attempts to draft life insurance bills, but none of them, for various reasons, was proceeded with. On two special subjects only has the Commonwealth passed life insurance legislation. In 1905 it extended to life policies the limitation imposed upon friendly societies, regarding the amount that may be paid on the death of a child. In 1932 it assumed control over the deposits previously lodged by companies with some of the States, and imposed a uniform scale of deposits for the whole of Australia. It may be mentioned that this act effecttively checked the formation of "" mushroom"" companies, many of which had previously commenced business in New South Wales, where no deposit was required. The first purpose of this bill is thus to consolidate these existing State and Commonwealth acts. It has become apparent, however, that the principles of "" Freedom with pubT74] licity"" embodied in these acts require some modification in view of modern conditions. This fact was recognized in Great Britain in 1923, when, following an inquiry into the methods of transacting industrial insurance, an Industrial In surance Commissioner was appointed, with wide powers of supervision of the companies. In the present bill it is proposed that a commissioner be appointed to supervise the administration of the proposed act, both as regards ordinary and industrial insurance. A further point is that whereas the bulk of life insurance business in Australia is transacted by companies which have acquired a world-wide reputation for their soundness, there are a few companies that are not yet so firmly established. In the case of the strong companies it is anticipated that the duties of the commissioner will be largely of a supervisory nature. In the case of those companies which are not so well established, it is anticipated that he will have to take more active steps to procure the maximum possible protection for the policy-holders. British legislation, in such circumstances, provides only that the commissioner can make application for the winding-up of the company by the court. It is thought, however, that in the case of a life insurance company, it will frequently be possible to make arrangements which are more satisfactory to the policy-owners than a complete winding-up of the company, and the bill provides the machinery whereby each case can be closely examined and, subject to directions of the High Court, the procedure most favorable to the policyholders ean be adopted. The procedure Adopted has been modelled upon an enactment of the South African legislature. It is appropriate at this stage to summarize the main objects of this bill, which have arisen from the foregoing historical discussion. These are:(a) To replace all State legislation on the subject of life insurance, and to provide a uniform basis for applying the requirements of those acts to the whole of Australia. (6) To incorporate existing Commonwealth acts with minor amendments. (e) To appoint an insurance commissioner who shall exercise active supervision of the activities of life insurance companies, with a view to securing the greatest possible protection for policyowners. (d) To set up adequate machinery for dealing with any company that fails to maintain a required minimum standard of solvency. In addition, it is proposed to provide for the establishment of a Commonwealth Government Insurance Office, if and when the establishment of such an office is thought to be in the public interest. I now propose to outline briefly some of the more important provisions of the bill. Before doing life insurance business in Australia, a company must lodge a deposit, on the same scale as is provided by the present Commonwealth act, and register with the commissioner. The commissioner may, subject to the Treasurer's approval, refuse to register any company uot already transacting life insurance business in Australia. Companies already doing life insurance business in Australia are entitled to registration on application within three months, but such registration is merely to ensure the continuity of their business, and will not imply that the commissioner is satisfied with the methods under which their business is conducted. have any doubt as to whether an existing company should be allowed to continue transacting life insurance business, the bill gives him power, after registering the company, to make an immediate investigation and then, if he thinks fit, to compel into the business of any life insurance the company either to improve its methods or to cease doing business in Australia. It has long been recognized that the funds of life insurance companies are in the nature of trust funds, and that they should, subject to any proper allocation of profits, as decided by the members of the company, be applied solely for the benefit ofi the policy-owners. This principle is enforced in the bill by the establishment of statutory funds. AU moneys received in respect of life insurance business must be carried to a statutory fund, the assets of which must be Mr Chifley. kept entirely separate ftrom all other assets of the company, and no part of a statutory fund may be applied towards any purpose other than life insurance business. Thus, if a company transacts, say, fire insurance business as well as life insurance, and suffers losses' on its fire business, the life statutory funds cannot be charged with those losses. The bill provides that accounts and balance-sheets in respect of each statutory fund shall be prepared annually in a prescribed manner . and that such accounts and balance-sheets shall be audited by competent persons. A person must, in the first instance, secure the approval of the commissioner before he undertakes the duties of auditor of a life insurance company. At least once in each five years the affairs of each company must be thoroughly investigated by an actuary. These provisions follow those set out in British legislation with one or two further safeguards. For instance, it is provided that the basis of valuation adopted by the actuary shall be not less stringent than a prescribed "" minimum basis"". This minimum basis cannot be called a severe one in present conditions, and no solvent company should have any difficulty in complying with it. For those companies whose position is not entirely satisfactory, however, the adoption of a uniform, minimum basis of valuation will Should the commissioner assist the commissioner to determine the course of action he should take. Besides being entrusted with the general administration of the proposed act, the commissioner is to be given very full powers to make confidential inquiries company. He can demandany relevant information from a company, and can, if he thinks fit, investigate any part of a company's business. In the case of such an investigation, the legitimate interests of the company are preserved by the fact that the commissioner must inform the company of the grounds on which the investigation is to be made, and of the results of an investigation. Also the investigation must be conducted in secret, and no information divulged except in pursuance of a duty under the act. As a result of his investigations, the commissioner may give such directions to the company as he thinks necessary, but, appointed in Victoriai n 1938, and the in view of the fact that such directions recommendations of that royal commismight seriously affect the business of the sion were subsequently embodied in the company, it is provided that the company legislation of that State. The present may appeal to the High Court against bill has included all the provisions of those directions. It is anticipated, howrecent Victorian legislation with minor ever, that the commissioner would noramendments, and thus extends to policymally only give directions himself on owners in all States' the benefits of matters of minor importance.

191,Debate (On Motion Hy Mr Menzies),"WAR GRATUITY BILL 1945. read a first time. Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.40] by leave I move That the bill be now read a second time. Tbis bill is designed to provide for payment of a war gratuity to mark in a special way the nation's gratitude to its men and women in the fighting forces. The gratuity provided under the terms of the bill is a free gift to members flor honourable service in the war and is to be regarded as quite distinct from the steps being taken to meet the obligations of the nation to members of the forces by means of other legislation covering repatriation, employment, preference, vocational training, land settlement and associated matters. In the course ©f my remarks introducing the budget in September last, I said;I am sure that the Government interprets the wishes of the people of Australia as a whole, as well as the members of this Parliament, when it expresses gratitude for the valor and devotion which has been displayed in all manners and ways by the members of our fighting services. It is the Government'3 conviction that the nation owes them some signal recognition outside the ordinary plans for repatriation and reinstatement in employment, which in a variety of legislative and administrative ways, will be provided for those who return from the war. Methods which the Government will consider include a straight out gratuity based on the principle of place and length of service, or alternatively, service overseas and for specified periods payment for extended leave based on the same, principle. There are, of course, various other ways in which the nation might indicate its admiration for the services they have given. I suggest it may meet the wishes of the House if this matter were referred to a parliamentary committee. After consultation with the leaders of the parties, the Prime Minister( Mr conclusion that the only practicable Curtin) subsequently announced that it had been agreed to constitute a committee to consider the question of a gratuity based on the principle of place and length of service,, or payment for extended leave based on the same principle, and/or other methods of indicating the nation's recognition ofi the services given by the fighting forces. A committee, representative of all parties, was appointed. It consisted of the following members:Mr J. B. Chifley, Treasurer (Chairman); Mr C. W. Frost, Minister for Repatriation and Minister in Charge of War Service Homes; SenatorH . B. Collett; Senator W. J. Cooper; Senator A. Finlay, Mr A. G. Cameron, M.P.; R. T. Pollard, M.P. The report of this committee was presented to the House on the 7th March last and ordered to be printed. As chairman of the committee, I wish to pay a tribute to the members who served with me in evolving the war gratuity scheme which is now embodied in the bill before the House. The objective-the recognition of the services of the fighting forces-was , of course, beyond any question of controversy or difference of opinion. Its attainment in a workable form, however, was full of complexities. The committee painstakingly devoted itself to the task of producing a scheme which, would give expression in a practical way to the nation's gratitude to those who have served the country in the fighting servioes in these years of war. I am glad to be able to record that the unanimity which was achieved by members of the committee on all recommendations was a real agreement, reached after careful consideration of difficult phases and the examination of various alternatives. I shall now outline briefly the main provisions of the bill. The measure provides for two rates of payment of gratuity. One relates to after return to Australia, and the other, the lower rate, is in recognition of service in Australia after the outbreak of war with Japan. The committee gave careful consideration to the line of demarcation for the purpose of the gratuity rates and finally reached the working rule would be one based on existing taxation legislation affecting all members of the forces, whereunder a broad distinction has been drawn between service .outside Australia and service within Australia. The rates of gratuity in both cases are flat rates without distinction as to rank and they are applicable to both men and women members of the services without any discrimination as to basis of eligibility or rate of",44,Second Reading

194,"Mr A. Mck. Mcdonald, M.p.; And Mr","payment. The overseas gratuity rate is designed to accord some recognition of the arduous and hazardous conditions which are generally associated with service overseas. It would be an impossible task to devise a scheme which would select for special recognition periods of time spent in actual battle and no attempt is made in the bill to do this. The application of one rate to all overseas service will in the aggregate provide at least as substantial recognition as a much higher rate of gratuity related only to periods of actual fighting, even if such a scheme were practicable. The rate of gratuity recommended for overseas service is £3 15s. per month. It covers the full term of service overseas, subject to a qualifying period, and 90 days after the return of the member to Australia. In the case of a member invalided back to Australia, the period in hospital and until fit to return to his unit will be additional to -the 90 day3. The minimum payment at the overseas rate to a member who has completed the qualifying period is twelve months' gratuity. gratuity, a member must have served as a member of a body, contingent or detachment of the defence force overseas for a continuous period of 90 days or for an aggregate period of 180 days in twelve months. There are adaptations of this brief description to cover the members of the Royal Australian Air Force and the Royal Australian Navy, but the qualifying periods are the same in each case. Service in New Guinea, Papua and ° Norfolk Island after the 6th December, 1941, qualifies for gratuity at the overseas rate. The gratuity for Australian service is 15s. a month. It relates to the period following the outbreak of war with Japan, the 7th December, 1941, when the general conditions of service in Australia were subject to material change, and deferred pay was extended to all members serving in Australia. There is for Australian gratuity a qualifying period of six months' service. A member with six months' service as at the 7th December, 1941, would thus be eligible for gratuity as from that date. The bill provides that the period of entitlement to gratuity shall terminate at the date of discharge of the member, or a date twelve months after the cessation of hostilities, whichever is the earlier. The committee, in its report, gave some examples of the amounts of gratuity which will accrue to members under these qualifying conditions:The payment for five years at the overseas rate is £225. For four years at the overseas rate and one year at the Australian rate-£189 . For three years at the overseas rate and two years at the Australian rate-£153 . For two years at the overseas rate and three years at the Australian rate-£117 . For one year at the overseas rate and four years at the Australian rate-£81 . In the bill, the terms ""general qualifying service "" and "" overseas qualifying service "" are used. "" General qualifying service"" covers all service which will count for gratuity purposes, irrespective of the rate of gratuity. "" Overseas qualifying service covers those periods of service for which payment at the overseas rate, namely, £3 15s. a month, will be made. To qualify for overseas The period of service for which gratuity ispayable at the Australian rate, namely, 15s. a month, is ascertained by deducting the "" overseas qualifying service"" from the total ""general qualifying service"" of the member. A number of special clauses deal with the administrative rules governing gratuity, and make provision for such matters as forfeiture during periods of absence without leave, and total disqualification where offences of a serious nature have heen committed. There are special provisions covering death cases. In all death cases overseas, and in death cases in Australia attributable to service, gratuity at the rate accruing to the member at date of notification of his death will be continued for a period terminating seven months after the date of notification of death. As the minimum payment in respect of overseas service is the sum due in respect of twelve months' overseas service, the minimum payment in overseas death cases will be for twelve months plus seven months. There are, as honourable members know, many cases in which a member of the forces remains missing for a lengthy period before death is notified. The view has been taken that in such cases the gratuity period should continue to run until death is actually notified, and for seven months thereafter. This is in line with the rules governing continuation of dependants' allowances and rates of war pension in the case of missing and deceased members. For Australian service only, the minimum payment in death cases will be for the period of qualifying service, plus seven months. Special consideration has been given to death cases overseas, and attributable death cases in Australia, in which members of the family were totally dependent on the deceased member at the date of his death. It is provided that the minimum payment in these cases should be the equivalent of three years' gratuity, calculated at the overseas gratuity rate. This provision is to cover not only death cases during service as defined for gratuity purposes, but also deaths of members eligible for gratuity which occurred between the date of their discharge, at which date their eligibility would normally cease, and a date twelve months after the cessation of hostilities. It also covers the deaths of members who had had no overseas service, and whose Australian service had not qualified them for gratuity-that is, members who died in Australia before completion of sis months' service on or after the 7th December, 1941. In these cases, if death occurs at any time between the date of commencement of continuous full-time duty and a date twelve months after the cessation of hostilities, and the death is due to war service, persons who were totally dependent on the deceased member at the date of his death will be eligible for the payment of three years' gratuity at the overseas rate. In the ""War G-ratirity Act which dealt with war gratuities for the 1914-18 war, discretion was left to the prescribed authority to determine claims, for gratuity presenting exceptional features, and the disposal of the gratuity in special circumstances. The manner in which this discretionary power was exercised proved conducive to the harmonious administration of the act, and similar provisions have been included ia the praeent bill. The estimated cost of gratuity up to the 30th June, 1945, is £63,000,000, of iir. Ohifleg. which sum £51,000,000 will be in respect of overseas service gratuity and £12,000,000 in respect of Australian service gratuity. For each additional six months the cost, so far as it can be estimated, will be £7,000,000. Members may recall that the total cost of the war gratuity in the 1914-1S war was £27,000,000. The present conflict has already lasted longer, and the numbers engaged are greater. The higher gratuity rate proposed is 2s. 6d. a day, as against Is. 6d. a day in the last war, and the rate for Australian service only is £9 per annum to members who qualify, as against a maximum of £9 in the last war. I need not remind honourable members that the economic situation in the years immediately after the war will be one in which the demand for goods in short supply will be heavy, and competition for available goods will be strong. As has been pointed out in the report of the committee, the release at this stage for immediate spending of the large sum of at least £63,000,000, involved in war gratuity, in addition to £60,000,000 or more of deferred pay which will, in any case, be paid in cash, would not be in the interest of the discharged members, or in the national interest. It is the Government's view that the comprehensive repatriation, re-establishment and associated plans will take care of the immediate needs of the members of the forces, and that. their interests will be best served by the preservation of their war gratuity for future use, except in the special classes of cases in which earlier cash payment is being provided. Profiting by the experience gained in connection with war gratuity bonds after the last war. it is considered desirable that, in the interests of the members of the forces, no bonds should be issued. It is proposed to establish a register of war gratuities in which, six months after the cessation of hostilities, members or their beneficiaries will be entitled to have their entitlement to war gratuity credited. The member's interest in the gratuity will be inalienable. His credit in the register will bear interest at the current rate for long-term Commonwealth bonds-3£ per cent -and the gratuity will be payable five years later. The gratuity and interest will be tax_free, and are not to be regarded as property or income for the purposes of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act or the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. Special provision is made for earlier cash payment in certain cases. These cases include the widow of a member, the widowed mother of an unmarried deceased member, the mother of a deceased member, if she was dependent on him prior to his death, or is in necessitous circumstances, and the blind and the totally and permanently incapacitated member. Cash may also be made available in approved, cases to provide for the cost of erection or purchase of a home for the member. The Government considers that the committee has, after exhaustive examination of the problems involved, produced an effective scheme which, within, the limits of our capacity, gives expression to the gratitude of the nation to members of the fighting forces. The Government accordingly submits the bill for the approval of the House. adjourned. WITH JUDICIARY-PETRO LANDKERO SENE : MEN TANDEMPLOYMENTBILL That the House do now adjourn.

Has the Minister's attention been drawn *<i a statement in the Melbourne Truth that Sergeant Ixrwerson, V.C., of the last war, and who had service in this war, was removed from the Caulfield Repatriation Hoapital on ANZAC Day and placed in a publie hoepital because his ailment was diagnosed as not being due to war service? 2. Is the Minister aware that in the same article it is stated that unnaturalized aliens, unable even to speak our language, are in the (same repatriation hospital and receiving full benefits, Buch as pensions and free treatment, because of their compulsory service in some Labour Corps? 3. It these statements are true, will the Minister take steps to have these aliens treated under some other regulation or act, and so save the Australian people undue distress and humiliation? In reply I desire to make the following statement:The soldier referred to in the article in the Melbourne Truth was admitted to the Repatriation General Hospital, Caulfield, for the sole purpose of diagnosis and report, in consequence of a report from Dr. C. E. Beaumont, of Myrtleford, Victoria. After numerous examinations had been carried out the condition was finally diagnosed as a malignant blood disease, and it was deemed essential by the visiting specialist incharge of the case that deep therapy treatment be given urgently. This special treatment was not obtainable at the Caulfield Repatriation Hospital and, pending availability ofi a bed in a public hospital where such treatment could be given, some X-ray therapy was carried out at the Repatriation General Hospital for diagnostic purposes. The first bed available at a suitable hospital was at the Royal Melbourne Hospital on the 25th April. 1945, and as the necessity for treatment CARE OF SERGEANT was urgent the ex-member was sent there ARBITRATION COURT : on that date. During the period when he was an 1945: investigation sustenance was payable in existence for many years at the equivalent of full pension rates. No authority existed for continuance of sustenanea after the investigation was completed. The whole of the medical reports have now been submitted to a board of independent medical specialists for an opinion as to whether there is any relationship between the soldier's disease and his war service. The Repatriation Commission has since considered the report of the specialists, but in view of the nature of the report, and also the whole of the evidence on the files, the commission has been unable to accept the case under the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Aet. I am assured by the commission that this case has received' full consideration, but I desire to make it quite clear that the department deals with each case «n its",45,Second Reading

The fact that certain persons who are enlisted for service in the defence forces are unnaturalized aliens was not overlooked by the Repatriation Commission, and the matter was taken up with the authorities concerned some time ago, but no solution of the difficulty has been arrived at.

The House will be familiar with the facts which I submitted at that time, including allegations of a bitter attack by the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr were evenly divided on the issue, and Judge Holloway) upon certain judges of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. Since then, proceedings have taken place in that court against the proprietors of two newspapers, in which statements of a substantially identical nature were published with regard to these matters. 1 do not intend to discuss the merits of these cases, but there has been a further extraordinary development, which in one sense clears up the mystery, at least in my own mind, and ofi which I think the House should be fully acquainted. I have before me the issue for Saturday, the 19th May, of Common Cause, which styles itself the official organ of the miners' federation of Australia. I note that the editor of this newspaper is Mr G. ""W. S. Grant, who is well known to members of this chamber as the general secretary of the miners' federation, and the proprietor of the newspaper is MrH . Wells, who is equally well known as the president of the miners' federation. On page 3 of the issue appears an. article headed ""Role of Arbitration-Criticism by ""Union Congress"". The article statesThe role of the Arbitration Court in tlie present period was trenchantly criticized at the conference of Federal Ministers and representatives of federal trade unions held in Melbourne last week-end. Convened by the Government at the request of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, the conference was the fourth all-Australia discussion during the war between Government and union leaders. Ministers, members of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, representatives of the metropolitan Labour councils and delegates from more than 80 federal trade unions. The federation was represented by the general president, H .

It was indicated that higher rates would be brought about by National Security Eegulations. Minister for Labour Holloway bitterly attacked Chief Judge Piper of the Arbitration Court. Ho described Judge Piper as spineless and weak-kneed. Mr Holloway revealed that the Government had got Judge Piper to practically draw up regulations to put into effect the policy of higher rates for women in "" r e f e r r e d "" industries.

200,Mr Holt,"Anyway, Mr Wells is aaware of this attempt to smash something which stands for the protection of their rights. I wonder whether the employers are aware of it-and they, too, benefit from the authority of the court. We have heard much of the need to reform the arbitration system. As a matter of fact, reforms were instituted as the result of action taken by the Government of which I was a member early in the war-actio n endorsed by honourable members who were then in opposition, but who now support the Government. A t that time, we removed many of the technical obstacles which prevented the giving of a speedy decision by the court, or which delayed access to it. Under the Industrial Peace Regulations, and by the creation of additional conciliation commissioners, we provided means for immediate access to the court if any trouble suddenly flared up. If the court is not functioning to-day to the satisfaction of the people of Australia, it is because this Government, instead of enforcing the decisions of the court, and backing up its authority, allows its decisions to be ignored. The Government has adopted a spineless attitude in the face of industrial lawlessness. Attempts have been made in the past to reform the arbitration system by substituting During the Lang regime in New Wales, ten conciliation committees appointed, I understand, by persons who had been trade officials, and lacked the proper for their responsible judicial task. ushered in one of the worse periods of industrial chaos in the history of New South Wales. vernment came into power it scrapped the committees Arbitration Court, giving the judges the status of Supreme judges.

I am in favour of conciliation in industrial affairs. I know how effectively the present court can work if backed with the authority of the Government, and if approached sincerely by persons who desire a decision which they can take back to their members; but the trouble is that not only is the Government not willin g to enforce the decisions of the Court, but also that there is a white-anting process in the Communist-controlled unions which has for its purpose the discrediting of the court and the arbitration system. That that is so is shown clearly by various references in their publications. This is a tendency which no section of this Parliament can ignore. I raise this matter to-day, not for party political purposes, but because it threatens the stability of the industrial and commercial structure of the Commonwealth. We have built up in this country a splendid code, which covers practically every industry. There is hardly any body of men and women who have not a detailed code to which they can turn to ascertain the conditions appertaining to their employment. There is ready for it conciliation tribunals. access to various tribunals.

Prior to Pool Petroleum Proprietary Limited taking over the control of motor spirit and kerosene in Australia, there were numbers of B class depots throughout the country in addition to the A -olass depots which the various companies had established. There were also smaller depots and agencies. But when that company took over the distribution of motor spirit and kerosene it closed a number of depots which had proved convenient to primary producers and other users of petroleum products. In some sections of my electorate, the primary producers protested against the closing of certain depots and asked that they be re-opened. The company replied' that because of man-power difficulties and shortages of material that could not be done. The primary producers were not satisfied, and their protests were supported by local transport committees which were set up to advise the Government transport authorities. received to their protests were not considered satisfactory, and so they approached me as their representative in the Parliament for assistance.

The reply that I reoeived from the Minister was exactly the game as #hat which Pool Petroleum Proprietary Limited had previously sent to the primary producers. When I told them of the reply of the Minister they were still not satisfied' that the circumstances justified the closing of the depots, and they then gave me facts and figures in support of their contention. I again took up the matter w it h the Minister. I believe that he did his best in the matter, but several months elapsed before he again communicated w i th me; and when he did do so, his letteT appeared to have been dictated by Pool Petroleum Proprietary Limited. The information which I submitted to the Minister must have been convincing, because the reply which I received on the 22nd December, 1944, from the secretary of the Department of Supply and Shipping, after I had discussed the matter personally w it h the The honourable Minister, contained the following paragraph :It was decided to request the Prices Commissioner to make an independent survey oi the position. This was done, and my officers have since made further inquiries through the Deputy Prices Commissioner, Adelaide, and Pool Petroleum Proprietary Limited. Up to that time the Prices Commissioner had not made a survey. I did not want a reply from Pool Petroleum Proprietary Limited; I asked for an independent investigation. On the 22nd March, I received a reply which showed that the primary producers were justified in claiming that the depots were closed regardless of the convenience or the interests of the users of petroleum products. This is the reply I received after that report had been handed to the Prices CommissionerThe reports received from the Price* Commissioner's investigating officer indicate that there is a justification for the establishment of petroleum distribution facilities at Nuriootpa and Yongala and I ha-ve therefore asked the Pool Company to provide such serThe replies which they vice. The reactions of the Pool Company to this request have not yet been received, but I expect to have them at an early date when I will send you an official memorandum. I have a copy of the report made by the independent inquiry, but I w i ll not read It it. It does not admit that a l l the depots that were closed should be re-opened. That was not sought, but there are certain depots which, in my opinion and in the opinion of the investigator, should be re-opened. I took my place in this Parliament for the first time after the last general elections nearly two years ago, and one of my first action* a* a Member of Parliament was to take up this matter. I raise it this afternoon in order to impress upon the Government the necessity to keep an eye on international cartels which have established themselves in this country. I realize that for the sake of the prosecution of the war, certain restrictions had to be imposed, but the reply made by Pool Petroleum Proprietary Limited that they could not spare the men or the material entailed in re-opening those depots did not hold water, because its trucks passed through towns, where depots had been",50,Spineless Judge
201,Mr Speaker,,52,Spineless Judge
202,Mr Smith (Wakefield) [4.20],"closed, to adjacent towns and could easily have dropped off the supplies that the people in and around those towns needed. When the petrol companies were in supposed competition, they provided conveniences for the public generally, and the primary producer in particular, hut, as soon^as they had banded themselves into a monopoly, they found a readymade excuse to curtail those conveniences in the general shortage of man-power and materials. At the same time, as my colleagues from South Australia could affirm, in some towns in South Australia, despite their claim that they had closed depots in other parts in order to conserve labour and materials-it was really to conserve profits-the y maintained as many as three depots. I suppose they did so in order to preserve their identity, and one cannot blame them. But one can blame them for unnecessarily closing depots in other places. I hope that the Government will do all it can to ensure the re-opening of those depots so that primary producers, the greatest sufferers from lack of labour and materials, shall be able to get their requirements with the least possible inconvenience. For years, the oil cartel has been a troublesome factor in the United States of America. I warn the Government' to be on the alert lest it should become similarly troublesome here. We must control these monopolies, of which the oil octopus is probably the greatest, to prevent them from getting a stranglehold, on this country. take the opportunity which the motion for the adjournment gives to refer to a matter which we had no opportunity to debate.

I have seen reports of long list of names at Australia House of most worthy British citizens who want to come here, as well' as the names of many -children who could he brought here under various schemes. Although the Government says that it wants to entourage migration, it takes no action in the matter. I shall not be unfair and say that no difficulties exist. They do, the principal difficulty being the shortage of shipping, in respect of which first priority must be given for the return of our servicemen in Great Britain, including large numbers of the Royal Australian Air Force. Nobody has brought up this matter since hostilities ceased in Europe. I do so now because the subject is of great importance to the Com. mon wealth. The prospects ' are that millions may die of starvation in Europe during the next winter. Great Britain, battered, but victorious, has been a rationed nation, its people living very sparingly during the last six years. The British people ,are likely to receive still less food because Britain has accepted the responsibility of succouring some of the liberated countries. Is the Government blind to these facts, or is it merely concerned with domestic problems? We must have regard to the long-range development of this country. We are in a hazardous position because of lack of man-power. Ex-servicemen on their return to this country from Great Britain invariably tell of British comrades who want to settle in Australia. But the -Government is doing nothing in the matter. Recently, I received a letter from >an Englishman in India who has lived in Australia. 'The colonel of his regiment made a special trip to New Delhi on his behalf and others to find out what Australia was doing to encourage British servicemen of all ranks to come to this country; but he could not obtain any information on that point at our office in New Delhi for lack of any policy. What applies to India in this respect applies also to Great Britain. Therefore, it is high time that the Government made a statement concerning its intentions. We have been told that an interdepartmental committee has been -considering the subject of migration. That committee has been in existence for some years, and by this time it should have evolved some definite plan. Australians in Great Britain who have served with the British forces have been told at Australia House to renew their inquiries in two or three years. I realize that the shipping position is acute, but, surely, we are capable of organizing things more efficiently. If we fail to do so, we shall lose many thousands of worthy migrants to Canada, New Zealand and other countries. President of the Executive Council) [4.38] -In reply to the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Smith) I point out that the situation with respect to petrol supplies in this country was very difficult when the present Government assumed office. The circumstances then existing are fairly well known, but of all the things which the Government has had to do in connection with the war, the handling of the petrol supply problem has been very satisfactory. We were obliged to establish the system to which the honourable member referred, namely, to set up a company known as Pool Petroleum Proprietary Limited, under which all grades of petrol were pooled. By that means we were enabled to conserve very substantially the man-power and material which would have been required had the petrol companies been allowed to continue to function separately. That work was done very well, but, as has been the case in many other instances during the war, it is true that inconveniences have been caused to a la.rge number of people. Controls of various kinds had to be introduced, and, in this instance, many depots from which both country and city residents obtained their supplies had to be closed. I am well aware of the difficulties' which have arisen under that system. The honourable member is justified in voicing his opinions on the subject, because, admittedly, residents in country districts were very greatly inconvenienced under that arrangement. I am sure that he will agree that I did my best to make the best arrangement possible. It was at my suggestion that the independent representative of the Prices Branch made the investigation",53,Spineless Judge

I am mindful of the power and influence throughout the world of the interests connected with oil. All of us are aware of that situation, and it is true that all governments must watch those interests very closely and prevent them from imposing their will upon the community. I appreciate the points raised by the honourable member, and I shall do everything possible to ensure that the adjustments he suggests are made. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr ""White) has a tendency to make exaggerated statements, 'fie says that large numbers of servicemen from Great Britain want to come to Australia. Surely, he knows that the war in. Europe is hardly over, and therefore these men have not yet .been demobilized. The honourable member's statement is extravagant. Mr ""WHITE -That is unfair. member expect that those men could be brought here at present when they are wanted, in their own country? I think that the honourable member knows that the United Kingdom Government is not particularly keen on sending any of its people to other countries at this stage. Mr ""WHITE -Our Australia House, Major Wheeler, has stated publicly that he has hundreds of names of persons desiring to come to Australia, but is unable to take action because the Government has no policy on the matter. people have handed in their names at Australia House for this purpose, the honourable member knows that at present it would be physically impossible to transport them to Australia. There is no doubt about that. The honourable member admitted that the shipping shortage is acute. That difficulty is real, and it is not merely a passing difficulty. dealing with circumstances as they exist at the moment, and the present shipping shortage is causing grave concern to the United Kingdom Government as well as to other Allied governments. Although the war in Europe is over, shipping is plies to liberated countries. This Government cannot overcome that difficulty. The honourable member hinted that this Government was, perhaps, more concerned with domestic matters, and, therefore, had failed to give due consideration to this problem. I remind him that for Australia the war is not over yet. me that. It is an old story. fronted with the problem of provisioning not only our own fighting service* but also British naval personnel and American personnel in this country; and that problem impinges very severely upon the economic life of this country. Royal Navy want to settle here on their discharge."" they want to settle here does not release them from their obligations with the services to which they are attached. There is another point to be considered. I do not desire to discuss migration policy until I am satisfied that migrants, on their arrival here, will have opportunities and jobs. Apparently, the honourable member is not concerned with that aspect. His view is representative at that an official should go to another country, collect as many people as possible, bring them to Australia and then forget about them. That is not my view of how migration should be conducted. Before men and women come to this country, a plan should be evolved so that when they walk down the gangway on to the wharf, they will know where they are to go and that opportunities are awaiting them here. honourable member does not realize that Australia is still engaged in the war with -Japan. Migration is not to be treated as some people would treat a football. The problem is very serious not only to Australia but also to the people who are likely to settle here. The Government does not propose to rush blindly into this matter. It is doing its best to evolve plans for bringing migrants here, but until it is satisfied that the necessary preparations have been made to",54,Spineless Judge

Four years ago, the Japanese were attempting to invade Australia, and the Prime Minister( Mr Cnrtin) required, as the basis for our defence wheme, a complete war effort. To achieve that objective, he had to obtain unity among the Australian people. Therefore, he conceived the idea of inviting the leaders of the trade union movement to meet him in conference. As the result of the success of that conference, the Government has been urged to meet the leaders of the trade union moverecent meeting was convened on that basis, and was called by the Department of Labour and National Service, at the wish of the Prime Minister. The conference was not the conception of the trade union movement. Every one will agree that the results accruing from these meetings make them worthwhile. I have been charged with having made certain statements at the last conference. It was alleged that I , individually, and in conjunction with other Ministers, 'had called a conference of judges at which we told them what to do.

Sydney Mprning Herald obtained a report of the meeting from certain delegates and published the facts as it had received them. Morning Herald stated publicly that it despatched a special representative from Sydney to Melbourne for the purpose of attending the convention; that he was not admitted to the proceedings because the press was excluded; and that the newspaper got from three separate delegates the information which it published. Who those delegates were, I have not the slightest idea. They might be the men to whom the honourable member referred. that this Government desires to abolish the Arbitration Court is incorrect. No organizations in Australia have stood so firmly for arbitration as the Australian Labour party and the Commonwealth Labour Government. do so. shifted their ground. As proof of that statement, I point out that I became a member of this Parliament as the result of the attempt by an anti-Labour government, led by Mr S. M . Bruce, to destroy the arbitration system. The sole issue at the election in 1929 was whether the Commonwealth should continue the arbitration system or scrap it. correct. The issue was whether arbitration should be a Commonwealth or State responsibility. issue, I was returned to this Parliament fifteen years ago. The honourable member for Fawkner might claim that the position has altered considerably since 1929. Let us examine the present circumstances. The honourable member knows a good deal about arbitration procedure and industrial statistics. I do not underestimate that. But I claim that never in the history of arbitration in Australia were so many men registered in the Commonwealth Arbitration Court as there are to-day. 1,250,000 trade unionists in Australia, and. of that number 1,020,000, through their organizations, are registered with the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, That proves that the trade union movement is still nearly 100 per cent, in favour of the arbitration system. That docs not mean that we are satisfied with the court. Nothing is perfect. The court will have to be made more efficient. Governments formed by all political parties have altered the Arbitration Court legislation, by adding to it, and eliminating its undesirable features. An endeavour has been made also to provide more conciliation. These things have been going on ever since I have been a member of this House. I remember going to the former Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Menzies) when he was Attorney General, and asking him to experiment more with conciliation by .appointing more conciliation commissioners. I pointed out that although conciliation was the basis of the first part of the act, it had been used very seldom in recent years. He agreed, and made the first appointment of a conciliation commissioner. The Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act should be recast in many respects.

We do not wish to drive people away from the court. . If honourable membersopposite and the judges themselves are sincere iii what they say, they can make the act more attractive, and so encourage industries to retain their affiliation with the Arbitration Court. One of the most recent pieces of legislation introduced by the Labour Government of New South Wales provides for fourteen days' annual leave for all employees in that State. That is a common-sense provision. Australian representatives at Geneva ten years ago voted in favour of such an improvement of industrial conditions. Honourable members opposite are always protesting that they believe in granting greater leisure to the workers. It is by incidents such as this that the Arbitration Court will be undermined. We must meet changed circumstances with new and better 1 methods. The action of the New South Wales Government in granting fourteen days' annual leave to all employees in that State has created a great anomaly throughout the rest of the Commonwealth. It is to be hoped that the example of New South Wales will be followed now in other States. There are more people working under federal awards in New South Wales than under -States awards, but..workers who are governed by federal awards are debarred [75] from sharing in this new annual leave provision enjoyed by their colleagues who work under State awards.

The anomalous position existing to-day can serve only to create turmoil and discontent. Under existing conditions, two men may be working in the same factory, one under a State award obtaining fourteen days' annual leave, and the other under a federal award, obtaining only seven days' annual leave. These men may even be living next door to one another, or in the same street. We have' always boasted that this country has been in the .yan of social progress throughout the world, and it is up to the Commonwealth Government to set the example. If one State is able to improve the working conditions of employees by granting, fourteen days' annual leave, and other benefits, surely the Commonwealth Government can do the, same all over Australia. Advances such as this will make the Arbitration Court more attractive and build up the goodwill of the people towards it . We do not want any organization to leave the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. Rather do we want new organizations to be attracted to it, so that there may be a common rule in regard to wages, annual leave, holidays, overtime, &c.

[5.2] -The Minister has just stated that he would not be in this Parliament but for the fact that the Bruce-Page Government intended to scrap the arbitration system in this country. The Minister knows that to be incorrect. It is true that that was the election cry on which the Minister was returned to this Parliament, but the answer to that cry was given at the next elections, when MrI received the following telegram :Bruce regained Flinders. believed the allegation of the Labour party that the Bruce-Page Government was attempting to scrap the Federal Arbitration Court, but three years later they showed that they had learned the truth. The facts of the case are these: Mr Bruce, as Prime Minister, endeavoured to unify the Commonwealth and State Arbitration systems. Eventually, he informed the States that, if they did not agree to his proposals to vacate the field of arbitration, the Commonwealth Government would do all it could by vacating the federal arbitration field. The States refused to make possible a uniform arbitration system, and it was on the proposal that the Commonwealth should vacate the arbitration field that the Bruce-Page Government went to the country. The Minister has, just stated that it plainly worded communication which was unjust that a man who was covered states that this agent has D.D.T. in by a Commonwealth award should have stock and can supply the Government's to work alongside a colleague who worked requirements whereas the Minister for under a State award, the conditions of Post-war Reconstruction informed me which were much more favorable. It that supplies were not available. was to correct that very anomaly that Mr Bruce endeavoured to bring about an all-Australian Arbitration system. Having been refused the co-operation of the States in that matter, he decided that the next best thing was for the Commonwealth to vacate the arbitration field. That was all that he proposed. When the electors of this country found out some years later that the Labour party's allegations were unfounded, they rectified their error in the electorate of Flinders at least by returning Mr Bruce to Parliament. It is noticeable that the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) did not again contest Flinders. Yesterday, the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) asked the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) to release a supply of D.D.T. which is urgently required to deal with insect pests throughout Australia and particularly in Queensland. The Minister said that there was not sufficient available to enable him to release a supply.

282,Mr Chifley,"The answers to theincome. It ia accordingly the practice of tlie department responsible for payment of the allowances to deduct therefrom the appropriate tax instalments. In the event, however, _ of a trainee objecting to such a deduction being made from his allowances, the deduction of instalments in the case of the particular trainee concerned is thereupon discontinued. 2. I am not aware of the cose of any exservicewoman trainee, in which a tax instalment deduction of Gd. is made from an allowance of £2 per week. The Income Tax Assessment Act provides tliat tax instalment deductions shall be made only where the salary or wages exceed £2 per week. If the honourable member is prepared to furnish me with particulars of the cases he has in mind, I shall ask the Commissioner of Taxation to inquire into these cases and make any adjustments which may be necessary.

In reply I refer the honourable member to the answer which I furnished yesterday to a similar question asked by the honourable member for Martin( Mr defeated. Daly). In the course of that reply I stated that provision already exists in the National Security (Patriotic Funds) Regulations for the appropriate winding up of patriotic funds and for the utilization of the assets so acquired for the benefit of members of the forces and their dependants. Regulation 12 of those regulations readsI f , at any time, it appears to the commisfication of the quantities requested. sion (Repatriation Commission) that it is desirable to wind up the affairs of any fund, the commission may, by order published in the Gactttc, -direct that the affairs of the fund be wound up, and that any moneys remaining -nexpended in the, fund shall be"" pa id by the person in whose hands they are to the aommission or a Patriotic Funds Board, and shall be disposed of by the commission or board in such manner ""as he directs for the benefit of persons who have served as members of the defence force during the present war or the dependants of deceased members of the defence force who served during the present war. LEND-LEASE AGREEMENT. the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Conelan) asked a question regarding a press report that lendlease by the United States of America to Great Britain and other countries was to be reduced, and sought information concerning Australia's position. I have conferred with the Minister for Trade and Customs on the points raised by the honourable member and am now able to give the following further information:The question of lend-lease iu stage two (i.e., the period between the defeat of Germany and the defeat of Japan) was one of the principal matters discussed by the Minister for Trade and Customs during his visit to Washington at the end of last year. The outcome of tlie discussions was that the United States administration agreed to continue to supply under leiid-lease the essential war supplies required by Australia from the United States and, on its part, the Australian Government undertook to continue reciprocal aid to the United States forces. Estimates of Australia's requirements under lend-lease for the first twelve months of stage two were presented to the United States authorities and a supporting case was personally presented by the Minister for Trade and Customs. The case was based on the fact that the Australian effort is related primarily to the Japanese war and w ill be maintained on a f u l l scale until Japan is The Australian programme of requirements was accepted by the United States authorities subject to availability of supplies and the appropriation of the necessary funds by the United States Congress. For practical purposes the calendar year 1945 has been adopted as representing the first year of stage two and requisitioning of the programme items has continued in the usual way. Each requisition is supported with detailed information showing the purposes for which the goods are required and a justiThe United States authorities reserve the right to reject any requisition in whole or in part if the demand cannot be f u l ly met or if the use to which the goods are to be put is not considered eligible for lend-lease supply. There has not been any general decision by the American authorities to curtail lendlease aid to Australia and the arrangements made by the Minister for Trade and Customs remain operative. The United States Lend-lease Act was recently extended to the 30th June, 1940, and since he assumed office, President Truman has reaffirmed the policy of the Roosevelt administration to continue lend-lease until Japan is defeated. 16th May The end of the war against Germany w ill obviously mean a substantial reduction in lend-lease shipments to Europe and this development was presumably the basis of the press report referred to by the honoraible member.",60,Liability To Tax

Isi t a fact that the Government is granting concessions to certain enemy aliens by way of free naturalization? 5. If so, is there any justification for such concessions, and wil l lie consider making the naturalization laws apply to all enemy aliens? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Man-power authorities in Victoria issued a statement in which they expressed the hope that employers of prisoners of war would rqtain such prisoners in employment, as this would be in the interests of food production and because it was most unlikely that alternative labour could be provided. 2. The Government is not in possession of any information which might suggest that among returned-soldier or other citizen organizations there is widespread indignation concerning alleged highly favorable .treatment being meted out to prisoners of war. 3. It is the intention of the Government that, in accordance with international convention, all prisoners of war detained in Australia will be repatriated to their own countries after the conclusion of peace. 4 and 5. Provision has recently been made by regulation under the Nationality Act that no fee would be payable for the grant of a naturalization certificate to the widow of an alien who was formerly a member of a labour corps with a good record of service. The standard fee for the grant of a naturalization certificate is £5, but ""in 1935 the Naturalization Regulations were amended to provide that no fee would be payable by aliens who served in the last war. In 1942, this privilege was extended to aliens who are serving or have served in the armed forces (other than as members of a labour corps). A t the present time, consideration is being given to the granting of free naturalization certificates to members of employment companies serving in the present war. Many of these enlisted aliens have been wearing the King's uniform for .two vears and have served their adopted country diligently. With regard to the general position concerning the naturalization of aliens, the position is as follows:Acting who are permanently domiciled in Australia and who can comply with all the requirements of the Nationality Act, such as five years' residence in British territory, adequate knowledge of English, intention to remain here permanently and satisfactory record. Before any application for a certificate of naturalization is granted, exhaustive inquiries are made to ensure not only that the applicant can comply with the prescribed requirements, hut also that there is no ground whatever for suspecting disloyalty on his part. If in any instance, the Security Service has any reason for offering a security objection to the grant of an application, the application would be refused. ""SHEEPSKINS FOR RUSSIA"" APPEAL.

WAU Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Harrison), and other honourable members have asked questions in regard to the award of campaign stars, a statement on which I made to the House on the 18th May, 1945. The reservations, which I said on the Sth May had been made by the Oommonwealth Government to its acceptance of the scheme announced by His Majesty the King for the institution of campaign stars and a defence medal will, if accepted, ensure that all members of the defence forces who have served outside Australia shall receive recognition under the scheme. Those whose service has been confined to the mainland of Australia will not, in general, be eligible for a campaign star or the defence medal. However, aircrew personnel operating from Australia, who have fulfilled the qualification of two months' operational service, are eligible for the 1.939-45 Star, the Pacific Star and also the Defence Medal under its conditions of issue, and one of the Government's reservations is The following is a directed to ensuring that all members of the forces which served in Darwin when that area was subject to aerial attack will receive the Defence Medal. WhatI Receipts. Expenditure. have just said, taken in conjunction with ' . d. £ a. d. my statement in the House on the 18th 105,386 7 2 May, covers in general terms all the 8,080 0 7 questions which have been asked about the eligibility of members of the Australian forces for campaign stars and 152,254 15 3 the Defence Medal. However, as 4,142 11 4 inquiry has heen made in relation to a t05,'->80 7 2 number of particular aspects, I shall deal specifically with the most important of them. Malaya -Malay a is an operational area for the .purpose of the 1939-45 Star, and participation in the operations there between the Sth December, 1941, and the 15th February, 1942, is of itself a qualification for the star. Members of the &th Division who served in Malaya are therefore entitled to the 1939-45 Star. Under the United Kingdom scheme, as it stands, personnel who served in Malaya will be eligible for the Pacific Star only if they have completed two months' operational service. The Government is not in agreement with this condition, and if its reservations are accepted, all who served in Malaya will also receive the Pacific Star. South-West Pacific StarI n the operations in the South-West Pacific Area, including the campaigns in Papua,",62,Prisoners Of Warandaliens Naturalization Is Granted Only To Aliens
291,Mr Chifley,"The Leader of theNew Guinea, New Britain, and the Solomons, as well as the present operations in Borneo, the qualification for both the 1939-45 Star and the Pacific Star under ihe present scheme is six months', or in the case of air crow two months', operational service. In the case of the 1939-45 Star, there is an exception to this general requirement of six months' or two months' service. This applies only to certain specified operations which took place in the earlier stages of the Pacific war. The list is not yet complete, but it covers, amongst other operaaccepted, it will not be necessary for any tions, the Japanese invasion of Timor, Ambon, Java, Eabaul and the Solomon Islands. Participation in these operalions is of itself a qualification for the 1939-45 Star, and six months' service for Army personnel is not required This exception does not apply, however, to the Baeiific Star, eligibility for which depends upon tbe completion oU six months' service. reservations are directed to obtaining the Pacific Star for all who served in the Pacific theatre, independently of length of service. Similarly it .also desires that additional provision should, be made for discretionary power which will admit of the award of the 1939-45 Star for operational service of less than, six months' duraition to cover, for example, phases of the New Guinea campaigns such as Kokoda, Buna, Milne Bay, Wau, Salamaua, Lae, Finschhafen, and Ramn Valley. The United Kingdom, Palestine and Sinai -In regard to the United Kingdom, Palestine and Sinai, the Commonwealth's reservation is directed to the inclusion of these countries as operational areas, so far as Australian forces are concerned, for the 1939-45 Star. Under the United Kingdom proposals, service on land of one year's duration in these areas would entitle Australian personnel to the Defence Medal only. This is not regarded by the Government as a satisfactory alternative to its proposal. Its view is that the service of Australian ""Army and A i r Force personnel, including ground staffs, in these countries should iff rppognizpd by the grant of the 1939-45 Star in addition to the Defence Medal. Casualties Operational service brought to an end by death, wounds or any other disability due to service is a qualification for the 1939-45 Star and the Pacific Star independently of the period of service. Prisoners of War -Tim e spent as a prisoner of war in consequence of capture in operations counts towards the qualifying period for the 1939-45 Star, but not towards any period of operational service which must ibe completed before the grant of the Pacific Star. If the Commonwealth's reservations are period of service to be completed before the 'grant of the Pacific Star and mem of the 8th Division, who are now prisoners of war, would be entitled to both the 1939-45 Star and the Pacific Star. Issue of Ribbons -The issue of the ribbons of the 1939-45 Star to members of the Australian Military Forces who served in the Pacific and Malaya was Tbe Government's deferred pending the outcome of the negotiations with the United Kingdom Government for the institution of a .Pacific Star. These negotiations were initiated with the United Kingdom Government in July, 1943. During the Prime Minister's visit to London in May, 1944, they were discussed with the United. Kingdom authorities, and, following these discussions, the proposal for a Pacific Star was accepted in principle by the United Kingdom authorities. Detailed conditions were subsequently formulated by the Australian service authorities ' and communicated to the United Kingdom. Government. Definite advice of the proposals for the institution of new campaign stars, including, a Pacific Star, was not received by the Commonwealth Government until February, 1945. Prior to the institution of the present scheme, the only recognition for service in the Pacific was the 1939-45 Star. Because of the great historical significance to Australia of the campaigns in Papua and New Guinea and because the result of these campaigns was to prevent the direct invasion of the Australian mainland, the Government did not consider that the 1939-43 Star was in itself appropriate recognition of the service of Australian Army personnel in these vital campaigns. It considered that a Pacific Star would alone' meet the case and in view of the negotiations wbich I have outlined, the issue of the ribbon of the 1939-43 Star to personnel of Australian Military Forces was held in abeyance by the Commander-in-Chief Australian Military Forces. Now that a Pacific Star has been instituted, those who are entitled to the 1939-45 Star under the conditions alreadypromulgated, will receive it without waiting for a decision upon the reservations which the Government has made to its general acceptance of the new scheme. United States Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal -Inquiry was made by the Leader of the Opposition in . regard to the issue of awards by General MacArthur to Australian war correspondents. I assume that he referred to the United States Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, -which was awarded by command of General MacArthur to a number of war correspondents, including 33 Australians, for long and meritorious service in the South-West Pacific Area with the forces of his command. The interchange of Allied campaign medals was raised with the United Kingdom authorities some time ago in relation to the question of the award of the United States Asiatic-Pacific Medal to members of the Australian forces. I quote the following summary of the reply which was received:While honours, decorations and medals granted as individual awardB may be exchanged, campaign medals, generally speaking, are issued to all members of the forces engaged. Moreover, such medals could not be accepted from all allies. The exchanges would thus run into millions. It ia felt that it would be impossible to make individual exceptions without compromising the whole practice. I understand that the policy and practice of the whole of the British Oonwnonwealth of Nations is not to interchange campaign medals and ribbons with Allied forces, and pursuant to this policy it was not.possible to give .permission to Australian war correspondents to accept this award. The honourable .member for Griffith( Mr Conelan) asked when the ribbons for the new Pacific Star would be issued to men entitled to wear them. The White Paper issued by the United Kingdom Government on the 8th May, 1945, stated, "" the ribbons which have been decided by His Majesty are being made now on the highest priority and will be issued as soon as supplies are ready "".",63,Service Awards Six Months Or In The Case Of Air Crew
