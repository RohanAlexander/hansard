(d) AMSA has not appointed staff under a graduate entry programme over the last six years. (3) (a) DoTRS has advertised positions for its Graduate Administrative Programme in April/May each year for the last six years. The target of the Department’s graduate recruitment programme has been tertiary graduates. The aim of the programme has been to attract high performing graduates, from a range of disciplines, to the Department. For the years 1996-2000,",122,Adjournment Cup And It Has Been A Complete Competi
230,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:the Department’s graduate recruitment programme was marketed nationally through Recruitment Services Australia. In 2000 and 2001, the Department independently advertised graduate positions in all major national and regional newspapers and indigenous publications. (b) (i) Campaigns for recruiting Air Traffic Control Trainees within AA have been conducted continuously since 1995. The aim of the recruitment campaigns has been to attract individuals to train as Air Traffic Controllers under the new Australian Advanced Air Traffic System (TAAATS). (ii) Two recruitment campaigns have also been conducted by AA, with the aim of supplying base level clerical support, and providing individuals with the opportunity to develop specific skills. (c) Due to the points raised in questions 1 and 2, CASA has not undertaken any targeted recruitment campaigns. (d) AMSA has not conducted any targeted recruitment campaigns. (4) (a) In 2000, DoTRS engaged an external provider to undertake graduate recruitment for this year’s programme at a cost of $84,536. Previously, graduates were recruited through Recruitment Services Australia. (b) (i) AA conducted the two recruitment campaigns identified at (3) above through the Government’s Skillshare Programme and the cost was nil. (ii) AA manages internally its recruitment campaigns for Air Traffic Services staff. From time to time during those campaigns, and dependent upon requirements, Airservices may engage the services of external contractors to provide assistance with some of the selection and assessment phases, eg initial review of applications, conduct of assessment centres, assisting with interview of candidates, etc. To ascertain the costs of each of those instances would require the examination of all file records and individual invoice records related to each ATS recruitment campaign since 1995, the majority of which are archived. However, figures readily to hand for the past financial year, indicate that for the Air Traffic Controller Ab Initio Recruitment Campaign conducted during the year 2000, Airservices did contract the services of a recruitment agency to assist in the initial assessment phases, at a cost of $13,967. (c) CASA has not engaged an external recruitment agency to employ apprentices, trainees or new graduates over the last six years. (d) AMSA has not engaged an external recruitment agency to employ apprentices, trainees or new graduates over the last six years. Aged Care: Prospect Electorate (Question No. 2571) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Aged Care, upon notice, on 22 May 2001: (1) Following her announcement on 3 April 2001 that the Government will fund a total of 9541 new aged care places worth a reported $182 million, how many of these places will be located within the electoral division of Prospect. (2) How many of these will be Residential (a) High Level Care, (b) Low Level Care and (c) Community Care Places. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-The answer to the honourable member’s question, in accordance with advice provided to me, is as follows: (1) Allocations of aged care places are made to Aged Care Planning Regions, not electorates. The electoral division of Prospect is partly in the South West Sydney Aged Care Planning Region and partly in the Western Sydney Aged Care Planning Region. (2) Ninety new low care places and 45 Community Aged Care Packages have been targeted for the South West Sydney Aged Care Planning Region and 80 low care places and 45 Community Aged Care Packages for the Western Sydney Aged Care Planning Region. In addition to the places targeted at these two regions, the following places are targeted to the whole of New South Wales: 80 low care places for people from nonEnglish speaking backgrounds; 160 Community Aged Care Packages for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities; and 30 Community Aged Care Packages for people from nonEnglish speaking backgrounds. Homes within either of these regions may apply for Statewide places. Australian Public Service: Superannuation (Question No. 2679) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Finance and Administration, upon notice, on 7 June 2001: (1) Further to his reply to my question No.2380 (Hansard, 2 April 2001, page 22432), how safe are the contributions made by the contributors to the Commonwealth Superannuation (CSS) and Public Sector Superannuation Schemes trust funds. (2) Was all of the 15.1% interest gained by the CSS, as reported in its 1999-2000 annual report, reinvested in the CSS Scheme; if not, why not. The management and investment of the personal contributions of members of the CSS and the PSS is the responsibility of the CSS Board and the PSS Board respectively. The Chief Executive Officer of the Boards has supplied the following information in relation to the matters raised: (1) The CSS and PSS Funds are invested in accordance with the requirements of the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Act 1990, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and all relevant general law. The members of the CSS and PSS Boards are appointed under the Superannuation Act 1976 and the Superannuation Act 1990. The Boards and the Funds are subject to all of the accountability and reporting obligations that are common to Commonwealth entities such as reporting to the Minister and the Parliament, and audit by the Auditor-General. In addition, the Boards and the Funds are subject to prudential supervision by APRA. The CSS and PSS were the subject of an audit by APRA in late 2000. One key legislative obligation placed on the CSS and PSS Boards is to develop and implement appropriate investment policies and strategies of the Funds. The Funds are invested by professional investment managers using investment mandates that are in accordance with these policies and strategies. Information on these matters is in the Annual Reports of the Boards. Additional information is available on the Boards’ websites. (2) All of the earnings of the CSS and PSS are reinvested in the Funds. Employment: New Apprenticeships Centres (Question No. 2741) Ms Gillard asked the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 21 June 2001: (1) Has his Department implemented a new computer system for the administration of the National Apprenticeship Centres incentives program; if so, what difficulties have been identified by users of that new system. (2) Were staff using the new computer system adequately trained before implementation of the system. (3) What resources were provided to Apprenticeship Centres to assist in staff training. (4) What is the current expected turn around time for delivery of incentives to employers once an application is lodged. (5) Has the turnaround time for processing incentive payments to employers increased since the introduction of the new administrative system; if so, by how much. (6) Are some employers being told that they will endure a 5 to 6 month payment processing delay. (7) What is his Department doing to improve the computer system and efficiency in getting money to employers taking up the government scheme. (8) When will the mandated turnaround times for the provision of incentive monies to employers be met.",124,Questions On Notice
231,Mr Fahey,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) The Training and Youth Internet Management System (TYIMS) was introduced nationally by the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs (DETYA) on 17 April 2001. A number of New Apprenticeships Centres experienced initial teething problems related to factors outside mentation, have sufficient bandwidth to operate the system effectively; some did not adjust their browser settings as instructed; and some had local network configurations that prevented the system from operating at full speed. These issues were rectified quickly through site visits and other support. A recent round of consultations with New Apprenticeships Centres indicated they are, in the great majority of cases, satisfied with the operation and performance of the system. (2) Staff from each New Apprenticeships Centre as well as DETYA staff were comprehensively trained in navigation and functionality of the system before its implementation. Feedback from all the training sessions has been highly positive. (3) Each New Apprenticeships Centre was provided with training manuals, on line help, a National Help Desk 1300 number and a free play training environment. Feedback from New Apprenticeships Centres indicated that the new system is much more user friendly than the previous system. (4) TYIMS specifications guarantee a 5 working day turnaround time for payments, with most payments received within 3 days. This is an improvement over the previous system of several days on average. (5) No, they have been reduced. (6) No. (7) DETYA will seek further opportunities to enhance the system as opportunities arise and fresh needs develop in the future. (8) There are no mandated turnaround times for New Apprenticeship Incentives payments. TYIMS specifications guarantee a 5-day turnaround time for payments, with most payments received within three days. Electricity: Prices (Question No. 2787) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 28 June 2001: (1) Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to an ABC 7.30 Report broadcast on 25 June 2001 titled “State meeting to address increasing electricity prices”. (2) Is the Minister aware of problems associated with the supply of electricity caused principally by air-conditioners in Victoria and South Australia. (3) Has the Minister been made aware of the demand for electricity peaks during summertime daylight hours as a result of air-conditioning loads. (4) Is the Minister able to say whether solar-powered electricity generators in California are now being used to help meet peak electricity summer loads in that state. (5) Did the 7.30 Report state that the electricity generating peak capacity will have to be increased by 50% over the next decade, or by between 4000 and 7000 megawatts of new generating capacity to meet this growing demand in Victoria and South Australia. (6) What would be the increase in carbon dioxide emissions in percentage and absolute terms if the 50% increase in demand over the next decade in electricity in South Australia and Victoria were sourced from fossil fuel. (7) What would the cost be of new fossil fuel power stations to meet this demand. (8) What would be the cost if this demand were met from solar-powered, wind-powered and hydropowered generators. (9) What steps will the Minister take to ensure that this additional 50% generating capacity to meet the demands of South Australia and Victoria’s electricity needs will be taken up by alternative energy generators such as solar, wind and hydro power. (10) Will the Minister examine the California solar power station experience; if not, why not.",126,Questions On Notice
232,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:swer to the honourable member’s question: (1) I am aware of the report featured on the ABC’s 7.30 Report of 25 June 2001 regarding the first meeting of the National Electricity Market Minister’s Forum and issues relating to peak demand in the electricity market. (2) The Commonwealth has no jurisdiction over the generation of electricity in the States and Territories. The Commonwealth understands that the relevant State and Territory authorities are acutely aware of these matters and are addressing the issue of increasing power demand both through providing additional power facilities, improved interconnections between States and demand side management. There are currently proposals for over 1,000 megawatts (MW) of new generation in Victoria and over 600 MW in South Australia, which includes around 270 MW of wind generation across both States. In addition, a new interconnector between South Australia and Victoria is currently under construction and proposals for Basslink and reinforcement of the Snowy interconnector are well advanced. The Commonwealth, State and Territory governments have adopted a number of demand side policies to encourage reduced electricity consumption. (3) There are difficulties associated with electricity peaks during summertime daylight hours and the governments of Australia are addressing this. To attract sufficient investment to meet Australia’s long term supply needs, to be fully efficient, and to address the greenhouse implications of electricity supply and use, the electricity sector must operate in a national market that is competitive, open and innovative. Because of this, the Council of Australian Governments or COAG, at its meeting of 8 June 2001, established a national energy policy framework to guide future policy decision-making by jurisdictions, established a new Ministerial Council on Energy and agreed on an independent review of national energy policy. COAG agreed that an objective of the national energy policy is mitigating local and global environmental impacts, notably greenhouse impacts of energy production, transformation, supply and end-use. (4) Solar-powered electricity generators are helping to meet peak summer loads in California, but to a very limited extent. In 2000, electricity from solar energy sources contributed less than 0.5% of California’s electricity generation according to the California Energy Commission, and solar electricity generation does not feature significantly in the Commission’s Peak Load Reduction Program. According to the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), in recent months the rising cost of fuels and the California power crisis have spurred a surge in installation of solar electric systems for homes and businesses. However, the contribution to be made by solar energy towards meeting California’s electricity needs is expected to be minor given its relatively high cost, which the US National Centre for Photovoltaics indicates to be several times more expensive per unit of electricity generated than natural gas, and other renewable energy sources such as wind and geothermal energy. (5) On the 7.30 Report, Mr Keith Orchison, Managing Director of the Electricity Supply Association of Australia, stated that, between 4,000 and 7,000 MW of new generating capacity would be needed in order to meet increasing demand over the next decade. I understand, however, that this estimate was for the entirety of the national electricity market, not just Victoria and South Australia. The National Electricity Market Management Company (NEMMcO) has forecast that peak demand in South Australia and Victoria will increase by around 3,000 MW by 2009-2010. As noted above, an increase of this order could be addressed not simply by building additional power stations, but through improved interconnections between States and demand side management. (6) If it was assumed that new power stations using fossil fuels were built to meet the additional demand, then the greenhouse gas emissions would depend on generation type, fuel mix and generator efficiency. For example, combined cycle gas generation, although it is a fossil fuel, results in significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions than other forms of fossil fuel generation. In very general terms however, CO2 emissions from an additional 4,000-7,000 MW of generating capacity using fossil fuels would be in the vicinity of 2 to 3 megatonnes per annum. According to the most recent National Greenhouse Gas Inventory this is equivalent to around 1 to 2% of Australia’s total annual greenhouse gas emissions.",127,Detya S Control For Example Some New Apprenticeships Centres Did Not At The Time Of Imple
233,Mr Truss,"The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following an(7) If it was assumed that new power stations using fossil fuels were built to meet the additional demand, then using an estimate of cost of $1500 per kilowatt to build a new power station using fossil fuels, the overall cost of building sufficient power stations with between 4,000 and 7,000 MW capacity would be in the vicinity of $6 to $10.5 billion. (8) A direct comparison of fossil fuel generation and renewable fuel generation is difficult because the capacity factors for renewable generation are much lower. The overall cost of an additional 7,000 MW of renewables-based generating capacity would depend upon the mix of renewable technologies. Major factors influencing this mix include installed cost per MW and resource availability. Also, the costs of renewable generation capacity are based on peak watts-ie the output when the source is at its peak (eg the sun or wind). For the demand to be met entirely by solar photovoltaics, and assuming a cost of $10 per peak watt, the total installed cost would be around $70 billion. If the demand was met by large-scale wind power alone, assuming a cost of $2 per peak watt, the total installed cost would be approximately $12 billion. Assuming that the hydro resource limitations in Victoria and South Australia would restrict development potential to small-scale, low to medium head applications, and assuming a cost of $1.50 per peak watt, the total installed cost would be approximately $10.5 billion. The actions being undertaken to mitigate growth in demand, however, suggest that it is unlikely the growth will be as dramatic as has been forecast, and it is expected that renewable electricity can form a significant portion of the generation required over the next decade. (9) The Commonwealth Government already has in place a broad range of initiatives designed to promote the increased uptake of renewable electricity throughout Australia. These measures include: The Renewable Energy Action Agenda, a strategic framework developed by government and industry which aims to achieve a sustainable and competitive renewable energy industry with annual sales of $4 billion by 2010. The landmark Mandatory Renewable Energy Target, a cornerstone of Australia’s drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which will guarantee a market for an additional 9,500 gigawatt hours of renewables-based electricity generation per year by 2010, and is expected to drive in excess of $2 billion of investment in renewables. The $31 million Photovoltaic Rebate Program, which assists householders and owners of community-use buildings who install grid-connected or stand-alone photovoltaic systems by providing a rebate of up to 50 percent of system capital costs. The $264 million Remote Renewable Power Generation Program, which aims to increase the uptake of renewable energy technology in remote areas of Australia by providing rebates of up to 50% of the capital cost of converting diesel-based electricity supplies to renewables. The $55.6 million Renewable Energy Commercialisation Program which provides funds for projects leading to the commercialisation of innovative renewable energy equipment, technologies, systems and processes. This program also supports projects that assist in the development of a sustainable, internationally competitive renewable energy industry in Australia. The $26.6 million Renewable Energy Equity Fund, which focuses on facilitating the commercialisation and application of renewable energy technologies through the provision of equity finance to companies undertaking specific renewable energy projects. (10) In line with its commitment to provide leadership and support to Australia’s renewable energy and electricity industries, the Government will continue to monitor and learn from international renewable energy developments, including those in California. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Noise (Question No. 2812) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 6 August 2001: (1) Further to the answer to part (3) of question No. 2672 (Hansard, 6 August 2001 page 29255), upon what advice does the Minister rely in assessing the aircraft traffic relationship between Sydney and Sydney West Airport.

Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Pollutants (Question No. 2813) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 6 August 2001: (1) Further to the answer to part (1) of question No. 2673 (Hansard, 6 August 2001, page 29256) has the Minister received advice from the NSW Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA) in respect of the anticipated expansion of Sydney Airport as a traffic generating event; if so, what is that advice. (2) Further to the answer to part (2) of question No. 2673, what safeguards is the Minister proposing to minimise or eliminate the adverse effects of the increase in air toxins from increased road and traffic due to the expansion of Sydney Airport. (3) Further to the answer to part (4) of question No. 2673, is the Minister now able to say that the expansion of Sydney Airport requires environmental assessment for air quality in the Sydney Basin; if not, why not; if so, when will that environmental assessment occur. swer to the honourable member’s question: (1) No. (2) Refer to answer to part (1) of question 2673. (3) No. Any proposal for upgrading the facilities and operational aspects of Sydney Airport will need to be considered against the requirements of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 to ascertain whether formal environmental assessment of such a proposal is required. Australian Broadcasting Corporation: 2002 ANZAC Day March (Question No. 2814) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 6 August 2001: Will the Australian Broadcasting Corporation televise the 2002 ANZAC Day march in Sydney; if not, why not. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: The ABC has advised that it will undertake a live broadcast of the 2002 ANZAC Day march in Sydney and other cities as in past years, and that no consideration of any kind has been given to any proposal to cease these broadcasts. The ABC is aware of unfounded rumours circulating in relation to the broadcast of the 2002 ANZAC Day marches, and is concerned that unnecessary anxiety should be caused to Australia’s returned service personnel, their families and other Australians. The ABC has further advised that ABC Television will continue to provide full and comprehensive live coverage in each state and territory of the ANZAC Day marches. In addition, where appropriate and subject to available resources, the ABC will seek opportunities to provide other programming such as occurred in 2000 with the live broadcast of the special Dawn Service from Gallipoli.",128,Detya S Control For Example Some New Apprenticeships Centres Did Not At The Time Of Imple

236,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the ArtsSydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Pollutants (Question No. 2846) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 8 August 2001: (1) Further to the answer to questions Nos. 2673 (Hansard, 6 August 2001, page 29210) and 2674 (Hansard, 6 August 2001, page 29211), what precautionary actions has the Government taken to protect citizens from increases in health risks due to long-term exposure to air toxic transport emissions from Sydney’s Airport’s total-airport operations, including aircraft emissions and emissions from road traffic going to and from the airport, and taking into consideration background levels of air toxic pollution from other sources, over the anticipated lifespan of the airport. (2) What, if any, precautionary actions remain to be implemented to protect citizens from increases in health risks due to long-term exposure to air toxic transport emissions from Sydney Airport’s total-airport operations, including aircraft emissions and emissions from road traffic going to and from the airport, and taking into consideration background levels of air toxic pollution from other sources, over the anticipated lifespan of the airport. (3) Why are road traffic congestion and air toxic transport emissions generated by motor vehicles which use Sydney Airport’s car parks excluded from the Federal Government’s area of social responsibility, given that the revenue-generating potential of Sydney Airport’s car parks is of significant commercial interest to current and future Sydney Airport operators, and a major commercial factor in the Federal Government’s privatisation of the airport. swer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Government currently oversights the Sydney Airport Corporation Limited’s (SACL) environmental management of the Sydney Airport site, including all operations that are undertaken at the site. In this framework, SACL has undertaken extensive air pollution monitoring at the site, in conjunction with the NSW EPA. This work includes monitoring of sulphur dioxide, particulates, carbon monoxide, ozone, oxides of nitrogen and non-methane hydrocarbons. The airport currently complies with all air quality standards set by both State and Federal agencies. Despite these findings, that Sydney Airport is not a significant contributor to airshed pollution around the Sydney region, SACL has established, under its Airport Environment Strategy, management actions to reduce the amount of air pollution generated at the site over time. Some of these measures have already been implemented including the introduction of a rail service to the airport and installing ground power to aircraft to reduce use of on-board power generators. (2) SACL is proposing to continue to monitor air quality at the airport site and has committed to maintaining air emissions at the site to 1999 levels. A major part of this program involves targeting major emission point sources at the airport site and implementing appropriate management measures to ensure this commitment is met. (3) The NSW State government has jurisdiction at the airport site for matters relating to pollution generated by motor vehicles. This entails that motor vehicle traffic pollution at Sydney Airport is handled the same way both on and off the airport site for environmental consistency across the jurisdictional boundaries. As such, the environmental issues associated with motor vehicle pollution at Sydney Airport carpark are dealt with in the same fashion as pollution generated at such places as the Westfield shopping complex carpark in Parramatta. Aviation: Aircraft Emissions (Question No. 2848) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 8 August 2001: (1) Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to a 25 July 2001 issue of The Guardian newspaper reporting that emissions from aircraft are a growing contributor to climate change, according to a recent government consultation paper on the future of British aviation. (2) Is the Minister familiar with the government consultation paper; if so what is the name of the consultation paper.",130,Detya S Control For Example Some New Apprenticeships Centres Did Not At The Time Of Imple
237,Mr Truss,"The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) My attention had not been drawn to the relevant article in The Guardian newspaper. However the importance of the air transport sector to long term greenhouse emission growth has been recognised for some time. While relatively small in absolute terms, the rate of growth presents long term challenges. In 1999 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report on the special challenge and possible solutions to aviation emissions. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has commissioned a study of policy options to limit or reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from civil aviation, which is due to be presented to the ICAO later this year. (2) I am aware of the consultation paper. The title of the consultation paper is The Future of AviationThe Government’s Consultation Document on Air Transport Policy, released by the then Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions, on 12 December 2000. Second Sydney Airport: Sydney West (Question No. 2858) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 9 August 2001: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 2619 (Hansard, 6 August 2001, page 29200), has the Minister’s attention been drawn to the reply by the Minister for Transport and Regional Service to question No. 2599 (Hansard, 6 August 2001, page 29198) in which he says the Government has made no decision on the site for a second major airport for Sydney. (2) In light of the Minister’s answer to part (2) of question No. 2619 in which it is stated that the Second Sydney Airport proposal for which an EIS was conducted was a proposal to locate a second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek, where does the Minister understand the site for a second major airport for Sydney to be. (3) What is the location of the Second Sydney Airport proposal as understood by the Minister pursuant to the provisions of the Environmental Assessment (Impact of Proposals) Act. (4) Is the proponent of the Second Sydney Airport the Minister for Transport and Regional services; if not, who is the proponent of the proposal. (5) In light of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services’ answer to question No. 2599, is the Minister able to say what is the effect of Commonwealth environmental law. (6) Is the effect of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services’ answer to question No. 2599 such that the proposal as submitted to the Minister for environmental assessment is thereby withdrawn; if not, which site was selected for the location of the Second Sydney Airport following the environmental impact assessment process conducted at the Minister’s instruction by Rust PPK Environment and Infrastructure, from 1995 to 1997 inclusive. swer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. (2) Refer to the Minister’s answer to question 2619 (Hansard, 6 August 2001, page 29200). (3) If the honourable member is referring to the assessment undertaken under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 then the member should refer to the answer to part 2 of question 2619 (Hansard, 6 August 2001, page 29200). (4) No, there is no current proposal. (5) Any proposal to construct a Second Sydney Airport will need to be considered against the requirements of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the Environmental Reform (Consequential Provisions) Act 1999. (6) No. The Second Sydney Airport proposal for which an EIS was undertaken was assessed in accordance with the provisions of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974.",131,Detya S Control For Example Some New Apprenticeships Centres Did Not At The Time Of Imple

239,Mr Truss,"The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following anAustralian Defence Force: Recruitment (Question No. 2861) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 9 August 2001: (1) What was the duration of the pilot outsourcing contract with Manpower Services Australia Pty Ltd for the provision of Defence recruiting services in Victoria, Tasmania and southern NSW. (2) Did the contract for the pilot incorporate a formal evaluation requirement; if so, what were the details; if not, why was there no such requirement. (3) Has Defence now completed an assessment of the success or otherwise of the pilot project; if so, what were its findings. (4) Is it proposed to publicly release the results of the assessment; if not, why not. (5) Has Defence now entered into a further contract with Manpower for the provision of recruitment services; if so, (a) when was this contract signed, (b) what geographical area and how many recruitment offices does it cover, (c) what is the duration of the contract, (d) what is the estimated total cost of the contract and (e) what evaluation arrangements will apply. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The duration of ‘pilot’ phase of the Contract for the Provision of Recruiting Services to the Australian Defence Force was originally over the period 4 September 2000 to 3 September 2001. (2) Under the terms and conditions of the Contract with Manpower Services (Australia) Pty Ltd a formal evaluation was not required. Defence was required to advise Manpower Services (Australia) of its intentions regarding Phase Two of the Contract (National roll out) by issuing a preliminary notice not less than 84 days prior to the end of Phase One (8 June 2001). Defence conducted an ongoing evaluation from contract signature. To provide a broader analysis Defence conducted an evaluation by a team comprising both Defence personnel and civilian contractors led by Mr Jim Longworth of Cogent Business Solutions. The evaluation considered factors such as: target achievement, candidate care (ministerial and other complaints), stakeholder feedback, contract administration, management of embedded staff, and waivers. (3) Defence has completed an assessment of the performance of the Manpower Services (Australia) during the pilot phase and determined that extension of the trial is the most appropriate course of action. (4) It is not proposed to publicly release the results of the assessment as the content is Commercial-inConfidence. (5) As a result of negotiations between Defence and the Manpower Services (Australia), a Deed of Amendment to the Contract was executed to extend the trial. (a) The Deed of Amendment to the Contract was executed on 20 August 2001. (b) The extended trial will be conducted in the Victoria, Tasmania and Southern New South Wales region, utilising three recruiting offices located in Melbourne, Hobart and Albury. (c) The amended contract is for the period 20 August 2001 to 28 February 2003. (d) Based upon full recruitment target achievement within the trial area by Manpower Services (Australia), the estimated cost of the Contract is $14.5m. (e) There will be ongoing evaluation of the performance of Manpower Services (Australia) throughout the extended ‘pilot’ phase. The evaluation will be conducted by an independent consultant using a terms of reference and assessment criteria that will be agreed by both Defence and Manpower Services (Australia). The evaluation criteria have been included in the amended Contract. The evaluation will consider the following factors: quality of applicants; quantity of applicants; contractual compliance; cost effectiveness; stakeholder satisfaction and innovation.
