It is not clear as to' what ""Order"" tlie question refers. If it be to Statutory Rules 1922, No. 51, dated 1st June, 1922, the reason is that in the interests of the revenue it was considered desirable to revert .to the standard for industrial spirit in force prior to the recent war, which standard had. to be departed from during that period owing to the scarcity of some of the denaturants. The Regulation cited actually allows a wider choice of denaturants than did the regulation which was -in force prior to the war. So far ns alcohol fuel is concerned it is not proposed to require the use of more than 1 per cent of wood naphtha in addition to the other denaturants.

At tlie present time; there is only one subCompany. The representatives of the Comsidized aerial service in operation, viz., that between Geraldton and Derby, Western Australia (1,195 miles). A contract was let to Messrs. Western Australian Airways Limited, for a period of twelve months, from Sth December, 1921, for the operation of a regular [20 ] weekly (return) service over this reute. The subsidy payable for maintenance of the service for the period of the contract is £25,000. The following additional contracts have been let for a period of twelve months, but service has not yet commenced:(o) Brisbane-Sydney (550 miles) -Sub sidy, £11,500. (6) Sydney-Adelaide (760 miles) -Sub sidy, £17,500. (c) Charleville-Cloncurry (575 miles) Subsidy, £12,000. 2. No. At the time tenders were received for the Western Australian service, there' were no Australian-made aeroplanes available for the efficient operation of this service. At the time tenders were called for the maintenance of the other services, Australian manufacturers were not in a position to produce in requisite numbers and in reasonable time machines suitable in design and performance for the economical operation of the service. 3. The matter is receiving consideration. AoBEEMEJJT WITH COMMONWEALTH. 1.

LINE OF STEAMERS. honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr House to adopt, and that it was still, in Pratten) inquired when the balance-sheet for the Commonwealth Government Line of steamers for the year ended 30th June, 1921, would be presented. I desire to inform the honourable member that, in accordance with the usual practice, the balance-sheet will be presented in the Budget papers. On the 12th July, the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) asked if the Minister in charge of the Commonwealth Line of steamers was aware that the managers of the line are charging higher freights from British ports to Australia than they are charging from Antwerp to Australia. In reply, I beg to state that the rate of freight from Antwerp to Australia is the same as from the United Kingdom to Australia. agreed to That the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works have leave, so far as members of thc House of Representatives are concerned, to sit in Adelaide during the sittings of the House. Debate resumed from 13th July (vide That the following Address-in-Reply to tbe Speech of His Excellency the Governor General be agreed to by this House:MAY: IT PLEASE TOUB EXCELLENCYWe, the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, beg to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the Speech which' you have been pleased to addross to Parliament. Last night, when at a late hour the Leader of the House by an act of unusual mercy, agreed to the adjournment of the debate, I was discussing what is known as the wireless agreement made between the Commonwealth and. Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, and I had pointed out that that agreement now executed between the Commonwealth and the company was the result of investigation by a Committee, following upon a motion moved in this House; also that in many radical particulars it was a departure from the agreement which the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) wished the my view at all events, open to very severe criticism on the ground that the Government should not have given away its paramount rights by associating itself with a subordinate company of this kind. We may console ourselves, however, with the knowledge that the position is not as bad as it might have been; unquestionably it is not so bad aa it would have been but for the timely protest made by ton). The Commonwealth Government have pledged this country to the expenditure of £500,000 in the first place, and I have sufficient knowledge of the developments incidental to undertakings of this kind to feel sure that our financial commitment is not likely to be limited to that amount. The agreement as it stands, as I have said, is much better than it was, but it is still open to criticism, and I say this with a f u l l knowledge and admission that as a member of that Committee I had some little part in making suggestions as to how the agreement might be improved. I did not pretend to draft in detail a water-tight agreement between the Commonwealth and the company. That, I very careful deliberation on the part of the Commonwealth Crown Law officers.

45,The Leader Of The Opposition ( Mr Charl,"Opposition contended when the matter was first before us, we should have provided that the report of that Committee should come back to this House for further and fuller consideration. But for some reason which I am quite at a loss to understand, the Prime Minister was so eager to commit the Government to this agreement, so eager to commit the Commonwealth to this expenditure, and was so extraordinarily friendly to this corporation, that he would not brook any further delay-n o delay at all if he could have helped it-and succeeded in getting the House to consent that there should be no delay beyond what was necessary for the Committee to consider the agreement; he would not postpone the final adjustment until the House had an opportunity >of discussing the Committee's report. I am sorry to say that the majority of the Committee have furnished a very sparse report. the evidence, which is of a highly illuminating character. But the report of bhe Committee itself, I repeat, is meagre I reported at somewhat greater length. I , however, was in a minority. The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) has said that, because I furnished my report upon the eve of the meeting of Parliament, my action was necessarily a mere party political move. The reason why I presented my report so close upon the inauguration of the session was that it appeared to me that its earlier presentation could serve no good purpose. It could not be considered until Parliament had met, and was, therefore, in a position to do to. AlsoI was influenced by the fact that, whether I disagreed or agreed, the contract would be accepted by the Government, and would bind the Commonwealth. A very startling and ominous piece of information is made known this morning. I refer to the answers to a series of questions put in the Senate Chamber yesterday by SenatorJ . D. Millen, a member of the Committee. It will be recalled by honourable members that the original draft agreement provided for .the preponderating influence in the company to be that of Amalgamated Wireless, in respect of the directorate, as against that of the -Commonwealth. The Opposition in this chamber attacked that proposition; and the Committee accepted its view, as against that defended by the Government. As a result, in the present agreement there has been inserted «. clause to the effect that the directorate shall consist of an equal number of representatives of Amalgamated Wireless and of the Commonwealth, three on eachside, and that the chairman shall be selected by this joint directorate. event of disagreement 1 to add that in that event the matter of his selection was to be submitted to an arbitrator. The chairman-thi s seventh member of the directorate-ha s been so selected. There was a disagreement between thegentlemen representing the Government and those representative of Amalgamated! Wireless. At all events, there was & nominal disagreement, for the outcome has been that, following upon the appointment of an arbitrator, there haa I quoted last night from been selected and appointed--as an independent chairman, be it marked-the Chairman of Amalgamated Wireless itself, namely Sir Thomas Hughes. thing I have eiver heard ! of the selection appeals to honourable members. who appointed Sir Thomas Hughes. on the Board, having disagreed over the selection of a chairman, appointed an arbitrator, who has selected as an independent chairman of the Board the Chairman of Amalgamated Wireless. the money and the company will run the show. ber for Batman( Mr Brennan) will see that this does not affect the agreement. absolutely, why Amalgamated Wireless jumped at every alteration which we made in the agreement. It reveals to me most clearly why, step by step, we drove them back, and why everything they said at first that they could not accept, they did accept. It was, of course, for the simple reason that Amalgamated Wireless realized that they would have the last say. The whole business is not only open to criticism, but to suspicion.

55,Mr Brennan,"It explains to me,shrewdly suspect, are representatives of the Commonwealth; and these representatives of the Commonwealth, I am bound to believe, are largely representatives of Amalgamated Wireless. I shall proceed now to deal in detail w it h the questions of SenatorJ . D . Millen, and w i th the answers furnished thereto. The honourable senator first asked1. What are the names of the directors appointed to the Board of the Amalgamated Wireless Company (new company)? The answer furnished was1. Sir Wm. Vicars, George Mason Allard, and John Stinson, representing the Commonwealth the best men in New South Wales. best friends of the honourable member and his party. The answer proceeds to state .that those representing the shareholders are Mr P. Bartholomew, MrE . T . Fisk, and Captain Langley Webb. SenatorJ . D . Millen next asked2. Isi t a fact that four of these directors were on the directorate of the Amalgamated Wireless Company (old company) ? ' 3. If it is a fact, is he (the Minister) aware whether such an arrangement is absolutely opposed to the intention of the Wireless Parliamentary Committee, whether such a state of control was viewed with great misgiving, and any agreement only consented to on the understanding that the seventh director should be independent of either interest? Those are the questions which were asked by a. Nationalist member of this Parliament. best men in the Senate. I know; and, certainly, one of the best informed men on the Committee. So leave that aspect of the matter. I do not much I must say for the honourable know that we have heard the last of it . senator. that last question ? No answer was for t hthis agreement which embodies vital coming to No. 2. as follow: 2 and 3. The agreement provided for the selection of the seventh director by the three Government representatives and the three commember of that Committee, may I ask pany representatives. If they failed to agree, you why we have never seen the printed the agreement further provided for the apreport of the Parliamentary Wireless pointment of an arbitrator, whose decision was to be final. No agreement was reached, and Committee ? an arbitrator was appointed by the six directors. The decision of the arbitrator, after table of the House. hearing both the company's and the Government's nominees, was for Sir Thomas Hughes. The appointment of the seventh director was in strict accord with the agreement approved by the Wireless Committee, the directors acting upon that agreement, and advising the Government what had been done. vouchsafed to that portion of SenatorJ .

I suggest to the Treasurer-wh o was a member of the Committee-that it would be very courageous on his part, and highly proper, if , as a member of the Government, he were to tell the House that that arrangement, if it had been foreseen by members of the Parliamentary Wireless Committee would never have been made, and that the Committee never would have agreed to such a proposal, but would have advised unanimously against it . I can safely say that the Treasurer knows perfectly well that such is the fact. Hughes connected w i th Amalgamated Wireless now? one of the said to be an independent chairman?

' It was one of the features missing from the agreement which the Commonwealth Government endeavoured to get us to sign, but is now embodied in the agreement in a form, the weakness of which I shall proceed to show, improved though it may be. The clause reads as follows:The company shall, within six months after the date of this agreement, or within such extended time as the representatives of the Comber says that he was not a member of monwealth on the Board may approve, enter into an agreement providing for the erection and operation of the stations mentioned in paragraphs (/) and (g) of clause 5 of this agreement. The agreement shall contain guarantees of such a nature, and to such an amount, as are approved by the Commonwealth representatives on the Board of Directors, for the provision of a direct commercial wireless service between Australia and the stations in the United Kingdom and Canada. Then a definition of ""commercial wireless"" is given as follows:For the purpose of this agreement the Commercial Wireless Service means a service capable, a« regards plant, apparatus, and personhave been expected, that it has come nel, of maintaining communication throughout 300 days of every year, on the minimum basis of twenty words per minute each way for twelve hours per day.

We asked, "" How do you know you can do it when no one else has ever done it ; what are the obstacles in tihe way of doing it ? "" The witnesses we called were unanimous in saying that there were tremendous difficulties which had never been overcome. We were told different patents, in force with the object of overcoming the mysterious difficulty of atmospherics, but that none of them had yet been tried out. Furthermore, we were told that no system, such as that to which the Commonwealth was Let us see how it is procommitted, had been put into operation effectively' in any part of the world. Of course, the Prime Minister said, "" Yes, you can go down to Koo-wee-rup to Amalgamated Wireless Limited there, and pick up messages from Leafield, in England, from New York, or from Bordeaux."" Because occasionally some stray, wandering messages are picked up from across the world-God only knows how they came or whether they will be likely I can quite to come again-the Prime Minister says, ""Yes, we can enter into this contract with Amalgamated Wirelessi Limited with perfect confidence."" I do not know what is going to happen. All that I know is that we are committed to this costly experiment, that the indemnity or guarantee clause, when carefully read, is a very poor protection indeed, and I suspect that the time is not very far distant when we shall hear that there has been secretly appointed an Arbitrator, something like the Arbitrator in reference to the KidmanMayoh contract, to decide between Amalgamated Wireless Limited and the Commonwealth as to what is to be done about the service which cannot be given to Australia. When these things happen we shall probably be told that in order to avoid the expense of litigation-becaus e we have already had expensive litigation with Marconi-and , incidentally, to avoid the publicity attaching to this question, the matter should be submitted to an arbitrator, and, if possible, one with his passage booked to New York, so that his finding may come back to us from America later in the year., I do not wish to labour the matter unduly. I feel inclined to leave it at this stage. Perhaps the Treasurer will favour us with his views upon the question. Perhaps the honourable member for Fawkner will give us the benefit of his opinion.

[12.10] -When the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) commenced his speech last night I thought he was going to deal seriously with the agreement that had been entered into between the Commonwealth and the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. I imagined that he was going to throw some light on his attitude, and give the House some information as to why he took the view that the agreement should not have been entered into. But, although I paid the honourable member the compliment of listening very carefully to his speech, and was proposing to take notes of the points made by him in order that I might deal with them, since I was Chairman of the Committee that considered the agreement, I found, to my amazement, that he had really nothing to say. It became more and more obvious with every word he .uttered that this was merely another attempt on behalf of the Labour party to flog the Government with anything on which they The could lay their hands. Honourable members opposite, however, in this case, have chosen a most unhappy means of condemning the Government. I propose to deal at some length with this matter, because I believe the House desires to obtain full information as to the exact terms of the agreement which was recommended by the mixed Committee appointed to consider it. Before doing so, however, I should like to < refer briefly to the attitude of the honourable member for Batman with regard to the whole subject, and particularly to his attitude towards the Committee, of which he was a member. He told us last night that his signature appeared, without his sanction, on the Teport of the Committee. That is correct. Let me explain the position. The Committee sat for some time, and considered the whole question thoroughly giving attention to .even the most minute details. Some honourable memhers of the Committee to whom I have spoken say that they have some recollection, as I have, that at the outset of the proceedings the honourable member for Batman said some. thing to the effect that it might be necessary for him to put in a minority report. That statement was made at the very beginning of the proceedings. Some members of the Committee have no recollection of the statement, but I remember it",24,Speech Should Have Supposed Was A Matter For
111,Party Look At My Leader ( Mr Charl,,25,Speech Should Have Supposed Was A Matter For
112,Commonwealth Woollen Mills Mr Bruce (Flinders,"Treasurer)and several others do. With ""that one small indication of what his attitude might be, he sat and worked with the Committee right through. He was one of a sub-Committee of three, who finally went through the draft and recommended it to the Committee as satisfactory. that attitude on the part of the honourable member? at all wrong with it if the honourable memword "" pretending "" very much represents iber had only maintained it. On the final day of meeting we considered and dealt with our draft report. It was a very short one for the reason that our views were expressed in the modification of the agreement as recommended by us. Asi t was very late in the evening the suggestion was made that I , as Chairman, should sign the report on' behalf of the whole Committee. It did not occur to any one of the. other eight members of the Committee that it was not to be a unanimous report. The possibility of any lack of unanimity with regard to the report did not once cross our minds. It was decided, however, that the suggestion I have just mentioned should not be adopted for the reason that one member expressed the opinion that the report would be a most historic document, and he desired, therefore, to attach his signature to. it. member for Batman present on that occasion. was hot. The point I wish to emphasize is that it did not occur to any one member of the Committee on which the honourable member for Batman had worked throughout, that the report was not going to be a unanimous report. And all of us were amazed when we saw the honourable member's statement after the report had been submitted. I have stated the f acts, and I leave honourable members to form their own opinion as to the attitude adopted by the honourable member for Batman. will remember my speaking to a proposal made by Senator J. D. Millen for controlling this scheme by Commissioners, and that I said I was much more favourably disposed to that than to the agreement. Millen, but he signed the report. There is another side to this question. We have heard this morning i certain criticisms of the agreement, which .1 suggest were very futile and small, but we heard none of those objections when the honourable member for Batman was pretending to give the Committee his earnest assistance and co-operation in order to make the agreement as good as possible. I think the the honourable member's attitude, if after having given us information and assistance in amending the agreement he now declares that he ought to have told us all these other things when we were considering the document. The honourable member was a member of the Committee, attended nearly every meeting we held, and went through the agreement in detail with us, and I think every other member of the Committee will agree that it never occurred to any of us that he would not sign the report. He did not raise the points then that he has mentioned to-day after the agreement has been signed. I come now to the actual detailed objections which the honourable member has raised. He said that Commonwealth money is being thrown away, that it has not been proved that direct wireless communication over a distance from 10,000 to 12,000 miles is practicable, and I should imagine from his remarks this morning that he is totally opposed to the whole project of direct wireless communication with Great Britain. That is news to me. That the practicability of direct wireless communication with Great Britain is not yet established is undeniable. No man can say whether or iiot this can be done with certainty, and that was a consideration which more than anything else impressed the Committee. All of us were seized of the wonderful value to Australia which direct wireless communication with Europe would be, but we were not prepared' to risk a great sum of Commonwealth money in such an undertaking on the evidence at present available. The experts examined by the Committee are confident that wireless communication with Britain can be established on the basis of a commercial service for 300 days in the year, twelve hours",25,Speech Should Have Supposed Was A Matter For

We asked them to adduce evidence in support of their theory, and all they could tell us were the results obtained by what is called ""listening in "" with their own instruments in Australia. A study of the summarized evidence will show that the experts have obtained very considerable results in that way over periods of weeks and for many hours per day. With the very inefficient receiving installations a firm getting the contraot. at present in existence they have been able to pick up wireless messages from Bordeaux, Leafield, and other stations in. Europe. The Committee were not satisfied, however, that that evidence was sufficient to warrant the Commonwealth spending a great sum of money, and we pointed out that the only basis upon which we could agree to recommend the purchase was that we should have some guarantee of the service which the Commonwealth would get in return for the money expended. possible, and some people will say probable, that when a station for the purpose of giving direct communication with Great Britain is completed in Australia, it will not function to the extent that is expected. A t first sight it would seem difficult to arrive at -any measure of compensation for the Government in the event of that happening, but the problem is not so difficult as it appears on the surface. The station to be erected in Australia will be one of the largest in the world, and even if it should not funcconsidered the agreement, and reported tion over a distance of 10,000 or 12,000 miles, it will undoubtedlv function for distances of 5,000 or 6,000 miles, giving us, for example, direct communication with America, and, probably, India. That provides a basis for entering into a contract which will provide proper safeguards for the Commonwealth. Suppose that a contract were made for the erection at a cost of £500,000 of a station to give direct communication with Britain for 300 days in the year, twelve hours per day, and twenty words per minute, and it should fail to do that, but should provide a commercial service t'o America and to other countries within a radius of 5,000 miles, it would be possible to reduce tbe Commonwealth expenditure from £500,000 to, say, £400,000 or £300,000 as the case might be. Upon that principle the Committee acted. We were not prepared to risk the Commonwealth money until we had a guarantee that we. would get good value for it , and the contract is so framed that there is no limitation in regard to the contractor to whom the work may be given. There have been suggestions that the contract must be given to the Marconi Company, but if there is any other firm that can give a better service at a cheaper price there is nothing in the agreement to prevent such mine that? company.' That is a safeguard which the Committee inserted, and I desire to make it clear to the House before I deal in detail with the agreement, because that is the whole basis of the arrangement into which we have entered, and it is a feature of the agreement which the honnan) in the earlier part of his speech, at It is very any rate, did not mention to the House. commitment will be on a sliding scale according to the measure of efficiency. the basis which will be adopted. The honourable member for Batman said that he did not pretend to draft a watertight agreement that could be open to no objection. I resent that statement. He was one of the four lawyers wiho were members of the Committee, and he was one of the sub-Committee of three who to the main Committee that it was a proper document which the Committee could recommend to the Government. The honourable member has suggested that, there was not time for the agreement to be properly considered by the Law ofiicers; if there were any doubts or uncertainties in his mind as to the agreement being water-tight, surely he, as a lawyer, should have warned the Committee of the danger into which they were walking. But he did not give us one indication that we would be unwise to accept the draft which had been prepared by the Solicitor-General and the Crown Law officers. The agreement came back to the main Committee from three legal members of the sub-Committee, and not one word did the honourable member say to indicate that the agreement was not",26,Speech Should Have Supposed Was A Matter For

Another point made by the honourable member for Batman was that the majority report was very sparse. necessity for a long report ; such a a report would probably have confused the issue. We embodied in the agreement all the recommendations, which the Committee had to make, and I think that was the most valuable report we could have made.

With Tespect to the incalled upon to make his selection, I have no particulars; but, as a member of the Parliamentary Wireless Committee, I There was no will say that it was not our intention, when the clause under discussion was framed, that a person who had been previously associated with the company should be chosen as the independent seventh director.

Any honourable member possessing an impartial mind will say that, if a seventh person has to be added to a directorate on which there are already three representatives of each side, the fairest method of selection is to employ the services, of an independent arbitrator. In this instance, seeing that the arbitrator is a gentleman of considerable standing, the president of the Law Institute in Sydney, and that the selection of Sir Thomas Hughes was a matter for the arbitrator solely, how^ can any fair-minded member hold the Government responsible? The next point with which I wish to deal is embodied in clause 5 of the agreement :(a) To construct,.maintain, and .operate in which the operators shall have been workAustralia the necessary stations and equipment ing as its employees. for a direct commercial wireless service between Australia and the United Kingdom; (6) to provide and operate a system of feeder stations for wireless connection between the main high-power stations and the capital cities of all the States; (c) to equip and organize the feeder stations, BO us to provide communication with merchant ships round the coast of Australia; (e) to arrange for the operation of suitable corresponding stations in thc United Kingdom; (/) to provide the main trunk stations in Australia and the United Kingdom within two years from the date of this agreement; (</) to arrange within two years from the date of this agreement for the erection and operation of a station in Canada capable of commercial communication with the high power station in Australia, and so equipped as to afford facilities for distributing traffic throughout North America; (h) to take over; within one month after signing this agreement, the existing Commonwealth radio stations, excepting those wholly under the control of the Department of Defence, but including thc stations in Papua, Territory of New Guinea, and Flinders and King Islands, and also, if required by the Minister for Home and Territories, the station at Willis Islets, and to operate and re-organize the service provided by those stations in such a way as to provide a service at least equivalent to that now being supplied by thc Commonwealth radio service. The company is to take over the existing radio stations throughout Australia. These are to be operated and re-organized so as to provide a service at least the equal of that now being furnished by the Commonwealth. The next clause covers the basis Government on which the stations are to be taken over. That is to be at a valuation to be made by a committee, ""including two representatives of the company and two of the Commonwealth, with an independent chairman, to be agreed upon by the other four representatives and, in default of agreement, to be determined by arbitration."" Also, the whole of the personnel of our existing stations are to be taken over, and are to carry with them all their present rights respecting pay, and all their accrued rights regard-* ing pensions and the like. With respect to pensions, the Commonwealth is to be responsible in conjunction with the company, according to the periods of service given by the employees with the two separate entities. That is to say, the Commonwealth are to be responsible covering the period in which it has employed the men concerned, while the company is to be similarly responsible for the term in Clause7 provides that, during the period of construction and re-organization, or for three years from the date of the agreement-excep t in the case of the existing radio stations in New Guinea, in respect of which the period is seven years-the Commonwealth shall pay to the company all amounts expended in carrying on existing radio stations. Thus it would appear that the Commonwealth is to bear any losses which may be occasioned during that term. At first sight honourable members may be inclined to think that here is furnished an opportunity for the company to lose as much as it may care, while the Commonwealth will be unable to protest, but must merely bear the loss. Upon a further analysis of the agreement, however, it will be found that nothing of the sort can happen. The stations are at present in the hands of the Commonwealth. After the expiration of the periods set out in the agreement they are to be taken over and operated by the company, and any losses that may thereafter accrue will fall upon the shoulders of the company. It would be absurd then to suggest that in view of those facts, the company would be careless whether losses were occasioned during the intervening period, seeing that they would subsequently have to carry on those mismanaged stations, and would be themselves responsible for all losses.",28,Speech Should Have Supposed Was A Matter For

""With respect to the existing radio stations in New Guinea, the Commonwealth undertakes to bear possible losses, as I have already pointed out, for a longer period, namely, seven years from the date of the agreement. The reasons for conceding an extended term, in the case of those distant territorial radio statious will be obvious. ' Alterations in the rates for traffic in respect of wireless are to be subject to the directors nominated by the Government, and not to the majority of the Board. I have already dealt with the question of the guarantee; that matter is covered in clause 12. There is no reason why a contract cannot be drafted so that the rights and interests of the Commonwealth shall be abundantly safeguarded. We expect to be in a position whereby we shall be assured that for whatever money we may spend we shall be given Ian adequate . return. do not wish to leave in tlie minds of sion .that it is absolutely certain, that the main station, when erected, will function for 12,000 miles.

There is further provision in the agreement that the whole system shall be handed over to the Government in case of war or of public daggerAnd, further, it is provided that the wireentitled to give notice to the company of the less installations shall not compete with the land lines already established in the Commonwealth. Such provision is necessary, of course, to safeguard Commonwealth revenue. places which are not served by a telegraph line in distant parts of the Commonwealth, there is nothing contained in the agreement to prevent their being served by wireless, and continuing to be so served. Special provision is inserted in the agreement by which nothing contained thereinshall be construed to prejudice or limit in any way any right or power of the Commonwealth to acquire on just terms, compulsorily or otherwise^ any share or interest of any person in the company. Some honourable members may fear that we are handing over to a monopoly for all time the control of wireless in Australia. Such, is not the case. If the company should become a monopoly there is nothing in the agreement, or elsewhere, to prevent the Government from taking steps to acquire the whole concern on just terms. The last provision of the agreement is to the effect that the shares which are to be subscribed by others than the Commonwealth must be so subscribed within six months, or within such extended time as may be mutually agreed upon; otherwise, the Commonwealth can refuse to go on with the whole matter.

Unquestionably, even if the station erected in Australia failed lamentably it should pick up Singapore, and it would he surprising if it could not pick up the next stage in India, while it would be extremely probable that it would also pick up the station in Egypt. It all depends upon the extent to which the Australian station will function. As the Norman scheme has been mentioned, one should, I think, say a word or two about it , because it was considered member for Batman has had to say to-day very carefully by the Committee of this Parliament. The honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) has said something with regard to the Norman report, and has indicated that it declared that commercial wireless over a range of more than 2,000 miles was an impracticable proposition, It was not a fair statement from the honorahle member with his knowledge of the position. The Norman report has been the subject of most unpleasant discussions. I put it no stronger than that. It has had surrounding it an atmosphere altogether undesirable. In fact, suggestions have been made that it really is the cable interests working against wireless. Many other suggestions have been put forward, but I do not wish to laibour the point, except to say that the Committee of this Parliament took a good deal of evidence about the Norman report, and all matters connected with it. Therefore, it is surprising to find any member of that Committee quoting that report as though he believed it to be the last and final word in regard to the subject. I know of no other points made by the honourable member for Batman. In fact, as I listened to him I was surprised to find that he proposed to bring under the notice of the* House nothing more than he had said in order to show why he had taken such a very extraordinary attitude towards the Wireless Committee, and all matters connected with it . I have no hesitation in telling the House that the agreement, as it is now drafted, has been very carefully considered. The Committee tried to close up every avenue through which the Commonwealth Government could be involved in financial liability, and obtain no result. A .Committee comHe asked whether these this Parliament is extraordinarily valuable, and the work done by this Committee was exceedingly well done-and having regard to the magnitude of the task, expeditiously done. The attention and time devoted by the members of the Committee to the work with which they were intrusted justify me in telling honourable members that they may quite safely rely upon the interests of the Commonwealth having been safeguarded as far as it was possible to do so. Having heard all that the honourable I do not for a second imagine that his attack has been directed towards the findings of the Wireless Committee. It has been directed solely against the Government. It was an attempt on the honourable member's part to delay the business of the House, and throw another stone at the Government.

150,Mr Wise.',"No; the company did notwhat we have had from honourable members opposite within the last few days. I have been sitting here listening to nearly everything that has been said. SinceI have been in ofiice I have seen certain things in the press in regard to matters in respect of which it was alleged the Government had fallen short, and I thought that, perhaps, the discussion on the motion for the adoption of the Address-inEeply would crystallize some of those complaints and enable me to discover the hideous faults, if there are any, with which the Government might be charged. I have listened, but I have not heard of any, and I have come to the conclusion that the present Ministry must be almost as satisfactory as I thought it to be. We had one amendment submitted by the Leader' of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) dealing with probably thc most serious problem we have in Australia to-day, namely, the industrial position, but the best the honourable member could do in order to thrust the blame for this grave and important situation on the Government was to say that it was all due to the fact that we had not properly administered the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act. However, that charge did no good. answer the charge now. I am merely endeavouring to indicate a few of the matters that have come under attention during the last few days. There is a welter of argument pointing to the fact that the industrial situation here is entirely due to an economic factor felt all the world over. The only thing apparent purpose of the Leader, of the Opposition, who now interjects with delightful frankness that the debate has done an enormous amount of good outside. Every one knows the purpose the honourable member had in view when he submitted his amendment and advanced the argument to which I have just referred. He also touched upon immigration, but I could see nothing in what he said of the slightest value. The Government have indicated their immigration policy, namely, that it is a matter for the States, and that we are willing to cooperate with the S.tates. I have gone through all the suggestions offered, and nothing has come to light of the slightest use in combating the policy of the Government. The matter of old-age pensions has been introduced at a time when no benefit could be achieved by the old-age pensioners, even if the amendment submitted opposite had been carried. When the Budget is under consideration will be the proper time for considering that question. I do not wish to speak on lines on which I might be supposed to be defending the Government. The Government needs no defence. lane? Flinders-lane, but I am hardly the person to do so, because some people may think that I am still interested in Flinders-lane. As a matter of fact I am not. I have given up my position there. Nevertheless, having been there, I do not propose to deal with a matter which already has been effectively dealt with by the Leader of the House( Mr Greene) in that well-balanced and well-reasoned speech he delivered last night. Every other question raised had been already answered by him in a very admirable fighting speech delivered by him on the previous night. However, there is one little matter to which I do wish to refer. The honourable speaking on the question of finance yesterday, indicated that in his opinion, in view of the figures I placed before the House the other day, I was actually going down the hill, and becoming like any other old politician. I do not wish to refer to this matter at length, but the was the source from which the comment comes naturally gives me grave alarm. I can assure the honourable member that his criticisms are a little premature. I have not quite sunk into the position he suggests. It might be of help to honourable members if I said a word or two about the honourable member's statement that he disagreed with something I had said in Brisbane-that we had very little more than £4,500,000 of our expenditure in which we could effect necessary and possible economy. As there are many honourable members who are looking forward to the Budget, and possibly preparing Budgets for me, I will give them some assistance by indicating how I arrived at that figure.",31,Speech Should Have Supposed Was A Matter For

Last year the figure was £31,361,000. course, is interest and sinking fund, which amounted to £21,083,000 last year, and will be more this year, because we have still further obligations to meet. The next important item under this heading of "" War Services"" is £7,028,000 for war pensions. Other items of expenditure in this direction are for repatriation and other war activities. The latter have practically gone or, at any rate, I hope they will be gone this year, but we have still an obligation to meet in regard to the repatriation pf our soldiers. I do not think that we shall be able to reduce the expenditure on war services below £32.000,000. Works £2,584,000 last year. We shall probably be able to reduce the expenditure in this direction this year to £1,500,000. The expenditure on "" Special Appropriations "" amounts to £14,972,000. Of this amount £7,035,000 is absorbed by payments to the States, and_ £5,295,000 by invalid and old-age pensions, and the payment of the maternity allowance. under this heading is controlled by Acts of Parliament, and I am afraid that this year it must inevitably amount to nearly £15.000,000. . This expenditure added to the £32,000,000 for "" War Services"" and £1,000,000 for ""Additions, New Works and Buildings,"" not including defence, makes a total of £48,000,000. we have an irreducible expenditure upon ""Defence."" of any Government to properly defend its citizens. announced a reduction of the Defence expenditure by something like £1,800,000, but we can go no further in this direction without a deliberate breach of the trust placed on our shoulders. Our expenditure on ""Defence"" will be, at least, £4,700,000, bringing the total expenditure to £52,700,000. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. lunch I was dealing with a statement. I had made, and which had been challenged by the honourable member for amount in respect to which economies [21] could be effected in the expenditures of the Commonwealth. I had given figures 1 for war services, new works and buildThe principal item, of ings, special appropriations, and defence, which total £52,700,000. There is one other item that falls within the ordinary departmental votes, and that relates to the Department of the Postmaster-General. During last year that Department spent £7,758,000. Allowing* for the greatest reduction conceivable, that expenditure could not be brought down to less than £7,500,000, seeing that the servioe is producing a revenue of over £9,300,000 per annum.. If we add that total to the figure I have given, we have a grand total of £60,200,000. Our total expenditure last year was £65,118,265. I think, therefore, that my honourable friend will agree with me that I had at ' Upon ""Additions, New least some basis for the statement. I made. and Buildings"" we spent I have given these figures at this stage because I think they will enable honourable members to form their own views as to Ihe possibilities of bhis very much discussed question of the reduction of the governmental expenditures of the Commonwealth to-day. I have looked very closely into the matter, and without foreshadowing in any way what I propose to Expenditure say. or do when I present the Budget, I point ont that the Government in this regard is in very much the same position as that of every private trading concern in Australiaat the present time. Owing to the war and the causes which followed from it, the expenses of every business in Australia to-day have been Then enormously increased. I am safe in saying that there is scarcely a business It is the task which, after it has made every possible reduction in its outgoings, could show a profit at all if it had to rely on its preWe have already war basis of turnover. The-position of the Commonwealth is very much the same, and we are not helping the people of Australia by trying to indicate that our financial salvation can be brought about simply by a reduction of governmental expenditure. The only solution is to be found in an increase in OUT national turnover, a greater prosperity throughout the country, and a broadening of the basis on which the necessary taxatiou has to be collected.

163,Mr Greene,"The Government wasposition, and that he was promptly nominated by his company for a position in the new company. To the Government that appears to be a distinct and definite breach of the spirit of the agreement into which we entered. It was the intention of the Government, as it was that of the Committee, and, I believe, of the agreement itself, that the seventh director should not be a man either associated directly with the Government, or associated directly with the company, but a man taken from the community as a whole, who could be regarded as an entirely independent person. I may say that the making of this appointment came with as great a shock to the Government as it came to the House. We learned of it only quite recently. The Government, however, is giving notice to the company that in no circumstances whatever can it consent to the nomination of Sir Thomas Hughes. With that, for the time being, I leave the matter. Honourable members will appreciate the significance of what I have said. While there is no doubt that, according to a strict legal interpretation of the agreement, Sir Thomas Hughes has been legally appointed, we say quite definitely that we cannot accept his nomination. The subject-matter of the amendment which has been moved by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) is highly important, and the honourable member is to be commended for bringing it before the House. He has been subjected to severe criticism, but I venture to say that the verdict of the public will be that he has done a work of much importance to the community. The luncheon adjournment to-day seems to have come most opportunely from the point of view of the Government. Before we adjourned the Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) was put up to reply on behalf of the Government to the honourable member for Batman. During the discussion of the very important point with which the Acting Leader of the House( Mr Greene) has just dealt, I asked the Treasurer, by way of interjection, what it was proposed to do in regard to Sir Thomas Hughes' appointment. I received no answer. We were practically allowed to believe that the view of the Government was that the appointment had been made in accordance with the agreement, and, consequently, had to stand. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) subsequently renewed the attack. He put two or three very pertinent questions to the Treasurer, but did not elicit any satisfactory answer. Evidently, during the adjournment for lunch the Government, recognising the position in which they had been placed, decided that their Acting Leader should make a speech as soon as the House resumed, explaining their attitude. It is most unusual for two Ministers to follow each other in a debate of this kind. That, however, is what occurred this afternoon, and the object was apparently to -cover up the true position. It is a new system.' -tea m work. had the Minister who is temporarily leading the Government in this House following another member of the Government, and saying that they were unaware of this appointment of a seventh director until it was brought out to-day. that the Government had only learned of it quite recently. they not take the House into their confidence, and state at once what they were going to do? Why did they wait until a member of another place had addressed a question to a member of the Government, and had elicited this information? Why did they wait until the matter was debated in this House before they admitted the importance of this point? Honourable members will recollect that when this matter was brought before the House' on a previous occasion, we on this side took exception to the proposal. The Prime Minister brought the agreement to the House, and moved that it be accepted. He and his Government were prepared to enter into that arrangement with Amalgamated Wireless Limited for a system of direct wireless communication with Great Britain, the Commonwealth to find £500,000. The agreement provided also-and this is a point I par' ticularly desire to stress-that the company should have four-sevenths of the representation on the directorate. I pointed out that and other defects, notably that no provision was being made for the taking over of the Commonwealth's existing wireless property. .

I do not mean anything offensive by that. House a draft agreement which the Committee found was loosely drawn and unsatisfactory and did not safeguard the interests of the Commonwealth. Now, after the Committee have reported and recommended an improved agreement, the Government have entered into a contract with the company. I desire to know the reason for all this haste. The Government, were, for some reason, very anxious to ratify the agreement, and we were told by the honourable member for Batman today that Amalgamated Wireless Limited is 'linked up with other companies. We had not that information before, and I believe that if the House had known that other companies were involved it would not, by a majority, of six votes, have resolved that the Government should have power to act on the finding of the Committee without reference to Parliament. that time that the Prime Minister had brought this project hack from London. that, and also that the Prime Minister was pushing very hard to get the agreement through in the last hours of the session. What satisfaction is it to the House to find now, after the exposure by the honourable member for Batman, that Sir Thomas Hughes, the former chairman of the company, has been appointed the seventh director, s6 that, whilst the Commonwealth finds £500,000 of the total capital of £1,000,000 for the purpose of what Ministers have admitted to be merely an experiment in wireless telegraphy, the company have been given the majority of representation on the directorate for which they asked in the first place? The Acting Leader of the House has said that He will challenge the appointment that has been made. That is the very thing that I wish to suggest to the House. What have the Government done in regard to this matter? say that there were almost insuperable know, the Minister's promise of investidifficulties in the way of getting an indegation is merely a smoke screen in order pendent chairman? to believe that that was so. But probably during the lunch hour the Government held a Cabinet meeting; they saw the weakness of the position, and how the But he had brought before the Commonwealth has been committed in respect of a liability of £500,000, and finding themselves in a tight corner, they resolved to tell the House that they would probe the whole matter. The country has a right to be thankful for one result from the amendment moved' by the honourable member for Batman, and it is that' the Government are at last stirred into activity, and will do something to safeguard the financial interests of the Commonwealth. ment of the Leader of the House means the cancellation of the agreement. it does; the House should have a definite statement upon that point. I doubt whether the Leader of the House dare go so far as that in the absence of the Prime Minister. This matter is worthy of the closest consideration. The Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) implied that the' Government were powerless in .this matter, inasmuch as the company had acted within the terms of the agreement that had emanated from the Committee, and which the House had empowered the Government to accept. If that is so, there is only one thing for the Government to do. If the company have acted within the terms of the agreement, the Government should repudiate it , and say that they find they have been "" taken in,"" and that the 'interests of the Commonwealth are not safeguarded. I ask the Minister in charge of the House whether he will give an 'assurance that the Government will cancel this agreement if Sir Thomas' Hughes is not removed from the position of chairman 1 member think that this debate should be adjourned until Wednesday next? journed beyond Wednesday so that honourable members may have an opportunity of perusing printed copies of the whole of the evidence and reports.

If ever good work has been done in this country, it has been in the discussion of the matters that have been brought before the House within the last few weeks. The Treasurer said that the people outside will notice what is happening. They will; if the majority of honourable members will not take notice, at any rate the people outaide will get information that they did not possess formerly as to the way in which the affairs of the country are being conducted at the present time.

As I cannot move that the debate be adjourned, I ask leave to continue my remarks on Wednesday next, or that the Government will agree to an adjournment. this matter forward in the public interest, and it has been disclosed beyond all shadow of doubt that there is a danger to the finances of the Commonwealth. However, I have not succeeded in my request that the debate be adjourned. member refused? I did not succeed, and that, in view of the refusal of the Government, honourable members should be prepared to take a firm stand. Are they going to permit this agreement to be ratified without demanding further information? It is useless for honourable members on the other side to shelter themselves behind the Government. A mistake has been made, and one which may piove very serious and costly. Honourable members are the custodians of the publio weal. I ask them if they are going to be browbeaten and suppressed upon this vital question 1 Is this a matter to be glossed,over or rushed through? rushed through; the honourable member may be quite sure of that! jority of honourable members are of the same view. the subject cannot be too urgently emphasized The country is about to be involved in an expenditure of £500,000 at a time when honourable members.are pointing to financial stress, and urging the need for greater economy than ever. Here is a semi-private concern, an enterprise as to which there is grave doubt whether it will pay. If it were certainly a paying proposition the Government would not be invited-indeed , they would nob be given a chance-to put up half-amillion of public money. Private interests would see to it that they ran the whole ""show"" themselves and retained all the profits. The Government have asked Parliament to ratify this outlay of £500,000. If the project proves a success the publio will reap the benefit; but, if it turns out a failure, the Commonwealth, which cannot afford to lose money, will not only lose but will have the added bitter knowledge that the sum has been thrown away;in a semi-private venture. The Treasurer has admitted that the whole scheme is in the nature of an experiment. There is nothing assured or successfully demonstrated in the proposition for wireless connection with the outside world. Wireless is in its infancy. The money of the people will be employed in experimental development. The Government are averse from the continuathe honourable tion or establishment of State enterprises, however profitable they may be. On the one hand they are now proposing to dispose of the Commonwealth Woollen Cloth Factory at Geelong; and, on the other, they are prepared, to put £500,000 of the people's money into a risky semi-public enterprise, the control of which, however, the Government may actually agree to place in the hands of the representatives of private interests upon the directorate. If honourable members are going to be content with the Government repudiation of the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes they will still be blameworthy; they will not have done their duty in the direction of safeguarding the public interest.
