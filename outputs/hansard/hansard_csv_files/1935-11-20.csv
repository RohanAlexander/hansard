0,"House Of Representatives. Wednesday, 80 November, 1035. The Chair At 2.30 P.m., And Read Prayers. Mr E. F. Harrison","Has the Minister for Commerce noticed the comments of Mr Dunningham, a mcmbei of the Now South Wales Ministry, in relation to the quality of Australian goods marketed in Great Britain? Do those comments agree with the recent strictures of Sir Stanley Argyle? that Mr Dunningham's statements dealt particularly with the advertising of Australian products overseas. Only. a month or six weeks ago, Mr T. Flood Plunkett, chairman of the Dairy Produce Export Control Board, returned to Australia from a long visit to England, which he made for the purpose of investigating the whole position. I quote the following, in regard lo advertising, from the report made to the board by Mr Plunkett :It would hi; impossible to set out in thia report thu benefits Australian producers receive from the publicity organization under the management of Mr A: E. Hyland. I can definitely say that I wus surprised at the good work accomplished and the splendid feeling created amongst distributors. Tlie number of shops now stocking and selling our products as Australian is growing from year to year, anil the reports received when making inspections justify the credit given to Mr ITyland and his staff for fhe splendid work done in widening the distribution of our various products. Mr Plunkett suggested that a further sum should be made available for this purpose. Additional provision, amounting to £10,000, has been made in this year's estimates, and that is being supplemented by further sums which are being provided by the Dairy Produce Export Control Board, the Apple and Pear Board, and the Dried Fruits Board. The opinion of Mr Plunkett, who is closely associated with the matter, is probably the best obtainable. of the Minister for Commerce been drawn to the fact that the amount of £90.000 allocated hy New Zealand for trade publicity purposes in Great Britain is, on a population basis, far iu excess of that allotted by Australia? If so, will the matter he considered with a view to. placing Australian products in Great Britain on at least an equal basis with other Empire products? Mr T. Flood Plunkett on his investigation regarding the organization of marketing of Australia dairy produce overseas statesSplendid results arc being obtained from the publicity methods employed by Mr A.

OIL EROM COAL AN D SHALE. Times yesterday published the statement by the Minister for Defence that the establishment in Australia of a plant for the extraction of oil from coal and shale would give employment to about 3,400 persons, would use approximately 800,000 tons of coal a year, and would produce from 50,000,000 to 60,000,000 gallons of excellent quality petrol at an estimated cost of Is. Id. a gallon. Will the honourable member undertake to do everything possible to establish this industry . in Australia, thereby assisting unemployed miners and taking a step in the right direction for tlie future defence of this country? the request of the Prime Minister, I received a deputation ou this subject, and made the remarks the substance of which the honourable member has given. I havo not seen the report which appeared in the Canberra Times. A full report of the deputation is being prepared, and will be submitted to the Prime Minister and the Minister in charge of Development, to whoso department the matter particularly relates. I assure the honourable member that every consideration will be given to the representations of the deputation in view of the importance of the matter. HOMH-OONSUMPTION PKIOE .

Heincident having been closed with his apology, did not prevent the honourable member from proceeding to take whatever steps he considered desirable, within cast upon him. the limits of the Standing Orders, for the purpose of preventing the honourable member for Barker from proceeding with his remarks. seems to me that the Chairman was, to some extent, irritated by what had occurred, and naturally was inclined to deem the action of the honourable member for Batman, in moving the closure when the honourable member for Barker was speaking, to be conduct not in keeping with proper procedure, but the honourable member for Batman was clearly within his rights in following the course he took. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) has been askod to indicate what the Chairman said the honourable member for Batman actually did subsequent to the withdrawal of the motion for his suspension. That is a point which must b«s satisfactorily cleared up. Were any remarks made to which exception could be taken? Did the honourable members speak disrespectfully to the Chair? Of course he did not, otherwise his disorderly remarks would have been recorded in Hansard, although, for my part, I do not desire to adhere rigidly to the Hansard report of the incident. 1 have referred to the atmosphere in which it arose, the circumstances under which the call was given to the honourable member for Barker, the application of the guillosorted to in order to prevent that honortine, and the naming of the honourable member for Batman, which closed with his apology, and I have stated my belief that he was perfectly within his rights in taking whatever action was open to him. The action he took, that of moving that the honourable member for Barker be not further heard, did not warrant auy further reflection upon him. We are all human, and in certain circumstances are liable to become irritated. Probably the Chairman of Committees thought that the honourable member for Batman was not entitled to take the course adopted by him. On the other hand, I consider that the honourable member had a perfect right to do what he did. Any honorahle member might have acted similarly, and, therefore, I say again that the conduct of the honourable member for Batman was in conformity with the Standing Orders, and. did not warrant any reflection heing ringah-Minister for Defence) [3.7] I was present during this incident, as I It had been during the whole of the sitting when the Sanctions Bill was under consideration, and I have a clear recollection of what took place, but it differs materially in some respects from that of the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley). It seems to me that members of the Opposition consider that, when the guillotine has been applied they have a right to a monopoly of the rest of the time available for discussion of a measure. I agreed with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) across the table that, so far as possible, honourable members who had not already spoken should be called. I had no communication with the Chairman of Committees on the subject, hut that was the general understanding between us, and I think the Leader of the Opposition will agree with me on that point. When the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) was given the call, the opinion was held by the Opposition that that understanding was not being observed, and, in my opinion, deliberate obstruction was reable member from speaking. This resulted, in the end, in the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) being named, he having very cleverly endeavoured, by points or order, and hy the exercise of various other artifices, to prevent the honourable member for Barker from being heard. In that object he succeeded, and he was named hy the Chairman. The Minister for Commerce (Dr. Earle Page) was in the House, and gave the honourable member for Batman an opportunity to withdraw what he had said and apologize. This was done, and there this particular incident closed. I now come to the aspect of the matter on which I differ from the honorahle member for West Sydney. The disorder continued.

What took place subsequently was that the honourable member for Barker proceeded with his speech, and I did not hear any uproar, nor did I notice any interference upon the part of the honourable member for Batman. withdrawing and apologizing twice, before tlie suspension motion was by leave withdrawn, the honourable member for Batman had persisted in his offence, I question very much, in. the then temper of the Chairman of Committees, whether he would have viewed such an interruption with any tolerance. I am quite confident that the committee would not have tolerated it. For my part, I heard no remarks whatever from the honourable member for Batman. In any case, the whole episode had ended. But a week later, on an entirely different matter, this episode of the 7th November, which had heen completely closed, was revived by the Chairman of Committees as a reason for persisting in naming another honourable member of the committee. the honorahle member for Batman! The Chairman had no .right to drag up the episode of a week previous unquestionably to reflect, further on the general conduct of the honourable member for Batman, when he was dealing with the disordeiiiness of another honourable member. It is unfortunate that this matter has reached the present stage, and there is undoubtedly a conflict of opinion on what took plaee. If the statement made by the Chairman of Committees yesterday be correct, undoubtedly the honourable member for Batman offended after having heen named. But I submit that, if he so offended, it is certain, in my opinion, that the Chairman would again have named him, because the Chairman was very reluctant to permit the Minister for Commerce to withdraw the motion After this moved, which would have involved the suspension of the honourable member. I have no knowledge whatever of the honourable member having persisted in any : further offensive conduct. It is true that he moved a motion which the Standing Orders entitled him to move; and if we look back on the matter impartially, we shall see that the honourable member for Batman set himself to comply strictly with the Standing Orders and, rather than interject, moved a motion which was the appropriate procedure for him to follow. The fact that the Chairman of If , after immediately Committees a week later drew attention to the matter which, so far as he was concerned, had closed seven days -earlier could lead honourable members to draw no other inference than that it was his intention to reflect upon the conduct of the honourable member for Batman. There was no occasion for the Chairman to reflect upon the honorahle member, or, for that matter, upon any otlier honourable member, when dealing with the second occurrence of disorderly conduct. I regret that the matter has reached the stage it has, and I believe that if the Chairman of Committees would state that he had no intention to reflect unduly upon",17,Bkennan

To sum up, the honourable member for Batman feels that his parliamentary reputation has been besmirched by the reference which the Chairman of Committees made to an incident which had closed a week earlier. He had no opportunity to call for a retraction by the Chairman of Committees. I exonerate the Chairman of Committees from any deliberate intention to reflect on the honourable member for Batman when he. used the words complained of iby that honourable member, and therefore I suggest that the fact that he inadvertently did so might be sufficient justification for his rising and saying that he had no such intention. If the Chairman of Committees does that, I think that the honourable member for Batman will be satisfied. General) [3.21] I regret that I am unable to contribute to the controversy any account of what took place in committee on the 7th November, as I was not in the chamber on the occasion referred to. I do want, however, briefly to direct the attention of honourable members to the terms of the motion now before the HouseThat, in tlie opinion of this House, the Chairman of Committees ( Mr J. H. Prowse)', on the 14th instant, offended against the privileges of the Parliament by reflecting from his place as Chairman of Committees on the conduct in Parliament of an honourable member, in terms which were not in accordance with the facts nor .on other grounds justifiable. mentary procedure will make it clear that Time has not permitted me to make an exhaustive examination of one of the most difficult and obscure questions of parliamentary procedure, but I take leave to doubt whether any question of privilege arises here at all. As honorahle members know, the Standing Orders of this House do not give any definition of "" privilege,"" and so we are remitted to the practice' of the House of Commons. In the tenth edition of May an endeavour is made to sum up the various grounds on which a question of privilege may be based. I ask the House to <be patient while I read from page 69Breaches of privilege may be divided into: (1) disobedience to general orders or rules of either House; (2) disobedience to particular orders; (3) indignities offered to the character or proceedings of Parliament; (4) assaults or insults upon members, or reflections upon their character and. conduct in Parliament; or interference with officers of the House in discharge of tlieir duly. Honourable members will have noticed the phrase "" reflections upon their character and conduct in Parliament"", which appears to cover the case set up hy the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan). But a perusal of the succeeding pages of May will indicate clearly that all the individual instances on which that general statement is based are instances in which persons outside Parliament have reflected on the conduct and character of persons inside Parliament. In other wordsI speak subject to correction-ever y case that has been treated as an instance of a breach of privilege by the House of Commons is one in which some one outside Parliament has done or 3aid. something which has been taken to impair the privileges of Parliament in relation to the rest of the world. Mr ""WABD -The House of Commons has never had a Chairman of Committees like ours. member for East Sydney interjects again I shall name him. gested here is that, by reason of something that has occurred inside Parliament, there has been a breach of privilege. I am at a loss to understand what privilege can be said to have been interfered with. Any authority on parliaevery member of Parliament enjoys the privilege of free speech. If it be that the honourable member for Batman alleges that the privilege of free speech which he should enjoy has been interfered with, I point out that the privilege of free speech is a privilege as against the people outside Parliament. Every member of Parliament is privileged to say what he likes in Parliament, and to enjoy immunity in relation to any proceedings which may be instituted by persons outside Parliament. But it does not follow that a member of Parliament has the privilege of unlimited free speech inside Parliament itself. Indeed, we have restricted that privilege by providing",18,Bkennan

A member who abuses his privilege may be called to order by the Chair, aud dealt with either by the Chair or by the House. Should the ruling of the Chair not be acceptable to the House, it may be disagreed with by following the appropriate procedure. In this case, I am not in a position to determine who is right on the facts, because, unhappily, no one who has spoken has been cross-examined. Consequently, I should feel tremendously embarrassed if I had, as a member of a jury, to decide this question. Some honourable members might feel more embarrassed if they were cross-examined, but I cannot go into that now. culty is in understanding how it can be said that, on the facts that have been alleged here, any honourable member has been deprived of some privilege which may rightly be described as a privilege of Parliament. Remembering my proposition that, primarily, parliamentary privilege is a privilege against the world, I can conceive of only one case in which it might he said to be an internal privilege. deprive honourable members of their lights within the Standing Orders were indulged in, then it might be said that a question of privilege inside Parliament had arisen. here? In his version of the incident, the honourable member for Batman did not say that he was prevented from speaking. On the contrary, he said he did not speak. He did not say that he wanted to exercise some right as a member of Parliament, and that the Chairman prevented him from exercising it. made a rude observation to him. the action of the Chairman of Committees was defamatory. ber agrees that he was not prevented from doing anything which it is alleged a member of Parliament ought t.o be permitted to do. observation of a defamatory nature was made by the Chairman. been in this Parliament very long, but I have had some experience of other parliaments, and have heard many defamatory remarks. Does the honourable member for Batman go to the point of sayiug that each of those defamatory remarks constitutes a breach of the privileges of Parliament? That a defamatory remark constitutes disorderly conduct I am prepared to agree, but that it constitutes a breach of the privileges of 1 Parliament I am at a loss to understand. Indeed, as I have said, one of the most cherished privileges of Parliament, as against the world, is to be able to offer defamatory remarks without let or hindrance. lai order to reach a decision on this quesMy diffition of privilege, it is not necessary for honourable members io give their versions of the incidents which led up to its submission, as they should easily reach a verdict on statements made at the time by the Chairman of Committees ( Mr Prowse). Those remarks constitute a greater reflection on the Chairman himself than cm the honourable member for Batman( Mr Birennan) and, if he could have them excised from Hansard, he would he doing If conduct calculated to -himself a favour. The honourable gentleman is reported by Hansard to have said on 'the 14th NovemberI named an honourable member from thia Chair last week. He offered a humble apology, But what are the facts and its acceptance wus recommended by the Chair: but that honourable member immediately proceeded to impede the progress of business after his apology had been accepted. Honourable members will see in that statement a reflection by the Chairman on himself. He said that the honourable member for Batman had offended, had been named, and had apologized, and then All he said was that the Chairman admitted 'that he had allowed him to continue to impede the committee. Honourable members will realize that, if the honourable member for Batman had continued to impede 'tlie progress of 'the committee, he would have suffered the consequences of his actions. The Chaiirman was watching him as a cat watches a mouse, and he would have seized the first opportunity again to name the honourable gentleman if He says that an he had transgressed a second time. The report in Hansard of the Chairman's I have not statement convicts him and no need exists to consider what I think might have happened.

This matter, however, should be judged on its merits, and not on party Lines. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) said 'that he could not make up his mind. [ should like to know what he meant when he repeated the remarks ascribed to th« Chairman of Committees. Isi t not has opinion that, if the Chairman were correct in his version of the occurrences Which led up to the naming of the honourable member for Batman, he should have named him a second time for the second offence ? what the Chairman should have done. the alleged offences, the Chairman acted so leniently as to let the honourable member get away with offensive conduct to the Chair, why did he, a week later, voice his spleen ? Obviously the incident was irritating him and he took an opportunity to relieve his feelings at the expense of the honourable member for Batman. An impartial reading of Che few lines, recorded in Hansard, of the Chairman's remarks must lead to the conclusion that the Chairman is convicted out of his own mouth. ( Mr Menzies) does not need to cross examine anyone as it will not overtax his powers of analysis to decide that if the honourable member for Batman had continued to give offence to the Chair after having been named once he would have been named again and suspended from the service of the committee. [3.36] -The debate has shown that if there is any injured party it is myself and not the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan). A perusal of the Hansard report of the period under review will show that the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway), who spoke before me for fifteen minutes, occupy two pages. I spoke for 20 minutes, and the Hansard record of that period occupies less than a the incident, not because he was just to page and a half of which 34 lines are attributed to me. I disagree with the contention made by members of the Opposition at that time that by speaking I had taken rights from them. It has been explained to me that the call alternates between the two sides o.f the House. When the honorahle member for Melbourne Ports resumed his seat, 1 was the only member on this side of the House to rise. Accordingly I received the call. Honourable members on this side of the chamber will support me in that. The purpose for which I rose was to reply in committee to three points made against the Government in the debate on the second reading. ber put up by the Government to reply on its behalf? only reason for my speaking was as 1 have stated. I realize tliat such a small incident as the one to which exception has been taken may result in the wounding of pride, but the extent of thai wounding depends on the amount ol' pride with which a man is endowed. On active service a self-inflicted wound is. never recorded in the casualty list, bin is always recorded in the pay book of tinsold ier when a fine is imposed for the offence. That is exactly the position which is occupied to-day hy the honourable member for Batman. If he i -' suffering, it is the suffering from a selfThe Attorney-General inflicted wound. Honourable members will recall that when I rose to speak J was subjected to a great many interjections and interruptions from the Opposition. Honourable members opposite contended that I was usurping something which I should have left to some one else. They villined me, and the honourable member for Batman declared that he would prevent me from delivering the speech. I replied that, whether. he interrupted or not, I would deliver it. He persisted in interrupting, and after making incessant interjections he was good enough to quote to the Chair thfStanding Order that an honourable member who interrupts the work of the committee is open to correction by the Chair.

If it were any other honourable member I should say that he was guilty of sustained and deliberate obstruction, but the honourable member is too angelic in temperament to indulge in anything like that. and the sweetest, charity he could never be guilty of sustained obstruction. I am loth to enter too deeply into this ing, as I do, my privilege of speaking argument for I remember that such a discussion, in the nature of things, has repercussions. A man who chops wood must, expect to make chips. But the scone that occurred in the committee that night arose in circumstances which should make the honourable member for Batman it. that causes interstate visitors in the galleries of the House to return to their homes with the idea that the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah would be too lenient for the occupants, for the time being, of seats in this chamber. Such conother honourable member on this side of duct is bringing the parliamentary institution into disrepute throughout the Commonwealth. Those are hard words, but I believe not only that they are true, but also that the honourable members of the Opposition, generally speaking, know in their heart of hearts that they are true. The whole argument hinges upon whether, after the honourable member for Batman was permitted to apologize the second time, he continued to interrupt the proceedings of the committee, and my recollection-and I have a very good memory, I believe-is that he did do so. If anything surprised me in connection with tlie incidents of that night, it was that the Chair did not deal with the honourable member a second time for what took place after he was named. I know that I am probably taking a great risk in daring to disagree with the view of the honourable member for Batman. As one who has read history, I recollect reading about a great Irishman, Cardinal Cullen, of whom it is said that no one dared contradict him in his life-time, and no one cared to write his biography after his death. honour to be an Irishman. that the honourable member will noi adopt the attitude that his actions alone are not to be questioned by honourable members on this side of the chamber. My part in the incidents of that evening Pursuing the purest virtue can be easily described. I was absolutely unaware of any tacit understanding between the Government and the Opposition iu regard to that discussion. Prizin this chamber, I would not willingly deprive any member of the Opposition of the right to express his views, particularly on such an important matter as that, which was then before the Chair. But considering that honourable members who support the Government had not risen the last member to refer to as frequently as they were entitled to do It was an incident of the kind to take part in the debate, I rose in my place to address the committee. Any criticism that the Opposition can level against me for exercising my privilege is also a criticism of the Chair. The Chairman was entitled to call me or any the chamber. It is the Chairman's sole right to make the call, and unless what I understand to be the practice in this Parliament is to be departed from-that is, that two members shall not he called in succession from one side of the chamber if an honourable member on the other side wishes to speak-the Chairman was justly entitled to call me. Eeferring now to the second incident, I saw and heard what took place. But it is not my desire to discuss that aspect of the subject. I am not able to determine what was behind the mind of the Chairman when he made the references of which the honourable member for Batman has complained. I am, however, able to say, from the very statements of the honourable member for Batman himself, that when I commenced to make my speech, he intended to prevent me from proceeding with it. I must say, with great respect +0 the honourable member, 'that his success on that occasion was one of the very few successes of his parliamentary career.

The honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) has given a fairly cleaT description of what occurred, but I do -not agree with his deductions. the facts. honourable member for Barker received the call from the Chain, we, on this side of the committee, objected, because o.f the agreement that had been made, and the honourable member for Batman( Mr wished to uphold 'the authority of the Brennan) interjected in She course of the proceedings with .the result that the Chairman called him to order and named him. The honourable member for Batman then apologized. In the meantime, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) had asked the Chair to exercise leniency towards the honourable member for Batman. Later, when the honourable member for Barker endeavoured to address the Chair, the honorahle member for Batman book every means afforded him by the procedure of the committee to prevent the speech from being made. As a matter of fact, the Chairman made two errors that evening. On the first occasion, he accused me of having used a word which I did not use and asked me to withdraw it. I do not know that I blame the Chairman altogether for what happened, but the fact is that he accused me of having used the word "" rooking "", whereas the word I actually used was "" fooling "". The honourable member for the word "" fooling "", and so did 'the honortion with members of the Labour party able member for Hume( Mr Collins), to whom the word was directed. When I was requested to withdraw the word ""fooling"", I did so, but the Chairman made -a mistake in saying that I used the word ""'rooking"", and he actually named me for using a word that I did not use. "" I will name the honourable member."" did not open my mouth when later the Chairman named me. It is apparent, therefore, that there was something very wrong. No doubt the Chairman was irritated. that I have ever named the honourable member for Cook( Mr Garden). "" I will name the honourable member for Cook."" so, the fact [remains that I did not open When the my miou'bh. It is out of those incidents bhat the trouble arose which is the subject matter of bhis discussion.

I know that I personally take every opportunity that I have, at times, to express myself. Sometimes I am right and sometimes I am wrong. But I believe that what was done that night was not intended to discredit the honourable member for Batman and was no reflection upon him. If the Chairman admits that his sole intention was to uphold his authority over the proceedings of the committee, the whole incident could have been passed over without trouble, and there would be no occasion for tbe moving of this motion of privilege. pose merely to describe the incident that happened on that particular evening just as I witnessed it. Immediately the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) was named he sat down and, so far as I could see from my position in the House, he practically turned his hack on the Chair, and entered into conversaof New South Wales. The subsequent disorder was such that the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) could not have heard one word the honourable member for Batman said. Thus, he was not on sound ground when he challenged the House yesterday to contradict his Batman did not utter a single sentence",22,Bkennan

102,Mr Lane (Barton) [3.50],"I proafter apologizing to the Chair, because at that stage there was a continued uproar among members of the Labour party of New South Wales, in which the honourable member for Batman joined with the object of interfering with the honorahle member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron). 1 myself heard the honourable member for Batman say to the honourable member for Barker, "" I will not allow you to speak "". has just said that no one could have heard what the hono/rable member for Batman said at that time. for Batman made that declaration before he was named. Immediately after the incident he repeated the threat; and, as honourable members generally are aware, the honourable member for Barker could not continue his speech, because of the uproar created by the honourable member foiBatman and members of the Labour party of New South Wales. 1 am astonished that any honourable member should try to excuse the behaviour of the honourable member for Batman. It is useless for the honourable member to come in posing as a wounded animal. He is a clever and a very subtle lawyer; he does things quietly. I assure him that, had I been in the place of the honourable member for Barker, he would not have prevented ine from speaking. When the honourable member for Batman declares that injury has been done to his political name by this episode, I remind him that if any such injury has been clone he still retains the reputation he has carried throughout his political life. When he desires to interfere with other honourable members, the honourable member for Batman can get away with a lot of things, because he is a lawyer and knows how to handle a situation under the Standing Orders without getting into trouble himself. I emphasize that the Chairman of Committees acted very leniently towards him on this particular occasion, and the attitude now adopted by the honourable member for Batman appears to me to be a case of biting the hand that fed him. He has attacked the Chairman of Committees, but I claim that the Chairman should have named the honourable member again; he should not have allowed the honourable member to present himself again in the House for the remainder of that sitting. I hope the House will reject the motion. The honourable member for Batman himself abused the privileges of the House and deliberately prevented the honourable member for Barker from speaking. In doing that he associated himself with members of the Labour party of New South Wales, among whom he appears to exercise a sort of semileadership. When in doubt about procedure, those honourable gentlemen promptly look to him as a lawyer and ask him what to do next. On this particular night he led them gallantly in abusing the privileges of the House by creating uproar. 1 oppose the motion. The honourable member for Barton( Mr Lane) has provided the strongest argument in favour of the case of the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), He accepted the challenge made by the lin) in this House yesterday, and declared that it was impossible for the honourable member for Yarra, owing to the uproar then taking place, to hear anything said by the honourable member for Batman, yet he now asks us to believe that he himself heard a statement made at that particular time by the honourable member for Batman, although he was seated much further away from the honourable member for Batman than was the honourable member for Yarra. I agree with the statement made by the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) that the honourable member for Batman told him he would not get a hearing. When the honourable member for Batman rose to a point of order that a tacit understanding had been arrived at between the Government and the Opposition that those who had not already spoken on the measure would be given an opportunity to do so in committee, the Chairman ruled, rightly in my opinion, that a point of order did not arise; and if the honourable member for Barker had then proceeded to make his speech instead of defying the honourable member for Batman to stop him, he would have had an opportunity of continuing. member for Batman do?",23,Bkennan

Many appointments are made for a term of seven years. In some cases the period is not specified, and the appointment continues until it is terminated. term are the tribunals under the Repatriation Act appointed? of the Commissioner of Patents is not specified, while that of the Commissioner of Taxation is seven years. I emphasize the point that the proposal contained in the clause would not permit the making of a new appointment for a period exceeding three years. Reappointment should be for any period up to seven years. I ask honourable members to agree to the clause so that the Government may appoint the Commissioner for War Service Homes, who has given valuable and capable service, for a period greater than three years. Attention having been called to the slate of the committee, Opposition is obstructing this bill is a shame. It is deliberate obstruction. [Quorum formed.] Mr Chairman, to what I regard as an offensive statement by the Minister, to the effect that the way in which the Opposition is deliberately obstructing this This hill provides that when the War bill is a shame. I ask that that remark be withdrawn. If the Minister made the remark, he Reappointments must withdraw it. that in my opinion it was deliberate obstruction of the bill. If any honourable member takes exception to it, I withdraw it. I was explaining that the intention of this amendment is to enable the re 1 appointment of the Commissioner for War Service Homes to be made for a period not exceeding seven years. In a position such as that dealing with the administration of the War Service Homes Department, which embraces the whole of the Commonwealth, considerable time is agree to the alteration from needed to make contact and become conversant with the operations of the aet in the different States. The officer who discharges these functions being a single commissioner, I am definitely of the opinion that it is desirable to appoint him for a reasonable term. Continuity of policy is a valuable factor in connection with the administration of such an important department as that now under consideration. It is advisable that the Commissioner should be reappointed for a period not exceeding seven years, as was provided in the original act. That system continued until for administrative purposes it vras deemed advisable that the Commissioner should be appointed for a period of three years, and the act was amended accordingly. The Government is of opinion that after a Commissioner has been in office for three years it should have power to reappoint him for a further period not exceeding seven, years in all. This is not a new principle, and in the interests of the administration of the War Service Homes Commission the amendment should be agreed to. Security of tenure will be given to the person holding the office, who will be able to give even closer attention to his duties than if he were appointed for only three years. poses to appoint the Auditor-General for a period of only three years. perhaps at the expiration of that period he will have reached the retiring age.",28,Quorums

The original act, which provided that the Commissioner should be appointed for a period of seven years, was amended in 1923 to provide that the appointment should be for only three years. The Government now proposes to ensure that the period during which a Commissioner shall serve shall be that provided in the original net. There is a reasonable objection to the Government's proposal, because the Commissioner is not subject to the control of the Minister. When a general, election is approaching, a government, realizing the possibility of defeat, may attempt to ensure continuity of its own policy by appointing a commissioner whose general attitude may not be acceptable to the succeeding ministry. In such circumstances, an appointment covering two parliaments could be made. In 1923, Parliament amended the act to prevent the Ministry of the day tieing the hands of successive ministries. could limit the powers of the Commissioner by amending the act. missioner is appointed for seven years, it is unlikely that Parliament would reduce the term of his appointment. powers of the Commissioner. bility of the Commissioner is, subject to the control of the Minister, to administer the act in detail. The Minister's control, of course, cannot extend to matters of detail. A commission has heen constituted to ensure that there shall be satisthe Minister. Decisions supported by the factory administration in matters of detail. I realize the force of what has been said concerning the desirability of retaining the services of a suitable Commissioner; but if a Commissioner has demonstrated that he is capable of carrying out to the satisfaction of all the important work entrusted to him, there would be no doubt as to his re-appointment. If the proposed amendment is adopted, the government of the day may fasten upon its successors a Commissioner who may carry on his work in the way which may be unsatisfactory to the government then in office. The suggestions of honourable members on this side of the chamber have been submitted, not with the object of obstructing the passage of the hill, but because there are good reasons why the appointment should be made for the period provided in the existing law. posed amendment is unnecessary. [Quorum formed.] If the present War Services Homes Commissioner is a permanent public servant and under the control of the Public Service Board, he is assured of continuity of appointment. I am sure that many purchasers of war service homes who ape dissatisfied with the interpretations of the Commissioner would oppose that ofticer being appointed for a term not exceeding seven years. Before the present Minister assumed control of war service homes, there wo,re many differences of opinion between the Minister and the Commissioner. On several occasions I have objected to his decisions, and have also had great difficulty in obtaining from him a satisfactory interpretation of various provisions in the act. I do not think that there would be expressions of regret if the present Commissioner decided to resign his position. A person holding a similar position who feels that he is secure for seven years may flout the Minister and act contrary to the wishes of those directly concerned. Many purchasers of war service homes have experienced considerable difficulty in obtaining from the Commissioner sympathetic consideration of the proposals they have submitted. If his tenure is somewhat insecure, he may not feel disposed to force his opinions upon Minister on one day have been reversed two days later. I spent nearly a month in getting the Commissioner to give an interpretation of the law, and action which prevented a purchaser of a war service homes being harshly treated was eventually postponed. If the period of appointment is for only three years, and the Commissioner is likely to resign, there are others in the Commonwealth Public Service quite capable to carrying out the duties now undertaken by this officer.",29,Quorums

I think it may be desirable to do so in this case, and, although seven years does appear to be a long period, it is preferable to a term of three years. I shall support the clause. In my few remarks on the second reading of this bill, I definitely stated that I was During the depression, as the economic opposed to this amendment. I take this opportunity of repeating my opposition to it, and, at a iater stage, shall cast ray vote against it. I disagree with the remarks of the honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn) that it is desirable that the term of office of the Commissioner should he extended to seven years. One hesitates to introduce personalities into these matters; but I certainly object to any extension of the period of office of the gentleman now occupying the position of Commissioner. There is no weight in the argument advanced by honourable members that the occupant of this office might, in order to secure re-appointment, allow himself to be unduly influenced by Ministers. Under the act he is obliged to do certain things subject to the direction of the Minister. His position is quite different from that of a chief executive officer in a government instrumentality such as a railway department, water and sever ageboard, and the like. These officers are by statute independent of governments, and are free to exercise their own discretion. But the War Service Homes Commissioner is definitely subject to ministerial direction. He is a public servant in receipt of a classified salary, and. as the honourable member for Dalley( Mr desirable, and it is particularly necessary Rosevear) has said, if his appointment should terminate, he will, provided he has done nothing in the meantime to warrant derating, be transferred to another position in the Public Service of similar grade to that which he occupied prior to his appointment as Commissioner. Thus he will suffer no loss of seniority or digthe period of the appointment would exnity. I am opposed to an extension of the period of office for two reasons: first, This argument might also be used in I do not believe in appointments for a long period-seve n years is altogether too long a period, and it is possible that the Commissioner may develop a tendency to think that he is in office for life; secondly, if the amendment is accepted the term of office of the present Commissioner will be extended for a much longer period. I say quite frankly that I do not think the present occupant of the position gives sympathetic consideration to cases placed before him, and that his administration of the Act is as harsh as it could possibly be. That, at any rate, has been my experience during the last few years. position of the country became more acute, and great hardship was imposed upon the people generally, tlie unsympathetic administration of tlie present Commissioner has stood out in bold relief. For that reason mainly I am opposed to the amendment. If the Government wants to retain the present Commissioner in office for any lengthy period it can continue to re-appoint him while it remains in office. I say, however, that it is not right that any government should extend beyond its own life the period of appointment of an officer in control of a department of this kind which directly gives expression to a policy that is rapidly becoming a vital matter on the hustings, and involves a direct mandate from the people. It seems to me that by appointing the Commissioner for seven years an attempt is being made to place the administration in the hands of an individual who will possibly carry ouf the policy of a government that has been rejected hy the people. [5.6] I entirely agree with the Assistant' Minister( Mr Thorby) that continuity of sound administration is always i-.i the administration of war service homes.

I regret the remarks of the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) regarding the present War Service Homes Commissioner. My suggestion for a reduction of the term of the appointment should not be regarded as a reflection upon that gentleman, for he has carried out his difficult duties faithfully and well honourable member for Lilley( Sir Donald for a number of years. All honourable members have had cases under their notice in which the occupants of war service homes have suffered hardships; but the Commissioner has discharged his diffiorable members have wrongly interpreted cult duties with impartiality, and to the best of his ability. A reduction of the term of the appointment from seven to five years would probably meet the wishes of the majority of the committee. the wishes of the committee in that regard. The Commissioner should not be appointed for so long a period as seven years. His decision is usually final, and appeals to the Minister are useless. Many of us know that the administration of these homes has been anything but satisfactory to the occupants. The Commissioner should not be appointed for more than three years, so that if it were found that he had not discharged his duties fairly he could be replaced at the end of that term. Some shocking cases have come under notice in which the administration has been of a brutal nature. I have no reason to suppose that the occupants of war service homes will receive better treatment in the future than in the past, and I do not consider that the present Minister will be -more sympathetic towards them than his predecessors have been. The Government will, no doubt, appoint a commissioner who will give effect to its harsh policy of administering these homes on even stricter business lines than those followed by private property-owners. Women and children have been evicted from their homes in Hobart, and left on the streets in the snow; yet the party which supports the present Government promised to do everything possible in the interests of returned soldiers and their dependants. I have no doub't that under the policy adopted by this Ministry, the occupants of these homes who cannot afford to meet their commitments will be thrown upon the cold streets. Downs) [5.14] I am pleased to know that the Minister( Mr Thorby) is agreeable to a reduction of the term of the appointment of the commissioner from seven to five years, as suggested by the Cameron). The act now provides for a period of three years, with the right of re-appointment from time to time for a further period of three years; but honthe purpose of th© act in suggesting that these appointments should be reviewed every throe years when a new Parliament is elected. Such a practice would be contrary to that usually adopted in British communities, which have sought to give public servants securityof tenure as opposed to the American system of spoils to the victor. It would be quite wrong to provide that with each change of government a new commissioner should be appointed. Commonwealth and State public servants are entitled to security of tenure, and there should also be continuity of administration. When au officer has served faithfully and well for three years, he has. earned the right to re-appointment. I welcome the intimation by the Minister that he is prepared to make the period of the Conu.uissioner'3 appointment five years instead of seven years as proposed in the bill. The reflections cast upon the present occupant of the position are wholly unwarranted. He has proved himself to be a competent and loyal public servant, and there is no reason to suggest that he would not discharge his duties fairly to all concerned.

In 1929, the Government of the day decided that the provisions of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act would be improved by providing appeal tribunals separate from the ordinary repatriation administration, so that soldiers should have the right of appeal to an entirely independent authority. At that time one Entitlement Appeal Tribunal and two Assessment Appeal Tribunals were appointed. Appeal Tribunal consists of three members. The chairman is one who has been admitted to practise as a barrister or solicitor of the High Court, or of the Supreme Court of a State. One member represents the returned soldiers and the other is a Government nominee. The tribunal decides on appeal from the decision of the commission whether a soldier shall receive a pension. An Assessment Appeal Tribunal, which determines on appeal the rate at which a pension shall be paid, is composed of a chairman, who is nominated by returned soldiers and who has been admitted to practise as a barrister or solicitor of the High Court or of the Supreme 'Court of a State, and of two medical men J/r. Lyons. selected from a panel approved by the Minister and specially experienced in the particular type of disability from which the soldier suffers. Quite recently the Government, actuated by a desire to reduce the number of appeals awaiting hearing, appointed an additional Entitlement Appeal Tribunal for a period of six months. -Since the commission was appointed in 1920, over 250,000 applications for employment were received and dealt with, and approximately 280,000 positions were found for the 264,000 men who returned to Australia. Quite naturally, soldiers injured and unsettled by their war experiences found it extremely difficult to re-enter the routine of civil life, and, consequently, the commission was obliged to find several jobs for the one man. To assist further in obtainment, and rail warrants to the value of £2,388,774 were made available, and, in addition, the Government granted £450,000 to the municipal authorities throughout the Commonwealth to provide employment for returned soldiers. For many years past, an amount of £2,500 has been paid annually to the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia to assist that organization in finding suitable employment for returned men. It is an unfortunate fact that the returned soldier has suffered in common with all other members of the community during the difficult times through The Entitlement which the Commonwealth has passed, but I am sure honourable members will agree that successive governments have' done all in their power to help those who served abroad. For soldiers who enlisted when they were under the age of twenty years and for those who, as a result of injuries received, could not return to their former occupations, a comprehensive scheme of vocational and industrial training was established. Throughout the States, leaders in education and industry advised the commission of the requirements, and trade unions co-operated most heartily with the Government in making the scheme an undoubted success. Practically £5,000,000 was expended in building and equipping proper training institutions, in providing highly qualified and experienced instructors for training soldiers, and for placing in employment over 27,000 who had qualified as wage earners. In addition, night courses were approved in about 46,000 cases, so that those who were employed during the day could increase their efficiency and qualify for positions of greater skill and responsibility with higher rates of pay. One interesting phase of this work was the Industrial Training Scheme. As honourable members w ill readily appreciate, a soldier who had been -withdrawn fro m the industrial world for such a lengthy period, had fallen behind his fellow artisans, and was not up to date in the use of tools or in current commercial practice. In other words, his efficiency had beeu lessened, and to assist him to regain his normal place in the industrial sphere, it was arranged with some industrial concern to employ h i m and pay, say, 40 per cent, of the award rate of wage, the Government, making up the balance of 60 per cent. Thus, even though his efficiency was low, he received the ruling wage for the industry in which he was employed. From time to time his efficiency was re-assessed and eventually the employer paid the f u l l award rate. Training of this nature was of distinct value to the economic life of the community. The commission has made available gifts and loans totalling £1,106,765 for furniture, and £422,000 has been expended in the establishment of businesses, the purchase of stock, live stock, plant, &c. Whilsti n some instances failure resulted, there are to-day many successful business men who commenced operations with the assistance given by the commission. In connection with employment, vocational and industrial training, and the business ventures of the department, there was established a "" problems committee "" to deal with cases of severe ill ness or in j u r y for example, the loss of both, legs or the loss of one leg. and one arm. This committee, which consists of the Deputy Commissioner, a senior medical officer, a business inspector, and at least one sympathetic experienced honorary worker interested in the welfare of returned soldiers, interviewed each applicant for assistance and endeavoured to find employment or businesses within the man's physical powers. The medical aspect of the commission's activities has received particular attention. Associated with the commission in Melbourne is a committee of eminent consulting physicians and surgeons, who assist in the formulation of medical policy and in the determination of difficult medical cases. It is known as the ""medical advisory committee,"" and has numbered amongst its members some of the most noted physicians and surgeons of the southern hemisphere. In each State there is ample hospital accommodation, in hospitals sfaffed,, where possible, by returned soldier doctors, retui'ned war nurses, and returned soldier administrative and other officers. Independent observers have frequently remarked that, as those dealing with the work are appreciative of the hardships suffered by the patients, there has been developed a sympathetic temperament which specially fits them for the work. There are repatriation general hospitals for the treatment of general diseases or illnesses; there are sanatoria in which pulmonary tubercular cases caused by war are treated, and the men instructed in hygiene and health measures; there are ANZAC hostels specially equipped and maintained for those whose injuries are exceptionally severe; there are most, up-to-date artificial limb factories, staffed by highlyqualified and well-trained artisans most of whom are limbless themselves. In these factories are manufactured artificial arms and legs, crutches and walking sticks, surgical appliances and other essentia] aids which, have earned favorable comment from' those who use them., and from other3 who are qualified to express an opinion. These institutions are visited regularly by consulting surgeons and physicians, who also served abroad, and are representative of the leading members of the medical profession of the capital city of each State. The X-ray, pathological, neurological and bio-chemical works are in the hands of highly-qualified and experienced practitioners. Major operations are performed by visiting surgeons, and medical cases are attended to by visiting physician specialists, with the help of the full-time medical staff. In addition to its own hospitals, the commission utilizes State institutions, and hears the expense of treating returned soldier inmates for war disabilities. One feature of the medical organization is worthy of special mention. In over 800 country areas, the commission has .appointed medical practitioners to act as local medical officers. This is most convenient for returned soldiers who may require immediate attention for a war disability; and not infrequently this service has saved life, limb and expense. Some returned soldiers have been so severely injured that their locomotion is confined to wheeled chairs or cots. In order to enable them to obtain a change of environment and some pleasure in life, the commission provides a special recreation allowance of £2 10s. a week, in addition to pension and attendant's allowance. It is possible for a soldier with a wife and three children to receive, by way of pension and allowance, a weekly amount of £10 6s. As an integral part of the medical work, the commission has arranged that widows, widowed mothers and children of those who died as a result of war service shall, at the expense of the commission, become members of a friendly society. In order to ensure the success of this scheme, agreements were entered into with the British Medical Association, the Pharmaceutical Society, and various friendly societies, and I take this opportunity to express publicly the Government's gratitude for the co-operation of those bodies. At the present time, there are about 1,600 in-patients receiving treatment, whilst there are over 17,000 out-patients in attendance. Last year about 40,000 cases were treated, and there were more than 146,000 out-patient attendances at d epar tmen tal ins ti t u tion s. The commission has manufactured over 10..750 artificial legs, at a cost of £194,000; over 1,090 artificial arms, at a cost of £22,000; 132 wheel chairs, at a cost of £19,000; 28,000 pairs of surgical boots, at a cost of £72,000; 77,000 stump socks, at a cost of £12,000; 3,367 pairs of crutches, at a cost of £65,000; and over 75,000 surgical appliances, at Mr Lyons. a cost of £104,000. In addition, 167,000 stock or repair jobs, costing about £183,000, have been carried out by the Commonwealth artificial limb factories. The transportation recreation allowance assists over 100 men, and last year involved the expenditure of over £13,000; while the medical treatment for widows, widowed mothers and orphans cost over £15,000 and assisted about 14,000 cases. From this brief outline, honourable members should feel reassured that medically the war-disabled soldier has been, and is being, well provided for by the Government. opportunity to acquaint Parliament and the people of Australia generally with what is being done for the returned soldiers. restricted in debate. limbs, Mr Speaker will probably tell us to confine our remarks to the bill. limit discussion, but I have taken the opportunity to give information which I thought would be appreciated by all. .1 am proud that Australia is able to do these things as some return for the greai services rendered by its soldiers.

Financial assistance, ranging from 5s. to £2 10s. a week, is made available according to the circumstances of the case and the nature of the training. Moreover, a scheme of apprenticeship, or unindentured apprenticeship, helps considerably to absorb these young people in suitable employment. In addition to the skilled",34,Second Reading

160,Mr Lyons,"On e of the most inartisans and professional students, there is a big group of trainees employed in business and commercial occupations; and whilst these occupations do not call for the manual dexterity of the trades, or for the extended academic knowledge of the professions, they do require specific training and specialized experience. This frequently takes the form of a course in accountancy, secretaryship, economics or commerce. This scheme so far has cost £1,500,000; the expenditure last year exceeded £80,000. Over 13,000 applications have been dealt with and more than 10,000 children have completed their training and are qualified as wage earners. Most of them are in employment. At present, over 2,000 boys and approximately 2,000 girls are at school, whilst over 1,500 are in apprenticeship. 189 are doing professional training, aud 46 are in agricultural training. This scheme has a definite social value and national significance, and is a contribution of incalculable value to the economic life of the community. The Government is grateful to the members of the Education Boards-expert s in primary, secondary, technical, and university education -wh o skilfully and scientifically, in a voluntary and honorary capacity, guide the beneficiaries to ultimate success. I turn now to the war pension aspecr. of repatriation. From time to time we tire prone to criticize the actions of the commission regarding individual cases, largely because we do not appreciate the intricacies of the situation, and do not always bear in mind that the commission must work within the limits of the act. The basic principle underlying any sound system of war pensions is that a pension is made available for a war-caused disability in accordance with the degree of incapacity revealed by a careful and com petent medical examination. The existing act provides a limit beyond which the commission dare not go, but I am convinced from a careful examination of the position that the commission has made a sympathetic attempt to grant claimants the fullest possible measure of relief that tin honest interpretation of the act would permit. An amount exceeding £130,000,000 has been paid in war pensions; last year war pensions expenditure was over £7,369,000. Each fortnight about £280,000 is paid to the war pensioners of the Commonwealth. Each day approximately £20,000 is added to the bill. There are at present about 75,000 soldiers and 1S9,000 dependants receiving pensions. Since the inception of the scheme more than 443,000 applications have been granted, over 57,000 have been rejected, and over 35,000 pensioners have died. The administrative cost for every £100 of pensions paid is £2 2s. 5d., which may be regarded as a very satisfactory figure. One particular section of the rehabilitation scheme of any other country may be more liberal than the corresponding provision in the Australian act, but a comparison of the whole of the benefits availa ble shows that Australia has every reason to be proud of its repatriation effort. The special rate pension of £4 per week is not found in any other legislation, nor is the loss of one eye compensated at such a high rate by Great Britain or any other dominion. The irreducible pension at 100 per cent, rate, and at higher rates for severe sufferers from pulmonary tuberculosis, is not found elsewhere, nor is there such a liberal scheme of allowances for those whose injuries are so severe as to warrant the services of an attendant. I trust that I have shown that wise and helpful provisions have been placed upon the statute-book, and that the well-being of those entitled to benefits for reasons arising out of war service has been carefully safeguarded. The effort may have fallen short of perfection; but, viewed as a whole, in the light of what has been achieved in the face of unprecedented social and financial stress and industrial dislocations, the result must bo regarded as extremely favorable. An endeavour has been made to alleviate the conditions of those who suffered through war service, hut as time progressed it became very evident to those administering the scheme that, suffering some intangible effects, was a. big class which so far had not been catered for. In Canada, these men were referred to as "" burnt out "" men-ma n who had become prematurely aged-and special legislation was introduced in the Canadian Parliament in 1930 to give to them some form of amelioration by making available n Veteran's allowance. The maximum allowance for a single man is about £1 a week, and that for a married man about £2 a week, provided that the total income in the former case does not exceed £76 per annum, and in the latter case £152 per annum. The British Ministry of Pensions has not found it necessary to make special provision for this class of sufferer because tuberculosis. The maximum rate of returned soldiers, in common with other members of the community in Great Britain, benefit under the scheme of National Health and Unemployment Insurance. New Zealand now proposes to help, these men by granting certain allowances, and the Commonwealth Government, after a careful review of the position, has decided to do something also. It is of the opinion that a man who served his country in the Great ""War and was damaged, even to a slight extent, either traumatically or by disease, and has superimposed thereon civil disabilities which combined with war effects render him permanently incapable of earning his living, should not have to depend upon the public or upon institutions or personal friends for help. Frequently, it is impossible to make any arbitrary difference between the pre-war, war, post-war, constitutional, domestic or economic circumstances which render the individual concerned of little or no value in the industrial world. It seems undeniable that his period of usefulness has been shortened when compared with that of the civilian, and it is also undeniable that the strenuous conditions of modern war are capable of hastening the process of decay which impairs organic functions. The Government, therefore, contemplates making provision for a pension at 60 years of age for those soldiers, and at 55 years of age for those nurses, who served in a theatre of war as defined, and whose experiences and hardships may reasonably be presumed to have aged them prematurely. to assist those who, though not having reached the ages mentioned, are in a physical or mental condition which renders them permanently unemployable. For those soldiers who suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis, it is proposed to provide a pension whether they served Mr Lyons. in a theatre of war or not or whether they are permanently unemployable or not. In addition, having in view the national significance of doing everything possible to prevent the spread of this disease, the Government intends to give treatment in repatriation institutions to all soldiers suffering from pulmonary pension will be 18s. a week for a single man or widower, 30s. a week for a man and his wife, and 2s. 6d. a week for each child; the last-mentioned provision is limited to four children. The total allowed income in respect of any pensioner will be £79 6s. per aunum. The Government desires it to be fully understood that "" permanently unemployable "" is a state in which a person is rendered, by physical or mental impairment, incapable of work. That incapability is to be construed as meaning not solely inability to pursue a remunerative occupation; it will include the almost insuperable difficulties some men will face when seeking employment. Inability to resume or follow a particular calling at which the applicant has hitherto earned his living does not in itself warrant payment of a service pension for the remainder of his life. The possibility of his taking up some other work will be investigated, and the service pension will be paid so long as, hy reason of his state of health, previous training, aptitude, or other circumstances, no such work is, or can be reasonably made available to him. On the pensioner will rest the responsibility of making a genuine effort to fit himself for unaccustomed work; it is expected that he will endeavour to adapt himself to changing circumstances, because, by so doing, he may regain his earning capacity. If the contribution which Parliament is asked to make gives additional comfort which will help him in his effort to qualify far employment, it will be of advantage, not only to tbe soldier, but also to the community generally. The question of capaIt is proposed, also, bility for work, or suitability for work of an alternative nature will be viewed in the light of all the surrounding circumstances and in a reasonable manner, having regard to all the facts and conditions pertaining to the applicant's education, experience, age, general qualifications, and previous employment. Medical opinion and recommendation in arriving at a determination in tliese cases will be sought and given due consideration and weight, but the Government intends that the deciding authority shall accept the responsibility for making a decision, and, in arriving at that decision, intended to reduce this to a period of six shall use common sense, justice, and sympathy. In addition to this new scheme of pensions, the Government has given consideration to other phases of pensioning, and proposes to liberalize the existing provisions. The Repatriation Commission, by powers conferred upon it under section 32 of the act, commuted pensions iu many cases. These lump sums were not paid unless it seemed that the conditions for which the pension was received had become stationary. transpires that some pensioners, unfortunately, liave become worse, and have an increased disability, but no pension. The Government after a careful consideration of all that is involved has decided to restore pensions in commuted cases at the rate shown to be justified by medical examination. An important clause in the bill now about to be discussed is that in which the Government proposes to accept the death of a blinded soldier from any causes as being due to war service. This, in effect, means that, upon the death of a blinded soldier, his dependants will be granted increased war pension and other benefits as if the death had been due to war service. In December, 1921, the Repatriation Act was amended to permit of payment of war pensions in cases where a disability originated before enlistment and had been increased to a material degree by war service. To obtain pension under this amendment, these oases, which are known as material aggravation cases, were required to apply within six months of the passing of the amendment. This restriction is found to be operating harshly, and the bill proposes to repeal' it and enable a material aggravation case to apply at any time. It is also proposed to insert amendments permitting these cases to seek redress before an Entitlement Appeal Tribunal and an Assessment Appeal Tribunal. At present they are legally debarred from making appeals to these tribunals. One further important clause restricts the time within which the commission may appeal against an Entitlement Appeal Tribunal. At present the commission may appeal at any time; it is months, except in cases where pension has been obtained by fraud or impersonation. In such cases, the commission will have the light to appeal at any time. In addition to the new benefits contained in the bill, the Government is glad to be able to say that it proposes to authorize the commission to liberalize the basis of calculation of pensions to aged parents and similarly placed dependants of ex-soldiers. It is anticipated that this will increase expenditure on repatriation It now services hy £30,000 a year. The granting of such pensions depends on a determination as to whether the applicant has adequate means of support. In future, certain items now classed as income, such as friendly society benefits, gifts by children, &c, will not be classed as income. The result will be that some pensions will be increased. The annual cost of the proposed new pensions and benefits is estimated to be£ Pensions and treatment to T.B. ex-soldiers 120,000 "" Service pensions "" .. 134,000 Commuted pensions .. 60,000 Aged parents, &c. .. 30,000 300,000 amount entailed in the liberalization of pensions will increase? crease. The amount stated is the minimum, and it is anticipated that for some considerable time it will continue to increase year by year as new cases come under the act. This bill is the result of the Government's experience of the working of the act, and of representations made to it by returned soldier organizations, to whom Ministers are always ready to listen.

174,Mr Holloway (Melbourne Ports),"I wish now to make a strong protest against the failure of the Government to call upon several major oil companies in Australia to pay accumulated arrears of taxation to the amount of millions of pounds. instructed to take every possible step to collect this money. It was suggested indirectly, in certain reports of the Royal on an inequitable basis. The Sanitarium Commission on Taxation, that these major oil companies were greatly in arrears in their taxation accountsa state Seventh Day Adventists. The company of affairs that should not be allowed to continue. It is entirely unfair that struggling business people should be forced to pay income tax on the very last farthing of their income while these huge companies arc allowed to escape The payment of millions of pounds. Apparently the arrears have accumulated to such an extent that there is even reluctance to try to enforce payment, but the duty should be faced courageously in the interests of the whole community. Another matter to which I direct attenit to sell certain of its products at about tion has relation to the position, from the half the price charged for similar goods taxation viewpoint, of a certain company operating in several States of the Commonwealth under various names, but generally known as the Australian Conference Association Limited; I discussed this matter privately with the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) some time ago, and he promised that he would place it on the agenda for discussion at a Premiers Conference. whether he has done so. connected with this company are Seventh Day Adventists who, in many respects, are good citizens. They engage in missionary work and in other directions perform a useful public service. Certain of their operations, however, bring them into covered by legal awards and therefore direct competition with ordinary business undertakings on a basis which is unfair. This company has established sanatoriums in various parts of the country, some of which are equipped with the most up-todate scientific apparatus. Patients who enter these institutions are charged the. ordinary fees for treatment. This company also has a subsidiary that statement. company which trades under the title of the Sanitarium Health Food Company, raw material used by this company is and engages in competition with ordinary sold as a by-product by breweries in companies manufacturing similar goods Great Britain. on a basis, which, to say the least of it, Australia and then sold as the finished Mr Holloway. is not fair. The fact, that the Australian Conference Association Limited engages in missionary enterprises in the Pacific Islands and spends between £60,000 and £70,000 a year in the The department should be work is not sufficient justification for allowing it to continue to compete against legitimate business concerns Health Eood Company employs several hundred people who, however, must be makes use of the scriptural injunction "" Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers "" as a justification for preventing its employees from joining ordinary industrial organizations, and also for refusing to associate with employers' organizations. On the ground that it is a religious and missionary organization, the Australian Conference Association Limited as also its associated companies, is exempt from income and land taxation. This enables by other industrial concerns, with the result that the business of the ordinary commercial enterprises has been seriously undermined. 50 per cent? ished the story. In addition to being exempt from land and income taxation, I do not know the company imposes a levy of 10 per The people cent, on the wages of employees, and as this reverts to the funds of the company which itself is exempt from taxation, the Government is also robbed of the opportunity to collect income tax on this amount from the employees, who are not need not be paid the wages fixed for payment by other companies.

178,Mr Holloway,"I repeat that thecommodity. petes unfairly with Australian companies which, in addition to treating and packing their articles here, also procure their raw material in Australia. I understand that the raw material imported by this company is allowed entry into the Commonwealth as oil men's stores which is practically dumped here as only a very low duty is charged on it. With each tin or packet or pot of its goods such as ""Marmite"", the company gives away a coupon which entitles the purchaser to another packet free of charge. This would appear to be selling the article at half price although I suppose the main reason for this concession is to increase turnover. T. do not take exception to the exemption of these people, as a religious organization, from income and land taxation, if all that they did with the money they earn were to carry on religious activity or purely charitable work and if none of their profits were used for other purposes. money were used for missionary purposes or for worship as other religious bodies use their funds, they should be exempt from such taxation, but this company competes with legitimate firms and in various ways undercuts them : it will not join any organization of employers, such as the Chamber of Manufactures, nor will it allow its employees to join any employees' organization, so that neither the company nor its employees can be compelled to observe industrial conditions laid down by the Arbitration Court; neither can be cited to appear in that court. Consequently the standards of rioi only other employers, but also employees of other companies are being gradually undermined by this unfair competition brought about first, because this companv acquires its raw material at a lower rate of duty than it should pay; secondly, because it is exempt, from income and land taxation; and thirdly, because, under a supposedly religious formula, it is not allowed to join any organization of employers and its employees are not allowed to join an employees union. Under such conditions this company, from an industrial point of view is undermining the standard of living of employees generally throughout Australia. The Treasurer should look into Thus this company comthis matter again. A year ago he promised he would make investigations, and I feel sure that he did so. When, previously, I spoke about this company I dealt mainly with its exemption from the payment of the sales tax. The only satisfaction the Treasurer could give me was the information that it paid that tax. He does not dispute the fact that it does not pay income tax or land tax. I suggest that I have indicated reasons why such taxes should be collected from it. The income of the company is earned in the conduct of an ordinary business in unfair competition with other companies. As it is carrying on trading operations, it cannot be regarded as a religious organization and, therefore, should not be given any advantage over other companies. It was with the object of establishing fair competition in business that the Arbitration Act was passed. Under that legislation employers and employees generally If the were placed on a similar footing, their survival depending purely on business merit and management. The Government, therefore, should not close its eyes to the unfair operations of any particular company. Possibly the only reason for failure to act in this case is that members of Parliament do not like handling ""sticky"" questions such aa offending religious organizations. However, the matter has got beyond that stage now. I believe that more employees are affected in New South Wales, but in my electorate over 1,000 employees in this industry are affected by this unfair competition. Gradually other companies are losing ground, and reducing the number of their employees, and the invariable reason given for it is the unfair trading competition felt, from this supposedly religious organization. The fact that it is exempt from land tax and income tax makes it impossible for other companies to compete. The Treasurer should discuss this matter with the Cabinet -and the departmental ofiicers to see whether or not this company is purely a religious organization. During the last ten years at least it has engaged in ordinary business operations in competition with other companies. Its average profit for the last eight years has been £28,000. Its gross profit over the same period amounted to £469.700. On behalf of the company it is stated that it spends between £60,000 and £70,U00 annually on missionary work outside Australia. The people of Australia, I am sure, would not agree to exempt from taxation any other religious organization which earned between £60,000 and £70,000 a year in this -country and spent all of that amount, even for religious purposes, outside Australia. In the case of this company this amount which is devoted to missionary work outside Australia is taken out of the annual profits before the balance sheet is made up. Thus the profit of £28,000 which it made last year was in addition to this sum of between £60,000 and £70,000, so that it would have made nearly £100,000 profit during the year ended the 30th June last. I know I shall get myself disliked for making such statements, and will probably be misunderstood by many people, who w i ll infer that I am attacking this company purely from sectarian motives. That is not so. I have the greatest respect for this organization, many members of which I know personally and hold in the highest esteem. I can speak favourably of the good work the Seventh Day Adventists are doing^ particularly at the Ilealcsville Sanatorium, in Victoria. But the activities of this company cannot be regarded as charitable or religious work; they are purely of a business nature from which profits are made, and the company should pay taxation like any other ordinary business organization. The operations of the Australian Conference Association Limited are on a f a r bigger scale in New South Wales than in Victoria. To-day I asked when honorahle bers would be given an opportunity discuss the report of the royal commission which inquired into the operations of the major oil companies in respect of the production, petrol. the HouseI feel sure that many honourable members will want to know more about the income tax payable by these companies. major £1,000,000 for income tax. I believe that this matter has been ignored hy the department Mr HoUoway. that the department does not now feel inclined to unearth it . Furthermore, I do not believe that these companies are paying a just rate of tax to-day. I urge the Treasurer to take action as soon as possible with the object of collecting retrospective taxation owed to this Government. Another matter which I ask the Treasurer to deal with as soon as he finds it convenient to do so concerns certain claims by public servants who retired on a superannuation pension. Along with other government employees, the payments to these ex-public servants were cut down during the operation of the financial emergency legislation. They were more fortunate perhaps than others, in that the cut suffered by them has now been f u l l y restored; but they now claim retrospective restoration of the money they lost when (he reduced rate was in operation. As these ex-public servants had paid some of their own money into the fund from which they now draw thoir pensions, they contend that they arc on a different footing from other public servants who suffered cuts under the financial emergency legislation. They claim that they entered into a contract with the Government, and that had they entered into a similar contract with any insurance company or benefit society they would not have suffered such losses as they have suffered at the hands of this Government, due to the reduction of their pensions under the financial emergency legislation. I ask the Treasurer to look into this matter. I also desire to draw the attention of the Treasurer to one or two anomalies which, still exist in connection with memthe payments of invalid and oldto age pensions. Some years ago several honourable members, including the Minister for Commerce (Dr. Earle Page), and the honourable members for distribution and sale of Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) and West AVhen that report comes before Sydney( Mr Beasley) suggested that the provisions governing eligibility for invalid pensions should be less severe than at present. There is always a diffiI repeat that one or two culty in securing justice in borderoil companies must owe over line cases. The matter has been straightened out to some extent in regard practically to repatriation claims, but difficulties still for so long exist in regard to claims for invalid pensions. Officers connected with the Pensions Department have admitted that, in some border-line cases they would like to give the benefit of the doubt to the applicants, hut they are tied by the decisions of the medical referees. When medical referees were first appointed, their duty was to ensure that justice was done to the applicant, but that principle has not been consistently followed. Indeed, they have become more and more like rhe hired legal advisers of insurance companies whose duty it is, when an injured workman claims compensation, to keep the amount down as low as possible. For some years past successive Treasurers have allowed it to bo understood that the pensions bill is to be kept down as much as possible, with the result that medical referees feel it to be their duty, not to see that justice is done to the applicants, but to seek some reason for refusing pensions. This situation has grown up as the result of demands for economy following upon criticism by the Auditor General, or of Cabinet pressure for reduced expenditure. It was suggested some time ago that a board of three medical men should be appointed to which border-line cases' might appeal from the decision of the medical referee, and this proposal received the support of the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) before he became a member of the present Government. It often happens that, after the medical referee has turned down an application, several private doctors, when consulted, give it as their opinion that the applicant is entitled to a pension. I urge the Government to institute a system whereby an applicant may appeal from the decision of the medical referee to a board of doctors, so that he may have yet another chance. A great many people are of opinion actually he had been separated from his that maternity allowances must be paid wife for 37 years. I took the matter direct to a nurse or hospital from which up with the department, and when I the mother has received attention, and placed the facts before the officials, the that the mother herself cannot draw the pension was granted, but the man had allowance. I know that that is not so, been enittled to a pension for several and I am taking this opportunity to coryears before he received it. This provirect the wrong impression which so sion should be made more elastic so that many people hold. I have discussed the injustices of the kind I have mentioned matter with the Victorian authorities, could not occur. In some instances there and have beeu assured that the mother is bad feeling between the separated man herself is entitled to draw the allowance, and wife, and the wife, it may he, but the belief has been fostered by hospital authorities that they have the right to claim the money for themselves, and they frequently get the mother to sign an authority for them to draw the allowance. I repeat that the mother has the right to draw the allowance herself, and she can pay the doctor and the nurse afterwards. I do not suggest that the doctor and the nurse should not be paid, .but I insist that the mother's first duty is to her child and to herself. I desire to draw the attention of the Treasurer to an injustice which is being inflicted upon many pensioners who have been notified that they possess a small reversionary interest in some estate. The amount, perhaps, does not exceed £50 or £60, and even that small sum will not come to them for perhaps seven or eight years, or until the death of some other person. In the meantime, however, the pensioner, who is probably about 70 years of age, has his pension reduced because the Treasury, insists that account must be taken, in assessing the pension, of the interest which the pensioner possesses in the estate. Quite often the pensioner has no real prospect of ever receiving the money, and it is almost criminal for the Pensions Department, in the circum. stances, to reduce the pension. The position is that the pensioner, if he lives long enough, will receive a few pounds from the estate; in the meantime, so far as the department is concerned, he may starve. There is neither justice nor humanity in that. Another matter which frequently gives rise to injustice is the difficulty of proving that there has been a legal separation between a man and his wife. In one case that came to my knowledge a man was refused a pension because he could not prove legal separation, although persistently refuses to give such, information as would be necessary to . enable her husband to obtain a pension. wife must support her husband if she has -an income, and if she declines to acquaint the department with her circumstances her husband may be refused a pension to which he is entitled. Surely some formula could be evolved for the solution of this difficulty. It may happen in some cases that the wife has a certain sum of money at deposit in a bank, but she declines to state what the amount is. The husband may be convinced that the amount is not enough to prevent him from qualifying for a pension, but the bank authorities have no power to disclose the information which would entitle him to receive that pension. port the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) with regard to the injustice suffered by persons who, because they have expectations from property, upon which they are not able to realize, are deemed by the department to be holders of property and on that ground pension rights are withheld from them. In this category are persons having reversionary interests under wills which they hope some day to (jnjoy, but owing to the depression it has been found impossible to realize on the properties and thus they are deprived of pension rights. I have in mind the case of a mau who sold his farm several years ago. Over £3,000 is owing to him under the contract of sale, but owing to the depression he is unable to secure payment from the purchaser, and the moratorium law prevents him from suing or from repossessing the farm. He is unable to obtain a pension although he is much in need of this form of assistance because he is in a state of absolute penury. manent. I have not the slightest doubt, As I believe his case is typical of many others, I suggest that if expectations in property are to be held against an applicant for a pension, the property in question should be real and not notional. I have another case which must be determined by the Commissioner of Pensions, and I invite the committee to consider the facts only as far as they illustrate the principle involved. A widow who came to Australia from England in 3926 to live with her family. She is now 66 years of age and is an invalid. She has not resided in Australia the requisite The law requires that a 20 years to entitle her to the old-age pension, but she has resided here for five years, the term necessary to entitle her to an invalid pension. Her application for an invalid pension has been refused on the ground that she has never, whilst in Australia, been capable of earning her own living. The law requires that the incapacity must be-permanent, and the department has ruled that it must be permanent and also total; and further, that the incapacity must have arisen in Australia. The following minute has heen issAied by the department in connection with this case:She has not at any period during her residence in Australia earned her living. Her sworn evidence of the 14th November, 1934 reads as f o l l o w s : "" I kept house . . . . I merely assisted with the light duties. I dn not think I could have earned my living on arrival. I do not think I could have done a day's work. I have always depended upon my family, but now they are unable to continue."" Upon that the department makes this commentShe has not been capable of earning her living since her arrival -in Australia,"" and therefore the pension was refused. An invalid pension could not, therefore, be approved in her name. The department has not followed the definition of permanent incapacity which has been observed hitherto. It has ruled that the incapacity must he total and permanent. The department has consistently refused the applications of women who, like this one, were not capable of earning their own living entirely, but were able to keep house or perform other light, duties. Apparently it has a sort of rough rule that if applicants are able to earn a few shillings a week in any capacity their incapacity is not perthat if this woman had been qualified hy residence to apply in 1926 for a pension in the circumstances then existing, her application would have been refused on the ground that she was able to do light work. The department must be consistent in its administration of the act. If it were to apply to all applications the interpretation which it has applied to the one which I have just mentioned, hundreds and probably thousands of people",43,Department Of Thetreasury
179,Mr Nairn (Perth) [8.45],"I supwho are now denied invalid pensions would qualify. In this case, I think, the department has erroneously ruled that the applicant was totally incapacitated for work on her arrival in Australia. I propose to refer this matter to the Commissioner of Pensions, so I do not expect the Minister to express an opinion upon it in the committee. As the circumstances of this case affect administration in a very definite way, I suggest that the Minister should issue a general direction to the Deputy Commissioners throughout the Commonwealth concerning the principle upon which this particular provision in the pensions la.w is to be operated. direct the attention of the Minister to certain phases of administration of the federal land tax, particularly as it affects was thereupon transferred to the sons; transfers of property. It is recognized rhat when a property exceeds the exemption limit the tax must be paid, and that in the case of a sale on the basis of immediate possession the tax on the increased value should also apply. But in cases where property is bought for delivery, say, after harvest, the department, I consider unjustly, now levies taxacountry, understated his age by about tion on the new property, not from the time of possession, but from the date of signing the contract. That principle was not always observed. Recently there has been an alteration in' the administration, because now immediately a contract is signed the property transferred is regarded as belonging to the purchaser, even if he does not take possession or enjoy income from it until after the ensuing harvest. The man who is in possession or has the right to receive the income from the property is the one who should pay the tax. I ask the Minister to look into this matter and see if it is possible to rectify this anomaly hy restoring the old principle adopted when making assessments. port the remarks of the honourable memway) and the honourable member for Perth (Mi-. Nairn) in regard to the administration of the Pensions Department, particularly in relation to the assessment of property of pensioners. It is well known that the Valuer-General's figures are intended mainly for the use of local governing bodies, and do not represent the true value. In some cases, his assessment is 50 per cent, higher than the actual market value. I have had brought under my notice the case of an old lady, 70 years of age, possessing a farm property apart from the home in which she lived. The farm was valued by the local governing authority at £425, and because it exceeded the exemption limit fixed by the act, she was unable to get a pension. Further investigation revealed that she had received the farm, and another property on which she resides, from her father, who stipulated that she should give to her sister and other members of the family £295 as part of their share. Her two son3 paid this amount to her sister and relatives, and the property but the department does not recognize the transfer. I submit that the transaction represented a legitimate sale in accordance with instructions of her father, and that the department is treating this woman unjustly. Another case is that of a returned soldier, who, in order to serve his 20 years. This man, who is now 84 years of age, lives at Wallsend. He applied for the old-age pension, but because ho transferred some property, valued in excess of £100, to his son, his application was refused. The act relating to the transfer of property by pensioners was amended in April of this year. It seems that the property which he transferred was valued at about £300, but a re-assessment has placed its value at about £200, and he is now getting a pension of 9s. or 10s. a fortnight. The son claims that the cost of the father's board and lodging more than offset the value of the property transferred to him. I have brought this case under the notice of the department, which is not prepared to admit the claim., beyond the amount of pension which I have indicated. I consider that in this matter the administration is unnecessarily harsh. Because of the son's callous treatment of the father, who still has a good deal of spirit and independence, declines to live with him, and I contend that he is entitled to the full pension. The position",47,Department Of Thetreasury

182,Ber For Melbourne Ports ( Mr Hollo,"of old-age pensioners whose domestic relations are unhappy also calls for more sympathetic admin.istra.tion. In many cases definite hardship is inflicted upon a husband or wife, as the case may be, who is dispossessed of property. I have submitted many such cases to the department for review. One is that of a woman whose invalid pension has been suspended because it has been discovered that her husband is earning money, although they have been living apart for twelve years. She has taken out a warrant for the arrest of the husband, but if he cannot be located difficulty will he encountered in having her pension restored. ""When a husband and wife have lived apart for a considerable time no hesitation should be shown in granting the pension. A further point is that, in fixing the amount of the pension, consideration should be given, not to the value placed on a property by the local authority, but to its revenue-producing capacity. A property that does not produce revenue should liave no effect on the amount of the pension. A ease in Maitland that has been sent on to me by the State member for the district is that of an old gentleman who has a property which, he says, is valueless, and which has been condemned by the local authority as unfit for human habitation. Although he lives elsewhere with a relative, the value placed on the property by the Valuer-General has been taken into account, and his pension has been reduced to about 10s. a week. I wish to refer, also, to the point raised by the honourable member for Perth( Mr scheme. An old gentleman who lived Nairn), in connection with -migrants who arrive in Australia at a. fairly advanced age. According to replies that I have received from the department from time to time, such persons who apply for an invalid pension are deemed to have been incapacitated when they arrived in Australia. Take the case of a husband and wife who come to this country at the age of, say, 56 or 58 years. The husband obtains employment, and the wife performs all the necessary housework. He may be killed or injured in the course of his occupation. She having reached an age when she has no ability to earn a livelihood, applies for an invalid Mr James. pension. She is informed that, in view of the age at which she came to Australia, she was then partially incapacitated, and is not qualified for the pension, although her husband is receiving an invalid pension as a result of injuries received in this country. I know that a regulation provides that a claimant for an invalid pension must have resided in Australia for a period of five years, and must have earned a living for a considerable portion of that time, but I claim that a woman who does all the work of a house earns her own living. I refer particularly to a case in Cardiff, and another in Young Wallsend, which have been brought to my notice by Messrs. Kay and Rutherford, ' the respective secretaries of the Old-age Pensioners' Associations in those districts. I have been unable to establish the claims of these persons, and believe that the department is treating them very harshly. Many young migrants bring with them their aged parents, who, if they remained in England, would qualify for a pension within two or three years. It is admitted that under the contributory insurance scheme in England a continuance of contributions after their arrival in Australia would entitle them to draw the pension, but they are not made aware of this fact before they leave the Old Country. I have learned of it only by studying the English act. Very few persons in Australia draw an imperial old-age pension. Two systems operate in England. One is an old-age scheme similar to the Australian scheme, although the payments under it are not so liberal as ours, and the other is the existing contributory in my electorate died recently at the age of 83 years. He drew an old-age pension while in England, but could not continue to draw it after he came to Australia with his children. The Commonwealth should make representations to the imperial authorities, with a view to a reciprocal, arrangement being made whereby an imperial pensioner could draw his pension in any part of the Empire. That is the case with imperial army pensioners. Members of the industrial army are entitled to equally favorable treatment. Many imperial soldiers who drew their pensions in a lump sum, and came to Australia, became incapacirated as the result of their war service after working for a few years, and to-day are drawing the invalid pension. That is grossly unfair to this country. I do not wish to be misunderstood. I have nothing against the migrant soldier who is forced .through incapacity to take advantage of ouipensions scheme; but I bave a grudge against the imperial authorities, because it is tlieir responsibility, and not ours, to provide for those those who have been engaged in the coalwho are suffering by reason of war service in the imperial army. I know of half a dozen such cases in my electorate. It will be admitted that shortly after the Great War many thousands of imperial ex-soldiers who were miners came from Great Britain to the northern districts of New South Wales. A number of them who are suffering from the effects of the war are to-day drawing the invalid pension in this country. It is, of course, much better for a migrant to bring his or her aged parents to Australia, instead of making periodical trips to the Old Country to visit them, expending in fares and in other ways money that would be better kept in Australia. On the other hand, why should not those who came to Australia at an early age, and who in later years wish to return to the land of their birth for the remainder of their lives, be permitted to enjoy there the pension granted to them in Australia? As a young man I frequently heard my mother speak emotionally of the position in which she had left her parents in the Old Country. The phrase that she used was that she had "" buried them alive."" Such a state of affairs does not conduce to family unity. I object to the absence of the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) from the chamber during the discussion of matters affecting his department. I mentioned this matter when these Estimates were last being discussed. When I commenced my speech to-night some members of my party expressed the view that the Treasurer ought to be in the chamber to hear what 1 had to say. This is the only opportunity that Ave have to discuss these matters, and we are merely beating the air if we receive no reply to our representations. Last week I referred to the very important matter of the maintenance of pensioners but have not been furnished with any information by the Treasurer. The contention of the department is that a hospital is not entitled to receive any payment in respect of an inmate who was not a pensioner prior to entering the institution. I have already broughtunder the notice of the Treasurer the manner in which industrial subscribers to hospital funds are treated. Many of mining industry in my electorate have contributed to hospital funds for many years, and their contributions are subsidized by the State government on a £1 for £1 basis. When they are compelled to become inmates of public hospitals the payment of their pension is stopped by the department, and an amount is paid direct to the hospital concerned. As these persons contribute towards their maintenance in hospital, the pension should be paid direct to them. The officers of the department have informed me that they are not under any statutory obligation to make any payment to the hospitals; but that.they do so because it is their responsibility to maintain the pensioner. Some time ago I wrote to the Treasurer on this subject, and the concluding paragraph of his reply readsTn these CUSPS where tlie pensioner is a contributor to a hospital fund and payment for his maintenance is being made to the hospital by a friendly society or from the hospital fund, it is considered that the logical step would he to decrea.se the ex gratia payment which is made by the Commonwealth to the institution. This question has already been considered, but as the contributions are generally not large it has been decided not to take any action in that direction. It will be seen from the Treasurer's letter that if the department did anything in the matter it would be in the direction of decreasing the payment to the hospital, instead of making the proper payment to the pensioner. Why should the Government take advantage of the fact that pensioners contribute to hospital funds for their own benefit? The attitude of the department has caused a good deal of dissatisfaction amongst many pensioners in my electorate, and although I have endeavoured to get the department to pay the pensioners the amount to which they are entitled, it has declined to do so. As the Treasurer has now returned to the in hospitals chamber, I trust that he will give close attention to the'matters which I have just to the case of a pensioner prospector, been discussing, and particularly the which may be taken as typical of others case of pensioner contributors to hoswho, after many years of prospecting, pital funds.

It takes a good deal of perspicacity on the part of the officers of che department, to spot cases of over-payment of tax. cases of under payment. The department has to examine the returns to make sure that tax is not short-paid. of work in the department allows the taxpayer is advised and moneys improperly paid are refunded. The case of pensioner' inmates of the Waterfall Sanatorium and similar institutions was brought up in the House some few months ago by the honourable member fov Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini). At that time. I undertook to have the position investigated to see whether the period of three months provided to determine whether a man was temporarily or permanently an inmate, could be extended. to be able to inform honourable members that the Government has decided to months, and that I am giving instructions accordingly. I hope this decision will go a long way towards easing the situation which the honourable member mentioned. The honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) raised the question of assistance to local governing bodies in connection with interest and sinking funds on loans raised by those bodies. As I replied in answer to a question in the House to-day, the Government is going into the question carefully with the State governments and hopes at an early date to be able to evolve a satisfactory scheme which will be announced in the House. The honourable member for Boothby( Mr Price) raised the point that manufacturers, printers and other traders in opportunity to tender for postal and other Commonwealth supplies for the particular State in which they were engaged in business. The position is that the requirements of each of the States and of all the States collectively are ascertained periodically and incorporated in a collective schedule in which the quantity of each item for each State is shown separately. An opportunity is given to quote for either the whole of the collective items or for any particular item in each State. South Australian printers, I think, take very full advantage of the opportunity to tender for the printed requirements of South Australia, but in general tenders from suppliers and contractors in cities other than Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, are very infrequent. An opportunity does exist, however, for contractors, particularly printers, to tender for the requirements of their own State. The honourable member also mentioned the desirability of simplifying the income tax form. I have discussed that matter with the Commissioner of Taxation, and I am advised that the form now used to collect the relevant information is as simple as possible for the purpose. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) inquired about the item in the I am glad Estimates: "" Cars for valuers."" It is essential that land valuers should have",51,Department Of Thetreasury

This is a reasonable system, which has been in operation for a number of years. It works quite well and results in a saving to the Government. If this system were not adopted, it would he necessary to hire cars for the use of these men and the cost would be greater. The honourable members for CapriMartens) raised the question of the appointment of a Commissioner of Pensions. I may say for the information of honourable members that Mr Metford was appointed Acting-Commissioner while Mr Hcathershaw has been engaged on special duties. Mr Heathershaw's period of service normally ended a few months ago, but he has been retained to complete certain special work. The period of his extension ends in a few weeks' time. Immediately he retires from the Service an appointment will be made to the position of Commissioner of Pensions, which, I feel sure, will be quite satisfactory to State or other hospital concerned. honourable members on both sides of the chamber. The honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) spoke about pensions beingreduced because the pensioners held to agree that the amount paid was equal life assurance policies. The point isand I myself have raised it in the Treasury several times-that life assurance policies cannot be regarded as other than property within the meaning of the act. As such, they must be taken into account in assessing the pension, but the practice is to consider only their surrender value. A number of honourable members have mentioned special cases concerning pensioners, sometimes by name, and sometimes not by name. They are, of course, usually particular cases, are sometimes extreme eases; and sometimes border-line cases. Without having the pensioners' file before me, it is quite impossible for one for the department administratively. me to reply to the points raised in any Mr Ciatcy. adequate way. I am afraid from my point of view it is of relatively little value to bring up individual cases in the House hecause it is impossible for me to comment on them without full knowledge of the facts. cases which I have mentioned? with them by letter. impossible, offhand, to deal with individual cases in a satisfactory way. 1 think that the departmental officer and I have never failed to give conscientious attention to individual cases submitted by letter. the policy at present adopted in connection with the pension paid to members of benefit societies who happen to be inmates of hospitals? that matter than I advised the honourable member by letter a few days ago. If the amount the Government pays to the hospital were equal to or more than the cost of maintenance of the pensioner, there might be something in the honourable member's suggestion; but in most cases that is not so. This is an ex gratia paymentby the Commonwealth to the the cost of maintenance. honourable member would get the hospital to the cost of maintenance.

It is a question of degree. The department makes every effort to deal fairly and adequately with tubercular applicants for pensions. That is instanced by the number of invalid pensioners who are suffering from tuberculosis in one form or another. [ think that is an earnest of the efforts made administratively to deal fairly with those who are unfortunately suffering from this disease. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports also mentioned a matter which is not new either to this committee or to the honourable member and me. I refer to the alleged unfair advantage regarding exemption from taxation that the Sanitarium Health Food Company and allied organizations have in trading in competition with others who make similar lines of foodstuffs. I have had lengthy correspondence with both the Retail Grocers' Association, which is not without eloquence on the subject, and the Sanitarium Health Food Company, and the religious organization behind it. When both sides of the case are examined it appears in a different light from that in which the honourable member has presented it to-night. According to an undertaking which I previously gave to the honourable member, this matter was discussed by representatives of the governments of the Commonwealth and the States in connection with the uniform taxation measure which will shortly be submitted to this Parliament, and it was agreed unanimously I think, that there should ject. The matter was gone into at great length about twelve months ago, and it has heen raised lately in a circular, which I think most honourable members have received; but on the evidence submitted to the various governments, none of them thinks it necessary or right that any change in the law as it now stands should be made. the company use its profits? That is the question. ber of questions that arise. I hold no brief for the company, but it has told a different story from that presented to-night. cease to be a religious organization when it engages in competitive trading for profit, and publishes returns disclosing profits ? depends for its determination upon two things: Do other religious organizations do this, or anything like it ; and to what purpose are the profits applied? Almost every religious organization engages in trade to varying degrees. Everybody is aware of. and, I think, appreciates, the efforts of the Salvation Army to provide cheap lodging houses in the capital cities. This is a form of competition with others who supply similar services. We know, of course, that this organization uses its profits for religious purposes. great. a profit is made, it surely shows that the company is trading on a basis which is reasonably fair to its competitors. I do not wish to he drawn into a complete discussion ou this subject. Nearly twelve months have elapsed since I have had it under consideration. If the company were to deal on the basis of no profit, I should say that there would be much more justification than there now appears to be for a charge that it competes unfairly against those who make similar goods. Of course, the company presents a good case as to the way in which it disposes of its profits, which it definitely maintains are used for religious",53,Department Of Thetreasury

When this matter was brought under my notice in all its detail, I was personally satisfied that I couple who have been separated for years could not recommend the Government to follow any other course than that which it is now taking. draw attention to the case of an old-age pensioner living at Mackay who, under doctor's orders, removed to the seaside for the benefit of his health. He was able to obtain a rental of 10s. a week from his own dwelling, and he had to pay the same amount of rent for a similar cottage on the coast; but he was advised hy the department that his pension would be reduced because of the income he was receiving by way of rent from his own cottage. 1 suggest that if the officers of the department had authority to deal with such cases, it would not be necessary to bring them under the notice of the Minister, because the officers who always investigate such matters fully and fairly would recognize the justice of paying the full pension. The reduction of the pension in such circumstances is indicative of harsh administration, to say the least, of it. It may be said by the Treasurer that if individual cases of this nature are brought under his notice, he will consider them; but he must almost certainly be guided by the advice of the responsible officers. Another point referred to by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn),, and also, I think, by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) is the department's insistence on legal separations being obtained by married couples who have been living apart for years, before, each party is entitled to the full pension. I have in mind two cases in Townsville in which legal separations cannot easily be secured, because of the opposition of one of the parties. The husband and wife have been living apart for 22 years in one instance, and in the other for 27 years. I have conversed with the police magistrate on the matter, and have been assured that there is not the slightest hope of the pensioners ever living together. The wife of one of the pensioners objects to the granting of I think that it a legal separation on the ground thai she is agreeable to the husband returning to the home; but, if the husband went back, they would immediately disagree, and find it impossible to live together. If the authorities are satisfied that a cannot live together, the cost of granting the full pension to each of them would not involve the country in heavy expense. In the case of the other elderly cotiple in Townsville, the husband has spent a considerable time in the public hospital in the last three years. 1 have heen interviewed by the wife, who has told me that the home is available to her husband whenever he cares to return to it, but the sub-inspector of police informed me that there was no hope whatever of the couple living together peacefully. Such matters as these could easily be investigated, and I believe that the department would be satisfied as to the justice of the claims made for the pension. Although the Auditor-General has not yet resigned from his position, the public has been informed as to who will be his successor. We know that the Commissioner for Pensions, Mr Heathershaw, will shortly conclude his term of service, and the Government could have announced the name of his successor as easily as that of the successor of the Auditor-General. of pensioners in hospitals is somewhat different from that stated by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James). The hospitals are encouraging a scheme of weekly contributions which entitle pensioners to free treatment for a certain period. A number of pensioners iu industrial areas have participated in the scheme, and the department should not be called upon to meet the hospital charge of 12s. 6d. a week which is now paid on behalf of each pensioner. I contend that if, by a system of weekly, contributions, the pensioners can obviate the hospital charge which the department has had to meet, the 12s. 6d. a week should be returned to them. I hope that the Treasurer will make a note of this matter. I am aware that the department is of the opinion that the pensioners should have this money refunded to them by the hospital authorities, because the department has already paid it.

BEKNAKD COKSEB -The receives no payment for 28 days. remarks by advice which I have received from the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions. [Qvorum formed.] I propose now to deal with the position of elderly persons who are beneficiaries under a will. A serious injustice is being done to many old people in New South Wales. One case that has come under my notice is that of a man and his wife who are both nearly 72 years of age. A younger brother has made a will providing that, upon the death of his wife, other relatives shall participate in the division of the estate; but his wife happens to be a young woman, in perfect health, and, therefore, likely to outlive the two old folk. Old people in such circumstances are suffering from penury and want, as the result of being denied the pension. relief from the State Government and apply to the Chief Secretary's Department for rental, which amounts in some cases to 5s. a. week, and in others to IO3. a month, but they have no other sources of assistance. In the instance which I have cited, the old folk offered to authorize the repayment to the department of any amount which they received in pensions if they happened to share in the division of the estate. I admit that cases of this kind are rare, but why the Government insists upon the interpretation of the strict letter of the laAvI cannot understand. I trust that the Treasurer will give consideration to the issues I have raised. Mnch dissatisfaction exists because of differences of opinion expressed by various doctors in regard to the eligibility of applicants for invalid pensions, and a board of appeal should be created to deal with this matter. The Pensions Department abides by the certificate of its medical officer, although two or three other doctors may disagree with him. When two doctors grant a certificate to show that a patient is suffering from a certain complaint and a third doctor issues a contrary report, it has been the practice for many years to accept the decision of the majority. To overcome this unsatishospital factory position, the department should establish a board of doctors, and the am guided in my' decision of the majority in each case should be accepted. But the department adheres to the hard-and-fast rule that the diagnosis of its own doctor is the only one to be recognized. Often one has to procure new medical certificates in order to re-open a case for review, and then after many months have elapsed, and strong representations have heen made, the departmental doctor may state that a person is entitled to a pension. I shall now refer to the numher of infirm persons in various institutions, who the Commonwealth Government considers are not eligible to draw the pension. In Hobart, 37 persons are domiciled in the Old Men's Home, but they are not in receipt of a pension; they are a charge upon the State. State governments should not be compelled to They may obtain food keep persons who are totally incapacitated and enter an institution. The time has arrived, I think, when the Commonwealth should shoulder the full responsibility for these aged people. The old age pensioners of Tasmania are a respectable body of people who have fulfilled their obligations to the Commonwealth; they are not drunkards as the Auditor General has described pensioners in his annual report. In every sense they are fit and proper persons to receive the reward that the Commonwealth grants to old people. One or two cases may occur in which the pensioners are subject to over-indulgence in alcohol, but in TasmaniaI have heard of very few of such cases; and in my discussions with the department itself I have learned that an overwhelming majority of these people are sober and conscientious. It is a "" lowdown"" and despicable act on the part of a man in his declining years, one who has long held an honourable and responsible position in the Commonwealth Public Service, to subject the old people to abuse for partaking of a little drop of beer in",55,Department Of Thetreasury

According to the act, an applicant for a pension must be deemed to be a reputable person: a criminal or a disreputable 'person is not eligible to receive a pension. The pensioners, as a body, are a credit to Australia, whose development is due to the old men who have blazed the track, in order to make this continent one of the greatest in the world. The administration of the iirvjalid pension should be more liberal in certain directions, or the Minister should instruct the department to give favorable consideration to totally incapacitated persons who are not old enough to be eligible for the pension. A young man who meets with an injury finds it difficult to obtain work, but for a man 55 years of age, who is incapacitated as a result of an accident, the difficulty is accentuated. rejected by the department was that of a man who had a leg broken at the ankle and was a complete cripple, but the departmental doctor declared that he was not totally incapacitated. cannot obtain employment in any industry. His case, therefore, should receive more sympathetic consideration from the I department, and a pension should be granted to him. At any rate, a victim of an accident in such circumstances should not be a charge on a State government, which, because of the He has inability of the Commonwealth legislation, must see that he does not die as the result of starvation. The Commonwealth declines to accept, responsibility for his maintenance because although he may be permanently incapacitated he is not totally incapacitated, notwithstanding that another doctor has granted a certificate stating that he is totally incapacitated. Irrespective of criticism or of the fears expressed by the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) that this country may not be able to fulfil its obligations to the pensioners in future, unfortunate persons in circumstances similar to that which I have quoted should be granted a pension. Australia is in a better position to provide for the pensioners than the Treasurer is prepared to admit. At the other end of the Treasury accounts there is a tremendous charge of £15,000,000 a year made available by the Commonwealth to the States for the relief of unemployment. It is a strain upon the finances of the country which Australia cannot continue to bear. .The Commonwealth should co-operate with the States in the payment of interest and sinking fund on relief works carried out by local-governing bodies. Why is it not co-operating with the Government of Tasmania in providing the money to finance these charges on certain public works in that state? The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order!

Several persons who, I am sure, are totally and permanently incapacitated have been refused pensions and I am their cases have been brought to my notice. In one or two cases, after much delay, the claims have been recognized by the department and pensions paid. The procedure should be simpler than it is. I ask the Treasurer to bring under the notice of the Pensions Department the desirability of evolving a simpler scheme. A "" h u s h "" policy is being followed in regard to the taxation of big oil companies. The report of the Royal Commission on Petrol seems to be a closed In delivering his book to members of this Parliament and the public of Australia. It is true, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) pointed out, that throughout the country there is a general belief that the oil interests are evading taxation by clever and cunning methods. I have here a letter from a gentleman who, for a number of years, has been interested in the taxation of oil companies, and I propose to read a few extracts from it Since 1910, I have made a continual appeal to the governments and the commissioner to apply tlie same methods of assessment to the Shell Company as have heen ruthlessly applied to the man in the street. In 1921, when Parliament, through my efforts, passed an amendment of the act to deal with this case, it was I wish to refer to freely stated that £3,000,000 was collectable from the Shell Oil Company. Despite my persistent efforts, tlie Commissioner for Taxation has refused to assess the enormous profits made by this company on a higher basis than 20 per cent. Before the royal commission, the Shell Company admitted having arranged their invoice prices to avoid paying income I do not wish to miss tax in Australia. Evidence was given that the Shell Company had not been assessed for three years, and that their assessments for the previous years were still awaiting adjustment. In the accounts presented to tlie commission, I showed that approximately £7,000,000-plu s penalties as enforced on others!-wa s justly collectable from the Shell Company. If that be true-and I take it that it has some foundation in fact, otherwise the statement would have been challenged I before this-ther e is something seriously wrong with the department.

In another case an invalid pensioner received an intimation from a relative that some money had been left to him in England. In his honesty he communicated with the department and suggested that it should be a friend and help him to get the money. The pension was cancelled from that day, and the cancellation continues. I inquired about the matter and later the department was good enough to assist the pensioner by communicating by air mail with the British authorities with a view to establishing his claim. When a man actually receives a legacy his pension naturally ceases, but in the present instance the man had not received the money; he was merely making inquiries about it. Denied the pension, he was left in unfortunate circumstances and friends had to come to his assistance. In a case of that kind a little. leniency should be shown. I am uot suggesting that the administration of the Pensions Act is generally courteous in every way and assists the pensioners so far as it can within the act. I hope, however, that the act will be amended so that these petty anomalies will be removed. The honourable member for Biverina (Mv. Nock) claimed that the Government should further reduce the land tax. If the Government has surplus revenues, the benefit of remissions should be given to the invalid and old-age pensioners. I would not at the moment favourably receive any suggestion for a further reduction of the rate of the land tax. In order to relieve the budget during the depression, pensions, and Public Service salaries were reduced, and heavy burdens of sales tax and income tax were placed on the people. During and since the depression, however, the payers of land tax have received much consideration from the Commonwealth Government. The tax was first reduced by one-third, and subsequently it was cut by 50 per cent. Not only has that been done, but a tribunal has been set up to which the payers of land tax may apply for relief in respect of the remaining rate of tax. While I should like to see the land tax abolished, I would not support any action in that direction while the invalid and old-age pensions are still subjected to reductions, and while the sales tax and income tax remain at such high levels. No one section should benefit exclusively from remissions of taxes. I am surprised at the neglect of the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) to give information in regard to some of the matters which I raised earlier. I mentioned the medical examination of applicants for invalid pensions, and to show that I was not making charges which could not be sustained, I cited the case of Mr P. Moyson, of 21 Wilson-street, East Sydney, who was examined by Dr. Ludowici when he made application for an invalid pension. The doctor rejected the application on the grounds that the applicant was suffering only from neuritis and therefore was not permanently and totally incapacitated. The applicant became dangerously ill a few days later, and, when he went to Sydney Hospital for an X-ray examinais unfair. The department tion was ordered an immediate dangerous operation. He had a tumour on the right lung. That should prove conclusively that Dr. Ludowici did not efficiently carry out the examination. His is not an isolated instance, as many Government doctors do not make adequate examinations of applicants for pensions. The sys*tem under which they are paid a fee for each examination should end, because most of them, having large private practices, give little time to applicants for pensions, knowing that all they have to do in order to receive payment is to put them through some cursory examination. These rush methods leave to the doctors more time in which to attend to their lucrative private practices. I suggested that the Government should alter the present practice and prepare a panel of Government medical officers from which the claimant for a pension could nominate one. I would prefer, of course, that the claimant should have the right to nominate his own private medical practitioner, but if the Government would not agree to that course I suggested that a panel of Government doctors should be made available from which a selection",59,Department Of Thetreasury
234,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [10.42],"may be made. Tlie result would be that a doctor who gained a reputation, for dealing harshly with pensioners would get very little business, while a doctor who treated pensioners fairly would be well patronized and build up a connection. I have repeatedly listened to speeches of honourable members opposite to the effect that anomalies exist in our pensions Mr Chairman, but I suggest that you legislation; but although requests have sometimes been made by Government supporters for an increase of the rate of pension we know very well that the policy of the Government is to keep the pensions bill at the lowest possible amount. The Government has, in fact, introduced a practice in regard to the fixation of the rate of pension which was never contemplated by those responsible for the introto do it. I repeat that honourable memduction of the pensions scheme. I refer to the provision that the rate of pension shall be determined according to the rise and fall of the cost of living. from memory, I think the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser), voted for that provision. If the Government has a genuine desire to increase the rate of pension it will now need to repeal the provision that the rate of pension shall be administration of the Department of thi: determined by the rise and fall of the cost Treasury. of living. I regret that the power to determine the rate of pension should have been transferred to an authority outside of this Parliament. AlthoughI concede that some honourable members have referred to anomalies in our pensions legisis in charge of the business before the lation the fact remains that such concessions as have been obtained for pensioners have been wrung from the Government partly by force of public opinion outside the Parliament and partly by the agitation of honourable members on this side of the committee. Although any request to the Government to liberalize our pensions legislation is a waste of words, it is nevertheless necessary that honourable members of the Opposition shall take every opportunity to voice their objection to the policy of the Government so that the public will not be deluded into believing that this Government has a real desire to assist the pensioners. is divided definitely on party lines and the Government represents one section of the community. party, or class, Government.

If an honourable member is speaking, and you, Mr Chairman, rule him out of order, has he the right to take a point of order regarding that ruling? Or do I correctly understand you to mean on the point raised by the honourable member for Hunter, that your direction to the honourable member for East Sydney to resume his seat was not a ruling, and therefore dissent from it could not be moved? Long continued parliamentary practice gives the Chair the power and the right to order an honourable member to resume his seat if his remarks are irrelevant to the matter under discussion.

I acted accordingly, but I gave no ruling. your right, Mr Chairman, to decide whether my remarks were relevant or irrelevant, but was asking whether you had ruled that they were irrelevant, and if so, had not another honourable member the right to disagree with your ruling ? explained the reasons for my action. The recent report of the Commissioner of Taxation discloses that on the 30th June last over £3,000,000 of income tax, and £61,798 of estate duty were' overdue. I notice that an extension of time has been granted in many cases for the payment of the taxes. I appreciate the difficulties which confront the department in the collection of such large amounts, and I recognize that officers of the department invariably treat taxpayers in such cases very fairly. In view of the large sum involved, I suggest, that in the public interest the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) should make a statement in connection with these amounts. [11.9] -I'trus t that as a result of the criticism which has been voiced hy honourable members on both sides of the committee, various defects in connection with the administration of the pensions law will be rectified.

272,Mr Drakeford (Maribyrnong),"which the treatment meted out to pensioners has not been satisfactory. We find that many pensioners who have been found to have committed an offence, are deprived entirely of the right to receive a pension in the future. That is wrong. In my electorate cases have occurred in which pensioners who really committed an offence were deprived of their pension, and the benevolent society in their district had to assume responsibility for their keep. I suggest that in such cases pensioners should be treated in the same way as offenders against any other law of the country; after suffering the loss of pension for a certain period, and so purging their offence, they should not be deprived of the right to have tlje pension restored. from, receiving further pension in cases of repeated offences. pensioners who committed only one offence, and when representations were made to the authorities to continue payment of the pension, the authorities pointed out that it would be inadvisable to raise this particular case, as the offence department had deprived him of his penwas serious. A representative of a benevolent society in my electorate brought this case under my notice, and asked me to endeavour to persuade the authorities to give the claims of the pensioner further consideration. However, in view of the intimation I had received from the authorities, it seemed to me that such representations would be futile. I plead for sympathetic consideration of such pensioners, and I suggest that after a pensioner has suffered a penalty for having committed an offence, whether or not he has admitted guilt, he should again become eligible to receive a pension. The honorahle member's remarks apply only to cases where the pensioner has been guilty repeatedly of a minor offence such as drunkenness. in mind was not one of drunkenness. This particular pensioner had failed to< disclose fully funds to his credit. I am informed that his pension was cancelled. When his funds had been exhausted the pensioner applied .for the reinstatement of his pension and was informed that he was not eligible to receive that benefit. It has been represented to me that several cases of this kind have occurred. I have in mind, also, another case which is similar to many which have been brought under my notice by the Pensioners Association. In this instance the pensioner was suffering from tuberculosis and was ordered to appear before the Departmental Medical Officer. Because of the state of his health, he was unable to do so; the medical officer examined him at his homo and decided that he was not eligible to continue in receipt of an invalid pension. A nurse was sent from the State Government Tubercular Clinic to attend to him and after he had been deprived of his pension for a period of three months, he was advised to visit the clinic for examination. The doctor there said he was not fit to work and, whilst not desiring to criticize the Pensions Department, expressed the opinion that he should still be paid a pension. After the pensioner again applied, a pension was given to him, but no compensation was made for his loss during the period in which the sion. In cases of this kind, where a man who has been deprived of a pension is later shown to have been entitled to it, the pension should be restored retrospectively. The department does not do that now. It allows a pensioner to remain for a certain period without pension, during which, period he has a struggle to exist, often having to depend upon a benevolent society or the charity of his friends or relatives for help. Such a practice is unjust. If , because of the recommendation of its medical officer, the department makes a mistake in depriving pensioners of what they are entitled to, and, later, the pensions ' are restored, payments should be retrospective over the period of unjust deprivation. If the Treasurer will consider cases of this kind, I feel sure that many causes for dissatisfaction will be removed. I am not suggesting that such cases are general. However, when such cases do occur, pensioners suffer injustice under the practice now adopted by the department. Generally speaking, I have nothing but praise for the administration of the department and I have no captious criticism to offer in respect of",63,Paiks

The position would be remedied if the Treasurer would issue instructions to officials of the department will be allowed to happen in the future. to modify what appears to me to be unfair governmental policy in these matters. Similar grievances occur in respect of applicants who own property and have made mistakes in the information supplied by them to the department. I support the suggestions by the honourable members for Perth( Mr Nairn) arid Hunter( Mr James) with respect to husbands and wives who are denied the pension because ithey live apart. I have in mind a case where a wife and husband were living in the same house; the wife refused to speak to the husband, declined to do any of his washing, and would not attend even to his meals. also refused to disclose particulars of property owned by her. The man, in good faith, made a statement to the department that his wife possessed no property, but it was afterwards learned that certain moneys had been supplied to her by her family, and becatise of this he lost his pension. Cases of hardship of this kind should receive more sympathetic consideration. During the earlier part^of this year, the that the applicant was entitled to a penPensions Department sent a doctor into sion, that should be sufficient for the my electorate to review certain invalid department.

I bring this matter under the notice of the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) now in the hope that nothing of the kind my electorate there are some pensioners who, many years ago, purchased blocks of vacant land which have remained ever since valueless and unsaleable, though carrying a fictitious value placed upon them by the Valuer-General. Such land is not an asset, hut is an actual handicap to the owners. Nevertheless, the Pensions Department insists upon taking into consideration the nominal value of the land when determining the pension to which the owner is entitled. In my opinion, non-revenue producing and unsaleable She property of that kind should not stand in the way of a person's pension rights. In many cases, the owners would gladly give the land to any one who would take i r. from them. The present system of medical examination of applicants for invalid pensions is unsatisfactory. Instead of there being only one medical officer in each centre, there should be a panel of four or five doctors in each metropolitan area, before any one of whom the applicant could appear.

The Minister knows who he is, foicomplaints have been made in regard to him in this chamber on previous occasions. quack. fairly widely held. The Treasurer should ask the British Medical Association to nominate a panel of doctor? before whom applicants might appear for examination. I support tlie remarks of the honourable member for Lang( Mr Mulcahy) regarding non-revenue producing property held by pensioners. I know of one case in which the pensioner offered the land to the department for nothing if he could receive his full pension, because the land was of no value to him, and was, in fact, a liability instead of an asset. The land is situated in the bush somewhere outside Bankstown, and there is no prospect of its being of any value for many years to come, r'i4i I desire to bring under the notice of the Treasurer the case of an Australian-born seaman whose home is in Australia, and who was employed under Australian articles on a ship trading to the islands. There he fell sick, and became incapacitated, but because he was incapacitated members. but, although he outside Australia, he was refused a pension. a pension ex gratial Treasurer will lay down some definite policy for pensions officials to follow. At the present time, even though the officials I ask the Treasurer to give careful consideration to all these matters, and also to satisfy himself that the method adopted for determining the rate of pension is, in all circumstances, quite fair. Nearly allhonorable members agree that serious anomalies in administration have been disclosed, but supporters of the Government, while complaining of} hardships that have been inflicted upon pensioners, hesitate to support their representations by their votes. member will not be in order in pursuing that line of argument; under this vote he is entitledto discuss only the administration of the Department of the Treasury. is a has been in charge of tlie administration, I have not troubled him greatly with cases that have come under my notice. I deal with the Commissioner or his Deputy in Sydney. But it should be possible, in this committee, to induce the honourable gentleman to take action to appoint a panel of doctors in the Sydney metropolitan area. Perhaps he will also consider favourably the suggestion that the department should take from pensioners non-revenue producing properties which, they say, are a handicap instead of an asset.

I cannot agree with the statement of the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) that the amount of income tax outstanding is steadily declining from the high point it reached in the worse year of the depression. As a matter of fact the report of the Commissioner of Taxation shows that the amount of income taxation outstanding on the SOth June last was greater than in the previous year.

It must be apparent that the proportion of tax assessed and not collected is rising instead of falling, parshould give the committee some informaticularly having regard to the remissions which have been made. It seems unquestionable that there is a greater amount of tax outstanding in proportion to the amount assessed than was the case some years ago.' In the particular group of income tax debtors for whom an extension of time or permission to pay by instalments has been granted, there appears to have been an extraordinary upward movement during the last year. 30th June, 1934, there were 6,779 cases for which an extension of time or permission to pay by instalments had been granted, and the amount of tax involved was £726,000. But last year the number in that group increased to 7,049-abou t 270 more-bu t the amount of tax involved had increased from £726,000 to £1,671,000. appears to be an extraordinarily large amount to be due by taxpayers who have applied for an extension of time in which to pay or who have been granted permission to pay by instalments. administering the Taxation Department should be asked to explain why within the last twelve months there has been such a . large increase in the pro-, portion of taxes due to the tax assessed, when, as a matter of .general knowledge, if the budget is any criterion, the capacity of taxpayers to improve their position has definitely increased. Many have had very substantial advantages by remissions of taxes and because of the improved conditions in industry. This matter requires a much fuller explanation than has heen given to the committee. Will the Treasurer state what action Ids department has taken during the last twelve mouths to collect money due to the Government by the purchasers of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers? So far as I can gather from, the facts set out in the Auditor-General's Mr Cwrlvn. report, the amount due in 1933was £778,330. If no payments were made sumption is that approximately £110,000 must be added to the total outstanding in 1934. I do not know whether that is or is not so, but in any case the Treasurer tion concerning the collection of moneys due from a company which purchased a very substantial Commonwealth asset.

Thursday, 21 November. 1985, | Quorum formed.] ThatI desire to refer to the failure of the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) or the Treasury officials responsible for the collection of debts due to the Commonwealth to collept the. amount owing to the CommonThose wealth in respect of the sale of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers. After reading the Auditor-General's report regarding this matter, it appears that there has been serious neglect on the part of the Government or the Treasury officials in allowing the purchasers of the vessels of that line by fraudulent means to escape the payment of-purchase money amounting to over £700,000. In order to impress the committee with the importance of this matter, I draw attention to the report of the Auditor-General, who not only says that these things are happening and have happened, but also says that on more than one occasion he has drawn attention to the fact that this money is outstanding and remains uncollected. The Auditor-General statesIn my report for 1932-33, I gave many details concerning the purchase of the vessels of tlie Commonwealth Government Line by the White Star Line. The vessels originally cost the Commonwealth about £7,500,000. They were purchased by the White Star Line for",68,Paiks
325,Mr Rosevear (Dalley) [12.31 A.m.].,"£l,9UO,0O0, of which at the 30th June, 1933, there was a balance owing to the Commonwealth (including interest) of £002,098. As no further payments, either of interest or principal, have' been made, the amount now owing to the Commonwealth has increased to £778,330* The White Star Line is now in liquidation, and its affairs are mixed up with various subsidiary companies in a manner which it is not practicable to deal with in this certain company whose shares he proreport. About three years ago, tlie vessels bought by the White Star Line for £1,900,000 wore solcl for £500,000 to a newly-formed company in which the White Star Line held a "" substantial' financial interest"" through another subsidiary company. In my earlier report, I criticized somewhat severely the misleading character of the statement of tlie chairman of the White Star Line to shareholders concerning this transaction, as well as the complaint of the chairman that his company had ibeen tlie victims of a very hard bargain by the Commonwealth. As I pointed out, this very fine fleet of vessels, which cost tlie Commonwealth originally £7,500,000, was resold for £500,000 only, and the asset forming the security for the payments due to the Commonwealth now seems to have.disappeared through the manipulations of the company with its subsidiaries. In the winding up of the White Star Line, the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company lodged proof of debt for £2.440,000 plus interest-seriousl y prejudicing the Commonwealth position. When the Commonwealth objected to the claim ranking for dividend, the claim was withdrawn and one for only £60 substituted. AU that now can be done is to await developments, but as far as the accounts show, it is unlikely that the Commonwealth will recover as much as £300,000. It is my contention that either the Government or the Treasury officials have been guilty of neglect, which should be dealt with in a. very severe manner. There is not the slightest doubt that both the Government and the Treasury officials were warned of the type of individual with whom they were dealing, for shortly after the line was sold to Lord Kylsant, that gentleman was gaoled in Great Brita in for having fraudulently sold the shares of a shipping company. The CHAIBMAN "" ( Mr Prowse) Order! The honourable member w ill not be in order in pursuing his remarks along those lines. tion of discussing Lord Kylsant other than to show the committee that, in view of his career overseas, the Treasury officials should have.heen warned of the type of man with whom they were dealing and should have forced h i m, before the line was sold again, to make reparation to the Commonwealth. I do not propose to deal with this subject further than to indicate the measures which should have been taken to protect the assets of the Commonwealth. As I have said, Lord Kylsant was gaoled. He had issued a fraudulent prospectus claiming that a posed to sell was making a profit, whereas it was afterwards clearly proved that the so-called profits were nothing more than hidden reserves brought into the balance sheet and produced as dividends. That, I say, should have been sufficient warning to the Treasury officers and the Government of the type of man with whom they were dealing, and they should then have taken action to recover the moneys due to the Commonwealth. conies under the Prime Minister's Department. Treasury officials are responsible for the collection of debts due to the Commonwealth. If the honourable gentleman can lightly see assets of this description taken away fro m the Commonwealth by fraudulent means, then I do not think lie f u l l y represents the electors of Grey in this Parliament. The Commonwealth disposed of an asset worth £7,500,000 for £1,900,000, and the Auditor-General's report shows that while this company was indebted to the Commonwealth for an amount of over £600,000 it sold to another shipping line through another subsidiary company in which it had a controlling interest, vessels which did not belong to it but actually belonged to the Commonwealth. When the White Star Line went into liquidation the RoyalM a i l Steam Packet Company put in a claim for £2,440,000. Thati t was a fraudulent gesture is to be seen fro m the fact that when the claim was contested in the court it was reduced to £60. Time after time, practically every month, members have asked quesI have no intentions in the House regarding this matter, but the Government has been stalling off tlie evil day when the demand for the settlemsnt of this outstanding debt should be made.

328,"Mr Rosevear ,","I take it that theI am surprised at the manner in -which about for the purpose of defrauding the rhe Treasurer dealt with the very important matter of the treatment meted out to tubercular applicants for invalid pensions. It is all very well for the Treanot, an officious officer got into communisurer to dismiss the matter by saying it is difficult to determine whether a tuberto ascertain some information about the cular applicant for a pension will be' permanently incapacitated or not. While these unfortunate people remain in the workshops and are forced even to associate with the members of their own families they constitute a menace to the health of all with whom they come in contact. The ex-Minister for Health went round the country like a travelling circus had been no occasion, in the circumadvertising his department by drawing attention to the dangers of this disease. The least that could be expected was that his colleagues would give more sympathetic treatment to those suffering from it. side the sanatoriums and are forced, through economic circumstances, to go into menace to the health of the community at large. The Treasurer has expressed doubt as to whether the departmental doctors are as bad as they are painted by applicants for invalid 'and old-age pensions. have received numerous complaints in regard to the treatment meted out by these doctors. These complaints have been made not only by disgruntled applicants whose applications have been rejected, but also by people who receive the pension, women and men, who state that had they known what they had to go through at the hands of a particular doctor in Sydney, they would not have presented themselves to him for examination. Another important point is the date of tion to the effect that he possessed the commencement of the pension. the administration of the Pensions Act on many occasions great delay takes place between the receipt of the application for the pension and the commencement of the pension. I have in mind at the moment the case of an applicant for an old-age pension who had been separated from his wife for 34 years. I think the fact that this man had been separated from his wife for 34 years would satisfy any reasonable person that it was a genuine separation, and not a separation brought Mr Rosevear. Pensions Department. In inquiring into the circumstances of the separation to discover whether it was genuine or cation with the Melbourne office in order applicant and also made inquiries concerning the whereabouts of his wife. In this way the matter was delayed for seven weeks. I brought this case under the notice of the Deputy Commissioner, who realized the fallacy of such inquiries and the pension was immediately granted. He declared that there stances, to institute all these inquiries. The point is, however, that the act definitely says that a resident of Australia, having attained the age of 65 years, shall be entitled to a pension. This man While these applicants remain outapplied for the pension when he reached that age, and there was not the slightest doubt as to his eligibility for the pension the workshops, they are a on the ground of age. But as I have said he was kept waiting for seven weeksand then when the pension was ultimately granted it was paid retrospectively for only three weeks. If a delay occurs through foolish acts on the part of an officer of the department, the pensioner I should be entitled to payment from the date of application. Some time ago, I brought under the notice of the department the case of a woman who had been separated from her husband for eighteen years. She had reared a family, and it was proved on the testimony of the members of her family and neighbours that the husband wasresponsible for the separation, and since that time he had not supported his wifeor children. The department found that he had made a sworn declaraIn only £30, but his bank book disclosed the fact that he had hundreds of pounds. He had been proved to be a liar, yet, when he said that he was prepared' to take his wife back and look after her, the department accepted his word. Thewife was paid a reduced pension, although the husband had not contributed a penny to the cost of rearing the family. The reason given for the refusal was that the husband had money and was willing to support her; but, if the husband had applied for the pension, his request would have* been refused on the ground that he had not supported his wife for eighteen years. Thus the department plays one applicant against another and "" gets it both ways "". Those. are the chaotic rulings under which the affairs of the department are administered to-day. blame It seems that either the Minister or Deputy Commissioner gives instructions foia general tightening up of the administration. In many cases, it is proved that, the medical testimony submitted on behalf of the department is misleading, and for a couple of months tlie pensioner is denied money to which he is entitled. When the pension is ultimately restored, the department escapes from payment of back money by claiming that there was reasonable ground for doubt, and that, in the circumstances, it bad acted generously. many persons are temporarily driven off the pension list. The report of the Auditor-General contains a general condemnation of the old age pensioners as a class. The language employed by this officer is quite uncalled for, and I do not think that any honourable member approves of it . Admittedly, there is a limited number of fraudulent jiensioners, but the proportion throughout small. Auditor-General's tax-dodgers reveals outstanding taxes to the amount of millions of pounds. I draw the attention of the committee to the difference between the language employed by the Auditor-Generali n his reference to persons who fraudulently escape the payment of their taxes and his remarks concerning the few old-age pensioners who attempt to defraud the department. The report statesIn the matter of questionable returns, the total income omitted by 658 taxpayers was £1,052,179. Penalties imposed in this connection amounted to £96,767. Legal proceedings were taken against 1,450 persons for recovery of the tax owing. Judgment was obtained for £49,135, with £1,077 costs. Taxpayers to the number of 1,158 who neglected to furnish returns were fined £6,260, with £469 costs. On page 40 of his report, the Auditor General remarkedI t cannot be denied, however, that the present recipients of old-age pensions include large numbers who, from extravagance, laziness, drink and general wurthlessness in their earning years, have become a burden on the community. It is interesting to know that, at the 30th June last, the following taxes were outstanding:I do not £ the Deputy Commissioner. Income tax. 4,371,882 Land tax 845,268 Estate duty 125,977 somebody higher up than the War time profits, 1915-19 .. 232,720 Sales tax .. .. 202,023 Flour tax .. .. 3,422 5,781,898 The Treasurer would find it more profitable to devote attention to'the forcing cf fraudulent taxpayers to meet their obligations than to the harassing of the old-age pensioners, because a very small proportion of them attempt to take advantage of the department. Consequently, There appears to be something wrong in regard to the sale of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers, and somebody should be brought to book over the matter. a.mj -In reply to the case which I submitted on behalf of patients in the Waterf a l l Sanatorium, the Treasurer ( Mr. Casey) endeavoured to lead the committee to believe that I have referred to the the Commonwealth is very shortness of the time allowed them to An examination of the prove that they were permanently in report regarding mates, and that he had decided to extend the period from three to six months.

These unfortunate persons suffer from tuberculosis, contracted when engaged in rock-chopping and other occupations. The delay occasioned by declaring this institution to be an asylum sometimes occurs twice a year, and by means of it the Treasury receives a considerable rake-off. Only recently has this attitude been adopted by the department, and I believe that it is due to a determination to cut down expenditure at every opportunity. The",70,Paiks

I support those honourable members who have contended that pensioners receive unfair treatment at times by some of the Government medical officers. In defending one of these officers, the Treasurer cast aspersions upon the character of other doctors,, and said that they had to earn their living. The only inference to be drawn from his remarks was that they were prepared to sell certificates as to incapacityA qualified medical officer can readily tell whether an applicant for the pension is totally incapacitated.

However, ' I do know of instances where a private doctor has been willing to certify to the total incapacity of a patient, conflicting with Referee's opinion. the Treasurer show that if the medical officers appointed by the department do not deliberately deprive anybody of the pension, they make the examination as exacting as possible in order to save money to the Treasury. The Treasurer cannot maintain that he has acted generously towards the people who enter certain institutions because I , as their representative, know that they are not satisfied, nor am I satisfied myself, by the extension of the period to six months. tuberculosis and entering such an institution will remain an inmate on his initial visit for a period of at least six months.

The line was practically given away, having been disposed of at about one-quarter of its value, and it should be the duty of the Treasury officials to see that the purchaser meets his obligations. In the collection of taxation it is remarkable how the responsible officials are so lenient when the claims are for large amounts, and how easily wealthy taxpayers can obtain extensions of time in which to pay their assessments. The honourable member for Melbourne Porta ("" Mr Holloway) wondered whether the Taxation Department was overworked. My experience of the ridiculous methods adopted by the officials, amounting to little short of persecution and sometimes bordering on the inquisitorial, convinces me that the taxation officials have plenty of time to spare. Imagine the great The cases I handle Taxation Department, metaphorically searching with a microscope, through files extending back for a period of six years, in order to collect 17s.

What has been my experience of this great department which handles millions of pounds is to my knowledge common to many taxpayers.

I hope that, the Treasurer will instruct the department to collect at once the money that is outstanding with interest added -J desire to refer briefly to the methods If it is paid immediately, there may be some funds in the Treasury to obviate the whittling away of invalid and old-age pensions. I commend the statement of the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) in which he said that a responsibility devolves on the Treasury to pay municipal rates on Commonwealth property. Bank does so. Mv, LAZZARINI I admit that the Commonwealth Bank is an exception. But the Commonwealth Government owns nearly half of the municipality of Liverpool, and pays no rates, with, the result that the municipality finds difficulty in financing its operations and in providing for adequate administration, unless it imposes a high rate on private property. The Constitution, apparently, relieves the Treasury of the obligation to pay rates, but a heavy burden is thereby imposed on municipalities. Mv. LAZZARINI -It may be legally right, but it is certainly morally wrong. Every citizen of Liverpool maintains that, the omission of the Commonwealth to pay rates and taxes on this large area of land is the one obstacle to the return of the district to prosperity, because the local governing body has difficulty in carrying on through lack of funds. What the Treasury would pay to the municipalities in rates would not amount to the remission of £200,000 which the. Treasurer yesterday granted to the wealthy taxpayers. amount to the remissions made by the series of financial relief acts. I request him to give this matter his earnest consideration, and to recognize that the municipality of Liverpool is deserving at least of a reasonable payment of rates for the use that the As a result of the movements of military vehicles to and from the camp, extra expenditure is incurred by the municipality, because heavy traffic causes the roads quickly to fall into a state of disrepair. adopted by taxation officials in connection with appeals under section 66 against the land tax assessments. Mr E. E. HARRISON -That is the hardship clause ? the procedure followed by the departmental officials is not in accordance with the intention of Parliament when it passed that section. I mention particularly the undue delay caused by the requirements of the department and of the appeal board itself, which lead to a considerable interval between the time when the appeal is lodged and when it is eventually considered by the board. From the experience of many taxpayers who have made application under this hardship provision, one could quite reasonably infer that this is not merely departmental delay, but is actually a matter of tactics on the part of the department to see whether the taxpayer will subsequently make a recovery in his transactions and so be in a more favorable position to be assessed for tlie taxes which are due by him but which he at the moment is unable to pay. Without naming the particular taxpayer, I can refer to the procedure followed in respect to one individual, who was placed in circumstances such as I have outlined. He fell into arrears of land tax. to the extent of £1,900. This man, desiring to benefit by section 66, had an opportunity to sell a small parcel of land. He negotiated the 3ale at £500, but, not having paid his land tax, he could not carry through the transfer without the consent of the taxation authorities.

That was an altogether wrong attitude for the department to adopt. It made the position of the taxpayer worse when his appeal for consideration under the hardship provisions of the act was dealt with, hecause, instead of his arrears being £1,900, they were only £1,400. The action of the department in that instance was a contravention of the intention of Parliament in regard to section 66. Bad as that case is, it is not to be compared with one which I shall now outline. A taxpayer made application on the 4th May, 1931, for relief from land tax for the year 1930-31. On the 22nd June, he received a requisition from the Deputy Commissioner for information to be supplied concerning his transactions for the year. That information he supplied to the Deputy Commissioner on the 29th September, 1931. No action having been taken, he made a further application to the Belief Board on the 15th March, 1932, in connection with his land tax for the year 1931-32. On the 21st November, 1932, he received another request from the Acting Deputy Commissioner for Taxation fov information to be supplied in connection with his transactions for the year 1931-32. On the 16th December, 1932, he supplied the information. Again, on the 29th April, 1933, he made a further application to the board for relief from land tax for the year 1932-33, no action for relief having been taken in the meantime. On the 22nd June, 1933, he received a requisition from the Deputy Commissioner for information to be supplied in respect of the year 1932-33 and on the 26th September, 1933, he supplied the information. On the 3rd January. 1934, a statement of the individual assets and liabilities of his partners as at the 30th June, 1933, was required of him by the Deputy Commissioner. February, 1934, he received a letter from the Acting Deputy Commissioner stating, first, that the application made on the 4th May, 1931, nearly three years previously, had not been submitted to the Appeal Board and, secondly, that a statement of the individual assets and liabililined, make it appear that the Taxaties of his partners as at the 30th June, 1933, was necessary in order to prepare his case for consideration by the board. On the 21st March, 1934, he received a further letter from the Acting Deputy Commissioner requiring a statement of individual assets and liabilities of his partners as at the 30th June, 1930. More than three years after his first application, for relief, the department required from him infomation relating to a period four years earlier! On the SOth April, 1934, he received a letter from the Chairman of the board informing him that his application had been referred to the Chairman of the Income Tax Board of Review for inquiry and report. On the 31st. August, 1934, he received advice that the Board of Review would deal with his application on the 24th September, 1934. On that date his appeal was heard. On the 18th December, 1934, he wrote a letter to the chairman of the board asking for a reply to his application. On the 13 th February, 1935-fou r years after he submitted his first application for reliefhe received a letter from the Commissioner, stating that the Commissioner or the board hoped to deal with his application at an early' date. On the 21st June, 1935, four years and six weeks after his first application, he was advised by the Deputy Commissioner that no relief could be given. That case shows that the intention of Parliament in regard to cases of hardship is not being observed in the administration of the Taxation Department. A few days ago I asked the Prime Minister, by way of a question in the House whether the circumstances of the taxpayer at the time that he had suffered hardship, or his circumstances at the time that his application was heard, should be the deciding factor in determining his application for relief. The reply was that the circumstances of the taxpayer both at the time he made his application and at the On the 27th time of the hearing of his appeal would be considered. Although taxpayers may be suffering heavy losses, they do not expect to continue to make losses indefinitely. The reply of the Prime Minister to my question, and the procedure adopted in the case which I have outtion Department is evading the intention of Parliament with, regard to relief by",74,Paiks
335,Mr Mcewen.,"delaying the hearing of appeals until such time as the taxpayer is again making profits. It may then be shown that it would be possible for the taxpayer to raise the funds necessary to pay the arrears of tax, in which event relief will not be granted. The experience of the taxpayer whose case I have mentioned is not unique. I trust that before this debate terminates, the Treasurer will indicate that he will alter the procedure followed by the department and see that appeals are dealt with as expeditiously as possible, so that a taxpayer who has suffered heavy losses in any year may receive that benefit which Parliament intended he should have, and not have bis case delayed in the hope that he will eventually become a profit-earning taxpayer again, and thus lose his right to relief. Such action is the more necessary as the decision of the Appeal Board is absolutely final. I wish to refer to invalid and old-age pensions and kindred subjects. I have no complaint, to make regarding the administration of the Pensions Department, for I have always found the officials sympathetic and, so far as I am competent to judge, efficient in the discharge of their duties. But in those matters in which the commissioner enjoys a discretion, one realizes that he exercises that discretion very largely in accordance with what he believes to be the policy of the government in power at tile time. His discretion naturally is influenced by the attitude of the party in power and by discussions in Parliament. Following upon what appeared to be a drive in the name of economy, I was shocked to find pensions refused to persons who obviously were ill and suffering from what even a layman could see were incurable diseases. In my own house I have met many persons, obviously totally incapacitated, who have been denied pensions. I refer, not to new applicants for pensions, but to persons, who had previously enjoyed pensions-on e hesitates to use the word "" enjoyed"" in the ease of a person in receipt of a pension, because he is suffering from an incurable disease, and is endeavouring to eke out an existence on 17s. or 18s. a weekwhich, however, had been taken from them by reason of recent medical examinations. I am bound to admit that in my limited' experience the position has recently, to some extent, been relieved. In some of the cruel cases the pension has been restored, but in others it has not. The matter of invalidity is left too much to the arbitrary decision of an individual medical man. HeU asked to answer the question: "" Is this person totally incapacitated?"" In my opinion the word "" totally "" is one introduced by regulation in violation of the statute. The medical man in answer to the question says: ""Well, no, not totally incapacitated."" That reply might technically be true regarding an incurable sufferer from tuberculosis. Such a person, however, cannot possibly obtain employment. What possible chance has any woman whose ordinary work is .domestic service, and who is a tuberculosis patient, of obtaining light duties in any home? Even the most humanely disposed person will not bring a sufferer from tuberculosis into a home, especially one which consists of young childen as well as adults. It would not be right for the head of a home to run such a risk; in fact it could not be done. Wherever work is sought, the tuberculosis sufferer will inevitably meet the response that no work is available. Such a person deprived of the invalid pension either perishes from want in a state of destitution or becomes a charge on some charitable institution or on the charity of friends. The charity of friends is always somewhat cold because people who find it hard enough themselves to live and to maintain their families will say: "" The Commonwealth provides pensions for these people if they are invalids, and if they are not invalids they ought to be working."" Their position is exceedingly difficult. Inquiry into applications for the granting of invalid pensions, I think, should be something more than a mere examination by one individual doctor. It should be an intelligent inquiry, of course, but it should be a more far-reaching inquiry as to whether by reason of the nature of the invalidity from which the applicant is suffering it is at all likely that such a person will be employed or will be able to obtain means of living by his or b""v",75,Paiks
336,Mr Brennan (Batman) [1.26 A.m.].,"exertions. From that point of view I regard the matter of the invalid pension as even more pressing and important than that of the old-age pension, hecause the hardship of invalidity is itself heavy and sometimes cruel. With the burden of extreme poverty added, the invalid pensioner's position becomes unenviable. Very little credit redounds to this country of super-abundant resources that invalids should be compelled to live in a condition of penury. Estimates are concerned, I should confidently express the hope, which, being expressed, may reach the ears of those administering the department, that the utmost care should be given to invalid pensioners and that searching inquiries should be made into each individual case of invalidity so that such a person as I have described should not be thrown on a cold world with a burden of suffering from disease, accentuated vastly by the suffering of extreme poverty. Another matter spoken of to-night, although of less importance, indicates how crudely drawn has been the section of the act which refers to separated husbands and wives. The causes of separation are not material to the granting of pensions. couple are separated in pursuance of a decree, order, judgment or by virtue of a deed of separation, their income is pooled, and they are supposed to enjoythe aggregate wealth on a fifty-fifty basis. I am quite aware that this is not the appropriate time for discussing in detail the merits of the pensions act, except insofar as administration is concerned. I know of cases where, for many years, there has been a separation understanding, and where there is no probability of the parties coming together again. There may be no ill will; there may even be perfect understanding; but, in any case, it is not the business of the Pensions Department, or of anybody else, including the Treasurer, to inquire into the cause of separation. After a few lines in the nature of a deed of separation have been subscribed, as if by magic a couple in the eyes of the Pensions Department is deemed to be separated by a deed. It is ridiculous. It is merely a formality which has no legal consequence at all, and it should not affect the Pensions Mr Brennan. Department in fixing a pension for an applicant, whether it be a husband or a wife. The only case in which a separation of parties is by actual decree is in divorce jurisdiction, whether it be by judicial separation or by decree. Reference in the pensions act to an order of the court is ambiguous. Orders of the court are made in petty sessions for the maintenance of wives and deserted children, but they do not effect separaSo far as these tions. In other courts orders are made such as the judgments of supreme courts relating to the rights of wives in regard to whom domestic difficulties have arisen with their spouses. Those supreme court judgments and divorce court decrees and separation agreements are the only instruments where there is something in the nature of a really formal separation. I suggest to the Minister that a short amendment of the pensions act would put the position on the basis that, if there is actual and permanent separation in fact between the parties, and a pension is sought, it should be granted when other circumstances justify it. If the Commissioner of Pensions is satisfied the applicants are separated, he should deal withthem on that basis, and The act says that unless the should not have to examine the separation from a technical point of view. Neither the Pensions Department nor the Government should be the censor of the morals and habits of the pensioners. A superabundance of laws is provided in this country for regulating the conduct of individuals. We have a series of courts,' from the police court upwards, dealing with all classes of offences, and the Pensions Department should not be called uuon to pay attention to matters which are capable of being dealt with by the courts of law. The courts will punish a pensioner either by fine or by imprisonment for any delinquency of which he may be guilty. If he has answered to the law, that should be sufficient. The Pensions. Department, I say, should not be the censor of public morals. What of it if it is"" true that a pensioner has a weakness in regard to alcohol? One naturally waxes indignant when a public official in a very high placeI refer to the Auditor-General-offend s to a very grave degree by making general statements entirely unsupported by evideuce, reflecting on the characters of our pensioners. This person, secure in the possession of a superabundance of this world's goods, has animadverted upon the conduct of pensioners and criticized them for what he has called their wastefulness, drunkenness, lack of provision for their old age, laziness and so on. It is easy and cheap to criticize unfortunate people in this way. I make these statements in ell seriousness because I feel deeply that the public officer concerned is deserving of the severest censure. I ask the Minister for Defence to submit the statements that I am making to the departmental officers so that they may be informed of the views of the public on these subjects, and so that we may, without undue extravagance, make provision for a more liberal administration of our invalid and old-age pensions legislation to the credit of ourselves and oui country. After all, surely the first duty of any civilized ficates recommending me for the pension .on organized community is to have regard ""for the welfare of its aged and infirm, and especially its invalid people. should not have risen again to take part in this debate had the Treasurer ( Mr The reply of the Treasurer was to the Casey) replied to the representations I made to him earlier. The matters that I raised were of considerable concern to the pensioners affected and deserved at least the courtesy of a reply. In the circumstances, I am not prepared to allow the matter to drop. I shall continue to refer to the cases that I have brought under the notice of the Treasurer until he furnishes a proper reply to my requests. I invited the attention of the honourable gentleman to the case of a person 61 years of age, suffering from chronic broiir dhitis, who, 'because he had secured a job looking, after a Government tank outback, for which he received the munificent wage of 10s. a week had his invalid pension cancelled. That .man, I submit, is entitled to the pension because his earnings are not in excess of. 12s. 6d. a week. This case was submittedto the Treasurer in writing, hut no reply has yet been received to the letter. At any rate I shall persist in my representations however long it takes me to obtain a reply AyesI wish now to direct attention again to the case of a person in my electorate who also has received scant consideration. It seems to me that the gramophone record that is sometimes played on the instrument in the lounge, "" I'm 94 today "", could well be played in this chamber to stress the absurd attitude of the department in respect to such cases as this one. The department's attitude would he humorous if the matter were not so serious to the pensioner. In this letter to me he statedI have been out of work for some considerable time and my doctor informs me that I will not work again. My father is working at the North Mine as a change house keeper, on the basic wage. He is getting up in years. He was 75 years old last July. I have a younger brother home with me also out of work. His age is 31 last January. He has been unemployed four years, last work on the mines. Myself, my age is 40 last June. My father supports both of us, and my brother still follows the mines up in the hope of getting work, but he has not hoen successful yet. Both Dr. Quinn and Dr. Dobbyn issued certithe grounds that I am unable to follow any occupation. The nature of my complaint is heart, chest and eye trouble. I am enclosing the reply I received and would be pleased if you would take up the matter with the department on my behalf. I have been unemployed about six years. following effect:The Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act provides that an invalid pension shall not be granted to a person who is adequately maintained by his relatives.

Nevertheless such responsibility must rest upon the department. The strange aspect of this incident is that a circular was issued from the Crown Law Department; a good deal of suspicion surrounds such action, particularly when we find that the department's consolidation has not yet been made available although its circular was issued three years ago. Honourable members are entitled to some explanation, if not from the Attorney-General himself, at least from his officers, of the reason for this delay. Such action does not lead to the best of feeling in the profession and there seems to be more in this incident than is apparent on the surface. I am unable to say what stage the Crown Law Office has reached in this work. The Attorney-General perhaps can give us that information. The fact remains that the two enterprising barristers to whom T have referred spent long hours burning the midnight oil and went to much expense to produce a publication which has been favourably commented upon by those competent to judge the merits of such a work, and the attitude taken up by the Crown Law Office in these circumstances seems to me to be most unjust. I would like the Attorney-General to give some explanation of this matter or at least to inform the committee whether the department genuinely intends to prepare a consolidation of Commonwealth Statutes, and when we may expect this publication to be completed I feel indebted to the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) for having mentioned the matter of the consolidation of Commonwealth Statutes. The work of consolidating the Commonwealth Statutes as up to the year 1911 was undertaken by the Crown Law Department, the present Solicitor-General, who then occupied a relatively subordinate position being mainly responsible for the work. The intention at that time was that a consolidation should be made at least, every ten years; but the intervention of the war, which disturbed our social activities in so many ways, to i\ degree prevented the department from carrying out its intention, as much additional work consequent on the war was thrust on the department. The consolidation of Commonwealth Statutes by Messrs. O'Sullivan and McGrath, the advantages of which we are now enjoying, was commenced and indeed was far advanced before it was brought under my knowledge at that time.' I am pleased to say that I gav.e every encouragement to those gentlemen who, largely from a sense of public spiritedness, devoted their very considerable talents to supplying an urgent need in publishing a consolidation of the Commonwealth Statutes. I will not say that the department over which I then presided frowned upon their efforts-that would perhaps be unfair to those loyal officers with whom I had the honour to be associated in the Crown Law Office-bu t I think there was a feeling in the department that the work should be carried out by the Crown along the lines originally intended but which, as I have pointed out, had to be abandoned. The Attorney General may now be in a position to tell us whether a consolidation by the department is in immediate prospect. It is a big work, and of course, it is necessary that consolidation should be kept up. The profession, at all events, would like to know what the department intends to do in this matter. Some time ago we were informed in the public press that a new body of police was to be appointed. I do not know how far that statement was officially inspired, or how far it was true. No doubt the Attorney-General can throw some light on it. men were provided with uniforms. That was all there was in it. Mi-. BRENNAN I do not know, and I am now asking what truth there was in the published statement. I should also like to know to what extent the function.* of these new police officers, if they are t.o be appointed, will coincide with those of the officers of the Commonwealth In vestigation Branch? endorse the statements of the two previous speakers with regard to the consolidation of the statutes of this Parliament by two Sydney barristers.

The point was then stressed that the previous Government had more or less given an undertaking to these two barristers that if they proceeded with the woTk the officers of the Crown Law Department would not undertake a similar work for a considerable time. It may be argued that there has been a change of government since then, but it is usual, in matters of this kind, for new governments to honour the undertakings of their predecessors. It was also mentioned during the previous debate that the two barristers circularized the legal offices stating that they had undertaken the work, and shortly afterwards other circulars on stationery of the Attorney-General's Department were distributed stating that the work of consolidation was being undertaken by the officers of that department. The result was that the sale of the legal books prepared by the two barristers was prejudiced, though they had been highly recommended. The matter has been raised in this House several times, but no satisfactory explanation has been offered as to why, if the circulars were not issued officially from the Attorney General's office, they should have been written on the stationery of that department. This is an opportunity for the Attorney-General to give an explanation of the matter, and perhaps he will also be able to say when the' work of consolidation is to be carried out. It may be relevant to point out that one of the two barristers who prepared the consolidation, which the official of the Attorney General's Department caused to be boycotted, had been an official Labour candidate for Parliament. It seems obvious that that had something to do with the action taken to spoil the sale of the books. Provision is made for expenses in conprosecution is successful or not.

Some years ago I suggested that a branch of the Crown Solicitor's Office should be established in Brisbane. Branches already exist in Sydney and Melbourne. Brisbane is the third largest capital city in the Commonwealth, and is entitled to a branch of the Commonwealth Crown Law Office. Upon investigation I have learned that the firm of Chambers, McNab and Company, in Brisbane, has been receiving over £1,000 a year from the Commonwealth for carrying out legal work on its behalf. It would probably cost more than that to maintain a Crown Law Office branch in Brisbane, but we should not look at this matter only from the pecuniary point of view. The Crown Law Department decides whether prosecutions shall be launched in respect of alleged offences against Commonwealth laws, and in Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne, this decision is made by impartial officers of the department. In Brisbane, the decision is made by members of a private legal firm. Without casting any aspersions on the firm's integrity, I think I am justified in pointing out that the more prosecutions it recommends the more it will profit. The system is somewhat like that which prevailed in the past when judges were paid according to the number of cases they heard. If a branch of the Crown Law Office were established in Brisbane old-age and invalid pensioners, who often do not know whether they have broken the law or not, and who cannot afford to get legal advice, would be assured of just treatment, because prosecutions would be launched against them only when there was a reasonable case. When members of a private company recommend a prosecution they know that they will be paid whether the A consolidated ment must pay the legal firm which repre-",80,Pairs

There is a State Crown Solicitor's Department in Queensland which renders a useful service to the community. On several occasions, I . have urged that sittings of the High Court should be held at regular intervals in every capital city, and I am pleased to know that my representations have been successful. The High Court now sits at regular intervals in the capital city of each State. I hope that this most desirable practice will be continued. Several years ago, when the present High Commissioner in London was Prime Minister, a comprehensive bankruptcy bill, consisting of over 50 pages, was introduced, but as it was brought forward late in the session, the pressure of other public business prevented discussion before its passage. That legislation altered substantially the whole foundation of bankruptcy law in Australia, and contained provisions which are not to be found in the bankruptcy law in any other country. [«51 other measures, the honourable member tralia was pioneering the way. to which I refer were calculated to be of advantage to Australia, there would be good reason to be proud of the fact that this country was leading the world, but I fail to see why we should give a lead by placing on our statute-book legislation which, in some respects, may be regarded as reactionary. As I have stated, there was not sufficient time to discuss the bill, but, after consultation with the then Prime Minister, a committee was appointed, consisting of representatives of the different parties in the House, to consider the proposals. The honourable member for Darling Downs( Sir Littleton Groom), an ex-Attorney General of the Commonwealth, was chairman of the committee which held nineteen sittings and acquired a considerable amount of information concerning suggested alterations to the bill. Communications were received from the Chambers of Commerce and other representative commercial bodies throughout the Commonwealth.

I understand that the suggestion now is that the committee of members of this House shall again he asked to consider the proposed legislation. If this course is adopted, I hope that the Government will expedite the sittings of the committee, and that Parliament will be given an early opportunity to deal with the bill.

General) [2.43 a.m.] -The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) was correct in pointing out that the office of Conciliation ""Whether it is desirable or necessary to fill the position will be determined by the amount of work available. In case an appointment should be necessary it is desirable to have the salary covered by appropriation. Bumours have been published from time to time with reference to the position of a judge in bankruptcy; but all I can say is that I know of no foundation for the suggestion that there will be a retirement, and therefore a vacancy, or that any particular person will be appointed to fill such vacancy.. The increase of expenditure in the Patents Office is due to the fact that provision has been made for five additional examiners of patents, one examiner of trade marks, three clerks, two assistants and three messengers. All these increases, which have been made with the concurrence of the Public Service Board, arise from the. fact that there has been an enormous increase of the work in the Patents and Trade Marks Department. In fact, the work has fallen so much into arrears that the section of the public which deals with patents and trade marks has complained of delay. It has been our endeavour to overcome the difficulty hy officers working overtime, and by employing temporary assistance, which is extremely unsatisfactory in a department in which expert knowledge is required. Consequently, in order to cope with the greater volume of work, increased expenditure and an increase of staff have become necessary. ( Mr Prowse) The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), and the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Baker) referred to the consolidation of Commonwealth statutes. I do not wish to tell the members of the committee a long story concerning this matter, because probably some of them have heard it before. I may, however, point out that no hostility exists in my department towards the private publication of Messrs. Sullivan and McGrath, as such. Indeed, I purchased a copy myself, and, if I remember correctly, paid for it. It 'is a useful work, but is not a consolidation of the statutes in the true, sense; it is an ordinary compilation. There is a Commissioner is vacant. great difference between the two, having regard to tlieir utility to the public. I entirely agree with the views of a previous Attorney-General, that there ought to be a periodical consolidation of the Commonwealth statutes.

When I assumed office as Attorney General representations were made to me on behalf of those responsible for the private publication, that the circulars should not be issued in connection with the proposed consolidation, and that a reasonable interval should be allowed before its publication, so that further sales of the private publication might be made, and agreements entered into with buyers be honoured. I thought that the request was reasonable, and I undertook that there would not be any further circularizing in connection with the publication being prepared by the Commonwealth until approximately the end of the present year, thus giving an additional year of grace to the private publication. I think that honourable members w ill agree that that was a f a i r attitude to adopt. The suggestion of the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Baker) that the private publication was treated in a hostile manner by the Crown Law Department because one of its compilers had been a Labour candidate for Parliament is one which I hope, upon reflection, he w ill uot pursue. In the first place, it is an extraordinary suggestion to make against a public department, and secondly I shall reinforce the honourable member's knowledge of the case by saying that, although he may be right in stating that one of the compilers had been a Labour candidate for Parliament, the principal publisher who was incurring the risk is a prominent member of the United Australia party. quently, if any person responsible for the administration of the Crown Law Department at that time was attempting to inflict in j u r y upon some gentleman because he was a Labour candidate, he was in j u r in g one of his friends a great deal more.
