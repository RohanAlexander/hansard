So let us bear that in mind when we look gaging in a re-trial. However, I am putting to at this question tonight. honourable members that it is somewhat naive of Mr Justice Cross, and I make that criticism, to We are not talking about standards; we are place great reliance upon that feature. talking about numbers. We are talking about politics, about ideologies, about personalities.

Is there any member in this . Every single one of the speeches which have been House who really thinks that the right honourable given by honourable members opposite has conmember is lacking in nerve and in stamina? If he tained in one way or another a lamentable had decided to fabricate something, would he not attempt to rerun it trial which has been held-a see it through? What is one of the hallmarks of an trial which the right honourable member for New honest witness giving evidence four years later England had to go through for many months and on? It is inconsistency in recollection and inconwhich resulted in his acquittal. I had thought that sistency in testimony. If a man comes into a court most of us believe that once one was acquitted by or to any other kind of inquiry and gives evidence an Australian jury, that was fair enough. Surely which is absolutely consistent, which is on all we know that the Special Minister of State will fours with what one would expect and which fits never face an Australian jury in regard to the like a glove, and if he gives the kind of evidence minor peccadillo that he committed by simply which might be expected of him, the first thing betraying a high secret of state. So let us therefore one must ask oneself is: 'Where did this brilliant remember that acquittal by an Australian jury is a witness come from? Where did he get such a sufair mark and one that should have us say: 'Right, perb recollection of events? How is it that he is he has had his trial. That is the result. Let us put it not inconsistent in anything that he says?' The aside and let, us accept the jury's verdict upon reason one asks those questions, as every honourhim'. able member here knows, is that one would find it very hard to remember what one said two days I come now to some of the criticism made by ago, let alone four years ago, or to remember the the Treasurer ( Mr Keating), whose rambling, inevents of a dinner party or a luncheon party a coherent discourse was a sad reflection on a man week ago, let alone one which was held four years who seemed to have some kind of intellect and caago.
