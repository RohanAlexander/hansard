The self-governing colonies in future will be styled generally dominions. circumstances, it has been and the suggestion appears to be an appropriate one, that a message from this Parliament might be a graceful recognition of the fact that our ties with New Zealand are necessarily closer than those which unite us to any other outlying portion of the Empire. We are not only of one stock, but our whole advance the whole trend and character of our legislation, and the whole character of our communities are identical. Marching side by side, we have naturally, not only the warmest regard for, but the deepest interest in, the future of that great and progressive State. There is really no change made except in the official status of New Zealand; but the occasion is being celebrated there, and a message from the Parliament of the Commonwealth will, I venture to believe, be very acceptable to the people of New Zealand.

When the hand of illness is heavy upon even one's bitterest political opponent, I hope that all political rivalry and feeling expires in the shadow. . of such an affliction. I trust that the Prime Minister, in his desire to devote himself to his public duties, will remember that he may, by over devotion, not render the service he desires to render_to the country. With regard to tlie subject now before the Chamber, I confess that I never attach much importance to questions involved in the names by which British communities are known. But, I think the Prime Minister has done well in seizing this opportunity to express to the people and Government of New Zealand the very strong admiration and affection we feel for that great country. As titles change, and as these growing States rise in the order of national importance, I trust that, great as their future destinies may be, we shall find them always consistent in their loyal der votion to the integrity to the Empire of Under the which we all form a part. I hope I may be permitted to add my support to the motion. The reason I desire . to do so is, that I aim particularly interested in the new dominion, seeing: that my wife is a New Zealander. I have very great pleasure in supporting the motion of the Prime Minister that the congratulations of this Parliament be sent to the Government and people of New Zealand.

But when there is a Tariff which is sure not to pass ' Sir WILLIAM LYNE able member does not know that. sure not to pass in its present for m ; and, therefore, the losses and difficulties are enormously intensified. I suppose there never has been a Tariff proposed which has more severely inconvenienced the community. I do not propose to enter upon the consideration of the fiscal question at the present moment, but I think honourable members on both sides desire to lessen the inconvenience to the people as much as possible. I wish, however, to express my great regret that this Bill has been interposed, with the result that, though it was thoroughly discussed in another place for, I think, some weeks, it is, apparently, going through this House without any consideration at all. We on this side are anxious to relieve the present uncertainty in reference to the T a r if f ; and, for my own part, I shall not help the Government in further evading the consideration by the Committee of Ways and Means of their fiscal proposals. 1 would rather be inclined to allow these Bills to go through without a word, as a roundabout way of compelling the Government to proceed with the Tariff. . Here is a chance presented to the Government to introduce half-a-dozen more B ill s ; although I really think we are getting into a state as regards legislation which is not worthy of the House. I sympathize with the Government in the affectionate' trustfulness with which they have regarded the Opposition. Ministers seem to think tliat it is the mission of the Opposition to look after the interests of the Government, when the Government cannot look after those interests for themselves. I had a lively experience of the Acting Prime Minister when he was leader of the Opposition and I was Premier; and I cannot remember that during that five years he ever sent me even a whisper when he had a dagger sharpened for me. That is a teen votes of censure in one session. thirteen; but one does not mind votes of censure of that description. I entirely sympathize with the Opposition in their attitude towards this B ill .

I am told that in consequence of their failure to maintain their position in the House the Government were so frenzied that they threatened an all-night sitting in order that this measure-which , with the exception, perhaps, of the Prime -Minister and the Attorney-General, Ministers know nothing about-shoul d be passed. I think that if the Ministry would display the same spirit in dealing with the work which the country is asking them to conclude, it would be well. Why has not the real Minister of Trade and Customs insisted on an immediate settlement of the Tariff? Why does he not exercise the power which he possesses ? ber is not in order in discussing that matter. about it.

If he is, then I shall claim the same latitude. orable member for Dalley will not interrupt the proceedings of the House. sir. orable member will not disregard the Standing Orders under whiph we carry on our work.

Unless that rule be observed, misHave the Governunderstandings may arise as to the business before the Chair, and votes may be cast under a 'misapprehension. The honourable member for Riverina has called attention to the fact that the right honourable member for East Sydney was transgressing the Standing Orders, but I would .remind him that the honourable gentleman said a few moments before that he was merely referring incidentally to the Tariff. thing more to say. Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [3.3] I hope that the few remarks I have to offer will not disturb the placid temper which the leader of the Opposition has displayed. I desire, however, to take exception to one or two observations made by him as to the delay in dealing with the Tariff, and also as to the interposition of the Judiciary Bill at this stage. In reply to several questions, I made it clear on three or four occasions that this measure, as well as two others, would be taken at the termination of the general debate on the Budget,-and the passing of the Works and Buildings Estimates. I do not know whether the leader of the Opposition was aware that it was intended in the first instance to proceed with this measure prior to the general debate on the Budget, and that, as I have said, I subsequently intimated on three or four occasions, that the Judiciary Bill and one or two other measures would be dealt with at this stage. This intention on the part of the Government was well known to the House, and the Judiciary Bill was proceeded with yesterday in accordance It will be with the plan of business which we had mapped out. I do not wish to make any insinuations, but I feel bound to say that the delay in dealing with the Tariff has I am putting things right, been due largely to the inordinate length of the debate on the Budget, and to the fact that four or five days were occupied in dealing with the Works and Buildings Estimates. member insist upon three or four' all-night sittings ?

The Government considered that the passing of this B ill was a matter of importance, and determined, therefore, to adhere to its previously-expressed determination to proceed with it yesterday. the Seat of Government B ill in the same category? has been saying for four or five years that the passing of that measure is a matter of importanceSir WILLIAM LYNE the honourable member will, not lose the good humour with which he entered upon this debate. It has been said in reply to questions addressed to Ministers that the Seat of Government Bill will be submitted this session, but I do not think it will be dealt with until this House has disposed of the Tariff. When we resume the discussion of the Tariffi t is our intention that it shall be uninterruptedly proceeded with unless special circumstances arise which render that course impossible. So far as we know at present there is no business which need be interposed when once we proceed to discuss the schedule. I trust that we shall have the assistance of the leader of the Opposition and his party in dealing expeditiously with the Tariff. I know that it would be unreasonable to expect them to agree to the class of Tariff that I fa.vour, but I trust, at all events, that they will not indulge in "" stonewalling."" It would be foolish to .suggest that a Tariff should not be fairly discussed, and no one will complain of any reasonable discussion of items which may fairly be debated. If the business set down for consideration to-day is disposed of tonight, we shall be prepared to-morrow to go on with the Tariff. As to fne B ill now under consideration, the Government had hoped that the discussion which had been foreshadowed would take place on the motion for the second reading. As I have said on several occasions, we did not anticipate that much time would be occupied in dealing with it , since it was a measure likely to interest only the lawyers in the House. We were under the impression that the discussion desired by some honourable members would take place on the motion for the second reading of the B ill , and that we should be able, in the ordinary course of events, to reach the report stage last night. It was only after great loss of time that we were able, about 10.30 last night, to proceed with the debate. The Government saw that, if they were to get the Bill out of the way within a reasonable time, in order that the Tariff might' be proceeded with, they must insist on going through with it , and I venture to think that had honourable members followed the W ill the Government put lines adopted by the honourable member for Angas0 ber did not stop to listen to his speech. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I did. The honourable member for Angas discussed the I trust that Bill dispassionately and threw a good deal of light upon it. It appeared probable that only three or four honourable members would discuss it at any length., and had we proceeded in the ordinary course we should have disposed of the measure about 11.30 last night without any "" jump Jim Crow"" business. the House adjourned. that was after the Opposition had virtually walked out of the House. speak the sitting would have been prolonged. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I do not wish to engage in any recriminations. I did not attempt to pass the B ill through the thirdreading stage last night, because I considered that those who desired to place on record their views in regard to it should have an opportunity to do so at this stage. gained nothing by the attitude which they took up last night? Thev might just as well have allowed a general debate on the second reading to take place in a proper manner last night. action of .the Opposition we were prevented from dealing with the Bill in what the honourable member would describe as a proper manner. If the Government had not known how to ""act in the emergency which arose the debate on the second reading of the Bill would have been blocked for two or three days.

Sir WILLIA M LYNE I shall be sorry if any unpleasantness arises, and I hope that honourable members generally will try to be as placid as the leader of the Opposition is to-day. under the impression that the question before the Chair was the motion for the third reading of the Judiciary B ill ; but although I have listened carefully to the Actfutile, because we cannot amend it, and it ing Prime MinisterI have heard nothing from him save a reference to an incident which took place yesterday, and a few pleasant observations about the leader of the Opposition. The attitude taken up by him may be a judicious one, but I fail to see that his observations were at all relevant to the Bill. I do not think it can be said that he has thrown any light upon it. The honourable member, for Angas, -who is well able to deal with the issues raised by the Bill, had the misfortune, last night, to speak to what were practically empty benches. If this measure be as important as it is said to be, I am surprised that at least the lawyers of the House did not remain to criticise, or endorse, his arguments. It may be said that I am simply indulging in the wild ravings of a layman, but I would point out that the leader of the Labour Party last -merit urged that the passing of this Bill was a matter of great importance, since we had to determine whether the High Court of Australia or the Privy Council should be the final arbiter on all questions relating to the Constitution. In reply to an interjection he said that he would not care if this measure were applied to cases that were now sub judice^ I should like to know whether this is"" a move to overcome a difficulty which has occurred between the Government of the Commonwealth and that of New South Wales-.

IRVINE -If it is passed, that: will certainly be necessary.

The Acting Prime Minister last night attempted to force the measurethrough the House at all hazards; but now he invites the legal members to criticise it, knowing that such criticism will be is not likely that the third reading will benegatived. I understand that the Bill allows an appeal from the decision of a. single Judge of a State Court to the High Court, passing by the Supreme Courts of the States. 1 rangement will only make things better for the wealthy litigant.

If I had enough talent to be a lawyer, I should welcomethis measure as likely to increase my opportunities for employment, because, if I missed Brown when before a single Judge, I might catch him in the High Court. If the High Court is to supersede the SupremeCourts, it will be farcical to allow them tocontinue in existence. What need will there be for a Supreme Courti f appealscan, be taken direct from a single Judge to the High Court?

I asked if two are ready. honourable member's face showed that he thought, not only that two are ready, but that they are too ready.. Courts are appointed, will there be appeals from their decisions to the f u l l Bench? These are fair questions to ask, and a lay member cannot be blamed for resisting the Bill until they are answered. I shall be justified in voting against the third reading if I do not get f u l l information on the subject. for Angas spoke strongly against the measure last night, and the legal members of the House ought to deal with his criticism. If they support him, I shall be justified in voting with other .honourable members against the third reading. As to the constitutional position that the Labour Party thinks so much of, I should like to know whether the Bill will arm the High Court with more power to deal with the Premier -of New South Wales. While I like the idea of the unity of the Empire, and would permit appeals to the Privy Council on most matters, there' can be no better authority than the High Court, composed as it is of Australians familiar with the ideals and desires of the Australian people, for the interpretation of our Constitution. Each of the Justices of the High Court has been at some time in his life largely instrumental in framing the Constitution, and the Chief Justice is unquestionably one of the highest constitutional Authorities in Australia. Sixteen or seventeen years ago he was greatly complimented for his draftsmanship in connection with the Constitution prepared by the Convention over which the late Sir Henry Parkes presided. Whatever our opinions of him politically may be, we must admit his pre-eminent ability as a lawyer who played a most important part during the early stages of the Federal movement.

110,Mr Crouch,"In the first place I def r o m initiating public bills which would create a charge upon the people by the imposition of local and other rates, or which deal with the administration or employment of those charges. Bills which thus infringe the privileges of the Commons, when received from the Lords, are either laid aside or postponed for six months. It follows, accordingly, that the Lords may not amend the provisions in Bills which they receive from the Commons dealing with the above-mentioned subjects, so as to. alter, whether by increase or reduction, the amount of a rate or charge-it s duration, mode of assessment, levy, collection, appropriation or management; or the persons who pay, receive, manage, or control it. it may be argued that this Bill does not absolutely tax any of the citizens of the Commonwealth, but merely declares that they shall be liable to taxation imposed by the States-in other words, that they shall no longer be exempted from it. But I would point out that this very class of B ill has been considered by the House of Commons, as will be seen by reference to page 581 of May. readA Bill to continue the Crime and Outrage (Ireland) Act 1854, was introduced in the Lords, but as the Act contained sections which authorized charges upon the county cess and the Consolidated Fund, a clause was inserted which excepted those sections from the operation of the Bill. In other words, it was admitted that the very extension of the Act to Ireland necessitated the insertion of a clause which exempted certain sections from the operation of the measure. agreed to by the House of Commons, and of taxation .was delegated.

To quote again from May. at the same pageWhen the Lords, by an amendment, extended the Contagious Diseases Prevention B i ll 1846 to Scotland and Ireland, as the B ill contained rating clauses, they inserted a clause providing that the rating power conferred by the B ill should not be thereby extended. the Commons disagreed; the Lords did not insist thereon, and thus the whole Bill was extended to Scotland and Ireland. Dealing with the Bill under consideration, that we withdraw an exemption from I would point out that in four States of ' taxation. the Commonwealth there are laws which But impose income tax upon certain persons. officer be taxed where he was not taxed In this Bill the Senate has declared that before, it must be an increase of taxation that tax shall be levied upon certain other of the people.

I , legislation, have to pay an increased amount hold that a proposed law imposing taxation cannot originate in the Senate. In this connection, I should like to refer to a. decision which you, sir, gave in 1903, in reference to the Sugar Bounties Billa decision in which Sir Edmund Barton, Mr Isaacs, and the honourable member for East Sydney acquiesced, namely, that the Senate had no right to extend the area of taxation. The Sugar BountiesB i ll of 1903 imposed taxation for the purpose of granting sugar bounties. That measure was forwarded to the Senate, where aln amendment was inserted extending the period during which the bounty was payable by two or three months, thus increasing the charge upon the people, and also enlarging the area of taxation. When the B ill was returned to this House you, sir, took up the position that the Senate had not the right to insert such an amendment, because . it increased the charge upon the people. The matter was There honourable . members will submitted to the House, and the gentlemen to whom I have referred all held that it was an improper assumption of right by the Senate, and, consequently, the proposal of the other branch of the Legislature was disagreed with, and the B ill was returned to it. Quite apart from the question of whether the Senate and the House of Representatives are parallel bodies to the House of Lords and the House of Commons' That exemption was the honourable member has cited the power venue; and, as I understand, the argument is that because we do not get the revenue, the B ill does not impose taxation on the people.

I do not think there can be any doubt that the answer is in the affirmative ; and, therefore, I think that the Bill infringes the Constitution, and the privileges of the people's House. This is aserious matter, because it appears to me that all the income tax cases lead to litigation. This is different from ordinary State legislation, in regard to which the Governor's final acceptance is sufficient. In the case of the Commonwealth there is a printed Constitution; and, therefore, the question as to the legality of this legislation originated in the Senate will"" have to be taken to the Courts. a ruling forthwith, because the honourable member for Corio was good enough to intiunate to me, when the Bill came down, that he would, at some period of its passage, raise the point to which he has just -addressed himself. After a very careful examination of the matters to which the honourable member has just referred, and of others bearing on the question, I desire to point out, first, that there is ho parallel -between this case and the case of the Sugar Bounties Bill which he cited. In that case there was undoubtedly a proposal to appropriate revenue, but in this case the Bill does not appropriate our revenue or any other revenue for any purpose whatever. Nor do I think there is a parallel between this case and the two cases in British practice referred to. In both of those .cases the question of levying either a tax or a rate for the purposes of the British Treasury was distinctly included, while in' this -case there is no proposition to effect any levying of money on any person, to come within the reach of the Federal Treasurer. ""We have here a Bill which deals, not with the income of the Federation, but with the incomes of the States; we contemplate taxation, not by the Commonwealth, but taxation by some, though not all, of the States which at present form the Commonwealth. -'The Bill professedly makes provision to take away some protection which has hitherto been' extended to several public servants, -from the operation of State taxation.

The enacting clauses indicate clearly that this is not a Bill to either appropriate revenue or moneys or to levy taxation; and therefore, I rule, without any hesitation, that the Bill does not come within the provisions of section 53 of the Constitution. I may say, further, that if I had thought the Bill did come within those provisions, and that its introduction in another place, and its transmission to this House, contravened our rights, it would have been my duty to call attention to the fact on its arrival, or as soon as I became aware of what it purported to do. I rule that the Bill is properly before us-that it was not improper for it to originate where it did; and that it is in no sense a Bill for either the appropriation of moneys or for the taxation -of the people far the benefit of the Com'-monwealth Treasury. torney-General) [3.50] I now move That this Bill be now read a second time. The object of this measure is to enabre the allowances and salaries of officers of the Commonwealth and of -members of Parliament, earned in a State, to be subject to taxation, in common with the ordinary salaries of the citizens of the State. The question of the liability of Federal officials and Federal members of Parliament has been the subject of discussion for some time in the Commonwealth of Australia. The question, as I stated yesterday, and as honourable members well know, arose in the case of Deakin -v. Webb and Lyne v. Webb, in which it was held that Federal Ministers were ex? empt from State taxation. ' That was the effect of fhe ruling; and the matter of the taxation by the State of Federal officials -was taken to the Privy Council in the later case of Outtrim v. Webb, whereupon the Privy Council decided that Commonwealth officials were subject to the State taxation. The matter came up again ' before the High Court in ""Baxter's case.; and the High Court reaffirmed 'its previous decision that Federal officials were not liable to State taxation' by way of income tax.

140,Mr Groom,"I shall go into detailsnaturally arises, assuming the judgment of tiie High Court to be right, what power have we to pass this legislation? That is a fundamental question, which honourable members are entitled to address to me. There are several authorities which I shall submit for the consideration of the House, and on which, I think, I can show that we have the right to pass this legislation. In the first place, I refer to a passage in the majority judgment in Baxter's case, which may be found in 4 C.L.R., on page 1133 of the authorized reports. The Chief Justice saidWe pass to the minor questions remaining for determination. tax upon the emoluments of Federal officers is within the prohibition is a minor question, for the Federal Parliament can make its grants subject to such a tax. Quilibet renunhare fotest juri i>ro se introducto. The majority of the Court stated in that case that the Federal Parliament could make its grants of salaries subject to this tax. At a.later stage, on the application for a certificate for leave to appeal, the Chief Justice, in referring to the two waiys of putting an end to this conflict, saidThe other way in which the inconvenience can be remedied is one which was pointed out in the judgment of the majority of this Court delivered yesterday. The Federal Parliament can, if it pleases, make its grants to its servants subject to the right of the States to tax them. It is only fair to point out to the House manner control, the operations of the constituthat Mr Justice Higgins dissented from tional laws enacted by Congress to carry into that view, sayingAs to the other suggestion, that the Federal Parliament may make its grants of salary subject to the rights of the States to tax them, I merely refer to it, because I .do not at present want to be committed to any definite view on the subject. At present I cannot see how, if an income tax upon the salary of a Federal servant is made invalid by the Constitution, the Federal Parliament can alter the Constitution by making the income tax payable. However, I do not wish to make any final pronouncement on the suggestion, which, as far as my memory serves me, has not been mentioned before in this Court. What he said, in effect, was "" I shall make no final pronouncement upon this subject, since the matter has riot been argued:"" Justice against another. justices on the bench, and this was a majority decision. I would remind the House that the principle of the decision given in this income tax case was based upon the decision in McCulloch v. Maryland1 When a State attempts to give to its legislaotherwise, to Tetard, impede, burden, or in any tive or executive authority an operation, which, manner control, the operations, of the constituif valid, would fetter, control, or interfere with the free exercise of the legislative or executive power of the Commonwealth, the attempt, unless expressly authorized by the Constitution, is to that extent invalid and inoperative. The Court held that Commonwealth servants are agents of the Commonwealth, and that it is impossible for the Commonwealth to carry on its functions unless those servants are free to carry out the complete work of the Commonwealth under the sole control of the Commonwealth itself. It held, as was held in the United States case of McCulloch v. Maryland, that if a State had power by its legislation to impede, fetter, hinder, or control Commonwealth The question whether a State agents in the performance of their duties, then it would really interfere with the sovereign functions of the Commonwealth itself. case of McCulloch v. Maryland decided? ment was given! by Marshall? 1 one of the finest expositions of law that has ever emanated from a'judiciary. It is the fundamental judgment on the interpretation of the Constitution of the United States of America. The reasoning in that judgment was as followsThat the States have no power by taxation or otherwise to retard, impede, burden, or in any execution the powers vested in the general government. This great principle is that the Constitution and the laws ' made in pursuance thereof are supreme; that they control the Constitution and laws of the respective States, and cannot be controlled by them; From this, which may be almost termed an axiom, other propositions are deduced as corollaries, on the truth or error of which on their application to this case, the cause has been supposed to depend. The learned Chief Justice Marshall then laid down three axioms(.1) That a power to create implies the power to preserve. (2) That a power to destroy, if wielded by a different .hand, is hostile to, and incompatible with, these powers to create and preserve. . (3) That where this repugnancy exists that authority . which is supreme must control, not yield, to, that over which it is supreme. It was held, in this case of McCulloch v. Maryland, that the State Government had. no right to tax any of the constitutional means employed by the Government of the Union to execute its constitutional powersThe States have no power, by taxation or",27,Second Reading

Of what avail are -ar e free from any control or interference these on the part of the'States. The Commonwealth is supreme within the ambit of its own authority, and the States are supreme -within the ambit of their authority. It was held in a later case-Dobbins v. The Commissioners of Erie County-that the States Governments could not tax a revenue collector employed by the Federal Government ; or, in other words, that in the United States the salaries of Federal officials were exempt from State taxation. Later on, in the case of The Collector v. Day,-it was held that the converse rule applied, and that the Federal authority had no power to impose a tax upon the salary of a Judgeof a State. This case grew out of an attempt of the Collector of the In ternal Revenue of the United States to collect a tax on. the salary of a Judge of the State of Massachusetts, levied in accordance with certain Acts of Congress passed 'in the years 1864-5-6-7. In the judgment, the learned Judge showed very fully the necessity of preserving all the Commonwealth instrumentalities from taxation, pointing out thatIn Dobbins v. The Commissioners of Erie County, it was decided that it was not competent for the Legislature of a State to levy a tax upon the salary or emoluments of an officer of the United States. The decision was placed "" mainly upon the ground that the officer was a means or instrumentality employed for carrying into effect some of the legitimate powers of the . government, which could not be interfered' with by taxation or otherwise by the States, and that the salary or compensation for the service of the officer was inseparably connected with the office; that if the officer, as such was exempt, the salary assigned for his support or maintenance .while holding the office was also, for like reasons, equally exempt. He said later o n If the means, and instrumentalities employed by that Government to it are, necessarily, and, for the sake upon their reserved powers, for like reasons, equally exempt from Federal taxation ? there is no express provision in the Constitution that prohibits the general government from taxthe means and instrumentalities of the States, nor is there any prohibiting the States from great law of self-preservation; as any governmeans if another power may tax them at discretion? Canada was also faced with the question of whether or not the Dominion officials were liable to taxation by provincial Governments. In .a series of cases, with which I do not wish to take up the time of the House, the Judiciary held that the Provinces had no power to tax the Dominion officials. There were one or two judgments in which doubt was cast upon the question, but it is clear that in Canada the Judges, as a whole,, were of opinion that the Dominion officials were not liable to provincial taxation. They followed the reasoning laid down in the case of McCulloch v. Maryland. When we consider the position in Australia, we must realize the value-of such a rule of interpretation as is laid down in that case. What is our position? We have in the Commonwealth and the States two distinct sovereign bodies with complete legislative power exercising an executive power, and carrying on their operations over the same territorial area. The States and the Commonwealth both work under the one written Constitution, and the principles of interpretation applied to its construction should be such as will allow the f u l l exercise of their, sovereign powers within the same territorial area without conflict. The decision in the case of McCulloch v. Maryland, which was followed by the High Court, is one of eminent utility, preserving as it does, the complete sovereignty of the Federal power within the ambit of its authority, and the complete sovereignty of the State's within the ambit of their authorities. A clear and intelligent principle is laid down for dealing with all cases in which there is a conflict of powers, either by a State attempting",28,Second Reading

148,Mr Groom,"Quite so. I mention taxing the means and instrumentalities of thatto interfere with the exercise of the Commonwealth authority, or the Commonwealth with the exercise of a State authority, and that principle was accepted by the High Court in the case, of D'Emden v. Pedder, and followed in the case of Deakin v. Webb, in which it was held that the Commonwealth authority cannot be interfered with by a State, and again' in the case of The Federated Amalgamated Government Raihvayand Tramway Service Association v. The New South Wales Railway Traffic Employes Association, in which it was held that the Commonmonwealth cannot interfere with the authority of a State by including its servants' within a Commonwealth Arbitration Act. The position of the Commonwealth in this matter is exactly the same as that of the Federal Government of the United States. To allow of the proper exercise of the Federal authority certain privileges or immunities are recognised, which protect the agencies and instrumentalities of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth has the power to create, define, and control its agencies and instrumentalities, and the exemptions and privileges necessary for their protection. That view has been recognised .in the United States. But it has also been held that, although certain banks were protected by the rule in McCulloch v. Maryland, Congress could waive its right to the exemption of its agencies and instrumentalities from taxation, and allow them to be taxed by the State authorities. Statutes have been passed by Congress to -enable the States to tax Federal instrumentalities or agencies, and the validity of these Statutes has been upheld by a series of decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States. It was decided in 1898, in the case of the Owensboro National Bank v. Owensboro, that two -elements were involved in the determination of this question: That is, the extent of the power of the respective States to .tax national banks, and the ascertainment -of the scope and purport of the law by which the taxes complained of were leviedEarly in the history of this Government, in -cases affecting the Bank of the United States, it was held that an agency, such as that bank was adjudged to .be, created for. carrying into effect national powers granted by the Constitution, was not in its capital-, franchises and operable on demand ations subject to the taxing powers of a State. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316; Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 9 Wheat. 738. Mr Groom. The principles settled by the cases just referred to and subsequent decisions were thus stated by this Court in Davis v. Elmira Savings Bank, 161 US. 283. National banks are instrumentalities of the Federal Government, created for a public purpose, and as such necessarily subject to the paramount authority of the United States. It follows that an attempt, by a State, to define their duties or control the conduct of their affairs is absolutely void, whereversuch attempted exercise of authority expressly conflicts with the laws of the United States, and either frustrates the purpose of the national legislation or impairs the efficiency of these agencies of the Federal. Government to discharge the duties for the performance of which they were created. These principles are axiomatic, and are sanctioned by the repeated adjudications of this Court. It follows then necessarily from these conclusions that tlie respective States would be wholly without power to levy any tax, either direct or indirect, upon the national banks, their property, assets or franchises, were it not for the permissive ' legislation of Congress. The States could not have taxed these -Federal instrumentalities without permis? sive authority from Congress. Section 5219 of the revised Statutes was quoted in that judgment, and is as followsNothing herein shall prevent all the shares in any association from being included in the valuation of the personal property of the owner or holder of such shares, in assessing taxes imposed by authority of the State within which the association is located; but the Legislature of each State may determine and direct the manner and place of taxing all the shares of national banking associations located within the State, subject only to the two restrictions, that the taxation shall not be at a greater rate than is assessed upon other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens of such Stale, and that the Several shares of any national banking association owned by non-residents of any State' shall be taxed in the city or town where the bank is located, and not elsewhere. Nothing herein shall be construed to exempt the real property of associa^ tions from either State, county, or municipal taxes, to the same extent, according to its value, as other real property is taxed. There is a large number of cases dealing with the constitutionality of such legislation, but it has been decided in America over and over again that it is constitutional. I shall not quote other decisions, because I do not wish to labour the matter. The Currency Act of 1894 was another measure passed by Congress to permit of the taxation of a Federal instrumentality by the States, and the preamble to that Act readsiBe it enacted . . . .that circulating notes of national banking associations and United States legal tender notes and other notes and certificates of the United_ States payand circulating or intended to circulate as currency, and gold, silver, or other coin shall be subject to taxation as money on hand or on deposit under the laws of any State or Territory : Provided that any such taxation shall be exercised in the same manner and at the same rate that any such State or Territory shall tax money or currency circulating as money within its jurisdiction. I wish to refer to one other decision on the subject, that in the case of Austin v. The Alderman, reported in 7 Wallace, 699, a decision given in 1868The right of taxation, where it exists, is necessarily unlimited in its nature. It carries with it inherently the power to embarrass and destroy. It is well settled that the States cannot exercise this' authority in respect to any of the instrumentalities which the general government may create for the performance of its constitutional functions. It is equally well settled, that this exemption may be waived wholly, or with such limitations and qualifications as may be deemed proper, by the law making power of the nation; but the waiver must be clear, and every well-grounded doubt upon the subject should be resolved in favour of the exemption. It has been decided by the High Court that the public servants are Commonwealth agencies, whom it is desirable to protect for the purpose of enabling the Commonwealth objects to be carried out without State interference. But the American cases show that this protection can be waived by the Commonwealth, and that we can allow our servants to be taxed by the States. The American decisions amply support that position. We have, therefore, provided in the Bill that. The taxation by a State, in common with other salaries earned within the State, of, (a) the official salaries of officers of the . Commonwealth residing in the State earned in the State after the commencement of this Act; and ' (4) the allowances and salaries, paid after the commencement of this Act, of members of the Parliament elected in the State and of Ministers of State .for the Commonwealth, and the Presiding Officer and Chairman of Committees of each House of the Parliament, all being respectively members of the Parliament elected in the State, shall not, if the taxation is not at a cation, which I shall submit in Committee. higher rate or to a greater extent than is imposed on other salaries of the same amount earned in the State, be deemed(i) to be an interference with the exercise of any power of the Commonwealth, or ' (<?) to be inconsistent with any Act by or in pursuance of which the salary is fixed or made payable. The present immunity of the public servants of the Commonwealth from taxation by the States rests on the ground that for the States to tax them would be an inter-, ference with the powers of the Commonwealth ; but the American authorities show that we have the right to waivethat exemption, and we now ask Parliament to sanction its waiver, and to permit the salaries to be taxed. In the United States it was held that a State Act providing for the taxation of a Federal official was inconsistent with the Federal Appropriation Act,, and to the extent of its inconsistency invalid. It miay be argued that there is no such inconsistency here, the exemption of our public servants from State taxation being; based on the ground that they are Commonwealth instrumentalities and agencies, and 1 should be free from control by any other authority. But, as we have clearly the power to remove the exemption, we are proposing to do so) and also declaring that State taxation shall not be deemed inconsistent with the Federal Statute. The Bill provides that the official salaries of officers residing in a State, earned in it, may be taxed in common with other salariesearned in it, the ""officer being required to pay his fair share towards the cost of the State Government which he enjoys, and that the allowance and salaries of members and Ministers of the Commonwealth earned"" in a State shall be taxable within the State for which they are elected, so long as the taxation is not at a higher rate or to agreater extent than is imposed on other salaries of the same amount earned in the State. The intention of the measure is toremove what is an anomaly, and recognising that the decision of the High Court was a good one as a matter of law, to-, place the members of the Commonwealth Public Service and Parliament on. the same footing as other members of the community. I trust that the .House will pass the measure in the form in which it' has been introduced, with a slight modifithat the Attorney-General did very well in expounding the. general scope of the measure, particularly from the legal point of view. It would really be a display of a defective sense of proportionon the part of the Housei f we expended a good deal of time in discussing whether the measure ought to> be dealt with prior to the resumption of the Tariff debate, and neglected to put before the country' its legal bearings when it did come before us.

149,Mr Glynn (Angas) [4.30],"I thinkhowever, that we are called upon to give an exposition of the law on such an important matter as one upon which the Privy Council and the High Court have delivered different decisions. Of course, it is interesting to know what was decided, in the case of McCulloch v. Maryland, but if there be any means of getting out of the unfortunate impasse in which we have been landed we ought to adopt it. Personally, I think the policy of allowing the States totax such of us as are resident within their borders is a sound one. To the extent that we share in the benefits conferred by a State Government we ought to be prepared to bear our share of taxation. To my mind, therefore,. it is not a question of policy with which we have now to deal, nor, for guidance, is it a question of law. But1 may, perhaps, be excused for saying a few words upon the probable effect of this Bill from .the legal point of view. The Attorney-General has referred to the case of McCulloch v. Maryland as establishing the fundamental principle under which not only are Federal agencies protected in America from State taxation, but State agencies are protected from Federal taxation. Last night, while the honourable gentleman was referring to the case of The Collector v. Day, in which it was decided that Congress could not tax a State instrumentality, I pointed out that the case of McCulloch v. Maryland should not be too strongly relied upon as an authority for that decision. In the judgment in McCulloch v. Maryland, which I re-read on Sunday evening last, a distinction was clearly drawn by Chief Justice Marshall between the position of a State in taxing an agency of the Federal Government and that of the Federal Government in taxing an agency of a State. IfI am not mistaken, in some subsequent cases-if not in the. case of The Collector v. Day-the position expounded by Chief Justice? Marshall, in the passage referred to, was pressed against the application of the principle of exemption from taxation where the tax was imposed by Congress upon the instrumentality of a State. In the United States Reports, No. 17, which has been referred to by the Attorney-General to-day, that distinction is clearly laid down by Chief Justice Marshall. findIt has also been insisted that, as the power .conviction that the States have no power, by of taxation in the general and State Governtaxation or otherwise, to retard, impede, burden, ments is acknowledged to be concurrent, every or in any .manner control, the operations of the argument which would sustain the right of the into execution the powers vested in the general general Government to tax'banks chartered by Government. This is, we think,the unavoidable Mr Glynn. the States, will equally sustain the right of tlie States to tax banks chartered by the general Government. But the two cases are not on the same reason. The people of all the States have created the general Government, and have conferred upon it the general power of taxation. The people of all the States, and the States themselves, are represented in Congress, and, by their representatives, exercise this power. When they tax the chartered institutions of the States, they tax their constituents; and these taxes must be uniform. But when a State taxes the operations of the Government of the United States^ it acts upon institutions created, not by their own constituents, but by people over whom they claim no control. It acts upon the measures of a Government created by others as wel^ as themselves, for the benefit of others in common with themselves. The difference is that which always exists, and always must exist, between the action of the whole on a part, and the action of a part on the whole-betwee n the laws of a Government declared to be supreme, and those of a Government which, when in opposition to those laws, is not supreme. Upon the question of supremacy, I would point out that the provisions of our Constitution are not identical with those of the United States Constitution, because in the latter there is an express declaration that the Constitution and the laws of Congress thereunder have a supremacy which is not expressly attached to our laws. the United States Constitution contains an express declaration of the supremacy of the laws enacted by Congress under the Constitution. In effect, perhaps, our Constitution operates'in the same way, though its wording is somewhat different. There is no doubt that the great decision of Chief Justice Marshall deserves the eulogium which has been paid to it by the Attorney-General, and other eulogies which have from time to time been expressed, because it was a decision which does not rely upon a single authority for guidance. It was simply an intuitive declaration. If was really the emanation of true reason from a judicial genius at a time when such a decision was required to save the integrity of the American Union. Marshall refers to the possibility of a tax being imposed which might be justified on the score of its uniformity of application to the instrumentalities upon which is was levied. He says=Upon page 433 I The Court has bestowed on this subject its most deliberate consideration. The result is a constitutional laws enacted by Congress to cany consequence of that supremacy which .the Con-",31,Second Reading

I may mention that this tax was not a uniform tax of the class mentioned by Marshall, which might come under the general taxation laws of a State. It was a, tax distinctly levied upon institutions created by an outside body, and was not applicable to similar institutions created by the State itself. It was an attempt to prevent the National Bank, established by Congress, from operating within the State of Maryland. I merely mention this fact because we must not deduce a principle as unqualified from a decision in which the principle itself was time after time subjected to the class of qualification mentioned in the quotations I have made. Reference has recently been made in England to this very point in some dissertations prompted by the income tax case. England have never heard of the case of McCulloch v. Maryland. not studied it very much. honourable member think that Sir Samuel Griffith is another John Marshall? the comparative ability of our tribunal. No man has a higher opinion of it than I have. ment as being somewhat premature, I say that the ability displayed by the members of the High Court, and the general scope of that tribunal, are such as realize our highest expectations. Attorney-General omitted to mention that the real point upon which the validity of this B ill turns-assumin g the universality of the principle enunciated in McCulloch v. Maryland-is not whether that principle applies to Australian conditions, but whether the power of exemption which is regarded as correlative to the power to protect is not confined to institutions created by the body that proposes to exempt. The the case of Van Allen v. The Assessors, reThat that if Parliament creates a Court and gives it a right of appeal to the Supreme Court-such as the Bankruptcy Court of Canada-it has the power to take away that which it has given. This corelation of the power to take away, with the power to protect, is identical in principle with that enunciated by the Privy Council in the case of Cushing v. Du-puy, in which it is laid down that what Parliament gives it may also take away again. We have, therefore, a concurrence of judicial authorities-American and English-upo n this point: that the power to protect includes the power to permit exemption, because, if exemption be abused, it is possible to f a l l back upon the power to protect. If we can create we can abolish, and if the power to create includes the power to abolish, surely it includes the power to exempt I O'MALLEY -The people in being by our legislation the Executive of the Commonwealth?

It is open to argument' that fhe instrumentality is the Department of Trade and Customs, as the executive which must be -created by the Constitution. It seems to me that the instrumentality must be the Post Office and the various Departments of State which, though not -created by the Constitution, were transferred under the Constitution to our control ; and that these Departments will be taxed through the taxation of the salaries. If that be so, we have no power to make the exemption. turn to the Constitution, they will find it provided that there shall be a Federal Executive Council, which the Governor General has to select; and though we may vary the salaries of the Ministers of State, we cannot abolish the offices. If so, can we tax those Ministers, or tax the offices embodied in the Constitution, by the indirect means adopted by the States in the taxation of the salaries? Can we' allow the States to do this? press the matter, which I know is open to two strong views; but we must not be too sure that arguments founded on a somewhat too hasty assumption of the universality of the American decisions, will apply to the conditions of the Australian Constitution. Mr W. H . IRVINE They have been pressed too far already. sions which were relied on in the Senate, and some of which have been referred to by the Attorney-General, the ground is that the office or instrumentality was created by the body which gives the exemption. Take the case of Austin v. The Alderman, reported in 74, United States Law Re-ports. I have the full quotation here, but I do not wish to read the whole. That was the -case of a national bank created by Congress. The basis of the decision was that a national banking association, created under the law of Congress, .might be taxed; and at page 498 of the report there is this short passage1 Any of the instrumentalities which the general 'Government may create. The general Government in that case was -Congress. tional Bank v. Owensboro, Mr Justice White mentioned that the bank was created for carrying into effect national powers created, again by Congress. In the case I ask that of Davies v. Elmira Savings Bank, the complaint was that the taxation impaired . the efficiency of the agencies of the Federal Government to discharge the duties for the performance of which they were created. Those agencies were created, not by the Constitution, but by Congress; and to give'a more extended quotation from the -judgmentNational Banks are instrumentalities of the Federal Government created for a public purpose, apd as such necessarily subject to the paramount authority of the United States. It follows that any attempt by a State to define their duties, or to' control the conduct of their affairs is absolutely void, wherever such, attempted If honourable members exercise of authority expressly conflicts with the law of the United States and either frustrates the purpose of National Legislation. In all the cases I have examined, I do not think there is -one to the contrary. The agencies, the taxation of which Congress permitted, were' created' by Congress itself. I do not desire to refer at any length again to the case of McCulloch v. Maryland; but in the decision of that celebrated case we find these wordsThe sovereignty of a State extends to everyI do not wish to thing which exists by its own authority, or is introduced by its permission; but does it extend to those means which are employed by Congress to carry into execution powers conferred on that body by the people of the United States? We1 think it demonstrates that it does not. Without for one moment saying that the principle in McCulloch v. Maryland is to the same extent applicable to Australia, I am of opinion that, assuming its application, we cannot deduce from it, with any certainty, the principle of exemption, relied on by the Attorney-General. We have control over the salaries; but my point is that we may not have control over the existence of the Departments, and what we tax may be the Departments. In the case of Cousins v. The Commonwealth, decided by the High Court, it was laid down that the preservation of accrued rights, such as salaries, applied only until some body of equal authority to that whose powers were transferred to the Commonwealth had interfered with those rights; in other words, that the Commonwealth Government could operate on the salaries similarly to the way in which the States could operateon them.

Maryland. Last night I mentioned, trusting to memory, that it was possible that the principle in that case was, even by Marshall, C.J., pushed beyond the necessities of the occasion in 1819; and a fortiori, those principles may be pushed beyond the clear necessities of our time. In that case, Marshall, C.J., drew a distinction between the instrumentalities that were necessary, and instrumentalities that were absolutely necessary to the existence of the Government. The decision was, in effect, that the principle of exemption or protection did not apply merely to those that were indispensable or absolutely necessary, but covered agencies which might be conducive to the aims of government. A t . page 205 there is the following passageI f this limited "" necessary ""That is limiting the instrumentalities tp those that go to the very existence of the Federal powermust be abandoned, in order to punish, whence is derived the rule which would reinstate it, when the Government would carry its powers into execution, by means not vindictive in their nature? If the word ""necessary"" means "" needful,"" "" requisite,"" "" essential,"" or "" conducive to,"" in order.to let in the power of punishment for the infraction of law, why, is it not equally comprehensive, when required to authorize the use of means which facilitate the execution of the powers of Government, without the infliction of punishment? I can only say that if we apply to such a comprehension as that the theory of exemption, and declare that every instrumentality that facilitates the operation of the national Government is exempt from State taxation, we shall land ourselves in the position expressed in Cooley on Taxation in the final quotation that I intend to make. a very large number pf and so mean a tremendous exemption from State taxation. notice that if this be good law, then the States can tax us apart altogether from the law laid down by the Privy Council; but I am speaking as if neither of the -dscisions touch .the question. enunciated that which is sound, the States can, it may be, tax us as long as they are not prevented from .doing so by the passing debted to him in this instance, since I have of a Federal Act.

In Let me make one all these cases the power of taxation is referred to as concurrent, and in one of them there are. comparisons of concurrent quarantine powers. Cooley saysAnd the State may tax the property of Federal agencies with other property in the State, and as other property is taxed, when no law of Congress forbids, and when the effect of the taxation will not be to defeat or hinder the operations of the National Government. A different rule, as has been well said, would remove from the reach of State taxation all property of every agent of Government. I do not intend to further occupy the attention of the House, since I have already spoken at greater length than I had proposed to do. I have offered these considerations in support of the contention that possibly, when the question comes before the High Court, we may find that this B ill is not quite the sound constitutionality that construction of the word the Attorney-General, perhaps, and some others, believe it to be. lieve . that there is a very general feeling in the Hpuse, as there is in the country, that some steps should be taken to remove the anomaly under which Commonwealth public servants and members of this Parliament are not liable to pay income tax imposed by a State. As the Attorney-General has pointed out, I have often expressed what I believe is the view held very strongly by most honourable members, that this anomaly should cease One of the difficulties in the way of its removal was that there was a general feeling, both in the. Public Service and in this Parliament, that the money paid in respect of any income tax should go to the State in which the officers were engaged, or in which members of the Parliament were elected.

An monwealth public servants should be subject to a certain deduction, and no power on earth could interfere with such a provision. The State has the power to modify its contracts with its servants in the way I have indicated, and if they are dissatisfied with the new contract they have a very simple remedy. The Bill is very important in the sense that it refers to the legislation of other Parliaments as a kind of legislation which will not be deemed to be an interference with the exercise of any power of If that be so, how can the Commonwealth.

The Bill will not affect me, because the State of Tasmania has not imposed an income tax.

In respect to those powers we are protected from interferso. ence by the States. I am not speaking on this subject as a lawyer, but am looking' at it from a reasonable statid-point. It seems to me that progress in all lines should be marked by sense, and that liberty should be governed by responsibility. If we declare to be right what we know to be' wrong, and go on paying because we darenot test the legality of the charge upon us, from fear lest the newspapers may attack us, we show ourselves to be weaklings. Members of Parliament and 1 private citizens ought to attack what I they know to be wrong, and to support what they believe to be right.

There may be other Avays of doing it. I think that something might be done in connection with the Appropriation Act which would be perfectly valid. objection to being taxed, and if there were an income tax in Tasmania, I should willingly contribute to it, because I am able to pay. Taxation should be based on l>35]2 equality of' sacrifice, and should be borne by those able to pay-the wealthy, and . not the poor. After, all, I should not pay, but those who pay me would do so. Taxation on rents and incomes is ultimately paid by those who sell their labour to make those incomes, or to pay those rents. We have no right to give to any State the power to so tax a man as to prevent him from serving people who want him to serve them. For ten or twelve years before the great American civil war of 1861 to 1865, the Southern States, where they had the power, would have taxed out of the Union every man who sympathized with it. Long, before the war commenced, there was a clamour for some such action. But Marshall's great decision barred the way. Why should we allow the States to have this power of taxation? There must always be an environment of prejudice. Our Chief Justice is the John Marshall of Australia!, and we have confidence in every Justice of the High Court. If I did something, and they ordered me to be hanged, I would go out to be hanged with every confidence in the justice of the sentence. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [5.27] WhilstI have no objection to pay taxation on my salary, and I intend to vote for the Bill, I must confess that I have been unable to follow the reasoning adduced by the Attorney-General in support of it. I was very closely connected with the railway men's dispute, which was brought before the High Court, and followed the argument from point to point. It was decided in that case that the Commonwealth had not power to do anything which might increase the wages of the railway servants of the States. If that is so, I do not see how the States car* constitutionally decrease the salaries of Commonwealth servants.' Mr Justice Higgins, speaking on this subject, saidAs to the other, suggestion, that tlie Federal Parliament may make its grants of salary subject to the rights of the States to tax them, I merely refer to it, because I do not at present want to be committed to any definite view on the subject. A t present I cannot see how, if an income tax upon the salary of a Federal servant is made invalid by the Constitution, the Federal Parliament can alter the Constitution by making the income tax payable. He, therefore, reserved his opinion until the point is definitely raised and argued. It has been contended that the Commonwealth can waive its rights in this' matter, and allow the States to tax the salaries of Federal officers.

Another point occurs to me. The Bill assumes that a member of this House earns his salary in the State in which his electorate is situated. I do not think that that is so. The assumption implies that each member of this House represents only his constituency, whereas, in my opinion, he represents the whole Commonwealth, especially on national questions. I object to that portion of the Bill which will permit the Government of Victoria, during the continuance of the Seat of Government in Melbourne, to collect income tax upon Federal salaries aggregating .£150,000 annually. I have taken the trouble to extract from the Estimates a ilist of the salaries paid to Commonwealth public servants connected with the central administrative Departments in Melbourne. The list is .as follows:-Senate, ,£5,872; House of Representatives, £ 6 , 4 4 5 ; Parliamentary Reporting Staff, £ 5 , 6 0 5 ; 'Library, £ 7 3 1 ; Refreshment Rooms, £ 5 3 * i Queen's Hall, messengers, £ 4 3 4 ; .gardeners, £ 4 3 2 ; engineers, £ 5 3 3 J a total of .£20,565. ment of External Affairs the salaries paid amount to £3,691, exclusive of £760 paid to the clerks of the Executive Council, -or £4,451 in all.

I do not think that they are. are elected in Victoria will be required to pay the tax here. Mr J. H.

Mr J. H . CATTS -Othe r salaries include:-Auditor-General, £ 1 , 0 0 0; Public Service Commissioner, £ 1 , 2 0 0; Public Service Inspectors, £ 3 , 5 0 0; High Court Justices; £13.815; total, £31,515. the High Court reside in Sydney. c Mr J. H . CATTS -In the Attorney General's Department the salaries paid include-High Court Associates, £ 2 , 1 7 8; Crown Solicitor's Department, £ 2 , 1 6 1 ; total, £6,678. In the Department of Home Affairs, the following salaries are payable: -Administrative , £ 5 , 5 8 2 ; Electoral Office, £ 2 , 1 2 0; Public Service Commissioner's Department, £ 5 , 2 3 5 ; Public .Works Department, £3,326 ; Statistician, £2.356 ; Meteorological Department, £4,196 ; total, £22,777. In the Treasury Department the salaries include Administrative, £ 5 , 4 2 1 ; Audit Office, .£5,327; Government Printing Office, £ 9 , 4 8 2 ; total, ,£20,230. The Department of Trade and Customs includes-Centra l staff, £ 4 , 9 3 8; Patents, £ 6 , 2 1 3 ; Trade Marks, £ 1 , 3 4 5 ; total, £12,496. The central staff of the Defence Department receive £14,473 in salaries, and that of the Postmaster General's Department £6,835. ' The aggregate total of these salaries is over ,£140,430. There are also other salaries not included in the list. Therefore, I am not far wrong when I say that £150,000 is annually paid in the form of Federal salaries to officers in Melbourne. This amount would be paid in New South Wales if the Federal Capital' Site had been settled. cers would then be upon neutral territory. In the DepartMr J. H . CATTS -That is .a further reason why they ought riot to be taxed in Victoria. Taking the exemption at £200, I find that salaries amounting to £79,908 annually would be subject to taxation in New South Wales, which, under, the present income tax, would realize £2,000. per year. WhilstI have no kind of sympathy with those who oppose Federal administration really and mainly because they object to the democratic legislation of this House, still I do object to building up a set of circumstances which enables Victoria to reap huge benefits, both monetary and otherwise, from the unfortunate continuance of the Federal Parliament and Federal Departments of administration in Melbourne. this Bill has met with universal condemnation by honourable members, none of them seem disposed to vote against it.

Although a promise was made that the question of whether Federal officers were liable to State income tax should be settled by a decision of the High Court, I know that the Premier of Victoria, prior to his departure for England, issued special instructions that those officers were not to be treated with any mercy or consideration. Even now, he has allowed a number of cases against them to be simply withdrawn in order that he may be able at a later stage-assumin g that he can obtain a decision from the Privy Council in his favour-to disregard the decision of the High Court upon this matter. Instead of coming to the assistance of the States at the present juncture, I feel that we shall be doing the wrong thing by enacting this legislation. High Court power to imprison anybody who violates its decision ? exercise that power. the principle of this B ill , but object to it , because I hold that this Parliament has no power to waive the constitutional rights of any man in the Commonwealth. Honourable members may waive their own rights. But ninety-nine men cannot waive the constitutional rights of the one-hundredth man. In the case of Austin v. The Alderman, which is reported in Vol. 74 of the US.R., it is laid downThe right of taxation, where it exists, is necessarily unlimited in its nature. It carries with it inherently the power to embarrassand destroy. It is well settled that the States cannot exercise this authority in respect to any of the instrumentalities which the general government may create for the performance of its constitutional functions.' It is equally well settled that this exemption may be waived wholly, or with such limitations and qualifications as may be deemed proper, by the law-making power of the nation; but the waiver must be clear, and every well-grounded doubt upon the subject should be resolved in favour of the exemption. There is not the slightest doubt that this Parliament, if it chooses, has power to dev clare that its own members shall be subject to income tax; but it has no power to decree that a single public servant who refuses to be bound by its action shall be liable to that tax. We have not the power to waive the constitutional rights of any man. Every public servant who refuses to be bound by this legislation, can decline to waive his rights under the Constitution. This Bill should not have been introduced I should not like to until after the Commonwealth had taken power to impose a general income tax on all persons within Federal jurisdiction. There is not the slightest doubt that, in trying to escape one anomaly, we are creating several and more serious anomalies. monwealth not impose a general income tax now ? a very proper course. Under section 51 of the Constitution, .the powers of the Commonwealth in the matter of taxation are unlimited. If we pass this B ill , we shall tax the salary of the official in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, and South Australia, while we shall allow the Federal servant in Western Australia and Tasmania to escape. Under the Public Service Act, certain rates of remuneration have' been fixed for certain services; and O'MALLEY -Has not the yet it is proposed by means of this taxation to differentiate between officers occupying exactly similar positions.

The highest income tax in Australia is levied in Queensland; and the effect of this Bill will be that Commonwealth public servants will, by means of the varying rates of income tax, receive various rates of remuneration, simply because, by direction of the Public Service Commissioner, they have been located in a particular State. There is even a greater anomaly. Under the B ill , the Attorney-General, for instance, will pay scarcely any income tax. His duties",40,Honourable Members Hear Hear

The same applies to any representative of Queensland who, in the course of his parliamentary duties, has to spend nine-tenths of his time in Victoria, leaving only one-tenth of his income to be assessed for income tax in Queensland. Honourable members \vill see that as there is usually an exemption up to a certain amount, such a member will pay no income tax. In the case of members of the Government, who receive large salaries, those from other States will pay no income tax. although the Victorian Minister will have to pay the full demand. or Minister will have to elect to live in one State or another.

Under this clause, the Victorian Government cannot impose taxation, although a member from a distance may spend ninetehths of his time within the State. Then, again, this Bill exemots the Justices of the High Court from income tax. Provided that nothing in this Act shall be deemed to authorize the taxation by a State(i) of the salary of an officer of the Com' monwealth, unless the officer resides, and the salary is earned, in that State-. Although three of the Justices reside in Sydney and two in Melbourne, their salaries are earned in no particular State -the y are absolutely Federal officials. Mr J. H . CATTS -I s it true that the salaries of the Commonwealth Justices are protected from any taxation ? Pope Cooper v. The. Queensland Commissioner of Taxes, it was held that the income tax is not a diminution of salary under the Constitution; and if it were not for the provision which' I have just read, the Justices of the High Court would have to pay. The Inspector-General of the Forces, and other officials, will not have to pay income tax, simply because his salary is earned in every State of the Union These, however, are only illustrations of a large number of similar anomalies. I do not think there is any necessity'to amend the Constitution. I must say that the States in this matter have acted in the most childish manner; and I do not think that it is right, while litigation is proceeding, that the Federal Parliament should step in with this legisjaitionSince the States insist on appealing to the Privy Council as against the High Court, I should welcome a proposal to postpone this Bill. Although we have power without any amendment of the Constitution to bring salaries under States taxation, I do not think that is a proper way of attaining our object. I regard this Bill as unconstitutional and illegal, though, of course, I respect Mr Speaker's ruling that it is properly before the House. I think, however, that the view I have indicated would be a proper one for a public servant to take in the High Court. There has been discrimination between the citizens of fhe Commonwealth, in transgression of the Constitution ; and I do not think that a 1 public servant, who resisted the payment of income tax next year, will have his position altered in the slightest by this Bill. It appears to me that the Government have jumped at a casual reference by a Justice in the High Court, although another Judge thought the procedure wrong.

The Bill has been subjected to some criticism. for Corio is under the impression that it has been originated simply because of the suggestion offered in a certain judgment. was considered long ago by the Crown Law officers of 'the Commonwealth, and on the decision then arrived at the Government decided to introduce a Bill of this description. that this measure rests merely upon the alleged suggestion contained in a judgment of the High Court. The question of -its constitutionality was very carefully considered. the general opinion seemed to be that there was no way of overcoming the difficulty; that since this legislation of the States was When an ultra vires of the Constitution of the Commonwealth, we could not confer upon them the power to tax Commonwealth public servants or members of the Federal Parliament. That question was raised at the outset, and it has been raised^ again this evening. The honourable member for Angas has referred to a matter concerning which I had some doubt when I first investigated the position. It was perfectly clear to me on the authorities that whatever the Commonwealth has power to create it has power to. regulate, and that it has power to decide whether or not its instrumentalities shall be taxed. I do not think there is any doubt on that point. The only misgiving I had was as to whether or not those particular operations or functions which were not created by the legislative authority of the Commonwealth could be subjected to taxation. The honourable member for Angas, with that accuracy of research which always characterizes him, came upon that point. T have here a recent case in which this very point was raised, and To which I intended to refer when moving that the Bill be read a second time. I refer to the case of Home Sav' ings Bank v. Des Moines (October term, 1906, US.R.). In that judgment the following passage occursFrom that lime no one has questioned the immunity of national securities from State taxation.

They are under the complete control of the Parliament, and their salaries are entirely created by the appropriations of the Commonwealth Parliament itself. Therefore, I am of the opinion that, according to the United States authorities, we have the power to deal with 'these matters. The leader of the Opposition, referring to the point raised by the honourable! member for Angas, said that he had not recently read the judgment of the High Court in the case referred to, but it appeared to him that thp Court had declared that it was unconstitutional for the States to tax Federal agencies, and that therefore we could not confer upon them the power to do so. vires of the Constitution, and the honourable and learned' member for Flinders agreed that it was. held that the Income Tax Act was to that extent inoperative, but we have to look to the reasoning in the judgment.

But this clause deals only with the taxation of salaries, and I wish to know from the Minister whether it is in tended that all taxation levied upon Commonwealth public servants and members of this Parliament equally with other State citizens, no matter whether imposed on salaries or as a capitation or other tax, shall be payable to the States.

The Minister must admit that there is an omission in line 11, which deals only with the official The South Aussalaries of officers of the Commonwealth, although there are other sources of income exempt under the High Court judgment. Many Federal officers receive bounties or In this B i ll we do not bonuses in addition to salary, the word "" salary "" having a definite meaning. ances be reckoned as part of the salary ? salary is the amount earned annually. clude allowances and bonuses. let the States ber for Corio not think that such bonuses are very exceptional? in the Estimates, which will come before us, there are several cases in which bounties or bonuses have been given in addition to salaries; and I think that, under the circumstances, the Attorney-General ought to submit an amendment. TheB ill professes to do away with anomalies', but, as a matter of fact, it creates further anomalies. The Attorney-General pointed out that a Victorian member of the Federal Parliament will pay tax on income earned in 365 days in the year; a New. South Wales member on the earnings of about 100 days, and Queensland members on the earnings of about two months. There is no doubt that a Federal member from another State, when in Victoria, enjoys the protection of the laws of Victoria; but in answer to that I may tell argument the Attorney-General replies that such a member is compelled to come to Victoria in fulfilment of his parliamentary duties. Are Victorian members not compelled to stay in Melbourne? If I , as a Victorian member, stay here and attend to my duty I shall be taxed, but if I chose to neglect those duties and depart for with a view to show the Queensland, I shall, according to the A t which may be created torney-General, cease to pay the Victorian income tax in respect of the days I am absent. That is a most extraordinary position, and I shall move an amendment to meet these inequalities when the A t torney-General submits his proposal. -No honourable member wishes to eva'de In my opinion, the scheme of the payment of any income tax for which he may be liable; but, at the same time, I wish to know whether it is proposed to give to the States a definite power, or to give them an arbitrary power which can only give rise to a; great deal of litigation.",48,Smith Th E Tasmanian Parently Though Probably By And By We J

Upon consideration, I think that the safest course to follow is to provide that a State shall have power to tax salaries "" earned "" in that State. That will practically mean that a member will be taxed in each State only in respect to salary earned during his residence there. that principle, I paid income tax even before the decision of the High Court. paid it in Victoria in prqportion to the number of davs I served here, but although ready and willing to do so, I did not pay it in South Australia, because the Commissioner, in reply"" to some correspondence that I sent in, told me he did not thihk the local Act touched the position. MrM c WILLIAMS (Franklin) [8.18]. I recognise that the legal questions arising under this Bil l must be left for the lawyers in the House to deal w it h ; but so far as the broad principle at issue is concerned, I think that every honourable member in respect of his total allowance should pay income tax to the State of which he is a representative. There are members of this Legislature who have from the first paid income tax to their own States. Would it not be manifestly Surely we give unfair for an honourable member to pay to Victoria income tax in respect of the allowance received by him whilst attending to his parliamentary duties in Melbourne for, say, ten months, and to pay income tax in respect of only two months to the State in which he was elected? tives of other States will not pay income tax in Victoria. MrM c WILLIAMS I am inclined to think that a good deal will hinge on the definition of the word -"" residing."" Many of us have our homes in other States, but I do not think it is. I are compelled to reside here for seven, eight, or ten months, according to the duration of each session. I think we should clearly provide in the B ill that inI f that decision come tax shall be paid by members of this Legislature to the States in which they reMy first impression side, or, in other words, to the States where they have their homes. Some of us have not taken advantage of the technicalities of the law to avoid payment of the I do not tax.

I intend to pay income tax in Tasmania, and when I have done that I feel that I shall have done all that I should be asked to do. Endless difficulties would arise if the income tax payable by us were to be divided amongst two or three States.

Federal officers who have taken advantage of the law to resist the payment of income tax, which State civil servants receiving lower salaries have to pay, have, to my mind, acted rather meanly.

If after the Bill became law the State of Victoria claimed the right to tax the full amount of a member's salary, and its claim was resisted, 1 think it likely that the High Court would say to the appellant, """"You are relying upon words in the Commonwealth Act which have no force, because a Commonwealth Act cannot limit the power of a State in reference to the passing of. income tax legislation, though the Commonwealth can waive its right as regards interference by such legislation."" We cannot interfere with the legislative powers of the States in matters wholly within the sphere of their authority. If we wish to make a bargain, we should approach the authorities of the States, and say, "" We shall pass this waiver if you will agree to Minister is a different thing from his . frame your Acts on the lines that we suggest."" We cannot make a bargain merely by passing this measure, and the probabilities are that, if we agree to a waiver, it will be enforced, and the proviso regarded as. mere surplusage which cannot have any operation. We all are of opinion' that there should be this waiver, and differ only on matters of detail.

We say in effect to the States, "" Your Income Tax Acts will not interfere with the instrumentalities of the Commonwealth if you pass them in the shape in which we think they should be passed; but, if you do not, they will interfere with to attempt to make them by legislation. our instrumentalities."" There is no sense in that position. Either the Income Tax Acts of the States do interfere 'with Commonwealth instrumentalities, or -they do not. If they interfere, it is for a conpendent sovereign authorities in that manstitutional reason, which I am afraid a Bill like this will not get rid of. If it can get rid of it, that part which attaches conditions to our waiver by interfering with in this matter. But the Bill will apply in the legitimate powers of the Parliaments of the States will, in my opinion, be a dead letter. If the measure is regarded as valid, the Court will probably say, "" We the waiver and ruling out all the irrelevant provisions."" The Court could not say, "" The measure lays down a condition in regard to the waiver,"" because the representatives of the State would reply, "" What we have done is entirely within our legislative competency, and no Commonwealth Act can interfere with it .

It is absurd What we are trying to do now is to enact that, in order to get the benefit of our waiver, the States must frame their laws in a' certain way. We cannot treat indener.

As a matter of fact, there is a whole series of American decisions upon the legislation under which Congress allows the States to tax certain banks. Some of those decisions have held the action of the States to be valid and others have pronounced it invalid, according to whether or not the States had complied with the conditions laid down by Congress. It stands to reason that Congress must have that power, because the poweT to tax implies the power to destroy. If we were to waive our privileges, and to simply say that Federal officers shall be liable to taxation by the States, the latter might specially select those officers for taxation, and allow all other citizens to escape. The honourable member for East Sydney has overlooked the very reason underlying the decision of Chief Justice Marshall in the case of McCulloch v. Maryland. the way that the Attorney-General has suggested ? whether a State would.act in that way but OJ"" whether it has the power to do so. Fortunately, in Australia we live upon terms of perfect amity with one another, but in the United States it was pointed out that if a uniform basis of taxation had not been laid down the States might have exercised their powers without restriction. Consequently, Congress enacted that the States might tax the banks within their, borders upon the condition that they taxed them 1 only , upon equal terms.

413,Mr Thomas Brown (Calare) [9.1].,"<tion. They recognised the necessity of pre-venting the States from differentiating in taxation between State public servants and Federal public servants and the people ^.generally. That is a correct principle, be-cause, otherwise, the whole Federal machinery might be rendered inoperativeJust recently, iri New South Wales, the Premier took a very high-handed action in -connection with proposed Tariff legislation. But for the provision in the Constitution to which I have referred, nothing would .have been easier than for Mr Carruthers -to convene the State Parliament, and ""to impose such differential taxation as -would have the effect of driving Fe-deral servants out of the State. would then have been no need to bring -down an army of policemen in order to seize the wire netting which was in the -custody of the Customs authorities. The -necessity for this, provision in the Constitution has been questioned, but it has been -decided by the Courts that a State, in the matter of taxation, cannot differentiate as against Federal servants. Of course, we -recognise that Federal servants receive the protection and other benefits of State legislation, and are, for the time. being, State -citizens; and there is no desire that, while they have a voice in determining the nature -of the taxation, they shall I escape the duties -of citizenship. All we desire is that there shall be no differentiation; and by this B ill in connection with his presence here-it is we propose to give the States the right to tax Federal servants and Federal repre-sentatives on the same lines, and to the -same extent, as State public servants and -citizens are taxed. If the B ill meant handof the duty of a Federal member to make ing over to the States the right to differentiate, I for one, would not be disposed to favour the measure, because there are rea-sons, and other reasons may arise in the future, why the States should not have that power. I do not altogether agree with the right honourable member for East Sydney that we have no right to indicate the lines -of the legislation of the States in this connection. In my opinion, we are quite within -our rights in doing so; and if the legislation of the States is not in harmony with -Commonwealth legislation, that is a! matter for the States. We are giving the States -certain rights rgiving the States under the Bill? ing the States the right to impose income taxation on Federal officers and Federal -members of Parliamenta right which the States do not possess under the Constitution. We aire taking away no rights or powers from the States, but, on the contrary, are conferring on them increased powers. If we do not indicate the lines on which the legislation of the States must proceed, the safeguards of the Constitution will cease to exist. First, I hold that all Federal public servants should bear their share of the burdens of the State in .which they reside, seeing that they have the protection of the State's laws, the benefits of legislation relating to education, and so forth. Members of the Federal Parliament do not desire to shirk their duty towards the States. They could not be There in this Parliament unless they were citizens of the States, and they should contribute to the taxation in return for the benefits which they receive from the particular States they represent. I do not agree with the honourable member for Angas that, because,, for a certain period of the year, a member of the Federal Parliament has to reside in Melbourne, he is under an obligation to pay Victorian income tax. Melbourne is the temporarv seat of Government, and a member is here for the purpose of discharging his duty, not to Victoria particularly, but to his own State, and the Commonwealth generally. Further, it is not the Victorian taxpayers who provide his salarv, or bear the expense incurred his own State. which has to provide that money. Therefore, in mv opinion, it is the State represented that has the primary, right to.tax the representative. It is part himself acquainted, not merely with the conditions of his own State, or with those of"" Victoria, in which he has to legislate for the time being, but, as fair as opportunity permits, with the conditions of all the States of the Connnonwealth. Several honourable members, including myself, have been in the Northern Territory during a portion of this present year, and we have also, spent some time in Queensland. I have, myself, arrived from South Australia only to-day; and I usually spend a good deal of time in my own State of New South Wales. How is it possible, under such circumstances, to apportion the amount of income earned in the various States, by calculating the number of days, weeks, or months spent in each on public business ? Anv attempt to give effect to the suggestion of the honourable member for Angas must break down. P'or instance, most of the members",56,Smith Th E Tasmanian Parently Though Probably By And By We J
414,Mr Hutchison,What rights are we,57,Smith Th E Tasmanian Parently Though Probably By And By We J
415,Mr Thoma S Brown,"We are givfrom New South Wales travel to their own State every week-end, and a considerable portion of their time is occupied in travelling, only the actual days of sitting being spent in Melbourne. Members from South Australia are similarly circumstanced; but, of course, members from more distant constituencies do not travel to the same extent. But, as one honourable member suggests, there would be a difficulty in determining in what State we were at any particular time, seeing that some of us travel so much. In my opinion, there should be no attempt to apportion the taxation in accordance with the time spent in one or other of the States. A member is here as the representative of a State, whether he be a Minister or a private member; and, as a citizen, he owes obligations to the State he represents. It may be that his parliamentary duties require him to spend a considerable portion of his time in Victoria, but he is a citizen of the State which provides his salary and travelling expenses. In the case of a Minister also, his increased remuneration has to be provided by the State which he represents; and the simplest way to meet the difficulty would be to leave each member subject to the income tax of his own State. member means in regard to the whole parliamentary income? should draw no line as between a Minister and a private member of the House. ral has said that that will be tiie effect of his amendment, hear that, though the Bill does not make the point very clear. pointing out what appears to me to be the correct principle on which we ought to act. We should, first, give the States power to levy taxation on Federal public servants, just as they levy taxation on their own public servants and citizens, and, secondly, we should leave members of Parliament, whether Ministers or otherwise, to be taxed in common with the citizens of the States they represent. If a State has no Income Tax Act in operation, honourable members representing' that State will escape such taxation ; and if , on the other hand, it has, then they will be called upon to bear an equitable share of taxation in common with all its other citizens. Whilst it is wise to have in the Constitution a provision to insure the supremacy of the Commonwealth, and to maintain the efficiency of its services, we shall be quite within our rights in conceding these powers to the States. In passing this B ill , we shall simply safeguard the constitutional principle at stake by indicating the lines on which State legislation of this kind will be effective. We shall not dictate to the States the classof legislation to be passed by them; we shall simply say-in effect to them, "" Y o u are at liberty to deal with members of -this Parliament and with public servants of the Commonwealth as you deal with all your other citizens; you shall not differentiate 'between them and other citizens;"" In taking this step, we shall safeguard that principle of the Constitution which is destined to make the Commonwealth supreme and effective in its legislation and administration. I hope that the Minister will not ask the Committee to legislate in a way that would require honourable members to pay income tax in several. States. require a private secretary. so irksome that honourable members would prefer to pay income tax in every State which made a demand upon them rather than submit to the inconvenience of having to keep an elaborate account of the time spent by them in each State. If the Minister follows these clear lines, he cannot, go far astray, and I shall be prepared £o support him.

It is to be regretted that the Constitution does not provide that Federalmembers, Ministers, and officers shall pay taxation to the States provided there is no differentiation as between them and other citizens. We should, in that event, be quite secure against any attempt to unduly affect the powers of the Commonwealthby means of taxation such as that to which the honourable member has referred. ber think there is any danger of such persecution ? think that there is.

I have, however, some doubts on the proposal. I hope the Committee will clearly understand that what we are proposing to do is not to tax any one, but simply to enable the States, if they think fit, to impose taxation.

What is the use of flooding the statute-book with legislation that is not required ? traduced in consequence of a report which was made by the Standing Orders Committee of the Senate. That body found that it was necessary that the Commonwealth should have a Parliamentary Witnesses Act of its own. At present we are dependent upon section 49 of the Constitution, which provides thatThe powers, privileges, and immunities of the Senate and of the House of Representatives and the members and the Committees of each House shall be such as are declared by the Parliament, and until declared shall be those of the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom, and of its members and Committees at the establishment of the Commonwealth. Therefore, in order to ascertain what are our rights and privileges over parliamentary witnesses, we have to find out the practice of the House of Commons, and to examine Imperial Statutes. Practical difficulties have arisen in this connection, and the Bill now before honourable members has not been introduced from a mere desire, to clothe ourselves with our own authority. The Standing Orders Committee declared that' Although the Committee consider that both the Senate and the House of Representatives and the Committees of either House have power, under the Constitution, to administer oaths, and that the Senate and the House of Representatives have power respectively to deal with any witness who refuses to attend, to be sworn, or to answer questions, they do not consider that the time of Parliament should be taken up by matters of this nature, but that the Courts are better constituted to adjudicate on such matters. The Bill shortly provides that Committees of either House shall have power to sum' mon witnesses, and to order a warrant to be issued for disobedience of such summons. It provides penalties for escape for refusing to be sworn, and for giving false evidence. favour the penalties provided in the Bill? penalties which correspond with those prescribed for offences of a similar nature. swer a question, seems to me the most dreadful thing of which I have ever heard-",60,Smith Th E Tasmanian Parently Though Probably By And By We J

IRVINE -That is a very different matter. protection to witnesses. scheme of the Bill is simply to complete the machinery of Parliament, so as to enable witnesses to be properly summoned, and sworn, to afford them protection, and to punish them if they tender false evidence. sonally, I ' am inclined to vote against this Bill. I do not think that it is necessary, and that fact was very clearly shown by the former President of the Senate, when the measure first came before the other branch of the Legislature. I believe that it was originally introduced by Senator Neild. Baker pointed out that the reason why Great Britain had legislated upon this matter was that, although the House of Lords had always powers such as are contained in this Bill, until the Act of 34 and 35 Victoria was passed, the Commons did not by Statute assert the existence of similar powers. sessed these powers was that' that House was regarded as a Court of judicature. Therefore, it had the power to examine witnesses. The result was, as May points outAt length, in 1871, >n pursuance of the recommendations of a Select Committee of I86Q, Act 34 and 35 Victoria, c. S3 was passed, empowering the House of Commons and its Committees to administer oaths to witnesses, and attaching to false evidence the penalties of perjury. B>' Standing Orders Nos. 8S and Sg, oaths and affirmations under the Oaths Act 1888 (see i>. 156) are administered to witnesses, before the House or a Committee of the whole House, by a clerk at the table; and before a Select Committee, by the Chairman, or by the clerk attending the Committee. I do not know whether the Senate is revery thought that a man who may be actspon:ihle for this Bill being copied from ing from the most honourable motives in the English Act, but, in passing, I may refusing to answer a question may be made say that that practice is becoming too common. The Commons then assented to the power exercised by the House of Lords. When our Constitution was enacted, we derived under it all the powers which the Commons possess and as Act 34 and 35 Victoria preceded our Constitution we have the power conferred by that Act. We can also regulate this matter by standing orders. Another provision in the Bill deals with the punishment of persons who are guilty of any interference with witnesses. I think' that some complaint was made in the Senate-regarding an alleged interference with the liberty of action on the part of a witness who had given evidence before a Select Committee, and who was subsequently dismissed from his employment. If honourable members will look at pages The general 120 and 121 of the Tenth Edition of May they will see that, among the privileges of parliamentary witnesses, is freedom from arrest and punishment for any evidence which they may give. Therefore, that protection exists at the present time. This Bill, from beginning to end, seems to prescribe penalties. Indeed, it is nothing more than a series of penalties for the violation of powers which we already possess. I am not inclined to vote in favour of converting every man who refuses to answer a question into a criminal who is liable to two years'' imprisonment. ing my twenty-seven or twenty-eight years of experience of parliamentary life, I have never seen a Bill which prescribed such penalties as are contained in this measure. A witness may be undergoing examination at the hands of a Parliamentary Committee-^-perhap s upon some political matter concerning which there is a great The reason the Lords posdeal of heat-and he may be asked a question by a member of that Committee. From considerations of personal honour, . he may feel indisposed to answer that question, but if he refuses to do so, he is made liable under this Bill to two years' imprisonment. Surely we do not wish to push our parliamentary privileges to that extent. Mr W. H . IRVINE A witness may decline to answer upon the ground that his reply may incriminate him.
