In view of the great increase in hospital operating costs over that period, will the Minister examine the possibility of an increased subsidy being paid in order to offset the intolerable deficits that most hospitals are now incurring? able member should realise that the question of finance for State hospitals is one largely to be settled by the State governments themselves. The Commonwealth makes available to the States through taxation reimbursements, and in some cases through extra grants, a very large sum of money each year. State governments themselves decide how much will be allocated to hospitals. As far as the question of hospital bed subsidies is concerned, the Commonwealth made available to the States last year about £9,000,000 over and above the amount the States had available to them from the other sources I have mentioned, and that brought in its train fund benefits from the various insurance organizations of another £7,000,000.

The lifting of these restrictions is not a matter which is dealt with by my department, but I think I should say, as I have, that it is in accordance with Government policy and that if any assistance is needed by any industry against importations, then other avenues are available to that industry. The impact of this action on the operations of television and broadcasting stations in the employment and development of Australian artists is a matter which comes under my jurisdiction, and I have always paid considerable attention to it. In recent weeks, I have given some thought to the impact of this recent development on that phase of the matter, but I point out to the honourable member that the increase in the import of television programmes does not mean any reduction in the quality of programmes, nor does it necessarily mean any reduction in the Australian content of the films that are offering. draw your attention to the remark that was made, but if you did not hear it, I will let report shows that it is standing at between",12,Hospital Finance

Health received a communication fsom the Premier of South Australia informing him that many ex-service men and women are on the long waiting list for medical treatment at the Royal Adelaide Hospital while one ward of the Dawes Road General Repatriation Hospital has been closed?

[4] Is he aware that section 5 of the Dairying Industry Act, which was passed in May of this year, reads1. Subject to this Act(a) a bounty is payable on the production of butter at butter factories. 3. The bounties are payable out of moneys appropriated by the Parliament from time to time for the purpose. Will the Minister explain, for the benefit of egg producers, the difference between a bounty and a subsidy, and the reason why he has made fish of one and fowl of another? this I wish that my colleague, the Minister for Social Services, who has a highly developed sense of humour, could answer the question. I am not trying to make fish of one and fowl of another so far as the egg industry is concerned. That is well beyond my capacity. The bounty provisions operating in the dairying industry have been in existence for many years and, in point of fact, there is no difference between a bounty and a subsidy. Perhaps, in future, it would be wise to use only the word "" bounty "", for that is the word used in the Australian Constitution. The butter subsidy relates to the butter industry as a whole-and to a stabilization scheme which applies to the total production of butter, for local consumption and .20 per cent, -of local .consumption figures for sale overseas. It would be my great wish that an increasing percentage of Australian butter be sold internally. It has been made .clear to the butter industry that the Government's policy is to reduce the subsidy gradually, and not in any drastic way. The Government does not think that .a great -trading country like ours can permanently subsidize exports, and it does not want to engage in price cutting campaigns in The international markets. I think that that is the answer to the honourable gentleman's question.

If so, what steps are being taken to ensure its re-enactment to cover a five-year period commencing with the 1958-59 wheat harvest? wishes to continue wheat stabilization for five more years. I should state that emphatically now. In recent months, representatives of both the Australian Agricultural Council and the Australian Wheat Growers Federation have met me and discussed the problem. As a preliminary to discussions, the Australian Agricultural Council agreed that a review of the Australian wheat industry should be made, particularly to find out what changes had occurred in the structure of the industry, and also to have a look at its general problems. I have discussed the matter with representatives of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation, and the preliminaries to a review of the industry have already been completed. HOG CASINGS. to the Minister for Trade who, in answer to a question by the honourable member for McMillan, referred to a sales replacement scheme as applied to import licensing. Does this sales replacement scheme provide for some alleviation of the problems encountered by the meat industry, and particularly the retail section of it, in obtainship had arrived here. The holding period ing adequate supplies of hog casings? in such a manner that any one who now desires to import hog casings will be given a quota. All who have previously been importers will have their quotas increased by a percentage as from 1st August last. Any other people who desire to engage in the business of importing will be given a quota, and all importers will have their quotas replenished from time to time on the basis of their actual sales achievements. That is how the scheme will operate. the Minister for Labour and National Serhelp us to place immigrants as they come vice a question. Do the bulletins issued by forward in the ensuing year. the Department of Labour and National Service from time to time showing the number of persons in receipt of unemployment benefit include immigrants still in Commonwealth hostels and in receipt of Commonwealth relief known as "" preemployment benefit""? Can the Minister indicate approximately the number of immigrants who are still unemployed? Does it run into many thousands? Has the Government any plan for placing unemployed immigrants in productive work without displacing other workers? figures indicating the numbers in receipt of unemployment benefit do not include immigrants who have reached this country and are awaiting placement in holding centres. honourable members are aware, it is the normal practice for assisted-passage immigrants from non-British countries to be taken to holding centres, and there to be put through various stages of processing, to use a rather loose word, in the sense that they are medically examined and given additional training in the English language, and certain information is obtained from them, and the like, while employment opportunities are sought. The honourable gentleman asked whether there were many thousands of immigrants in these circumstances. The answer is "" No "". The latest figure for the whole of Australia was just over 1,500.

In explanation of my question, I would state that the Albury City Council has been anxious to obtain, for the purpose of establishing an aerodrome, a portion of an estate near Albury, known as the Hawkescote estate, which has been resumed for war service land settlement. As a result of representations by the State member for Albury and myself, I understand that the New South Wales Government is prepared to make this land available and has asked the Commonwealth Government for its concurrence. Has the Minister received this submission from the New South Wales Government, and is he prepared to agree to this action being taken? I have not yet received a submission from the New South Wales Government relating to the acquisition of this land for the purposes of civil aviation. As soon as question time is over, I shall make inquiries in the department and if there is any useful information I can convey to the honourable gentleman, I shall furnish it. the Prime Minister.

This Government can certainly not be accused of being unaware of the very great need for development right across the north of Australia. the Minister for Primary Industry. It concerns the Government's dried fruits stabilization plan. In view of the endorsement given to the plan by such an overwhelming majority of those growers who voted, will the Minister confer with representatives of the Australian Dried Fruits Association to see whether they will revise their previous attitude on the necessary percentage of industry approval? I ask this question because it is quite apparent that a high percentage of those growers really interested in their industry, as evidenced by their taking the trouble to vote in a voluntary poll, want this scheme. large majority of the growers who actually voted, favoured the dried vine fruits stabilization scheme, and I think this indicates that it was a generous scheme and one that would bave been in the best interests of the industry. The honourable member suggests that I confer with industry leaders to ascertain whether an affirmative vote by a majority of growers voting, although not necessarily a majority of people entitled to vote, should be sufficient to bring the scheme into effect. I would inform the honourable member that already the executive of the Australian Dried Fruits Association has contacted me and asked me for certain information so that it can gauge the implication of the vote and determine what further action it should take. I think it would be wise for the Government, or for myself at least, to defer further action until I hear from the representatives of the industry. COAL. the Prime Minister.

Further, is the right honourable gentleman aware that leading technologists consider that a process of fluidized low temperature carbonization of coal could be of great economic value to Australia and could be the answer to the deterioration of the coal industry? Therefore, if the Prime Minister desires the continuance of full employment and the expansion of secondary industries, will he confer with his colleague, the Minister for National Development, to see whether a series of conferences can be held, representative of all sections of industry and science, to ascertain whether a. coal-based chemical and liquid fuel industry could be established, in Australia? with by the Minister for National Development, who is in another place.

Can the Minister inform me of any active measures bhat are presently being taken to assist egg producers? Does he not consider it time that a vigorous and practical plan was made to find markets for eggs in countries other than the United Kingdom? Finally, can the Minister provide the House with: any information regarding the egg pulp sales which are usually made on a contract basis at this time of the year to the United Kingdom? honourable member has raised this question, because the answer will, I think, indicate the continuing interest of the Commonwealth Government in the marketing of eggs and egg pulp. There has been a fall in the price of fresh eggs overseas and therefore the chairman of the Commonwealth EggMarketing. Board has taken vigorous action to try to sell Australian eggs in other markets. He has been overseas, quite recently and has been able to sell substantial quantities of fresh eggs in, for example, Italy. Venezuela, Malta. Trinidad, and several other countries. I think, altoone. Annually there is a substantial immigether, about £250,000 worth of fresh eggs grant and natural increase in our populawere sold. In addition, in recent days there have beenconsultations between the various State egg. marketing boards and the Commonwealth Egg Marketing Board for the purpose of having a co-ordinated plan for the marketing of Australian egg pulp. I think about £2,500,000 worth of pulp is involved, and the Commonwealth is naturally very interested in it. Only yesterday approval was given by me,, through the Federal Treasurer, for funds to be provided to the Commonwealth Egg Marketing Board to finance the purchase of egg pulp for sale overseas during this year. have received a letter from the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard) proposing that a definite matter of urgent public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namelyThe serious position caused by unemployment in or throughout Australia. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. (More than the numbers of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places)first comment I wish to make in connection with this important matter is to say that no one could regret more than I having to initiate this debate in order to draw the attention of the Government to the serious 1 unemployment situation that has in recent months developed in every State of the Commonwealth. I make that comment because slightly less than eight years ago every member of the Liberal and Country parties was telling the people of Australia that he was determined that full employment would be maintained under a Liberal Country party Government. But it must be perfectly obvious to even the most optimistic Government supporter that full employment has not been maintained, because, as I shall show in a few moments, the number of unemployed is increasing at an alarming rate while the employment that is available to the community as a whole is rapidly shrinking.

53,Mr Barnard (Bass) [11.17],"Th ewell as the growing annual influx to the employment market of children who reach the school leaving age, mean that the number of persons engaged in employment in this country each year should substantially increase over that of the preceding year. But during the last twelve months it increased by only 2,000 against an increase of 56,000 and 84,000 respectively for the two preceding years. In other words, the demand for labour is not expanding as rapidly as is necessary to absorb the additions to the Australian work force through natural increase, as well as immigration. There are, of course, other causes, which in my opinion are closely related to the drastic cuts that are now being made by private management, and by government and semi-government institutions in their orders for new machinery and buildings, as well as for other equipment. As a result of that policy the engineers and builders, those associated with them in those industries, and more importantly the many thousands who depend upon them for their employment, are being thrown out of work. Their purchasing power has fallen, and once again this vicious unemployment spiral is being set in motion. Criticism of the Government's inaction in this regard is not confined to those unfortunate people who to-day are being compelled to exist on a miserable Commonwealth sustenance at a time when prices have never been higher, when the cost of maintaining an average Australian home has reached fantastic proportions, and when rents and the prices of most commodities essential for home and family life have become more than just a problem even to those people who can enjoy continuity of employment. Criticism of the Government's action is not confined to that section of the people. I believe that, if they were given the opportunity, those people who normally subscribe to the political viewpoint of this Gointo account the marked increase that vernment, who have supported it at the polls, and who returned it to the treasury bench in 1949, also would emphatically protest at the actions of the Government which, for the second time in eight years, has created a serious recession in Australia. I hope that I shall not be accused by the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt), as is usually the case when unemployment is being discussed by the Parliament, of being guilty of fostering discontent or of contributing to a worsening of the situation, or that we shall again hear the stock phrases that he uses in a debate of this kind. Let me make it perfectly clear that neither I nor any of my colleagues on this side of the chamber is prepared to accept a situation in which thousands of Australians are looking for work but, because of the actions or the inaction of this Government, are not able to find it, without making, on their behalf, the strongest possible protest in this House. When unemployment becomes an established fact, at least on the scale that exists to-day, most people are fully aware of it, particularly those who are directly associated with the industrial and commercial life of the community. Unemployment reaches out into every phase of those activities with, as the Minister knows, a subsequent worsening of the position. It is not necessary for a condition of unemployment to be advertised by me or any one else in the Parliament. Although the Minister has been endeavouring to create the impression that no one who requires work is unemployed to-day, the figures compiled by the Commonwealth Statistician and the Department of Labour and National Service, unfortunately, provide a completely different picture. In June, 1955, only 2,000 persons throughout the Commonwealth were in receipt of the unemployment benefit. By June, 1956, that figure had risen to 7,000, and by June, 1957, it had risen to 18,071. The latest statement issued by the department indicates that at the end of July last 20,291 were in receipt of the unemployment benefit, to which I submit must be added a further 10 per cent, to cover non-British workers who are being held in holding centres. I suggest that that is not an insignificant figure, particularly if one takes occurred between March and June this year when an additional 7,214 persons registered to receive the benefit. I emphasize at once that the figures which I have just cited relate only to persons who have registered and are in receipt of the unemployment benefit, and that they therefore do not reflect the real employment situation. Until recently, it has been extremely difficult to obtain from the Minister any figures other than those which relate to the number of persons who have registered and are in receipt of the benefit. I reminded the Minister only yesterday, following his reply to a question that was asked by an Opposition member, that instead of giving the real unemployment figures he merely quoted those which related to people who were actually in receipt of the unemployment benefit. They do not reflect the real situation, because if, as is the case, a vicious means test is applied ness of the situation should disillusion him. to an applicant for the benefit, obviously the number of persons who have actually registered and are in receipt of the benefit is only a fraction of the number of persons who are unemployed. Naturally, it suits the purpose of the Government, unless it is asked otherwise, to release only figures relating to persons who are registered and in receipt of the benefit. As I indicated only a moment ago, at the end of July last that number was precisely 21,291. But, according to the statement that was issued by the department, the total number of unemployed registered in all States in July was 53,108. Although the department has indicated, I believe with some justification, that it is not able to assess accurately the complete unemployment level, and although approximately 53,000 persons are registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service, obviously there is a large number of unemployed people who, for a variety of reasons, are not registered with the department. A conservative estimate would place that number at 10,000. It could be more, and I concede at once that it might be less. Moreover, as the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Townley) has already indicated, at the migrant holding centres at Bonegiiia in Victoria and Greta in New South Wales approximately 1,800 non-British workers and their dependants are being held pending their placement in employment. Mr Harold Holt -There are 1,500. me only last week by the Minister for Immigration indicated that 1,800 were being held. Therefore, a more correct assessment of the unemployment situation would place the number of unemployed at approximately 64,000 rather than 53,000, as has been acknowledged by the Department of Labour and National Service and -which the Minister for Labour and National Service, magnanimously I thought, attributed to the usual quiet in Australia at this time of the year. If the Minister is so out of touch with labour conditions as to suggest that the serious unemployment situation is the result of seasonal fluctuationsI do not believe for one moment that he actually subscribes to that viewpoint-som e responsible member of the Government who is aware of the seriousLet us examine the statement which was released by the Department of Labour and National Service, in order to obtain some indication of the increased number of persons who actually registered last month to receive the unemployment benefit. In New South Wales, the increase was 1,091, and in Victoria, 8!4. In Queensland, there was a reduction. The increase in South Australia was 291; in Western Australia, 331; and in Tasmania, 133. I repeat that the Minister says that that increase is directly the result of the usual quiet in Australia at this time of the year. I remind the House that it was at a time when unemployment was rapidly increasing in Australia that the Minister for Immigration chose to launch his ""Bring Out a Briton"" campaign. In my opinion, that is a scheme which deserves to succeed and which I believe every honourable member wishes to see succeed, and which must succeed. But it could hardly have been introduced at a more inopportune time. At the present time, more than 400 persons in Launceston are looking for employment. Surely in view of that circumstance neither the Minister for Labour and National Service nor his department can expect to be overwhelmed with enthusiasm, fn every State new Australians are looking for work. For these unfortunate people the social problems directly resulting from loss of employment obviously are accentuated by other considerations such as language difficulties and assimilation problems. Judging by the expression on the Minister's face, apparently he does not altogether agree with the point I have just made; but I simply remind him of the statement which appeared in the Melbourne "" Herald"" of Thursday, 15th August-and f do not think that newspaper is given to distorting the picture in any way. The statement in that newspaper substantiates whai I have already told the House, which is that in every State, new",17,Unemployment
54,Mr Barnard,"Figures supplied toAustralians are looking for work. Despite that, at the moment the Government is making, and has made, no decision to alter the proposed level of immigration intake for next year, which stands at 115,000. Every honourable member on this side of the House agrees with me that, as work is not available for everybody in this country, whatever commitments the Government may have in respect of immigration should be immediately reviewed. Let me say at this point that the policy of full employment was first implemented in this country when a Labour government was in office in 1942. The present Government, instead of maintaining full employment, has, for the second time in less than eight years, created recession conditions. It has imposed the most severe restrictions on bank and consumer credit, certainly more severe than any ever before applied in Australia's peace-time history. Possibly this single factor, more than any other, with its fantastic and complete crippling of the building industry, has been the direct cause of the serious unemployment that is to-day apparent in this country. I warned the Government during the last sessional period that it would be only a very short step indeed from unemployment in the timber industry to unemployment in the building industry and the other industries closely associated with it. The Government, by its complete neglect of the building industry and by its imposition full employment that is unsurpassed in any of credit restrictions, has dealt a crippling blow at the building industry, as a result of which we are in our present serious position. Lawrence) -Order! The honourable gentleman's time has expired. Minister for Labour and National Service) [11.32] -The employment level is always a matter of very great consequence to governments in this country, and it is fitting that the Parliament should, from time to time, review the level of employment in order to see what can be done to ensure that that level is high, that work opportunities are ample and that the economic trends are running in the right direction. I question, however, the wisdom of the timing of this proposal by the Opposition at this stage when we are on the eve of a statement by the Government of its budget proposals and of its economic and fiscal policies for the remainder of the financial year. One would have thought that if honourable gentlemen opposite are really concerned about the employment level and economic trends they would be interested to know what the Government proposes to do to meet any difficulties that can be shown to have arisen. As I have said, the Government has in its mind, as it has had since it took office, the question of the level of employment in Australia, and the maintenance of buoyant economic conditions which will enable us not merely to maintain a stable economic situation but also to provide for the future. Because we are committed, as a government, to a programme of development and immigration and of national growth in these two directions, it is necessary for us to maintain incentives for industry and to follow policies which will not only keep people already in this country fully employed but will also provide employment opportunities for those whom we attract here as a result of our immigration policy, as well as those added to our work force as they leave school and become employable. 1 make that general statement in order that there shall be no doubt in the minds of either honourable gentlemen opposite or people outside as to what the Government's general approach has been and will continue to be. We believe in full employment. We are proud of a record of other industrial country in the free world. And it shall be our continuing objective to sustain that record. Having said that, I admit quite frankly Australia at this time. The Government's measures to correct such slack as has already appeared in the economy, and to provide an overall environment in which next year we shall be able to absorb successfully an additional 60,000 people whom we expect will become available in the work force in this country will be revealed, at least in part, in the budget proposals to come before the House next week. Now, let us see whether we cannot find a basis for factual statements which will be acceptable to both sides of the House. It is one thing to accept that it is natural to have an argument between a government and an opposition; but if the argument is to have any validity for people outside this chamber it should be based on facts which can be",19,Unemployment

I want to try for a minute or two to establish the basis to which we should -direct our remarks when we speak about this problem of unemployment. 1 have already conceded that there is at present a degree of unemployment, and I have said that we are taking suitable measures, as they appear to us, to correct the employment situation and maintain buoyancy in the months ahead. What is the degree of unemployment existing at present which it should be our endeavour to correct? Well, we do not get much guidance from honourable gentlemen opposite on that, although they have taken it on themselves in this House and in another place to attack the figures which I supply from time to time as indicating the employment trend. If my figures are inaccurate-and I will proceed to show in a moment that they are as accurate as anybody in this country can ascertain and supply for public information-le t us have a look at the figures produced by honourable gentlemen opposite. We have had two spokesmen for the Labour party in the last two days leading a discussion on this employment question. The first spokesman, who made his statement in another place yesterday, opened his remarks by saying that there were upwards of 100,000 men unemployed in Australia at present. A good round figure! echoes the honourable member for East -16,64 0 males and 4,188 females. There Sydney. Order! There are too many interjections. bers opposite make sweeping generalizations without making any attempt to give the roughly in that proportion-16,64 0 males facts. The first official spokesman of the to 4,188 females. When we turn to the Labour party said yesterday that there were number of people applying for work, we find 100,000 men unemployed at present; but that the total at the end of July-the latest the spokesman for the party to-day is rather date for which I have these figures-wa s more modest. He has sliced very considerably the figure given by his cofleague in the 53,108, comprising about 37,000 males and Senate yesterday. He tells us now that in about 15,000 females. The question arises his estimate there are about 64,000 people whether that is a conservative figure for -people , not men-unemployed . and it could be less. -welcome admission too. I am merely out married women seeking part-time work putting side by side the two statements and elderly, retired persons also looking for made by the official spokesmen for the Opposition. One says that 64,000 people are unemployed-no t men, but people. But yesterday's spokesman in the Senate said there were 100,000 men unemployed. Now, we are given a figure of about 64,000 men and women unemployed, which, the honourable member who gave it says fairly, could be more or could be less. Now, let us see what figures we ourselves have. I explained to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) yesterday that we could do no more, except at census lime, than point to the trends disclosed by the figures which come to the Department of Labour and National Service. One figure is that of people in receipt of unemployment benefit. I admit immediately that that figure does not show the total number of unemployed because of the qualifying period before the benefit can be received and the income test which is applied. So, it can be taken that that figure represents the lowest level of unemployment which can be indicated; and it is certainly not without some significance that there has been a steady increase, though not a dramatic or spectacular increase, over recent months in the number of people who are in receipt of unemployment benefit. The figure at the moment stands at just over 20,000. I can give the actual figure for the latest date, 17th August, for which the figures have been supplied to me. They show a total of 20,828 in receipt of unemployment benefit was a minor reduction of 80 on the preceding week. That is the figure for unemployment benefit, unemployment in this country, or whether it indicates approximately the total number seeking work, in the sense that they are",20,Unemployment

The Minister for Labour and National Service has admitted that 20,000 of our fellow-Australians have registered and qualified for unemployment relief, and this number is but a fraction of those who are out of work at the present time. The Government, in the course of statements which have been dragged from it, not volunteered, has stated that 53,000 persons are registered as wanting work. That, 1 say, is indefensible. Throughout Australia, in city and country alike, the spectre of unemployment is looming. I hope, in the course of my remarks, to make some reference to my own electorate. The Minister wishes to brush airily aside the unhappy situation, because he has no solution to this problem. He dismisses the plight of the jobless, who subsist on a pitiably inadequate unemployment payment because there is no work available. He does not wish to discuss the matter. He has said that the number of unemployed is very small a mere token number. It is true that the number mentioned is but a fraction of the unemployed in Australia at the present time. About 20,000 persons are registered for unemployment relief, while an admitted 53,000 are registered as unemployed. Everyone who has considered this subject knows quite well that many people have failed to register for unemployment benefit because they know that they would not get it. Those who do not register, either for unemployment benefit or for employment, are not counted among the unemployed. I wish to direct attention to a remark that was made by the Minister for Labour and National Service himself. said that the labour force in this country increased by about 2,000 last year. I should like to ask the Minister what has happened to the 80,000 immigrants who came into Australia during the twelve months if the labour force increased by only 2,000. What has happened to the youth of this country who leave the schools each year in search of employment? I say with all the force at my command that, on humanitarian and economic grounds, there should not be any unemployed. There should be no idle hands in Australia to-day. From time to time, we hear remarks from the Government side of the House on the need to develop Australia. Yet the Government has admitted this morning that there are 53,000 unemployed, and it is apparently satisfied with that state of affairs. The existence of unemployment is not denied. As I have said, no fewer than 53,000 persons are registered as being in search of work. The Minister for Labour and National Service wants to evade the responsibility, and has pointed out that all will be well when the budget is presented. I direct attention to quite a number of opinions that have been published in the press recently. On 28th July, 1957, the "" Sun-Herald"" reported Mr C. R. Hall, director of the Chamber of Manufactures, as statingThe fall in employment is the inevitable result of credit restrictions, high taxation and inadequate tariff protection. Mr P. J. Self, of the Employers Federation, commented that unemployment should be arrested before it was too late. These are the points of view, not of members of the Australian Labour party, but of people who, in the normal course of events, would support this Government. To-day, the financial editor of the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" went on record as saying that the have it known. . . that general unemployment has already touched a level where there is not much margin left for an increase which would be tolerated by the electorate. I am concerned with this problem on humanitarian grounds as well as economic grounds, because it affects people as human beings. I make no excuse for my attitude, because I believe that my duty is clearly to come to this National Capital, and to this Parliament, to represent the people of my He electorate. I have a bounden duty to represent more than 1,000 unemployed in my electorate, as I have to represent the people who are employed. The unemployed in my electorate, which stretches over an industrial area into a semi-industrial area, constitute a problem that has existed for some time, for some of them became unemployed when this Government dismissed them from the Commonwealth Small Arms Factory last year. Following that, colliery after colliery has closed yet, despite pleas made by me, the Government has remained unmoved",23,Unemployment
72,Minister For Trade ( Mr Mcewen) Would,"and indifferent. The local authorities have submitted works programmes. They wanted something to be done, and the works programmes submitted by them were for useful jobs which would help to bring better living conditions to the people of the area. This Government refused to do anything about the matter. Its invariable reply is that the States have the responsibility and, therefore, should do something. I say that it is the responsibility of this Government, the government of the nation, to alleviate the tragic plight of people who, through no fault of their own, are being obliged to subsist on such paltry amounts as £2 10s. for an individual and £4 15s. for a husband, wife and child. Such conditions as that should not be tolerated in Australia in these days. The responsibility for this scandalous state of affairs under which a whole family is compelled to live on approximately one-third of the basic wage, the amount looked upon as the irreducible minimum, is with the national government, and it should bestir itself and do something about the position. After all, it is far better to find jobs for the ing fewer but the vacancies for employment people than to allow them to subsist on a portion of the recognized basic rate. I emphasize that the Government has a responsibility to do something about the matter. I have before me some facts relating to the coal industry. Since 1954, some 4,000 persons have left this industry because there has been no work in it for them. When the Government was asked to do something in order to find employment for these people it set up a committee. The Coal Industry Committee held its first meeting on 16th May, 19.56. In all, it met three times, the last meeting being in November, 1956. Since then it has not met at all. If this Government were sincerely concerned about these problems, especially that confronting the coal-mining industry, it would ensure that this committee functioned and tried to do something to meet the crisis. Instead, the Government has allowed this committee to remain more or less idle since 1956. The responsibility for all these things comes back to this Government. After hearing the honourable member for Bass deal with the matter in such an excellent manner, I would have been content if the Minister, when replying, had stated categorically that the Government would do something to find jobs for those people who are unemployed to-day. Order! The honourable member's time has expired. opinion, the main issue in this debate is to be found in the opening statement by the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard) that unemployment in the Commonwealth to-day is increasing at an alarming rate. If that is the case, then I believe there is a definite need for the Government to take action. But all the figures that have been produced on both sides of the House show that it is not increasing at an alarming rate. As we have already heard from the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt), the rate is actually falling at the present time and, indeed, the number of unemployed has decreased over the last fortnight. However, I submit that the actual statistics are not nearly so important as the fact that trends are improving. Not only are the numbers of unemployed becomare increasing. There are already 18,770 vacancies for employment throughout the Commonwealth. This represents an increase of over 300 during the past month. The important question to ask ourselves during this debate is whether we can believe the statement made by the Minister about the situation. I believe that this Government's record over the last seven years shows that we can definitely believe the Minister's statement because it discloses that we have been able to keep the unemployment position under control. We have a better record in this direction than any other government in the whole of the western world, and most governments behind the iron curtain. As an example, I point out that unemployment is increasing at an alarming rate in red China. I repeat that no government has a better record than the Liberal-Country party of Australia. As the Minister also stated, the question of unemployment cannot be considered on its own. It must be taken into consideration with two other major factors in the Australian economy. The first of those is the whole matter of the balance of payments and the second is the cure of the ever-present fear of inflation. If we were",24,Unemployment

The harm that would be caused thereby to many members of the community would be even greater than some of the harm being caused by the present position in which we have 20,000 people unemployed Mx. Ward -Even the Minister admitted .there were over 60,000 unemployed. unemployment benefit -people interviewing me ahout this within "" unemployed "". Order! The honourable member for East Sydney will cease interjecting. inflation, unemployment and the balance of payments-mus t be considered together, and -this Government's record discloses that over the last seven years it has learned much about the taking of remedial measures to deal with each of them. For that reason, -when the Minister says, as he did yesterday, that steps are to be taken to bring the level of unemployment under control, and to improve the position within the next few weeks, we have every justification for believing that the Government knows it can carry out that promise. 1 have no wish to minimize the effects of unemployment or the damage that it can cause to the individual. I can speak oniy of those people who are unemployed at the present, in my own electorate. Probably1 see as many unemployed there as are to be seen in most other electorates throughout Victoria because I represent a partially industrialized electorate of that State, do know that there are people unemployed at the moment in the electorate of Fawkner, but I should say that unemployment is not always the result of government action, despite what honourable members opposite would have us believe. For instance, only last week, a factory in the Fawkner electorate had to be closed and all the operatives put out of employment. The reason was thnt sales of the product that factory v/as making had been severely retarded because of the growth of the new television industry. People no longer want the products of this particular factory; they are buying television sets instead. Surely it is not to be argued that the Government's aim should be to retard progress in the community by insisting that factories increase the production of items which are no longer wanted by the public! On the contrary, 1 should say that the most important thing at the moment is to take constructive action to help ihe people who are thrown out-of employment by the march .of progress in the community. The first thing to do, obviously, when people become unemployedI have had -the last few days--is to see -that they are 'a'ble to obtain unemployment relief as soon as possible <and that widows and others who are permanently out of work 'are given the appropriate pension. The main thing is to see that those people who are thrown out of employment are retrained as rapidly as .possible to equip them with the skills they will need in the new jobs that are now being offered. Only last week, I saw the value of the rehabilitation service that trains for other jobs people who have been thrown out of employment by accidents or illness and who can no longer do their ordinary work. We all have seen that there are vacancies in industry to-day for people who can acquire particular skills, and I should have thought fhat the members of fhe Opposition would have directed their attention to the need to increase training opportunities, with a view to fitting people to do the skilled work that is becoming increasingly available in the Commonwealth. If we think that there is a need for training in new skills, .perhaps our minds also should return to the need for an allowance immediately people are thrown out of work, and for unemployment relief to be greater -in the initial stages of unemployment, so that people might have an opportunity to train themselves in new skills. I therefore suggest that it is important to look, not only at statistics of unemployment, but also at the rate at which people can be trained to take on new jobs, so that the period for which they are unemployed may be reduced to a minimum. That, I think, is the way in which the Government is tackling this problem at the moment. The honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti) referred",25,Unemployment

78,Mr Howson,"-Thes e three mattersto the special problems of the coal industry. In my opinion, many of those problems were brought about by the actions of the people in the industry. We never hear to-day about the calamities suffered by Victorian housewives because of the shortage of coal ten years ago. We should not forget that the Victorian Government had to develop the brown coal industry in order to make Victoria independent of New South Wales black coal. In conclusion, this Government has proved that it can control the level of employment. As the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt) stated yesterday, it will act in the very near future industry for a reduction of port quotas in order to reduce the level of unemployment. I have every confidence in that statement and I believe that within a very few months an excellent result will have been achieved. Order! The honourable member's time has expired. -The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr policy of restricting loans to the States for Howson), at the conclusion of his speech, said that the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt) would take action to reduce the present level of unemployment, but previously he said that the Government did not accept responsibility for the unemployment that exists. Those two statements do not seem to me to be consistent. If the Government can take action now to reduce unemployment, why did it not take action months ago? After all, the present position has not arisen only in the last week or two. We have been hammering at the Government about the deteriorating employment situation for the last twelve or eighteen months. The present trend of unemployment is following the pattern of previous trends. Looking back over the years, we can see that the first indication of an economic recession and increasing unemployment begins with a slump in the building industry. When that industry begins to experience difficulty, men employed on building work are put off. That, normally, is followed by a reduction of the quantity of bricks and timber required. When the quantities of those materials required are reduced, the brick and tile manufacturers and the timber industry also begin to put men off. The effects are then seen in the country areas from which timber is being procured. For months past we have been reading in the newspapers that there is no sale for large quantities of timber in New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania, with the result that timber mills have had to close down. After that state of affairs has existed for a short period of time, other industries, such as the transport industry, begin to be hit. Then there follows a big reduction in the work available for waterside workers. Only recently, we saw in the press a report to the effect that an application had been made by employers in the stevedoring because there were more men available than could be employed. The decline then spreads to other industries and affects other workers, such as road transport workers and the storemen and packers. Honourable members opposite may ask, "" What has that to do with the Government?"" My answer is that the stairway down which those industries have been falling has been erected by the Government through its housing, and restricting bank credit to people who wish to obtain loans to build houses. I do not intend to argue whether there are 52,000 or 62.000 people unemployed, but I do know that I have people coming to me all the time because they are unemployed. Only last week, two men came to me and said, "" Mr Thompson, will you help us to make out claims for the old age pension. We do not want to knock off work, but we are over 65 years of age and cannot get a job. We are not allowed to register for employment. The only thing left for us is the pension "". I suppose there are thousands of people throughout Australia who are ready, able and willing to work but who cannot register as being unemployed because they are over 65 years of age and are not entitled to unemployment benefit. The Government, apparently, says "" You should get the age pension "". retire people at 65? about that. I am merely saying that many people who are over the age of 65 cannot get jobs. When this Government speaks of the number of unemployed it forgets all about those people.",26,Unemployment

Not' one of the Opposition speakers has mentioned that strike duringthis debate. The honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson) quite rightly said that the building industry is one of the chief barometers of employment in Australia, and, consequently, of its economy. He went on to say that this Government should make more money available to the States by way of loan funds or increased tax reimbursements.. The honourable member must surelyknow, as every honourable member, in this Parliament must know, that last year the supplementary vote, of tax reimbursements to the States was increased.. It has been made public also that, this year works and housing finance will be increased by £8,000,000. The supplementary grant of tax reimbursements wiil be increased again by an extra £4,000,000. This will bring the amount far above that provided in the formula laid down some years ago by the Labour government. 1 am glad that the honourable member for Port Adelaide, raised the subject of the building industry, because there is a state of unemployment irr this, industry in Western Australia which has existed, for more, than twelvemonths. This conditionis a direct result of the maladministration of the building industry by the State Government. In spite of the talk bymembers of the Opposition from Western Australia, it is well known to members of the Commonwealth Parliament that this state of affairs has been developing for some considerable time. We can all remember very clearly that when the Western Australian Labour Government took office it set about to solve the housing problem. That was a very laudable objective, but one would have thought that a man placed in i^e nosi'ion of administering a department would have at least used some business sense. We ail recall the fact that some years ago even the Commonwealth could not obtain either bricks or timber from the Western Australian Housing Commission to build post offices, drill halls, telephone exchanges or any other buildings, because of thedictatorial attitude of the Minister' for Housing in that State. That same gentleman exercised his dictatorial powers most trenchantly over building contractors who were prepared' to work for the Commonwealth. He told them that if they did so they would not receive any timber from the State sawmills for their normaljobs or for any building projects. That Minister for Housing; the well-known "" Herbie"" Graham, refused toallowany timber to be exported from Western Australia, even to the eastern States. Everybody knows that if the sawmillers have, small parcels of timber to sell to other States or to people outside the government set-up, and they are refused permission to make, those sales, obviously they will lose their customers. That is what happened in Western Australia more than twelve months ago. The four States of Tasmania, Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland, which are very heavily engaged in the building industry, are faced with the problems of unemployment because of short sightedness of tbeir Labour governments. I wish to refer tofigurescontained in the annual balance-sheet of the State sawmills of Western Australia for the financial year 1955-56. In that year a loss of £13,549 was sustained. In the preceding j'ear. a profit of £35.941 had been made, so in the two years there had been a difference in. trading to the extent of £49,490. The report contains this comment on. that resultsHad! increased sloe's gone into consumption wilh a return equal ta the. avenage cost of production and handling the trading account would have shown at least £35,000 betterfor the year. But apparently the Western Australian Government would not allow the State sawmills to sell the timber at cost. I was alwaysunder the impression that it was one of the planks of the Labour party that the purpose of setting up socialist enterprises was to curb private enterprise and to ensure that the people whom members of the Opposition say so glibly they represent would obtain supplies at reasonable prices. It was their idea to prevent prices",28,Unemployment

It will be interesting to see what As a result there has been a drain on the public purse, and the sawmills that had surplus stocks which could have been sold have suffered afinancialloss. Members of the Opposition in this Parliament and supporters of Labour governments in State parliaments have repeatedly spoken about the humane attitude of governments. associated with that action of the Labour Government in Western Australia? Had it allowed the £35,000 worth of timber to be sold to small contractors, many housWhen the State Minister for Works was ing jobs, which were already in hand, could have been completed. That would have meant the employment of carpenters and others in the building trade for a longer period, as well as continued employment for others not directly associated with the industry, such as hardware suppliersand others referred to by the honourable member for Port Adelaide. It wonld have meant, also, that more people could have bought homes at a cheaper price. It would have been possible to put more men into employment for a longer period and as a result they would have been able to turn their money over. The position in Western Australia would not have developed then as quickly as it did. The next move was this: Last year, the Premier of Western Australia obtained the consent of the other Premiers, at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, for the CommonwealthI ask honourable members to mark this point-to make him a grant for unemployment. It was all very nice. The Premiers of the other States said that they would be quite happy to agree to his spending this money if the Commonwealth could find it. Western Australia received a grant of £2,000,000. What happened? Was one more man placed into employment in Western Australia as a consequence? I invite the honourable member for Stirling( Mr Webb) to say that such was the case. Everybody knows that nobody obtained any extra employment. The grant of £2,000,000 was used to pay debts that had been accumulated by the Western Australian Government in three years of mad administration, to some aspects of which I have already referred. There has been a clamour, also, by the Western Australian Minister for Works for more money for a comprehensive water happens to that scheme as a result of the announcement made by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies.) recently. What has been going on in Western Australia is simply this: Irrespective of the economics of the problem, men have been put on and kept in employment at overtime rates. Money has been tossed down the pipe, so to speak, to Where is the humanity satisfy the vanity of the State Minister for Works. Recent events show how inconsistent he is. That criticism applies also to the rest of the Cabinet in Western Australia. opening a water supply, the construction of which was associated with this grant, he said, "" I hope the people in this area will not expect other people to pay for it "" . He wants everybody else to pay for his vain ideas, but when it gets down to tin tacks, he does not want the man in the street to get any benefit. All this glib talk by supporters of the Australian Labour party in this chamber and throughout the Commonwealth about their desire to help the man in the street is just so much tommy rot and hypocrisy. That can be proved by an examination of any of the trading concerns with which they are associated. Whenever there is an opportunity for them to help the man in the street, they sit pat on supplies and everything else associated with their ventures and try to make a profit. They say they established the concerns in order to keep a curb on private enterprise. I have yet to learn of anything that has been done by the Labour party towards a real solution of the unemployment problem. Order!

He has not helped in any way to solve the problem or to give a constructive lead towards its",29,Unemployment

86,Mr Clarey (Bendigo) [12.33],"Isolution. Perhaps his speech has served its puipose in enabling him to make an attack on the Labour Government of Western Australia, but that has nothing to do with the matter of urgency that is before the House. I desire first to commend the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard) for submitting this important matter to honourable members. The problem of growing unemployment is causing grave concern throughout Australia. The point that was made by the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson) in this connection is the important one. What is the trend of employment? If honourable members follow that trend, they can see whether or not a dangerous position is developing. I fear much more the gradual creeping paralysis of unemployment than I do sudden unemployment which can frequently be explained and can be rectified immediately. The figures that have been released by the Department of Labour and National Service for some years past have shown that a most regrettable trend is gradually developing. All the indications are that unemployment will grow. For example, I have found that the low level of unemployment was reached about October, 1955, when the number of persons registered for work totalled 14,294. By February, 1956, when the Januaryfigureswere released, the number of persons registered for employment and described as unemployed totalled 30,661. The latest figures available show that the number of persons registered as unemployed in July, 1957, totalled 53,108. Moreover, the most up-to-date figures given by the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt) indicate that the number of persons who are receiving the unemployment benefit at present is greater than it was when the figures for July were released. We find that, month by month, unemployment is growing, and more persons are registered for work. More persons are receiving the unemployment benefit and, what is equally important as an indication of the trend in industry itself, month by month fewer vacancies are being shown in industry. Statistics relating to vacancies recorded by the Department of Labour and National Service show a decline. In 1955 there were 56,112 vacancies. By July, 1956, the number of vacancies had fallen to 28,784. In July, 1957, there were only 18,770 vacancies registered with the Department of Labour and National Service. The most regrettable feature is that unemployment is spreading throughout Australia. No community can be said to be free from it. I have been staggered to find the extent to which unemployment exists in the country districts quite apart from its incidence in the capital cities. The last statement issued by the Minister showed the position regarding the payment of unemployment benefit in some of the country towns. For example, in Wollongong 420 persons were receiving the unemployment benefit. In proportion to population, the position is worse in Wollongong than it is in Sydney. That applies also to Newcastle where 371 persons are receiving the unemployment benefit; to Maitland, 228; to Lismore, 192; and to places like Lithgow, Cessnock, Katoomba, Orange and Bathurst. The position is the same in Victoria. In Geelong, 503 persons are receiving the unemployment benefit, so that, in proportion to population, the position in Geelong is twice as bad as it is in Melbourne. Indications are that unemployment is growing, not only in the capital cities but throughout the country districts as well, and, as a result, there is a growing sense of insecurity among the people. I firmly believe that although the Department of Labour and National Service does everything it possibly can to give the most reliable figures in connection with this problem, the figures that are presented understate the actual position. There is no better place than the trades halls in the capital cities to ascertain what unemployment is developing. I discussed the problem of unemployment in Victoria recently with Mr Stout, secretary of the Melbourne Trades Hall Council. I asked him what the position was in Victoria. He told me frankly that unemployment was increasing, and that the industries affected included those connected with the manufacture of textiles, knitted goods and footwear, and the building industry. As has been so clearly demonstrated by the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti), unemployment is increasing on the coal-fields, because coal mines we closing down. In Tasmania many limber mills have closed down, resulting in unemployment in the timber industry, ln my own constituency of Bendigo1 have found skilled carpenters seeking employment as unskilled or semi-skilled labourers because they cannot find work as carpenters in the building industry. It is a shocking economic waste to have these people, who possess the skills that so short a time ago were very scarce and in great demand, forced to take unskilled work because the circumstances of the times do not permit them to use their skills in their norma! avocation. I am advised by officials of the Trades Hall Council in Melbourne that men and women are flocking daily to the various trade union offices seeking employment. Many of them are immigrants, and many of them cannot speak English as well as we would wish. They go to the offices of the Trades Hall Council and to the offices of various organizations, trying to secure jobs. Of course, the opinion that I express regarding the total volume of unemployment cannot be substantiated by figures, but it is the opinion of the secretary of the Melbourne Trades Hall Council and, I believe, of the secretary of the Sydney Trades Hall Association. The opinion is that the number of persons unemployed at present is double the number shown in the figures that have been issued by the Department of Labour and National Service. Of course, one cannot prove such a statement without producing figures, but one does know that unemployment exists and is increasing. [Extension of time granted.] I think the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson) was correct when he said that if there is any industry that can be taken as a barometer of economic activity, it is the building industry. If the building industry is fully occupied, it provides opportunities for employment for a great number of workers in other industries because of its requirements of raw materials from so many sources. At present the building industry is in a state of The seat of Government of the Commonwealth stagnation, for which this Government must be blamed.

The fact Wales, and be distant not less than one hundred that money is not available in bank loans miles from Sydney. means that the deposit required for a home is exceptionally high. The result is thai there is a tendency everywhere to reduce the rate of home building,' which is of such importance to our people. One must bear in mind that home-building activity creates a great deal of employment. As our population increases, both by immigration a n j by natural increase in Australia, so the number of homes required must also increase. I wish to stress that if employment is to be increased money for home building must be made available. This will stimulate a demand for both materials and labour, and the number of persons unemployed wil! decrease. I hope that our discussion to-day will cause the Government to give more serious consideration to the problem of unemployment, and that its future economic policy will result in a maximum of employment. We must not allow the creeping paralysis of unemployment to become more widespread.

SinceI have been in this Parliament there have been repeated criticisms not only by the press but also, unfortunately, by some members of the Parliament, of Canberra and its development and the people here.

88,Mr Hamilton (Canning) [2.16j,"1Such territory shall contain an area of not less :han one hundred square miles, and such portion thereof as shall consist of Crown lands shall be granted to the Commonwealth without any payment there for. Then the Seat of Government Act which, if my memory serves me correctly, was passed in 1908, laid down that the capital city should be in the Yass-Canberra area. Tnat was followed within the next year or so by arrangements, under the Seat of Government Acceptance Act, to enable the Commonwealth to take over this particular area from the State of New South Wales. So whether we like it or not, and whether the National Capital is in the correct place in Australia or not, it was determined by our forebears-the founders of the Constitution-that it should be in a certain area of New South Wales and not less than 100 miles from Sydney. Therefore, it is here with us. I think the best we can do is to make the best of that selection. If each and every one of the honourable members elected to this Parliament has any consideration at all for the position of this Parliament within Australia, within the Commonwealth of Nations and, indeed, in the world, he should use his best endeavours to see that this is a fitting capital for this country. We have plenty of examples to guide us on what has gone before in the older countries of the world, so let us hope that we shall not make any grave error which, in later years, could be thrown hack at u's as folly and so forth. It will be recalled that this provisional Parliament House was opened in 1927. Quite a few people throughout Australia had the idea that a national capital should contain only a parliament house where members could occasionally meet and discuss the affairs of State. They failed to realize that a national capital must have within its borders all the various departments of state and, if possible, branches of industry, to keep the place going. As1 have said, down through the years there has been unfortunate criticism of Canberra, not only by members of Parliament, but also by outside media. I hope that the creation of this commission is a move in the right direction. Personally, I think that it is. I hope that the commission will have teeth so that it can do something and not be tossed aside, as have been certain schemes over the years. The Minister for the Interior( Mr Fairhall), in his second-reading speech, made the comment that the development and progress of Canberra will be subject to the state of the economy. That is probably as it should be. But, I do hope that those judges of the state of the economy in the years immediately ahead will be somewhat better judges than we have had in the past, because, as was correctly pointed out last night by the honourable member for Chisholm( Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes), during the last seven or eight years there have been fits and starts in this capital to do this, that, and the other thing. As the honourable member rightly said, in some instances after a commencement had been made, steps were suddenly taken without the Minister's knowledge and the particular project was not gone on with. Let us all hope that, as a result of the creation of the proposed commission, nothing of that kind will happen in the near future. This is one part of the bill that gives me some concern, not only in relation to the proposed commission, but also to other activities of the Commonwealth Government. I have mentioned the matter in this House on previous occasions. Let us hope that the state of the economy will not be such as to prevent this commission from functioning as we all hope it will. When the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. R. Fraser) was speaking to the motion last night, he expressed some concern about the composition of the National Planning and Development Committee. I remind him that it is quite possibleI am not going to say that it will definitely happen-that included in the panel of names submitted by the engineers' and architects' organizations will be that of a person who lives in the Australian Capital Territory. Who knows whether the selection of two persons for cultural and other purposes will not be made from persons living in the Territory? However, even if that does not happen, I should like to remind the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory, as well as the people in Canberra, that this is the National Capital, and that residents of the most remote portions of this country are just as much entitled to have representation on the proposed committee as are the residents of the Territory. I am not speaking in a derogatory manner of the people here. I am only pointing out what, to my mind, is a fair and reasonable manner of approach to the composition of the proposed body. Let the people of the Australian Capital Territory, as well as those in the rest of Australia, dismiss the idea that this National Capital belongs to any one section of the people. It does not belong only to the people of Canberra or to any other section of the Australian community; it belongs to the whole community. Therefore, it behoves every one of us, if he has any pride whatsoever in his country, to see to the best of his ability that the National Capital will be a credit to Australia. The honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory rightly stated last night that very few members of the Parliament see fit to remain over the week-ends during sittings of the Parliament in order to have a look at this place. An honourable member on my right says, "" Hear, hear "". If anybody took the trouble to have a look at the most inadequate airport terminal at Fairbairn on a Friday morning of a parliamentary sitting week he would see quite an appreciable jam of human bodies trying to get on the first available aircraft to fhe north or to the south-tryin g to get out of this place just as quickly as they possibly could. west, but not quite so quickly. If some honourable members can catch transport on Thursday nights, they do so. should have a yarn with Hughie Leslie. also with the honourable member for Grayndler, whom I have seen on some Thursday nights between 7 o'clock and 9.30 o'clock looking for a vehicle to get him to Sydney. It would not do any honourable member any harm to stop in Canberra occasionally for the week-end to see what makes this place tick. ber from Victoria asks, "" Does it tick? "" I am sure that to-morrow morning he will be going hot-footed for Melbourne because the semi-finals of the football are to be played there. I suggest to him that he remain in Canberra over the week-end. One semi-final of the Australian Rules football will be played here on Saturday and one on Sunday, so he will not miss anything but will be able to enjoy some sport. Unless honourable memhers are prepared to give some time to having a look at this city, they will not know what makes it function. We all recall, as the honourable member for Chisholm mentioned last night, when the building of a swimming pool in Canberra was first contemplated. Criticism came from everywhere. Thank goodness the criticism had no effect on those who were determined to establish that amenity in this capital! I say that because a swimming pool was necessary, and not merely to provide something for the people living in Canberra. If we did not do jobs such as that, how would we look in the eyes of the world when we tried to stage some sporting event in the National Capital? Surely the people of the Commonwealth did not want us to have only a duck pond or something of that kind for world champions when we invited them t'o come along to show us their prowess! I congratulate every one associated with projects such as that, because they are the people who will look forward to see what this city should have, will get into the job and will have it completed. Unfortunately, because of the state of the economy at various times, other projects in the sporting field, the public field and every other field have been started and then stopped, and, as every one is aware, it takes a long time to get them started again. Therefore, I am sure that honourable members and every thinking person outside the Parliament will agree that the creation of this commission has been needed for a long time and will hope it will be able to do something, as I think it will if it is given the opportunity. The Seat of Government Acceptance Act was passed as long ago as 1909, and the idea of establishing a national capital was contained in that document. I wonder whether honourable members realize how many departments have been moved to the National Capital since 1936. I made myself aware of it to-day. No department has been moved to this city since 1936. Admittedly the departments already here at that time have expanded. That has been caused by the increase of population and the increase of the functions that have to be carried out by the National Parliament. Also, two new departments have been created. From memory, they are the",32,National Capital Developmen T Commission Bill 1957

94,Mr Hamilton,"An honourable memDepartment of National Development and the Department of Immigration. But there has been no movement of departments to this capital since 1936. If this city is to be built as was envisaged in the late 1890's and as the founders of the Constitution wrote into section 125 of that document, then at long last we should be making a move and this measure has not been brought forward too early. The growth of Canberra has been truly remarkable. If honourable members care to refer to "" Hansard"" of two or three years ago, they will find that I said then that no city development in the world could compare with the rapid advancement of Canberra; and the city is nowhere near completed yet. When I first came here in 1946 I think the population was 12,000. As the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory mentioned last night, the population is now 37,000 or 38,000. An increase of pop'dilion of that magnitude requires a lot of building, housing, roads and services of every kind. We have a big job in front of us if we are to carry out the plans envisaged at the end of the last century. That task requires the immediate creation of of some authority that can carry on, unhindered by the ramifications of departmental procedure. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) said only recently that it was imperative to move sections of the defence services to the National Capital as early as possible. That means moving some 1,100 officers-agai n I am relying on my memory. Quite a number of homes will need to be built and services of every kind provided. Therefore, the creation of this commission is warranted at this juncture. commission will mean that the task will In the past, some criticism has been levelled at the departments handling the job of building Canberra. SinceI first became associated with the Department of the Interior, I have heard, not only in this Parliament, but also from civil servants throughout the Commonwealth, that unfortunately the Department of the Interior is the backwater of the Government. It certainly has been since I have been associated with it. The honourable member for Chisholm referred, in his speech last night, to "" Operation Admin."" and the various plans that were subsequently prepared and then altered or discarded. No one could complain if there were a decline in morale amongst men engaged in these departments when, after taking the trouble to work out the necessary details of these plans, the whole of their work had to be more or less thrown into the waste-paper basket because of some movement of the economy or for some other reason. In view of that situation, the officers of these departments should be most highly commended for the progress they have achieved. As was pointed out by the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory, the honourable member for Chisholm, and myself a few moments ago, the growth of this capital during the past ten years has been remarkable, and the job done by the men in the departments under most trying circumstances has been excellent. I know myself that they have not confined their work to the hours between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., but have taken the job home with them to tackle at night or over the weekend. After concentrating and giving their all in the hope that something decent would emanate, to see their work tossed into the waste-paper basket must be frustrating. Therefore, they are to be most highly commended for what they have done. The building of this city has been entrusted to the Department of the Interior and the Department of Works, and it is only natural that there should be some differences and some slight friction. However, a small body of men concentrated within those departments has been able to keep things at least on a reasonably even keel, and they have done a truly remarkable job. Therefore, I hope, and I am sure that every honourable member hopes, now that the importance of building this city has been realized, that the creation of this really be tackled with some determination and some continuity so that it can be completed as early as possible. I hope that the gentlemen who undertake this job will not only be mindful of the fact that they must build homes and roads and provide footpaths, electricity, sewerage and water, but also will have a true vision of what this capital must ultimately become. I hope one of the jobs that they attempt reasonably earlyI do not say to-morrow-wil l be the construction of a new Parliament House. I remember when I first broached this subject to a Minister of the Interior in this place. His reaction was truly remarkable, but I am very glad to say that at this moment he thinks along the same lines as I is to increase as we hope, it will not be long before, as the honourable member for -Chisholm( Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes) said last night, this Parliament will be bursting at the seams. Then we shall have a nice kettle of fish, and I would not envy -either Mr Speaker or the President his job when that happened. I can only hope that the proposed commission will pay .some regard at least to the commencement of work on a new parliament house. This building could then be ear-marked for some other special purpose. I believe that it would make an admirable high court, ;but that is for some one else to decide. Last night the honourable member for Bonython( Mr Makin) referred to the -condition of the airport terminal in this -city. Opposition Members -Hear, hear! support of honourable members opposite, but I can recall very clearly that when a -certain Minister for the Interior was anxious to get on with the job of improving it, the work had to be put to one side because faint zephyrs were threatening to -chill the economy. I wish to say quite frankly, and without any criticism or bitterness towards any individual, that the airport terminal is a disgrace, not only to -Canberra but to the Commonwealth of Australia as well, and to every taxpayer in this country. I have often refrained from replying to criticism of Canberra's development, but I do not intend to do so any longer. I believe that to support criticism of the building of magnificent structures in this centre is merely to pander to the low type of person-fortunatel y such people are rare-wh o gives no thought to the future of his country. We have before us many examples of capital city development in other parts of the world. Let us ensure that we are not guilty of stupid mistakes, of lack of vision or of being miserable in providing finance. Let us look round the world and see what has been done elsewhere. We are one of the world's youngest nations, but nonetheless important for that. We, as the custodians of public finance, should get on with, the job of looking after the public welfare and ensure that in this National Capital we shall have buildings that will be a credit to Australia, do. If the population of this country and a source of pride to the Australian people. Some of the buildings that have been erected in other parts of the world have little more permanence than structures of straw and mud. I welcome this legislation and congratulate the Minister upon being able, at long last, to introduce it. I know the battle that he has fought to bring it forward. I also commend all his predecessors for the job that they have done since I have been associated with the Parliament. Legislation such as this has long been wanting and the Parliament owes the Minister and his predecessors a great debt for their determination and energy which have resulted in the proposal that, at last, we have before us to-day. with every other honourable member who has spoken, I support the bill, though not without reservation. Taken by and large-, its purpose is the improvement of the capital city, and any honourable member who is imbued with the national spirit must support it. As I see it, the bill streamlines the plan for the development of Canberra. Such a bill is long overdue because, unfortunately, Canberra's development has, for a variety of reasons, been retarded. No' sooner had the capital been established in 1927 than we encountered the chill depression winds of the 'thirties. No money could be spent on "" frills"" when there was not enough available to enable hundreds of thousands of decent Australians to keep body and soul together. No one could blame a government for failing to carry out large-scale improvements in Canberra during that period. We had just emerged from the depression when we were faced with a second world war. Again, money was needed for more serious and necessary purposes. After the war there was a great need for expenditure in such fields as the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen, and it was another two or three years before any plans of a worthwhile kind could be made for Canberra's development. Since that time there have, of course, been allocations to successive Ministers foi this purpose. However, from the information that I have gleaned, it would appear that this money has not always been spent in the most advantageous manner-that there has been a duplication of control and a constant and confusing cross-current of",34,National Capital Developmen T Commission Bill 1957
95,Mr Hamilton,I . appreciate the,36,National Capital Developmen T Commission Bill 1957
96,Mr Bird (Batman) [2.39],"In commonactivity. Indeed; it is remarkable that we have achieved as much as we have done. 1 am very much afraid that the human element has entered far too greatly into the scheme of things. To use a colloquialism, there have been too many cooks spoiling the broth. I hope that this bill will do away with that sort of incubus, which has certainly not helped progress. The sporadic and spasmodic efforts of the. past will now be directed into more orderly and progressive channels. That is all to the good. The stage has been reached when the development of this capital city must be accelerated if it is to be worthy of the name and justify its existence. Ever since Canberra was suggested as the site for the National Capital it has been the subject of criticism. There was a great deal of controversy over the site, and when the capital was established in 1927 it was described in all quarters of the Commonwealth as a white elephant. Even to-day I hear a great deal of criticism of Canberra as I move about Australia's best capital cityI refer, of course, to Melbourne. The Melbournians say that it was a great mistake to move the seat of government from Melbourne but, as the honourable member for Canning( Mr Having said that, 1 could quite easily wax Hamilton) has said, under the Constitution it had to be done. The visitor to Canberra merely sees buildings dotted here and there with 2 or 3 miles of paddocks in between. Many people seem to think that this is unworthy of a national capital. I hope that, with the passage of this bill, work will be expedited, and plans will be brought into operation to make this a city suited to the purposes for which it was originally intended, and a national capital in every sense of the term. An examination of the measure indicates that great responsibilities are to be vested in the proposed National Capital Development Commission. It is true that the commission will have three members, but, in fact, it will be a one-man band. As far as I can judge, the commissioner will be all-powerful, and I should say that the two associate commissioners will fill the role merely of advisers. The success of this proposal will be gauged by the capacity of the commission to deliver the goods. We should support it in every way possible, and see that it gets away to a good start. It is to be vested with powers that are rather unusual in Australia. I realize that there are other government, instrumentalities controlled by commissioners who have almost supreme powers, but it is uncommon to find a situation in which an urban population as large as that of Canberra is subject to a person with powers such as the proposed commissioner will have. That is not necessarily a matter for criticism, because conditions here are such that some one in authority with dictatorial powers is needed. 1 say that, not critically, but, at the moment, more or less in approval. Unless the person who is responsible for delivering the goods has dictatorial powers, we shall not achieve anything like what we hope to achieve, because so much red tape has to be cut away and so many obstructions have to be removed. To be perfectly honest, I think that the commissioner will need to be ruthless and ready to tread on a few corns. If he is not, we shall not get the results that the Parliament expects. The need for planning is apparent on all sides. Everywhere, in Canberra, one sees evidence of a lack of planning, as well as of bad planning. There seems to have been a casual and haphazard approach to many of the problems of developing Canberra. enthusiastic, and say that we should spend unlimited sums of money on all sorts of grandiose plans to bring Canberra to a condition as near perfection as possible. Unfortunately,, of course, this Government and those that will follow it will have to maintain a balance. They will not be able to spend all their money on one scheme. Governments of this Commonwealth have to administer the whole of the country, and all sorts of pressures aTe brought to bear upon them to spend money on this, that, or another thing. That is not to say that no large amounts should be spent on Canberra. But, we should see that the taxpayers receive value for any money spent here. I think that, if they do, every one in Australia will commend this Government on the introduction of this bill. There is much to be done in Canberra. Vital decisions have to be made. No doubt, the persons who make them will be subjected to criticism. After all, the only man that is never criticized is he who never does anything. I hope that the proposed commissioner will be a man of strong purpose. I hope, and I am sure, that the Minister for the Interior( Mr Fairhall) has in mind have wider powers than are usually given to for the appointment a particular gentleman a body of this kind, but I hope that it will wno possesses all the qualifications for the not exercise them under too remote a control job. Believe me, he will need very high from the Minister. In certain circumqualifications. Among them, I think, he stances, remoteness from ministerial control should have a streak of ruthlessness, as well may be a good thing, but in other circumas determination and resolution, so that he stances, it can be a very bad thing. I hope will not be deterred by puny criticism that the Minister, irrespective of his other huried at him by groups of people who ministerial duties, will give sufficient time think that this, that, or another thing should to the study of any recommendations or be done. The commissioner will have to reports submitted by the commission on determine what should be done, and how matters of policy. The commission will priorities shall be allocated, and he will be have substaniial responsibilities and wide in a far better position to judge than will powers.

In recent years, the committee has investigated I shall give an illustration of what the Public Works Committee has discussed in relation to Canberra in recent years. Recently, we were called upon to look into the question of a new traffic bridge and, in the course of our investigations, much expert evidence was called. As a matter of fact, almost everybody who had any knowledge of the subject at all was called to give evidence. We made inspections of the site and eventually we came to a decision in regard to the bridge, but, in arriving at that the plan for the lay-out of Canberra except decision, we were able to obtain and consider information relating to Canberra's traffic problems, such as the density of traffic and the necessity for more roads, and Many papers are laid on the table of the also we were able to find out something about the lakes scheme. We were able to find out, for example, as was mentioned by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Wimmera mentioned last night, the deletion Lawrence), that a certain part of the lakes scheme-the West Lake proposal-ha d been excised from the scheme without the knowledge of practically everybody. That fact came out when we were investigating the Canberra bridges project and we specially mentioned it in the report that we submitted to the Parliament two or three years ago. In that investigation, our chairman gleaned a lot of information in his official capacity that would be most useful to this proposed committee. Then again, two or three years ago, we investigated Canberra's water supply. We made trips to the hills surrounding the Cotter River. We went almost everywhere. We went to Melbourne to investigate its water supply. In that investigation, the chairman amassed much information. Recently, when we carried out an investigation of the Canberra hospital project, we obtained a lot of information about the projected increase of the population of Canberra and that sort of thing. Four or five years ago, we investigated the need for a new national library building in Canberra, and we took evidence in Melbourne and Sydney in relation to that project. Therefore, from the point of view of the bridges, the lakes scheme, the water supply, the hospital and the National Library, I submit that nobody would be more competent to serve on this new committee than the chairman of the Public Works Committee, because, as a result of his association with the Public Instead of the Minister giving only two or Works Committee, he has been able to equip himself with a lot of knowledge which, I am certain, it would take other people years to acquire. The chairman of the Public Works Committee has access to the files of that committee, and I suggest it would be a mistake to exclude him from the new body. He could certainly make a positive contribution to Canberra's progress in the future. Another provision of the bill with which I desire to deal is clause 11 (5.) which will prevent the commission from departing from with the approval of the Parliament. Theoretically, that is a good provision, but in actual practice it will not mean much. Parliament. Almost anything can get through without anybody knowing anything about it. As the honourable member for of the West Lake from the lakes scheme got through with hardly anybody knowing anything about it. This is a proposal to perpetuate a system that has failed in the past. A multitude of documents are laid on the table of the Parliament and hardly anybody knows anything about them. A million and one things have to be considered. Ministers cannot be expected to have the fullest appreciation of all matters. I would say that the experience of the past shows that, because of pressure of business, alterations such as the deletion of the West Lake scheme have gone through almost unnoticed. A Minister may be abroad and the Minister temporarily in charge of his department, not knowing much about it, could put his signature to a proposed alteration. The document would be laid on the table of the Parliament, and before one could say "" Jack Robinson"" it would go through. Because of our unenviable experience in the past in relation to the deletion of West Lake, we should not encourage such a state of affairs. Therefore, I suggest that every proposed variation of the original Canberra plan should be referred to the recently formed Joint Parliamentary Committee on Canberra. I understand that that committee, consisting of members of both Houses, was formed for the purpose of giving consideration to matters referred to it by the Minister. With that objective I heartily concur. three minutes of his valuable time to a departmental officer who comes in to give reasons why the plan should be changed, putting his signature to the document and letting the matter go at that, he could refer the suggestion to the Joint Parliamentary Committee. The members of that committee are a band of enthusiasts; otherwise they would not be on it. They could give the matter consideration and arrive at a considered verdict, not in the space of two or three minutes, but after hearing all the evidence for and against. I suggest to the Minister that he consider doing this, because it will prevent surreptitious altering of the plan, as has occurred in the past. Finally, as one who has had some muniliamentary reports can be. If one looks cipal experience, I regret that provision is on one side at the preoccupation of the not made on this advisory committee for Public Service with the daily task of adminicitizen representation. I do not suggest that stration, and, on the other, at Ministers all members should be elected by the citimaking decisions and giving effective reprezens of Canberra.

The commissioner will have a wonderful range of views on almost every matter with historical reasons, this is a somewhat spoilt which he has to deal, and when the two community. When public servants first experts in any particular field are unanimous came up from Melbourne and regarded in an opinion, that will be something at themselves as exiles from civilizationleast to be taken very seriously.

Because of another are quite out of relationship, and effective in other ways. The commissioner There is the further factor that, for far from life in Canberra being a disability, this is in many respects a privileged city Many things in Canberra are subsidized case for establishing a fully effective local a long period must elapse before there can be local government as we understand it elsewhere. Much has been made of the question of annual appropriations. It derives, of course, historically from the fact that under all governments there have been sudden -switches of the amount of money being made available for the development of the -city. That, surely, is inherent in our whole -system of annual budgeting; but there is no -need for it to be so. The fact is that, whatever long-term financial provision has been made for Canberra, that provision must be reviewed from year to year by the government of the day. It is not a question merely of what this Government will do next year; it is a question also of what its -successor will do. But the many policies -of government can by no means be com-pressed within the three years of the maximum life of a parliament. The principle -of annual review and annual budgeting is right at the root of parliamentary control -of expenditure and I , for one, do not support the idea that an appropriation for -Canberra should be for more than one year at a time. That does not mean in practice that it cannot be kept on an even keel. On one occasion when expenditure on Canberra was cut, it was done, not with 'Canberra in view, but at a time when the -Commonwealth decided that public works were to be curtailed to hold back inflation. It was thought desirable that the -Commonwealth should set a good example, .and Canberra suffered. Any general decision is apt to be particularly silly in detailed -circumstances in individual cases. I suggest that we should be greatly misled if we got away from the principle of annual budgeting We have the example of the ""Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme, which is far more committed in advance than would be any building that is likely to be erected in Canberra, and which can 'be managed very well on annual appropriations. The tasks immediately ahead of the commissioner are serious in themselves. The bringing of 1,100 members of the Defence Department and their dependants will be :a very large operation. I hope that in the future the Government will make every -effort not to bring people to Canberra ahead of the provision of adequate facilities to enable them to continue their domestic lives. There has been a number of cases of broken homes and, at best, cases of people having to spend years away from their wives and families. There is really no reason why, if the various departments acted as a whole, that should be so. Apart from promoting efficiency of government, the movement of the services and their civil service counterparts to Canberra is to be greatly welcomed as a useful diversification of Canberra life. Another matter which should be considered and which has already been mentioned is the planning and building of a future parliament house. I suggest that we should seriously consider the establishment of a parliamentary committee to examine that question, because every one else is likely to be too busy and too preoccupied to give to it the attention which it really deserves. The provision in Canberra of houses for Ministers should also be considered. In practice, the efficiency of government suffers greatly from the frequent, almost total, absence of all Ministers from Canberra. I know from personal experience as a public servant under two governments of different political colour that there were numerous occasions on which it was important to get a rapid decision, particularly on events occurring overseas, and when it was quite impossible to contact several members of the Cabinet by telephone because they were scattered all over the Commonwealth without any effective corporate nucleus being left in Canberra. I suggest that we would do well to examine the South African practice. Perhaps South Africa has gone farther than we should ever wish to in providing houses for all Ministers in both the administrative capital of Pretoria and the parliamentary capital of Cape Town. Until we have a number of houses for Ministers, and have at least a proportion of Cabinet living steadily in Canberra, moving from there to their appointments instead of coming occasionally to Canberra, the efficiency of government will suffer. The fact is that our constitutional fathers committed us to creating a capital in the wilderness, and living in it; and until the most senior of the persons involved in that process live in Canberra government will continue to be less efficient than it should be and will not be as effectively carried out by Ministers and the Parliament as it should be. Mr J. R. Fraser -There are some vacant houses at the Causeway. that, but there are not many others. There are several matters in respect of which the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory may be of some assistance. He pointed out, I think very rightly, and I agree with him entirely, the need for vision and thinking big in this matter. I hope that he will do his best, in order to help in that direction, by overcoming some of the local practices which drag us the other way. For instance, I understand that there is an effective darg on the laying of bricks in this capital city. I do not know the actual number, but I understand that the darg is now about 450 bricks a day, which is certainly well below the number of bricks a good piece-worker would normally lay on a housing job. I am also told that there is a very active darg at the local brickworks. That brickworks is highly essential for the development of Canberra, and its continued failure to produce bricks in adequate numbers is at least part of the reason why the Canberra landscape is dotted with so many eyesores. I would not profess to be an expert, but I suggest that that is something the Government should examine very closely; and if, in fact, after all these years and development of the Australian Capital the Government cannot run the brickworks efficiently and produce a reasonable number of bricks, it should consider allowing private enterprise to do the job. I agree with the honourable member for the Territory was accomplished during the the Australian Capital Territory in his life of that commission. Whether or not suggestion that changes in the Canberra plan that is so I am not in a position to test, such as that which led to the lake leaking but I. should like to say something about away, should be specifically dealt with by the composition of the authority proposed the Parliament as substantive matters to be established under the bill. instead of merely being dealt with in documents laid on the table of the House. It is a sad admission if, after regulations have it will at least bring to an end the duality lain on the table of this House for a period of authority operating in this Territory in of fourteen days or three weeks, they are respect of development and building. It not looked at by responsible members of will end the conflict between the Departthis House and debated. Absolute vigilance ment of the Interior and the Department of by the Parliament is essential to safeguard Works. In making that statement. I do not our fundamental liberties. If such things wish to belittle either department in any in fact happen in this Parliament, that is a way. The officers of those departments, failure with which we should deal instead have been motivated by the highest ideals. of attempting to deal with it piecemeal in Nevertheless, conflict in their ideas hasrelation to particular pieces of legislation. brought about a very undesirable state of There is no doubt that the national capital of any nation is a symbol and should be a focal point of national pride. I believe that we should give the Minister every support that we can give him; and, when the new commissioner is appointed, we should also give him every support. They will both need it. The commissioner will need the support of the Minister, and the Minister will need the support of the Cabinet. He will also continue to need a very fruitful flow of finance. Mr O'CONNOR (Dalley) [3.30] -The House has listened to a number of authoritative and thoughtful speeches on the bill. I am prompted to take part in the debate because I am a member of the Public Works Committee, in consequence of which I have knowledge, limited though it may be, of some of the developments and projects affecting the National Capital that have been before that committee over the last ten years. I say, advisedly, that my knowledge in that respect is limited. One of the most thoughtful contributions to the debate was made by the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. R. Fraser). The bill, as the Minister for the Interior( Mr Fairhall) has said, proposes something that is not original. It could be termed a variation of a theme; and in this instance the theme is the control Territory. The Minister pointed out that the Australian Capital Territory was, in the late 1920's, subject to a commission of the kind proposed in the bill. He also said that some of the best work in the history of Whatever else the bill will accomplish",41,National Capital Developmen T Commission Bill 1957
98,Mr Bury,"Yes; I can well believeaffairs. So, I feel that it is in the interests brought to Canberra, additional problems of the Territory that that situation should be brought to an end. Some reference has been made to the new Parliament House. I have been informed that it is suggested that the new Parliament House should be built on a site which is completely contrary to the proposal contained in the Burley Griffin plan. If any such idea is entertained at the moment I suggest that people who entertain it should abandon that line of thought and return to the original Burley Griffin proposal. I think that the suggested site for the new Parhament House is not suitable and that the current proposal should be abandoned in favour of the originaf proposal. It is interesting to contrast the develoption and opposition in others. One can ment of Canberra with that of Washington. As every one knows, Burley Griffin was an American; and continued reference has been -made to the similarity between Washington and Canberra. Whilst that similarity exists, I think that it is well to point out that Canberra is .growing at a far greater rate than Washington did in its early days. Canberra's population has doubled during the last eight years and to-day is about 38,000. When the United States of America had a population of approximately 9,500,000, which is Australia's population to-day, the number of persons in Washington was 15,000. So to-day, we have over twice as many people in our National Capital as the United States had .in its capital at a correshall-be appointed by the Governor General. sponding stage of that nation's development. From 1810 to 1840 the population of Washington rose by only 18,000. The population of Canberra has more than doubled in the last eight years. It is true that after 1850 Washington developed at a far greater rate. The movement of departments to Canberra has been referred to. I think it is worthwhile to make the point that at present 7,000 public servants who will eventually be brought to Canberra are located in Melbourne. The ""first move in this direction -will be to bring 1,100 of'them to Canberra -within the next two or three years. The -Government is to be congratulated on facing up to this matter, but whether its plans will 'be fulfilled remains to be -seen. The uprooting of such a large number of people presents a very formidable problem, not only to the employees themselves but also to their families. When they have been will arise in providing housing, hospital and health facilities, roads, and so on. Mr O'CONNOR And educational facilities also. Therefore, I think that the Government should formulate a programme, stating a definite deadline for the establishment of each department in Canberra. The people involved should be given reasonable notice of the Government's intention, because they will have to uproot themselves from their surroundings and start a new life here. It is not an easy problem to solve. The proposal to remove the departments to Canberra has been met with great enthusiasm in some quarters, but with obstrucreadily appreciate the position of public servants who have only five or ten years to serve. Their lives, homes and everything they possess are centred in other cities. They will be expected to lift themselves from those surroundings and start life anew, at a stage when they are thinking of retiring from work. It is safe to say that .quite a lot of the obstruction to the transfer of departments from Melbourne to Canberra comes from quarters outside the Government. The contentious clauses in the bill are clauses 4, 11, 21 and 25. Clause4 provides that fhe commissioner shall be assisted by two associate commissioners, each of whom The Minister for the Interior( Mr Fairhall) proposes the establishment of a commission wherein one man will have sole authority .and power to determine the .development and planning of this capital. Although other honourable members have said that they approve of this idea, I do not. To me, it seems that two associate .commissioners to assist the commissioner would be iredundant. The proposal is that .these associate commissioners shall be completely bereft -of .all authority and power, except -such as may ibe delegated -to them by the commissioner. That being the case, why .is lit -necessary to appoint associate -commissioners? . i .think it «w.ould »be better .and .more democratic to elect a commission of three ;persons with full voting power and .authority than (to ihave one commissioner, assisted by two .associate commissioners who have no authority at all. I am not at .all in iavour rof having all the power and",44,National Capital Developmen T Commission Bill 1957
99,Mr Chambers,"And education.authority vested in one person. To me, it seems anomalous to appoint associate commissioners to act in whatever capacity and degree shall be determined by the commissioner. Clause 21 provides that, on 31st March of each year, the commission shall submit to the Minister particulars of proposed expendiposes ro set up a committee to advise the ture for the nnanciai year commencing on the following 1st July. The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Bury), who spoke in support of this clause, said that that was a very good proposal. In travelling round with the Public Works Committee, visiting such places as Darwin, I have found that most Public Service departments regard yearly allocations by the Treasury as one of the greatest obstacles with which they have to contend in the development of any place or project. They find that it is impossible to plan effectively when they are tied to yearly allocations. Under this system, if an allocation has not been spent when the end of the financial year approaches, there is always a hurry and scurry on the part of those responsible for the spending of the money to ensure that they will spend their allocation and put themselves in the position of being able to justify their demands for the ensuing financial year. Because of the annual review and allocation by the Treasury, they find that they are not able to do any effective planning. That has been the experience of government departments throughout the Commonwealth. It is not merely my opinion, but the opinion also of highly placed public servants. Year by year, they are required either to cut back or accelerate their spendof the committee altogether. Allow him ing towards the end of the financial year, and this interferes drastically with any longundoubtedly now has, rather than push range project to which they may be committed. A large project may necessitate the expenditure of from £1,000,000 to £5,000,000. The preparation of plans and drawings for such a project takes from nine to twelve months. When departments are restricted to a yearly allocation, it is quite be necessarily bad. The history of Canberra possible that the whole project will be held up or will ultimately collapse. That has happened time and time again. We have found instances in which the Government has decided to withdraw an allocation from one project, to the detriment of that project, and use it for something else. Therefore, I submit that the idea of keeping K -15] allocations down to twelve months is not, in the long run, in the best interests of the development or planning of the Australian Capital Territory. As I said before, there is ample evidence to support that point of view. In clause 25 of the bill, the Minister procommission. IL will be known as the National Capital Planning Committee. The Minister has proposed that the commissioner himself shall be the chairman of the committee. One of the ideas that was presented by Government speakers was that this would prevent any conflict between the commissioner and the committee. If there happens to be a conflict between the commissioner and the committee it does not follow that that in itself, of necessity, must be bad. But the honourable member for Wentworth said that if the commissioner had to act in this capacity as chairman of the committee it would go a long way towards reducing the possibility of conflict. What will be the position of people on an advisory committee who find that the chairman himself is very much opposed to one of their propositions and that, notwithstanding their point of view, he has the power of veto? It will not be very beneficial to them to know that the man who presides over their committee will have the power of veto. It is evident that the National Capital Planning Committee will only advise the commissioner and. rather than give the commissioner the power of veto, I think it would be in the best interests of all to keep him away from the deliberations to retain the authority to veto, which he him into a position in which he will preside over a committee which might find itself in opposition to him on quite a number of matters. While it has been suggested that this might be a way of avoiding a deadlock, I do not subscribe to the idea that disagreement between the two parties would shows definitely that the differences of opinion that have prevailed from time to time between some of the authorities in this Territory have resulted in quite a lot of good. I think that the membership of the proposed committee could be considerably widened to the benefit of the committee and of the Australian Capital Territory. I fail to see why it is necessary to stipulate that two members of the committee shall possess artistic or cultural attainments sufficient to enable them to sit on the committee. What, it might be asked, is the definition of artistic or cultural attainments under the bill? I think it would be far preferable to allow the appointment of two people without making that stipulation. I support other speakers who have paid quite apart from its beauty, impresses me. tribute to the members of the old committee It is the significance of the city as the who will resign as a result of this legislation National Capital of the Commonwealth coming into force.

What",45,National Capital Developmen T Commission Bill 1957
100,Mr Cleaver (Swan) [3.52],"I rise to is more important, the city, in my opinion,having visited this place of beauty and importance, are quite unaware of the place that it should occupy in our thinking. The Federal Government consequently must plan adequately for the future. This hill is designed lo provide better planning for the future, and, talking of planning, I have been greatly impressed by these words uttered by Daniel Burnham of WashingtonMake no little plans. They have no magic to stir men's blood. Make big plans. Aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram, once recorded, will never die, but, long after we are gone, will be a living thing asserting itself with ever-growing insistency. Apparently the plans have not been big enough in the past. Fears have been allowed to intrude, and big plans, once conceived, have been reduced to very small dimensions. If we are to move forward with the establishment of this commission to build the National Capital as it should be built, we need a basic big plan, a plan that will so captivate us, irrespective of whether our responsibility be great or small, that we shall not allow it to be reduced as the years go by, bringing with them the difficulties and frustrations that others have faced in the past. The Minister, when presenting the bill, rightly paid tribute to many individuals who served the country well with their talent and leadership in other years. I am pleased, too, that he has referred to the 1955 report of the Senate Select Committee on the Development of Canberra, which he has described as a monumental piece of work. It has not been my privilege to read every word of that report, but I am indeed impressed with the research in which the members of that committee engaged. It is my view that the bill before us now may not have reached this House for some considerable time had it not been for the helpful research undertaken and the stimulating challenge to action presented by that Senate committee. I have referred to my initial contact with Canberra in 1947. That has given me the opportunity to look back over the past ten years and see the development that has taken place in this city during the post-war period. Can we be satisfied with what has been done? In answering that question, I should like to refer again to the report of the Senate committee, to which I pay tribute. The members of the committee draw attention to the fact that the Public Service Board, in its report for 1952, regretted the lack of progress in preparation for the intake of new public servants to the city. The board said that more than four years had passed, but it was impossible to begin the transfer of departments from Melbourne to Canberra. It said that the position was much as it had been before the great depression; that a planned policy, designed to provide office accommodation, housing and amenities was essential; and that it was necessary not only to prepare for the natural growth of Canberra, but also for its expansion. The board recommended that the Government should reaffirm its determination to make Canberra the centre of federal administration, and should act accordingly. The report for the next year indicated-that the demand for housing and amenities continued to outstrip the supply. It was apparent, at that stage, that coordination in planning for the development of this city was lacking. Administrative building accommodation without adequate housing surely is not sound planning, and that is the situation as we see it to-day. Many of the people who gave evidence before the Senate committee stressed the fact that engineering research must precede major town planning, but it has been apparent again and again over the years that this engineering research upon which to build has not been available. For that reason, improved planning is the very objective of this bill, which seeks to establish a commission whose duty it will be to see that development goes forward on a planned basis. As other speakers have emphasized, the commission will work through an appointed commissioner who will have two associates. Much has been said about the task to be carried out by these men, particularly the commissioner. Let us be clear in our minds about this. We must realize that if we want a top quality man, as we do, this will be another highly paid Public Service position, but the appointee will need to bring to his appointment the qualifications for which the country asks and, therefore, he will be worthy of his h>""». irrespective of the cost. I am pleased that the bilr maices provision that the commission shall have available to it the departmental services which have been associated with the development of Canberra in recent years. 1 refer to the Department of Works and the Department of the Interior, both of which, naturally, have within them men who have been closely allied with what has gone on. It is only natural economy that the services of the officers and the equipment of those departments should be available to the commission when called upon. It is to be noted, however, that freedom is given to the commission to engage private enterprise for specific tasks. That is in line with my thinking, which is liberal thinking, for it emphasizes the economy that private enterprise can so often demonstrate-econom y and efficiency which are not available to a government organization. 1 am pleased that this freedom is given to the commission. Unification of all activities is also provided for in the bill. This will be a truly developmental commission, in that, when a task has been completed, the land and property will be transferred back to the relevant department. The commission is not building for the future as an established administrative body. I emphasize, also, that the Government, having approved of any particular five-year programme to meet present requirements in Canberra, the new commission, when organized and established, will face immediately the problems of housing and public utilities in this place. Wide powers have been given to the commission, but it will be noted, I am sure with confidence, that adequate ministerial and parliamentary control has also been set up under the proposed legislation. Several speakers have dealt with the financial provisions of the bill. Finance for the work of the commission is to be provided by annual appropriation. Again, 1 come as a contributor to the debate with some convictions about the established system of government finance for works of this kind. There seems to me to be a fear about breaking away from established custom. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr O'Connor) referred to his contact with this very problem of appropriation of funds for works as he has travelled in parliamentary delegations to one place or another. To some extent, I have had similar experiences, and I am not at all convinced that the annual appropriation system is essential to keep under close scrutiny the operations of the commission. Minister, in his second-reading speech, did not claim that that was the only means of maintaining close scrutiny, but he implied that, at least in his opinion, it was an aid. I want to affirm that budgeting for a full twelve months and budgeting beyond the period of twelve months often are adversely affected by annual appropriations. What does the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Development of Canberra say on this matter? If we turn to paragraph 49, we find that back in 1921 a committee which was responsible at that stage for the development of Canberra set a target for the establishment of the Seat of Government. That target was for a three year period, covering expenditure of approximately £2,000,000. The report, in paragraph 50, statesNotwithstanding the modesty of the programme it was not completed. The funds provided fell well below those asked for by the Committee£200,000 for the first year, instead of £400,000, and £330,000 and £430,000 instead of £700,000 for each of the second and third years. As the funds were not allocated until after consideration of the estimates it was not known till comparatively late in the year what funds were available. There is a section of the report which is headed "" Need for assured long-range finance "", and I propose to read short extracts from it. Paragraph 95 reads as follows:According to the evidence given by witnesses before the Committee, Governmental finance has been the major obstacle to Canberra's construction, lt was said that the system of annual appropriation delayed commencement of new projects and then caused a rush to spend money before the end of thefinancialyear, resulting in unevenness and uncertainty in planning and in the uneconomical use of moneys . . . Paragraph 96 is in the following terms:Witness after witness stressed that the first essential of any proposed development must be a guaranteed works programme with an assured allocation of funds over a period of years. Project budgeting, as it has been called, was advanced as the only satisfactory method of construction finance. The committee expressed the opinion that the necessary finance should be assured, irrespective of changes in economic conditions. The report, in paragraph 106, states that this is doubtless what the chairman of the Public Service Board had in mind when, during the course of his evidence, he referred to fluctuations in the building construction output and said that it The appeared to the board that the key to the position was for the authorities responviewed as a race apart. Local government sible for construction to have a clear in this city should be provided at some authority for a high level of expenditure time, and I do not approve of repeated on a programme based over a period of delaying actions. WhatI say in this respect years. I wish to bring to the notice of the House our democratic way of life, of which we the following recommendation of the are so proud. In this democracy of ours, committee:That the Authority That is, the commission now proposedbe guaranteed, by an appropriate provision in the that people may live in this city for a lifeenabling Act, sufficient finance to permit it to time and it should be their privilege and carry out a long-term balanced programme; .ind responsibility to administer it as people in that the Treasurer be enabled to make advances other communities in Australia are called to the Authority for the purposes of the Act. Reference has been made to the Snowy express the hope that the Government will Mountains authority and to the method not long delay the introduction of some of providing funds for it. I think we should satisfactory form of local government in recognize that the substantial funds the National Capital. advanced to the authority are made available without regard to the political complexion of the party in government, ancl ment of Canberra seemed to be very clear, that that has afforded the authority the after its research, on what should be done opportunity to budget along the lines I in this connection. In its report, reference have already suggested. Another aspect of the bill which, is of interest to us is the proposal to establish ment and circumstances warranta national capital planning committee. Much has been said in support of the inclusion of leading members of the professions of architecture, engineering and town planning, and also leaders in the cultural arts. That proposal appeals to me greatly. the The honourable member for Batman matters, at local Government authority level, as ( Mr Bird), who spoke a little earlier are delegated by the Minister from time to time. in the debate, seemed concerned about the Such a system might present considerable advisability of having the commissioner as difficulties, but I believe that all problems, chairman of this planning committee. He and particularly problems of this nature, felt that the commissioner, already having exist only to be overcome. wide powers, would be, as it were, a one man band and should not also be automatically chairman of the planning committee. and guide all building development. I trust I cannot agree with that attitude. In that there will be no misunderstanding about my opinion, it is the logical thing for the the plans that may be envisaged by the sercommissioner to have such close associavice establishments at any stage, because, in tion with the planning committee. Such, my opinion, even the plans of such establiaison appeals to me as being sound and lishments should be submitted for approval necessary for effective planning over thc to this National Capital Planning Comyears. Another point that I would like to stress authority were permitted to undertake probefore I conclude my comments relates to jects without first obtaining the endorsement the fact that the local population will not of the committee. I further hope that the be represented on the planning committee. section of the report of the Senate select I am aware that other honourable members committee which deals with the Royal Milihave touched on this matter. I suggest tary College will receive the early attention that the residents of Canberra must not be of the commission when it is established, can hardly be challenged when we think of local government is fundamental. The City of Canberra, as the National Capital, will always need to be heavily subsidized by the Commonwealth Government, but I stress upon to administer their cities. I therefore The Senate Committee on the Developis made to "" future municipal bodies "", and it is recommendedThat there be established as Canberra's develop(a) A Canberra Municipality for the City of Canberra, and (b) A Shire Council for the balance of the A.C.T. both bodies when constituted to be responsible to Minister through the Canberra Authority. That these authorities have power to deal with such The planning committee should approve mittee. The various approaches, vistas and the skyline could be disfigured if a service particularly the suggestion contained in paragraph 532 that the building of the new road should not be long deferred, and that the present road running through the college to the aerodrome should be closed to through traffic as soon as possible. PerhapsI should add my own personal conviction about the early building of the new Parliament House, for this building in which I now speak has, throughout the years, been known, at least by those associated with it, as a temporary structure. To-day, as other speakers have said, it no longer adequately serves the needs of the Commonwealth Parliament. My recommendation is that, to provide for the heavy cost which naturally must be spread over a long period of years, early provision be made of £1,000,000 or more annually, so that funds may be built up without a terrific impact on the economy of the country and with a view to ensuring the erection of a magnificent structure which will stand as a memorial to the foresight of those responsible for the leadership of the nation. Sir Littleton Groom, who was Minister for Home Affairs in this country in 1920, has been described as a man who was inspired by a flaming zeal for the building of this city. Canberra was conceived as a beautiful city and some people claim that it is already beautiful. Others contend that it is growing more beautiful year by year as not only the trees and gardens grow but also as buildings and amenities are developed. Let us be sure that no obstacles are raised to prevent this development commission, of which we are speaking this afternoon, from making the National Capital, within a few years, symbolic of the initiative and vigour of our young and free country. We shall need more men with the same sort of flaming zeal for the building and development of Canberra as Sir Littleton Groom possessed. They will need to be men who will not be daunted by any criticism or frustration. [4.16] I was very interested to listen to the second-reading speech on this bill by the Minister for the Interior( Mr Fairhall) and also the contributions to the debate that have since been made by honourable ?members. I want to say, right at the com-mencement, that I do not plead guilty to .one charge that was made here yesterdaythat honourable members know only the way .from the aerodrome to this House or from the hotel where they stay to this House. There are few streets or areas in this capital city that I have not visited on many occasions, and I think that I am in a position to express an opinion on the development of Canberra. 1 wish to give some credit to those who have been responsible for the work that has been done here. I do not think that simply because government departments have been in control of Canberra things have been done that do not conform to the original conception of Canberra. I give credit to those concerned for many fine things they have done in this city. The number of visitors who come to Canberra annually provide evidence of the appreciation that is growing everywhere of Australia's National Capital. I am not very much concerned about the proposal embodied in the bill to create a commission. Many honourable members seem to think that merely by changing the captain of a ship we will have a different ship. I am not looking for miracles from the commission that is to be appointed. The Minister himself, who is in control of Canberra, will be the one most relieved at the passing of this measure. He will be able to pass on much of the responsibility to the commission. I am not altogether satisfied that what is proposed in the bill will give a tremendous impetus to the building of Canberra or will result in an immediate pushing forward with the growth of this city as many desire. I think that when the commission is appointed and sets to work it will find itself very much in the same position in which Ministers for the Interior in the past have found themselves when they have attempted to do such work. I was interested last night in the remarks of the honourable member for Chisholm( Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes), the former Minister for the Interior, who was practically in charge of the development of Canberra for some time. I agree with him that the present Minister has been prepared to push forward because he has been imbued with that enthusiasm to which the honourable member for Swan( Mr Cleaver) has just referred to plan on a big scale and to do something worthwhile. But, finally, it all comes back to a matter of finance. If any one is told that he can proceed with a job which will cost £10,000,000 or £40,000.000. no matter how long it takes, the first thing he",47,National Capital Developmen T Commission Bill 1957
101,Mr Thompson (Port Adelaide),"has to find is the requisite money. What will his banker say about it? If an ordinary citizen wishes to build a far bigger home than the one in which he is living because he is not satisfied with a six-roomed house, and wants to have an acre of land surrounding his home, laid out in landscape gardens so that it will be a beautiful property, he has to go to his banker or a financier to get the wherewithal to meet the cost, unless he has the money in his pocket. Whoever is appointed as commissioner, or as assistant commissioners, will discover that the money will have to be found to pay for the work proposed. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr O'Connor) spoke about a yearly appropriation of funds. So long as the people of this Commonwealth have to be taxed yearly to provide revenue for the government I would say that we should stick to the yearly appropriation. If in any year it is found that the amount of revenue has fallen or that a bigger expenditure has been incurred by one section of the community than was expected, it will be far easier to make an adjustment on a yearly basis. That has been the experience in the past. In connection with the development of Canberra we have had to cut our cloth, in many cases, according to the moneys that have been available for all purposes throughout the Commonwealth. I am trying to consider this matter from a down-to-earth, practical point of view. I am trying to envisage what will be the practical results that will follow from the appointment of this commission. I think it was the honourable member for Batman( Mr Bird) who spoke about the commissioner as being a one-man band. As the representative of my constituency, I am not prepared to say to a one-man band in Canberra, "" You can do what you like with the revenues of this country"". If one man is responsible, he must be under strict supervision. The Minister may argue that the bill provides that by 1st March each year an estimate of expenditure for the following year must be prepared. That is a proper provision, and I take it that the Minister will be prepared to say to Cabinet whether that money should be made available for the purposes of the commission. Otherwise he would not be carrying out his job. Consequently, by Ist March each year an estimate of the funds necessary for the following year must come before the Minister. That will then be considered by other authorities, such as the Treasury and other departments, to ascertain whether the proposed expenditure is warranted and whether the Treasurer is prepared to raise and allocate money for the purposes set down or whether the proposed expenditure should be curtailed. When I consider this aspect and recall what was said by the honourable member for Chisholm last night-that Ministers for the interior in the past, who had vision and tried to get things done, suddenly found the ground cut from under themI feel that this commission may find itself in a similar position. I do not know what the intentions of the Government are in respect of the buildings that are needed in this capital city. A proposal has been made to bring departmental oflicers from Melbourne and other places. Two or three years ago a statement was made that when the new administrative building was completed, various departments would be brought to Canberra ant! the result would be an increase in the population of Canberra of approximately 7,000. There would be also the people who would be needed as schoolteachers, shopkeepers and assistants, postmen and so on as well as the wives and children of the officers who were brought to Canberra. I understand that it is intended to bring about 1,100 officers here to administer the headquarters of the armed services. However, I do not think that they will occupy all the space available in the administrative building. I hope they will not; I should expect that that building would accommodate more than 1,100 officers. But when they are transferred to Canberra they will need housing. I do not know whether honourable members, generally, feel they have a responsibility to their own cities or constituencies and the people there. We find that we cannot get enough money from the revenues of the country to build sufficient houses for them. I cannot understand the mentality of any honourable members who would suggest that absolute preference should be given to housing in Canberra. We must make Canberra a good place in which to live, and a worthy national capital, f want to see Canberra improved appropriately. At the same time, I will not criticize the Government because there are a number of persons waiting for houses in Canberra. I would not suggest *.hat the Government should build houses in Canberra at the expense of communities "":n my own electorate and in other places throughout Australia. It is very easy to look at these matters only on the surface, and I think we should avoid that when we are considering what is to be done in Canberra. Another question concerns the new parliament house. Will proposals for new buildings in Canberra of that character be referred to the Public Works Committee, or will tliey be considered only by the new National Capital Development Commission? Public Works Committee. aware, that is not stated in the bill. Authority is to be given to the new commission in connection with works and buildings? detract from the Public Works Committee Act at all. thing in the bill in that connection, but I will not argue on legal matters. Will it be the prerogative of the new commission to decide what type of school will be erected if it is decided that one is necessary? Will it be the prerogative of the commission to decide whether a school is needed and where it should be built, or will it be the responsiit is thought to be beneficial to work through bility of the Government to decide that a school is needed and must be erected? There is also a proposal to complete the National Library. Will the new commission be asked to decide when the Library will be built and what priority it will have? I should like to know what the position will be in connection with all such public works. It is all very well to say that the Government public purse should be controlled by the has fallen down on the proposal to build these places and that we will set up a commission for the purpose, but will we leave these matters entirely to the discretion of the commission? Let us suppose that there is to be a big expansion of housing in Canberra. Will the commission have the sole right to say where the houses will be built? I know that such a body will be bound by the Canberra plan and will not be able to depart from it materially, but I should like to have its jights defined. An honourable member spoke about a proposal to build a national church in Canberra. Will the commission have the right to say to those who want to build a national church where the church will be erected and whether it approves of the plan for the church, or will the persons interested go to the Minister or to the Government? I might be wrong, but from my reading of the bill, I am a little afraid that we might get away from parliamentary control of government departments, and that we might be giving too much power to a small body, f am not opposing the bill in any way. It has been submitted by the Minister for the Interior on a decision by the Government following a detailed inquiry by a Senate committee which inquired into the development of Canberra. I am merely putting forward some questions on matters I should like io have clarified by the Minister. I have referred, previously, to annual appropriations. This matter has been investigated by the Pubhc Accounts Committee, of which I am a member. It has been trying to determine whether there should be annual appropriations or trust funds for departmental expenditure. The Public Accounts Committee has listened carefully to the opinions of highly efficient officers who are well fitted to give advice, but the more we inquire into some of these matters, the more complex they become. In one case, a trust account and not on the basis of an annual appropriation, but such an arrangement would not be satisfactory in other oases. The question also arises of the control of national revenue and expenditure by the Parliament. Some members of the Public Accounts Committee feel strongly that the Parliament, but that control would be weakened by a departure from the system of annual appropriations. I know that honourable members, generally, would find it almost impossible to examine all the accounts that come before us, and to maintain parliamentary control over them as they desire. In fact, the Public Accounts Committee was set up for that reason. With the great number of members in the Parliament, and the wide diffusion of expenditure among departments, it was found necessary to appoint a committee of",51,National Capital Developmen T Commission Bill 1957

104,Mr Fairhall,This proposal does not,53,National Capital Developmen T Commission Bill 1957
105,Mr Thompson,"I did not notice anythe Parliament to look into these matters and report to the Parliament when it thought some action was necessary. The inquiries of the Public Accounts Committee have shown the need for control by the Parliament over national funds, and I wonder whether some honourable members realize how easily they could weaken the direct control of the Parliament over the revenue that is collected from the people of Australia. In those circumstances, I do not want to debate the bill generally. I do not want to go into the question of an advisory committee on town planning in Canberra, because I know that an advisory committee has been doing that work efficiently. If the Minister is satisfied that he can appoint another committee to carry out that work adequately, I am quite happy about the relevant provisions in the bill. How that control should be exercised is really a matter of Government policy. I hope, however, that the Minister will clarify some matters on which I have expressed doubts. I approve of the ministerial control as set out in the bill, and hope that the commissioner who is to be appointed will do the work efficiently. Mention was made of the brickworks at Canberra, its output and what was done with the bricks. The same results can be seen in both government and private enterprise. Some of our biggest industries simply throw money away. Private enterprises frequently employ men on Sundays and on Saturday afternoons at penalty rates, passing the extra cost on to the public by increasing the price of the manufactured article, when much of that extra cost could be saved by efficient management, t do not subscribe to the view, therefore, that private enterprise is invariably more efficient than government undertakings. I visited Darwin recently, as a member of the Public Accounts Committee, and I was most impressed by the work being done there by a government department. I saw work in progress on the construction of a new airstrip at the Darwin airport by members of the Royal Australian Air Force, who, of course, receive no penalty rates for working on Sundays. It was a real pleasure to see the way in which those men were prepared to work. No private enterprise could do the job better than those men did it. Let us not believe that a job done by a government department must necessarily be more costly than a similar job done by private enterprise. Much depends on the man in charge of the job, and very often on the ministerial control of the work. AlthoughI have been in Canberra for oniy about eleven years, I have formed a great liking for it and for what has been accomplished here. Many complaints have been made regarding the buildings that have been erected in Canberra, but when we consider what has been done in other cities, the comparison is very much in favour of Canberra. I know that many complaintsare justified, including one that was referred to by the honourable member for Chisholrrr ( Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes). I refer to a number of homes that were constructed at Narrabundah Heights. I believe that the sub-division of that section and the placing of the houses on particular allotments show very poor planning, and in the years to come people will ask why those houses were constructed in this fashion and on such small allotments. I was pleased to hear the honourable member for Chisholm say last night that he believed this mistake would not be repeated, and ! sincerely hope that it will not. I wish to say a few words about the way in which the City of Canberra is spreading out. I think this matter was also referred to by the honourable member for Chisholm. The city is now very widespread, and those who are earning the lowest wages and can least afford to pay fares are the ones who live at the greatest distance from their work. Transport costs, not only in Canberra but also in other cities, are adding very greatly to living costs. AlthoughI believe that a family man should have his own home unit, with his own grounds around it, I suggest that we must consider building more flats. I know that many large blocks of flats have been built in the neighbourhood of Civic Centre. AlthoughI have not been inside those flats, I understand that many people are very proud of them. Flats are not suitable for a couple who have young children, but many older people in our community to-day would be far better off in a good three-roomed flat than in the homes that they bought 30 or 40 years ago. Many of these people have now reached the age when they cannot keep those houses in repair. They live on superannuation payments, and because they have noi sufficient money to look after their houses properly, the houses are falling into disrepair. If vve look around the older portions of our cities we see old weatherboard and brick houses that "" Mum and Dud"" built 40-odd years ago. They still cling to those houses, but when you ask them, ""What about painting the house?"" they say, "" We have only our pension and cannot afford to paint the house "". Then they worry about the condition of the place. Some honourable members have from time to time argued that houses should be built only for sale, not for letting, but I believe that governmental or semi-governmentai instrumentalities in every State should construct suitable small homes for these older people. While listening to the radio to-day I heard that the Minister for Housing in Sydney has said that his government intends to spend a limited amount of money in providing small flats for pensioners. RecentlyI spoke to one of our housing authorities in Adelaide about the same question. He said, "" We have a group of those flats, in single-story buildings, and we are losing money on them "". f know that they are not returning an economic rental, but the people occupying them are much more suitably housed than they were previously. I suggest that when future building plans are being made for Canberra we should remember that we owe a big debt, which we will never be able to pay, to the old people in the community for what they have done through the years. When we are making our building plans, let us keep in mind the rights of these people, and do something for them. Will the proposed commission have the power to decide to build houses for old people and charge less than an economic rental for them? If so, where will the money come from? Or will such a. decision be made by the Government? When the Government delegates its responsibility to an outside or semi-»overnmental authority, it must ensure i that adequate provisions are made for all sections of the community. As I said at the beginning of my speech, dealt with the city beautiful. Washington, T can see in this measure the handing over I claim, has the right to concentrate its from the Minister to a commission of a attention on the construction of a city good deal of responsibility. I can see also beautiful primarily for this reason: The that certain functions which were prebasis of government in the United States viously exercised by an honorary National of America is entirely difTerent from that Capital Planning and Development Comin Australia. America isI am quite sure mittee will be transferred to another comthe Americans are grateful for this fact, mittee. I cannot find anything in the measure to convince me that the proposed commission will do the job better than government departments have done it in the past. deais with the machinery for ensuring the proper planning and development of Canberra. The Minister for the Interior( Mr Fairhall), in his second-reading speech, stated that the purpose of the bill is to establish a powerful and competent cornmission, charged with responsibility for the planning, development and construction of Canberra. In common with other honorabie members who have spoken in this debate, 1 have no objection to the purpose of the legislation. 1 am very much intrigued, however, by certain statements that have been made during this debate-first , by the constant attempts to compare Canberra with another national capital, Washington, and, secondly, by the suggestions that have been made, as they have been made previously, that the people of Australia owe much to the people of Canberra. They have made, and are continuing to make tremendous sacrifices to come and live in this place. Sir, I can find in the first place no reason for comparing Canberra with Washington as a national capital, nor can I find any sympathy for those who are compelled to live in Canberra. pathy. Rather do I envy them the conditions under which they live. First, let me deal with the comparison that has been made between Washington and Canberra. Much has been said of the desire to build a national capital. What should a national capital comprise? We do not judge a national capital purely on the bricks and cement and the paths and the bridges that are in it. A capital is surely something which conveys more than mere beauty. The whole debate so far on this bill has",53,National Capital Developmen T Commission Bill 1957
106,Mr Leslie (Moore) [4.44],This bill,55,National Capital Developmen T Commission Bill 1957
107,Mr Curtin,Why?,55,National Capital Developmen T Commission Bill 1957
108,Mr Leslie,"I say I can find no symand I am equally sure that vve are at times envious of thema country of free enterprise. It has not got a system of government with a responsible Ministry such as we have; America has a different system entirely. The result is that in America those who are responsible for decisions made in the national capital are people who are appointed heads of departments with complete responsibility to administer them and who are drawn from the people themselves. They become the permanent heads of the departments. They are the persons who have had a close association throughout their lives with the rest of thc people, and the decisions which they make are decisions which affect the people throughout the nation. While the United States is still a country of free enterprise, the impact of the decisions of Washington upon the people of America is nowhere near the impact of the decisions made by the people of Canberra on the people of Australia. We in this country are under a system of government that is subject to all the advice, direction and what-have-you of a civil service system, which is largely in control of the countrya civil service system in which the heads of the service are people who know nothing else than the administration of government departments. They have grown up in the protection of that system, and here in our National Capital we are building up a system under which such persons are growing up to an even greater degree in the protection of this system which denies to them contact with the common mob-the people outside. Country party politician! the Australian Country party outlook is not in existence in Canberra. If it were, there would be a far greater understanding of the fundamental problems of this country. It is an even greater pity that the honourable member himself does not care to enlarge his own mental capacity and become acquainted with some of the problems of the country. If he were to do so, he would be able to speak far more intelligently in this place. Canberra is not a city which is seeking beauty; it is a city seeking a soul. That is its biggest problem. It should be a capital which epitomizes the Australian spirit, the spirit of private individual initiative, private enterprise, the spirit of sacrifice in search of an ideal, the Australian way of life. We want to build here a city which will indicate to the rest of the world how Australia came to be built; and it was not built by people living in a city beautiful surrounded by hills and kept exclusive from the economic problems of the rest of tha country upon which those persons depend for their living. That is the need of Canberra. This bill deals purely with the mechanics of developing a city beautiful; it does not go to the extent of providing the Canberra people with the opportunity of building a city with a soul. That can come only by giving to the people of Canberra what the rest of the people of Australia have accepted willingly for themselvesa sense of personal responsibility for their own welfare. That has been the secret of the success of Australia hitherto. That is what is needed here. The question of an annual appropriation has been repeatedly referred to on both sides of the House. It has been suggested that Canberra will not succeed if its planning is limited by an annual appropriation, and that there should be a guaranteed regular annual income. Sir, that is the very thing which would kill any soul which thc people of Canberra cared to create and to put into the place. Anything to be of value must have cost something. The greater the sacrifice that has been made, the greater the value we attach to whatever it may be. To what extent the people of Canberra value the benefits that they exclusively enjoy I do not know; but I am certain that because the cost to them individually and personally has been so little-in most cases nothing whatsoever-thos e benefits are not appreciated as they should be. I do not say that the people would not appreciate them if they were given the opportunity to do so; I believe that they would appreciate them. From the conversations I have had with the people of Canberra, I am sure that they are eager to assume responsibility for their own welfare. They are as good Australians as the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith( Mr Curtin) who is still interjecting.

I have been a ratepayer for 30 years in a town in Western Australia, and I have not yet got a footpath outside my property. The schools, the hospitals, the halls, the roads and whatever else we have in that place have been provided out of resources which came from the community, with a small degree of government subsidy. The reverse position exists in Canberra. The result is that the things that I have provided for myself are of enormous value to me. We fight and we battle to get a little more and to make progress from day to day. member is here? gets money from here which he does not earn. that. soul that I want to see manifest in Canberra is not the soul of the honourable member. I want this Government to provide for the people of Canberra an opportunity to live as the people in the rest of Australia let us not talk about building a beautiful live. I am not unmindful of the fact that many people in Canberra, including civil servants, were previously resident in other parts of Australia, where they participated in the local affairs of the community and assisted in providing the things that they value. I believe that when they are compelled, as they are undoubtedly compelled, to live in Canberra, they would be willing to shoulder responsibility in this community to the same degree as they have done elsewhere, if they were given the opportunity. Such responsibility would compel them to rely, as the residents of other parts of Ausbenefit of Australia"". If we can imbue tralia rely, on varied economic conditions for what they had and for the manner in which they lived. They would be compelled to cut their coat according to the measure of their cloth and would recognize drought and pestilence and appreciate prosperity. That is the condition which would give Canberra a soul. IfI were to bring people from my electorate in Western Australia to Canberra and point out to them only the city beautiful, I would create in their minds envy and a doubt about the capacity of people who live in such luxurious circumstances to understand the needs of others. I want to bring people from my electorate to the Canberra where tremendously important decisions in this bureaucratically run country are made -decision s which are of far more import to the everyday life of the individual than decisions made in any other part of the country-and be able to say, "" These are the people upon whose advice governments act and who provide the material .upon which decisions are made. Here are the conditions under which they live. These conditions are the same as those enjoyed by you and me. These people are in common touch with the people of the rest of Australia, not merely by means of reports and statistics, but because they enjoy the same circumstances and living conditions, and thus have an understanding and a sympathy for the people whose destinies they are guiding "". That is what 1 want to see in Canberra. It can be done by giving to the people of Canberra no less a degree of responsibility in the management of their affairs than is given to people who live in other parts. I commend the Minister on this piece of mechanical advancement for Canberra; but capital city without recognizing the need to build a place which epitomizes the spirit on which this nation was built-the spirit of self-sacrifice, determination and enterprise. This is where the spirit of Australia centres; not in bricks and mortar, in the archives of our libraries, or in our museums, but in the way in which the people live. The people of Canberra should be able to say, "" This we achieved through our own combined and individual efforts. It cost us much in time, money and effort, but this is what we did for our benefit and for the Canberra people with that spirit, we will build a national capital of which we can be proud, and will encourage Australians to spend as much time in Canberra as they can. We will gain inspiration to build a better nation and will not be fearful that every time we return to our electorates some one will tell us that the people of Canberra are without responsibility and have only to open their mouths and the Government gives them what they want.

114,Mr Leslie,"My word I will! Thefirst step and that this is the mechanical process of building the Canberra that we wanta city with a real soul. with the honourable member for Chisholm( Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes), when he deprecates the practice adopted by the Government of rushing bills through the House in one day or so. That seems to be a trend which has developed lately. Just before the House adjourned, at the end of the last sittings, the Norfolk Island Bill, which dealt with matters that had not been discussed in this House for twenty years, was passed through all stages in one day. This bill was introduced yesterday, and the second reading debate continued immediately. It deals wiih an important subject, which has not been considered for many years. Honourable members should be given more time in which to study the measure and consider their attitude towards it. Ministers have an advantage because all the facts are before them and they have their advisers to help them. An entirely new approach to the type of city required for the National Capital is needed. The National Capital was primarily intended as a legislative and administrative centre, and when it was established, various matters had to be considered. As far as possible, it had to be in a central position and weight had to be given to the defence requirements of the day; it had to be away from the seaboard. State jealousies and vested interests retarded federation. New South Wales, the mother State, opposed federation for some time. A former Prime Minister and Premier of that State, after whom the electorate I have the honour to represent was named, was known as "" YesNo Reid"" because of his change of attitude from time to time on the question of federation. Ultimately, a compromise was reached. The capital was to be established in the area in which it now is. Even so, its establishment was retarded for 27 years because of the influence of Melbourne, of big business interests, of the administration, and even of parliamentarians. It was only because of the determination of a small group of parliamentarians in the early days that the first step towards the establishment of the capital at Canberra was taken. As the honourable member for Batman( Mr with much that was said by the honourable Bird) pointed out, there are still influences against the final changeover to Canberra. Apparently, Melbourne has not yet recovered from the shock it received when it learned that the capital was to be moved to Canberra. The establishment of the capital in Canberra, in 1927, was facilitated to some extent by a by-election, in 1926, for the electorate of Eden-Monaro, which surrounds thc Australian Capital Territory. I was a candidate for the Labour party on that occasion. There was much hostility at that time at the Government's apparent lack of sincerity about bringing the capital to Canberra. The issue was brought into that election campaign and had the effect of bringing the Prime Minister of the day, who was, by a strange coincidence, called Stanley Melbourne Bruce, to the electorate. He announced that Parliament would be moved to Canberra within twelve months. So, the by-election helped to establish the capital, in 1927. The complete changeover was still retarded for various reasons. The attitude of those engaged in the administration who are at present living in Melbourne and other capital cities is understandable. Naturally, they are concerned at the prospect of having to uproot their homes and families and overcome the limited opportunities for careers that offer in Canberra. With inter-continental ballistic missiles, siting considerations no longer apply, for a matter of 100 miles is neither here nor there -merel y another few minutes in the flight of the missile. Clearly, it does not matter whether the capital is inland or near the seaboard. Accessibility, another factor which previously retarded the development of Canberra, is no longer of any importance. In the early days honourable members had to travel to Canberra by train-ofte n all night and all day as well. Now we can come here in 40 minutes from Sydney by aircraft. Broadcasting also has brought us nearer to the people. Indeed, with the advent of television, we may be brought too closeunless, of course, a beauty parlour, or makeup room is established nearby. However, our physical separation from the great centres of population does create an air of unreality, and a failure to understand the everyday problems of the people. I agree member for Moore( Mr Leslie). We have",57,National Capital Developmen T Commission Bill 1957
115,Mr Morgan (Reid) [5.0],"I agreeto give Canberra a soul. We must consider how Parliament and the administration can be brought closer to the problems of the people. Perhaps if Mohammed will not come to the mountain the mountain must go to Mohammed. I can understand the practical difficulties experienced Western Australians who wish to visit Canberra. Perhaps we should become a perambulating parliament, and move from place to place. It would certainly be appropriate during the winter months. At present Canberra is merely a bush capital, to which only tourists have access. We are an object of curiosity to visiting school children and others, but students of political economy, who reside mainly in the other capital cities, cannot afford either residential city. I urge the Government to the time or the expense to come here to examine the conditions under which we operate and apply ourselves to the problems of the nation. After all, this is mainly a debating chambera talking shop. As the honourable member for Moore has quite frankly admitted, the real business of Parliament is done by the civil servant-the administrator. Perhaps it would be more fitting if, from time to time, Parliament visited some of menace to the industrial and economic life the other capitals, took over the city halls of the community, and an even greater and conducted its debates there.

It and the industrial life of the community. has been estimated that food to the value It might have been better if the National of £25,000,000 will be produced in these Capital had been established nearer one of the State capitals, or on the seaboard in some such place as Jervis Bay or Twofold. Bay, where industries could have been readily set up. Perhaps it is too late to change the site, but we can at least change by the present unsatisfactory position. We are not precluded by the Constitution from establishing industries in and around: the capital. Under it Parliament is given exclusive power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to the seat of government of the Commonwealth. There is nothing to prevent the capital from becoming not only an administrative and legislative centre but also an industrial and ensure that the proposed commissioner looks into the question of establishing industries that will serve not only Canberra but also the Australian community generally. One of our greatest needs is de-centralization. Four-fifths of our population is to be found in the six capital cities, which are so over-crowded and congested that traffic everywhere is becoming chaotic. This is a The honourable member for Chisholm newly irrigated areas, and the establishment of a modern industrial centre near Canberra would create a local market for this produce. Canberra's healthy, vigorous climate would prove congenial to workers in industrv and would doubtless contribute to greater efficiency and production. It was once considered that major cities should be adjacent to the principal ports, but town planners no longer hold this view. Indeed, the establishment of industries at Canberra would open up the ports of Jervis Bay and Twofold Bay and the areas which surround them. More important still is a field for the employment of young people. This is a matter that the honourable member for Moore mentioned. Canberra now has a population of some 35,000, and it has one of the highest birth-rates in the world. Apparently, there is something in the air in Canberra, or perhaps there is not much else to do. Parents desire their children to remain at home and prefer not to send them to schools in far distant places, even if they can afford it. No doubt, many of them could not afford it. The result is that the main field of employment for young people in this National Capital is the Public Service, for which some people may not be suited. Every one has a particular aptitude, and the direction of young people into Public Service employment for which they may not be suited merely creates odd lots, and a restriction of employment opportunities, which must have an effect on the administration generally. Such a narrow field of employment tends to establish hierarchy, and a super bureaucracy, based on a class of people apart from, and above, other sections of the community and lacking understanding of the problems and needs of the people as a whole. Also it favours privileged sections of the community such as big business, which can employ lobbyists to come here and work on behalf of their particular interests, or even establish head-quarters in Canberra, as some organizations have already done. Those privileged sections have an unfair advantage over others such as workers and pensioners. These things create among all sections of the community the feeling of hostility towards Canberra that the honourable member for Batman( Mr Bird) and other honourable members mentioned. This is inimical to harmony and to the progress of the country generally, and could lead to a lack of appreciation of the government of the day and the elected representatives of the people. 1 trust that the proposed commission will be clothed with the necessary authority to investigate the problems of the development of Canberra and make recommendations in the way that other honourable members and I have outlined, and that the Government will give it encouragement and support in this task. I trust, also, that citizens, industrialists, and trade unions, will be represented on the proposed National Capital Planning Committee. It is all very well to establish a beautiful capital city here in a salubrious climate, and to provide all the amenities required by the resident administrators, and parliamentarians. But that is not enough. It is more essential that this National Capital should be administered by the right kind of people wfth the necessary qualifications and an understanding of the Australian people and the Australian way of life. These administrators should be properly trained in administrative skills, not just by academic study, but by practical experience, and they shoula have a wealth of knowledge acquired by contact with people in all walks of life. The need for a new Parliament House has been mentioned. No doubt this building has served its purpose well, but it is now out of date, and the accommodation available in it is insufficient for present needs. I support those who advocate the planning now of a permanent Parliament House to meet not only present, but also future, needs. In considering this matter, we should take account of the need to protect vital records in time of war. If a new building were constructed on the proposed site on Capital Hill, ample provision could be made for underground vaults in which to store and preserve vital records in the form of either duplicates or photostat copies. In the dire event of war, this capital would no doubt be a target for attack, and if vital official records were destroyed, chaos and dislocation of government administration could result. If such records were preserved in a safe place, the government of the country could continue with a minimum of dislocation, except in the extraordinary event of the administrators being wiped out. for the Interior and Minister for Works)",58,National Capital Developmen T Commission Bill 1957
116,Mr Fairhall (Paterson,"Ministe r15.20]-in reply I should like to take this opportunity to thank honourable members on both sides of the House for their contributions to this debate, and for the expressions of goodwill with which the introduction of this bill has been met. I thank honourable members, also, for the many suggestions that have been made. Although some honourable members may be critical, there is a general appreciation that this measure has been introduced in an effort to eliminate mistakes which previously have marred the exercise of developing the National Capital. I applaud the upsurge of interest and enthusiasm for the development of a more adequate national capital, which has culminated in the last two days in the hope that something will be done. We should not be apologetic about what has not been done, Mr Speaker. Rather, we snould be appreciative of what has been done, because, over the last 30 years, we have transformed a sheep paddock into a quite worthy national capital. As honourable members on both sides of the House have pointed out, the population of this city has doubled in the last eight years. There has been reasonable, but certainly not adequate, provision of housing and amenities for the increasing population. Of course, a number of mistakes has been made, and the proposed National Capital Development Commissionis to be established in an effort to remove the causes of those errors. We in this country are motivated by a made it necessary to introduce this scheme sense of divine discontent; we want to do of development under a commission. better. Washington has been mentioned repeatedly in this debate. It is rather errors have been made in the development interesting to note, that, up to this point, of this city.

In my view, great Charles Dickens visited Washington in 1842, he commented that Washington's spacious avenues "" began in nothing and went nowhere"".' That comment made in American context is similar to the statement made in this debate yesterday that "" Canberra consists of two suburbs looking for a city "". We must take the view that this is a developing National Capital. We cannot get overnight everything that we want. When we feel inclined to criticize the rate at which our National Capital is being developed we might perhaps take note of the fact that the corner-stone of the Capitol in Washington was laid by President George Washington in 1793. The Statue of Freedom which adorns the top of the Capitol dome was not erected, and the building was not occupied, until 1863 -7 0 years later. We in this country are doing a good deal better than that. Another point that we should bear in mind is that Washington has had something like 160 years in which to develop, to grow old, and to mellow, whereas we have still only 30 years of construction behind us, and are virtually only beginning. To-day, Washington is the mecca of an intensely nationalistic America. It is not an exaggeration to say that, with the growth of tourist traffic to this area, Canberra is attaining a similar place in the national affections of Australia. It is the very growth of Canberra in this way that has It has been pointed out that certain there is no need to strengthen the provisions contained in this bill, which are also in the Seat of Government Act, requiring that no amendment shall be made to the gazetted plan of Canberra without both Houses of the ParUament having an opportunity to know of it. to criticize it and, if necessary, to disallow it. I shall now deal briefly with two or three points of criticism which have been raised. Perhaps they were not so much points of criticism as questions about the machinery for operating this commission. A good deal of reference has been made to the question of annual appropriations. T think we could not have done better than listen to the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson) this afternoon when he drew attention to the urgent need to ensure that the Parliament will not lose control of the nnanciai affairs of government. However pleased a Minister for the Interior or his department might be at having guaranteed finance for a considerable period ahead to carry out this developmental work, nothing alters the fact that it would be completely inconsistent with Australian methods, or even with general methods, of publicfinancethat there should be that sort of long-range provision. I .am would be involved if, at the end of a finansatisfied in my own mind that those who cial year, the commission found that it had seek long-range financial provision really underspent its appropriation.

The present National Capital Plancould not stop overnight thesort of devening, and Development Committee can lopmental machinery which will be involved approve, reject or suggest amendments to here. Finally, of course, the establishment proposals which are put before it by the of this commission to undertake this job is a commitment. It is an outward sign of the Government's appreciation that it has a long job ahead of it and is prepared to establish special machinery to carry out that job. It has been said that this is an unusual project and, therefore, ought to be provided with finance in an unusual way. If it is reasonable to make long-term financial provision for the development of Canberra, I see no reason why the same procedure should not be adopted for the whole of the Commonwealth works programme, which is developmental, but on a national rather than a city scale. There is the great developmental project in the Snowy Mountains, there is the work being undertaken by the Department of Supply, and so on. I suggest to the House for its consideration that if we were to make long term financial provision for one of those activities, we should be obliged to provide it for all. Under those circumstances, the Government would lose control of such a big sector of the overaU economy as to place itself in financial danger and to lose considerable control over the day-to-day movements of government affairs. Some fear has been expressed that waste Canberra must bear a reasonable relation to the rest of the Government's finanNowI come to the question whether the Department of the Interior or the Department of Works, but the National Capital Planning Committee which we propose in this bill will stand in an entirely different planning machinery of the commission. Jt relationship to the commission. It was suggested yesterday that with a committee of eight we might well have eight different opinions. I do not think that is a practical possibility. If it were, it could be suggested that in a House of this kind we could have 120 different opinions. We might begin with a number of different opinions, but debate would produce a unanimous or near-unanimous opinion. In the event of such a difference of opinion, the commissioner would be in a position to assess the weight to be given to the opinions which persist. He is the man who carries the responsibility for this task of development. I do not think we ought to lose sight of the fact that the functions of this commission are planning, development and construction. The commissioner has the responsibility for planning in the National Capital. It would be an odd circumstance indeed if we forcibly separated him from the machinery which is to provide the technical advice. There was a second very important point to which the Government had regard when this proposal was developed. It is one thing, as some honourable members have pointed out in the House this afternoon, to develop a beautiful national capital, but this capital must be not only beautiful, but functional. It must be designed for the work of government. It must be designed physically with due regard to the administrative problems involved. The commission, having decided to go into a housing programme, may build houses of a certain value, but on the completion of the commission's work, those houses have to be handed over for administration, which means the collection of rents, to the Department of the Interior. Conse quently, the commission will be required to consider, not only whether any project il undertakes will be adequate to its task, but also whether that project will unduly complicate the administrative processes which must fotlow. That duty will devolve upon the commissioner. I visualize a situation where a project initiated by the Government -thi s will perhaps answer the question of the honourable member for Port Adelaideand having been approved in the normal annual works programme will go to the commissioner for execution. The commissioner must have access to the planning committee, because that in fact is the is in fact the commissioner's right hand. I would not care to see a situation in which the commissioner could be arbitrarily or legally separated from the machinery which would do so much of the work for which he is to be responsible. I come now to the question of local representation on this commission. I understand the concern that exists in this field. If we were setting up a policy body to operate in the political field of Canberra, to deal with local government questions, I would readily concede the desirability of having Canberra people democratically represented on what would be inevitably a democratic committee. But in this particular case we are setting up a technical body. We have gone to some pains, and will go to more pains, to see that there will be available on this commission the best technical brains that we can find for the tasks entrusted it. I think we have to decide whether we are going to have a technical committee, which is a specialist body, or a representative committee which may be in a position to contribute the most valuable ideas but which may also be in a position to confuse the consideration of technical matters involved. I am bound to concur with the editorial published in to-day's issue of the "" Canberra Times "", an excellent paper and one which I may say is always very vigilant in the interests of Canberra. To-day's editorial statesWe do not believe that the National Capital Planning Committee should comprise any person who owes his place to the holding of an office or by right of election by popular vote. That is a view with which I would invite the House to concur. We are setting up a special committee to develop the National Capital. It seems hardly likely to me that a responsible body of this kind would overlook or even could overlook the interests of those who live and work and have their future here in Canberra. The interests of the people of Canberra and the development of this National Capital cannot be mutually antagonistic. If the commission is to look after one it must necessarily look after the other. In an undertaking of this kind, devoted to the development of the National Capital, the activities of the commission must be heavily weighted in the direction of the national interests. It is for that reason and for that reason only that additional finance is being made available to the commission for the construction of the National Capital. I do not think I need labour the point to local residents that they are deriving from the development of the National Capital tremendous benefit for which proportionately they pay only a token rate. I appreciate that they are paying the equivalent of local government rates, as do the citizens in every other town, but they are enjoying tremendous benefits and a tremendous flow of amenities which are not generally available in a city of this size. This, of course, is reflected in the problems mentioned by the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. R. Fraser) when he advocated the early development of local government. I am not opposed to that concept at all. In the course of time, local government must come to Canberra, but I suggest that we have a fairly full plate in relation to the development of Canberra, and 1 would be unhappy to see too many great changes of this kind being effected simultaneously. I would suggest to the people of Canberra who are concerned with this particular problem that ways still exist for them to express their views on the development of what is, in fact, their city. The Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council may still advise the Minister. The Minister retains control of the commission and its programme. The honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory has never had any inhibitions about bringing forward in this House the grievances, imagined and otherwise, of the people of his constituency. Both of these channels remain open for the people of Canberra to express their views and to bring their pressure to bear on the commission. I think sufficient has been said to cover these points. I do suggest to the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory, whose interest, I know, is to preserve the right of the people of this city to exert an influence on the development of their city, that the new commission has all the powers it needs to call upon local people, if necessary, to bring their wisdom to bear on the problems facing the commission. Now, 1 would like to deal, briefly, with the question raised by the honourable membei for Port Adelaide, because it seems to be of quite considerable importance. The honourable member raised the question as to what authority the commission would have to determine the priority of various public works here in the National Capital. There seems to be some misunderstanding on this point. References have been made to the airport building and the railway station. I would point out that these activities remain under the control of the Ministers who are responsible for those particular undertakings. Whether or not there is to be a new airport building does not lie with the Department of the Interior, nor with the Department of Public Works initially. It lies with the Department of Civil Aviation, in the same way that the building or extension of a hospital in Canberra is a matter primarily for the Department of Health. the control of the Department of the Interior. When a school is required it will appear in the works programme developed by the Department of the Interior, to meet its administrative responsibility. Such projects will find their way into programmes according to the need envisaged by the departments which are responsible. When they get to the point of being included on a design list, a works programme approved by Cabinet, and ultimately by the House tbrough an appropriation in the budget, then they become the concern of the commission. But the commission is concerned with planning, development and construction only. I think I have covered most points raised in this debate. I appreciate the comments that have been made and I commend the bill to the House and ask for its support, because I believe that the machinery now to be established will go a very long way towards overcoming the difficulties of the past and will lend some speed to the wings of future development.

The clause further provides that the functions of the commission shall not include the undertaking or carrying out of development or construction upon land owned by a person other than the Commonwealth. I think another clause will empower the Minister to refer other matters to the commission.

I advise the Minister to look at the matter fully, because such a movement is outside the ordinary range of a department's activities.

I propose to refer to it a little later. I shall not deal with it in great detail, but I shall refer to some of the leading points. The fact is that for the first time in its history the textile industry of Australia is facing the problem of free, unrestricted imports of textiles from Japan, under arrangements which place Japan on the same competitive basis as other countries. That is Australia's point of view. The right honourable gentleman did not refer to the position of the United Kingdom. Never before has the United Kingdom textile industry, which still trades with us, been faced with the possibility or probability of complete elimination from the Australian market. I do not think the people of Australia would approve of that. I doubt whether those persons who were responsible for negotiating this agreement for Australia contemplated the conditions which are now facing interested manufacturers and the great trade unions concerned in the production of Australian goods by Australians for the use of the Australian people. There has been an enormous improvement in the efiiciency of the textile industry in Japan since World War II . It ranks second only to that of the United States of America in volume.

I Move,"the great monopolies and corporations that dominated the whole industrial, commercial and, to some extent, political life of Japan would no longer face the world in serried ranks after the war, but, in spite of all the undertakings and proposals, that is what they do to-day. There is no doubt that the Zaibatsu group, the Mitsubishi and the Mitsui groups have, in the textile industry, as in all other industries of Japan, Many towns in New South Wales are declinresumed their old position, which was one of domination of Japan and desire to dominate to the greatest extent all the trade in the areas they can control or influence. Products affected by the proposed agreement, to mention only a few, are rayon, which has a very important bearing upon British investment in this country, knitted goods, a wide range of clothing, piece goods, dress materials-wool , cotton and rayon-porcelai n ware and insulators, glass bottles-especiall y in connection with cosmetic sales-cutlery , silver ware, electroplate, optical frames and toys. There is too much of an inclination to treat the toy industry as of no account, but for many years groups of servicemen have operated important sections of the toy industry in this country, and it is an important industry from many points of view. Other products affected are electrical equipment, automotive parts and machinery. So we are concerned not merely with the textile industry but also with all those forms of trade that we have with Japan. I want to refer first to the woollen and worsted industry. That industry to-day has no fewer than 164 mills in this country, employing just on 25,000 Australian men and women. The value of the goods produced by the industry is no less than £70,000,000 per annum. When one looks back to the threat to that industry which first occurred during the Prime Ministership of Mr Scullin, when one considers the tremendous contribution to this country's war effort by the textile industry, which provided the clothing for the service men and women, not only of Australia but of all the Allied forces serving in the Pacific, notably the forces of the United States of America, and when one considers the policy of the Labour Government under Mr most recent application of the industry for Chifley, one is forced to draw certain conclusions. The Chifley Government, broadly speaking, sought to convert to peaceful uses those factories which had been engaged in munitions production. In the country towns of New South Wales and Victoria particularly, and in other States also, there have been social and economic changes because of the production of textiles. It is very important for country towns that there should be some opportunity of employment for the young people there. ing visibly because of the absence of industry. The textile industry has played an important social and economic part in the life of Australia, particularly in the country towns. I hope that the Australian Country party, which, I suppose, favours the decentralization of industry about which so much is said, will look at this matter again and see the detrimental, disastrous effect that an agreement of this kind could well have upon those industries in the way I have tried to describe. During the period of the war, the industry used 25 per cent, of the total Australian wool clip. I cannot give precise figures for the amount of the clip used in the production processes of the Australian industry, but in purchases of Australian wool it ranks fourth after the United Kingdom, Japan and France. So this industry is not a stranger to the important wool industry but one of the chief buyers of our wool, the figures being astronomical compared with what they were in the days when the industry was first established. The industry has been assisted by the Tariff Board's recommendations for reasonable protection and it has reached a stage of high efficiency. Of course, there are certain things that it cannot do. One cannot achieve efficiency in Australian industry by means of low wages and sweated labour, but there has been efficiency in the industry, as the Tariff Board has reported from time to time. Only this year, after an inquiry lasting for two years or more, the Tariff Board reported in favour of further protection, but the Government turned down the proposal. So when the Government comes to be judged on its treatment of the industry that is a fact which must be remembered. Thc protection was three years old when it was rejected in May of this year by Cabinet. Without the protection that it sought, this industry cannot compete with the product of Japan for reasons which will be apparent, They have assisted in the decentralization no blame being attached to the Australian of secondary industry and are a feature of industry. Figures differ, but I think it is fifteen or 25 country towns in Australia. correct to say that the average Japanese They are entitled to the support of the worker in the textile industry receives Australian Country party for that reason, between one-sixth and one-ninth of the net unless that party does not want to have effective wage or salary paid for similar secondary industries in the country towns work in this country. In measuring the of Australia. It would be unthinkable that cost of production one should not say, as the Australian Country party should take the Minister says, that the Japanese pursuch a narrow view. Therefore, if we can chases of our wool amount to such a big assume that there are no politics in the sum, and our purchases amount to such matter, it must be admitted that these indusa relatively small sum, that we must do tries are a great asset, and give a chance something about it.

The only variation inevitable consequence of which is destruction, one must come to the conclusion that they are reckless of the consequences. How can the Government take that attitude to an industry which is employing 25,000 Australians, supporting their families, and assisting a large number of associated industries? In 1954, the Board of Trade in the United Kingdom issued certain restrictions which are still in force. It placed a limitation of £25,000 on the imports of pottery. That much can be brought into the United Kingdom, and no more. A limitation of £30,000 was placed on the value of buttons and parts thereof, including button blanks, collar studs and shirt studs that could be imported. Imports of lacquer wire were limited to £15,000 worth. Imports of brooms, mops and brushes not containing precious metal were limited in value to £25,000. Imports of electric lamp bulbs, or filament of a voltage and conditions of employment are far below of 12 or less, were limited to a value of £7,500. I am not giving the whole list, but only a few illustrations to show that the Board of Trade in the United Kingdom has severely restricted the imports of goods that could compete with industries which have a very high place in the world, but which pay what we regard as proper wages to those who work in them. Woollen goods are not included in the list to which I referred. The United States of America imposes prohibitive duties on all types of piece goods entering that country in excess of 5 per cent, of the local market. The American Government excludes anything more than one-twentieth of the local market from the whole area of competition, even though normal tariffs in America are far higher than they are in Australia. I said a moment ago that other European countries operate the import licensing system against Japan, but the United Kingdom entered into an agreement which gave Japan the right to export to Crown colonies. Let us see what happened as a result of that agreement. In 1953, Japan enjoyed 15 per cent, of the market in Nigeria. By 1956, Japan enjoyed 91 per cent, of that market. This happened in a British colony. Great Britain had held 31 per cent, of the market in 1953, and became virtually excluded from it by 1956 when she enjoyed only 1 per cent, of the trade with Nigeria. In Sierra Leone, another Crown colony, Great Britain enjoyed 97 per cent, of the market in 1953 and Japan exported nothing to it. By 1956, however, Japan had taken 66 per cent, of that market while Great Britain's trade had dropped to 21 per cent. To what is all this due? It is due to the fact that no country like Great Britain, where decent labour standards with reasonable wages and proper safeguards, together with social security and so on are demanded, can compete with Japan. That country can compete with products manufactured under conditions which, from the British point of view at any rate, amount to sweated labour. It should also be recognized by the International Labour Office that Japan is manufacturing goods with sweated labour. The position has been somewhat similar in Barbados, Kenya and other Crown colonies, all due to the fact that the Japanese wage structure, the hours of work those of competitors, including Australia. The conditions enjoyed in Australia have been made possible only because of the protection given to Australian industry over the years by this Parliament, a protection which saved this country in the early days of the war from a direct onslaught by our enemies. The contribution made by Australian industry at that stage was a very great feature of our war effort. This cannot be denied by any honourable member, whatever his politics may be. It was a really great performance which was given due recognition by General MacArthur and others qualified to express sound opinions on the matter. According to the statistics available to me, the average male adult wage in the textile industry in Japan is 20.6d. an hour, while the average female adult wage is 11.6d. an hour. In Australia, however, the average adult male rate is 94d. an hour, while the average adult female rate here is 68.3d. an hour. In other words, the proportion is 11 to 68 or approximately 1 to 6. Another important fact is that in Japan only 20 per cent, of the employees are males, whereas in Australia 47.5 per cent, are males. So, in Japan, industry has become dominated to a large degree by female labour. One article I have read on the subject states that in Japan every cottage is a factory and every factory is a cottage. There is a good deal of boarding-in of the female labour. In that country, they have that control over the females which we read about as having existed in Great Britain generations ago. Another important feature is the fact that in 1954 the average working hours in the textile industry in Japan were 196.7 a month. A moment ago, I referred to the purchases of Australian wool, about which thc Minister has had so much to say. Last year, the United Kingdom purchased 910,000 bales of greasy wool on the Australian market. She was our chief buyer. Then came Japan, which bought 652,000 bales of greasy wool, and France, whose purchases totalled 650,000 bales. Thc Australian industry, which was our Cinderella industry fifteen or twenty years ago. purchased no fewer than 601,000 bales. Those figures give some idea of the tremendous amount of wool imported by Japan, but I think it is generally recognized by economists that Japan is importing from Australia only such things as basic foodstuffs and raw materials which it manufactures or processes and sells again to this and other countries as finished products. Japan is ensuring that it imports from Austraiia only those things which may be used to provide employment in Japan. If the agreement under discussion is agreed to, we shall be, in a sense, exporting employment to Japan and importing unemployment. Anyone who has a true appreciation of what is involved must admit that. The Minister went to great pains in his endeavour to impress upon us that everything will be all right under the proposed treaty. He said, "" I cannot predict the future; I am not going to try"". I have already submitted that it is his duty to try to assess what goods will be coming in. Great Britain did not make the mistake that this Government seems to be making. Great Britain determines what shall come in. Why cannot that be done here? If Australia is to have a trade agreement with Japan, why cannot the Australian Government say what Japanese goods are to come in? Why can it not say what quantity and what value of goods shall be imported from Japan? I am not advocating that we enter into such an agreement, but I suggest that if we are to have one, that is the proper way to go about it. But the Government says that Japan has to be treated as a most-favourednation, that it has to be treated in the same way as all nations, with the exception of the Commonwealth or the Empire. The Minister said, "" I will not attempt to say what is going to be the result"". He does not see what a trap he has dug for himself by making such a statement. He does not realize that the safeguards contained in the agreement do not apply unless the disastrous results in industry mentioned in it are those which could not be anticipated. I point out to honourable members that the ultimate results are obvious now. At this early stage, even before the tariff is brought into operation, people on all sides are pointing out to the Government exactly what the results will be, and I am confident that these people are correct in their prediction. I should like to join issue with the Minister on another point made by him. He said that Japan exercised great selfrestraint in her exports to Canada and that we can take that as our guide in judging Japan's future attitude towards Australia. That is in black and white, in the report of his speech. Let us see what happened in Canada. Before Canada granted most-favourednation status to Japan in 1954, the total value of Japanese goods exported to the Canadian market was 14,000,000 dollars. That, in itself, was a quite substantial sum. but by 1956, this country which the Minister asks us to hail as one which exercises great restraint in its export policy exported 65,000,000 dollars' worth of goods to Canada, and it is estimated that this year the total value of Japanese goods placed on the Canadian market will be 120,000,000 dollars. They are actually engaged, in time of peace, in aggressive economic action, not to get a fair share of trade, but to get all they can. Look how they treated the British colonies! I would agree with the principle of conferences with the industry, but apparently the Minister's idea is to hold them after the agreement has been signed. bers of commerce, anyhow. friendly with them, like the party to which he belongs. No one could accuse it of making any contribution, over the 30 or 40 years of its existence, to Australian industry.",68,Japanese Trade Agreement
135,Mr Ward,He only talks to the cham,72,Japanese Trade Agreement
136,Dr. Evatt,"Naturally , he is moreThe Minister has cited the Japanese agreement with Canada as evidence of the selfrestraint of the Japanese. What lever did they use? It was the lever of wheat, and it was used in the same manner as wool is being used by Japan with the Australian Government. When we look at the realities of this agreement, is it not a sham to say that there is any real chance of restraint on the part of Japan, which depends so much on secondary industry organized to a degree never anticipated before the war, which is assisted by the American armed forces and all their technicians, and which has technological agreements in connection with the textile industry-to take only one industry-wit h the largest shirt manufacturer in the United States? The fact is that there has been no increase in purchases of wheat by Japan from Canada, so that the Japanese have not taken the wheat they promised to take. There is practically no chance of Japan saying, ""We are going to put a tariff on wool coming here "". Wool is bought in the open market of the world. That market determines the price of wool. If Japan imposed a duty on wool, thus adding to the cost of manufacture, no doubt the increased cost would be passed on and would add to the price of the manufactured articles. Would the Japanese do that? If they did, it would interfere to some extent with their power to destroy competitors in the market for secondary products made from wool. I submit, therefore, that that fear is imaginary. Then we come to the safeguards in this agreement. The Minister's speech turned on the safeguards, but I think that they have been misunderstood by him. After all, he made a written agreement, signed it and pinned himself down to an interpretation of it when he spoke to the House the other night. What are the safeguards? It is perfectly true that they can be called safeguards, but we have to look at Article V. to see whether they are really so. We can get out of the agreement or negotiate to have it varied, but we cannot be sure how long such negotiations would last. If the Japanese took as long to negotiate as they did in the great disputes prior to World War II. , they would take quite a long time. This is what Article V. says. . . If, nevertheless, as a result of unforeagreement to enable one party or the other seen developments, the Government of either country finds that any product is being imported from the other country under such conditions as to cause or threaten serious injury to producers in the country of importation of like or directly competitive products, lhat Government may. in respect of such products, suspend obligations . . . I shaU not read the whole of the paragraph, but the essence of it is that Article V. will apply if certain things happen as a result of unforeseen developments. But the Minister knows of the dangers. He knows what happened to Canada and other countries. Japan's object in seeking mostfavoured-nation treatment is to capture markets. Would that be an unforeseen circumstances to a reasonable man knowing something about Japanese business or the course of Japanese trade? Of course not! I mention this matter, but I am not going into too much technical argument about it. One cannot be sure how this will be interpreted. The Minister's say-so will not determine it. He says, "" Look at Canada. We can expect the same generous treatment as Japan gave to Canada "". Well, we know what that was. It was an attempt to capture the Canadian market, and there was also an attempt to capture the American market. The Americans, however, said. "" All right. One-twentieth is all you are going to. get-no t a skerrick more. We will take nineteen-twentieths for our people because, we must protect them"". Why could not a similar attitude-no t necessarily the same attitude -be taken by a patriotic government which wanted industry to develop in this country? The Australian textile industry is not a new industry, but an established one. There are involved in it not only Australian employers, but. also British investors. I am told that the most serious consequences of all will result in the rayon industry, in which British investment has been considerable. The Minister for the Army( Mr Cramer), at the opening of one of these British establishments only a few months ago, gave an assurance of full support, or every practicable support, from the Australian Government. I have consulted both the manufacturers and the trade unions and I am told that if this agreement goes through without real safeguards being inserted in it, the industry will suffer. When I say "" real safeguards"" I do not mean the provisions that have been put into the to get out of it or to vary it; I mean some definite protection. If the agreement contained such protection we could measure it, but nothing of the kind has been attempted. The treatment of Canada has aroused tension and criticism throughout the world. My only point about the agreement concerns the article that I have mentioned. 1 say that there is no sure safeguard there. Just imagine what will happen if there is a rush of Japanese goods to this country and some industries totter! No doubt representatives of the industries concerned will come along to the Minister and ask what he proposes to do about it. We do not know what he would do, because he also said in his speech, "" Oh, those things might happen, but you have to accept the agreement in good faith and give the Japanese a fair opportunity to develop this arrangement"". But if you give them a fair opportunity to develop it-and that sounds so smooth and plausible-yo u destroy Australian industries, although, of course, not necessarily in every aspect. This agreement applies to practically Japanese goods. For instance, what chance will there be for Australians engaged in the toy industry, which is peculiarly popular in this country, when they find that it is impossible for them to continue in competition? My colleague, the honourable member for Scullin( Mr Peters), with his great experience of the manufacturing industries, particularly in the State of Victoria, will deal with this matter in detail, but I want to give just one illustration. I have here a document given to me by Mr Erskine, the secretary of the New South Wales Textile Workers Union. It was handed to him by the Shirt Manufacturers Association. It readsI hand you herewith sample of white poplin business shirt from Japan. The shirt can be produced for honourable members to see. I understand from the experts that it is beautifully made. The letter goes onThe estimated landed cost is: F.o.b. 6s. 3d. (sterling); freight 6d.; exchange ls. 9d.; landing charges Id.; duty Ss.; making a landed cost of 13s. 7d. The estimated sale price would be approximately 15s. 6d. or 16s. I am assured that a shirt of similar quality, produced under trade union conditions in this country, would cost not less than two guineasapproximately three times as much. No matter what their intention is about the industry, people usually fall for that kind of offer. I think I have given sufficient illustrations to show that certain conclusions should be drawn from this proposed treaty. I have referred to the places in Australia, especially the country towns, where textile industries have been established. Instead of factories producing for war purposes they are now engaged in peace-time production, and it is quite certain that some of them must go under in the fierce competition that will ensue from this treaty. I submit that the treaty should not be adopted. From an Australian point of view it is a thoroughly bad treaty. It is indefinite and ambiguous; the clause 1 have mentioned is sufficient illustration of that. It may be necessary to call upon an international tribunal to give an interpretation of what is called the "" safeguard "" clause. I do not think it is a proper safeguard for Australia, unlimited categories of at all. Before the agreement is signed and executed, a plan should be drawn up to show how much should come in under all categories, as the English Government has insisted upon in its legislation to which I have referred. Of course, the agreement gives Japan special opportunities for the first time since World War II . Australia gets nothing except the opportunity to compete; that is proposed. The Minister spoke as if Japan was providing guaranteed markets. They are not guaranteed markets but, according to the Japanese statement, opportunities to compete. If the Japanese are acting in good faith, such opportunities will help. There are no effective emergency powers available to the Australian Government if there is serious injury to Australian products or to any industry adversely affected within the meaning of the agreement. Secondly, I submit that the treaty is unnecessary. The Minister argues that the balance of payments is so much against Japan because of its large purchases of wool that Australia is under some obligation to alter that position. The Minister bas said that in his statements to the press; and he said it here the other evening. But the balance of payments is not a two-way affair between Japan and Australia. The Japanese deficit as between Japan and Australia represents a credit which becomes available to other countries in the sterling have not the details of the numbers, but pool, and they, in turn, buy from Japan that was his statement, and I have no doubt -with the credit they obtain. Why is this that it is correct. absurd argument advanced?

The people of this country have reason to judge us, not on the propaganda of the honourable member for East Sydney, but on our performances. We are prepared to stand by them. While I am not going to spend a great deal of time on the speech of the Leader of the Opposition, I am quite certain that even those Australian manufacturers who have some fears about the operation of this treaty will not have missed along the road of industrial progress during the irony of a situation in which the role of champion of Australian industry has been assumed to-night by the leader of a political party which is pledged to socialize warmly received, as one might have Australian industry. The right honourable gentleman reminded me of a turkey farmer who takes great care of his flock as he prepares the turkeys for the Christmas slaughter, and then turns them over at a profit. The Leader of the Opposition has painted a black picture of the possible consequences for Australian manufacturers and their employees from the low-wage manufacturers of Japan. That is the whole substance of the right honourable gentleman's case. He is prejudiced against a treaty which aims at expanding our trade with Australia"":; one who opposed it. Again not unexpecsecond best customer, but apparently he has no such qualms about the effect on Australian industry of low wage production from red China, because the right honorabie gentleman is a persistent and most enthusiastic advocate for trade between Australia and that Communist country. produced in red China. member for East Sydney knows that the present government of communist China JS starving its citizens to death in order to obtain overseas credits to buy industrial machinery to turn red China into the greatest industrial power in Asia. He knows that, but that does not stop him preaching in and out of season in favour of trade between Australia and red China. Does the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues imagine that the wage level of the Chinese workers will be comparable with that of the Australian workers? Of course, it will not be comparable, but that does not stop the right honourable gentleman declaring from the platform that Australia should build up its trade and enter into trade negotiations with red China. I merely point this out to those many Australian manufacturers who feel that in the right honourable gentleman, and those who sit behind him, they have champions to preserve their position in Australia. I do not expect to experience much difficulty in convincing intelligent Australian manufacturers that their best interests are safe in the hands of the present Commonwealth Government, which has led them steadily its eight years of office. The Japanese trade agreement has been expected, by sections of industry, such as organizations of persons concerned with commerce and primary production, who can see clearly the benefits for themselves that are likely to flow from its implementation. Such indications as one can find of a general public opinion in this country confirm that the agreement enjoys wide public support. The Leader of the Opposition has often given us the results of gallup polls to support his arguments, and it may interest him to know that in a recent gallup poll more than two people stated that they favoured the agreement for every tedly, only some sections of our manufacturing industries, and some trade union spokesmen for their employees, have come out in opposition to the agreement. But the fact that a line of policy beneficial to Australia as a whole is productive of resentment in some sections of the Australian community has never deterred this Government in the past-no r will it in the future-fro m going ahead with what it believes to be for the national good. At different times, as honourable members will recall, this Government has incurred the displeasure of the farming community, and in particular of the graziers, because of the special tax that we levied on wool at the time of high wool incomes in 1951 and",76,Japanese Trade Agreement

It has incurred the displeasure of representatives of commerce, who attack us from time to time because of the operation of import licensing, and of the trade union movement, whicb has attacked us because of our legislation on secret ballots and the disciplinary provisions in the arbitration legislation. We recall what was said about the so-called "" horror"" budget of 1951 and the ""little horror"" budget of the autumn of last year. Although those attacks were made on this Government by sections of the community, we can say that results have proved the justi52,000. The number of-employees in those fication of the measures introduced and the wisdom of the policies that we followed at the time. So even if this agreement produced some sectional resentment and some sectional pressure, we would not hesitoo little importance to these industries in tate to proceed with it, because we think it to be in the best interests of the Australian people. I genuinely believe that it is not only in the best interests of Australia as a whole, but also, properly understood and taking the long view of its operation, most directly in the interests of Australian manufacturers and their employees. At this stage I wish to say a few words about the importance of these manufacturing industries to the Australian people. We have never under-estimated their importance to this country. The expansion of Australian secondary industry production since the beginning of World War II . has been phenomenal. These industries have given employment to more than 1,000,000 Australian wage-earners. Approximately 36 per cent, of all wage and salary earners in civil employment are engaged in our manufacturing industries, which also provide indirect employment for many more workers. We acknowledge that the success of these industries throughout that period has meant a great deal to the development of Australia. We acknowledge that fact not only with gratitude, but also with some justifiable pride, because of the contributional workers a year, we must look to the tion we have been able to make, as a government, to the results that have been proneeded work opportunities. The Minister duced. In 1939 there were 26,941 factories in Australia, but by 1956, which is the last year for which I have figures, the number had increased to 52,359. To-day there are almost double the number of factories that we had in that pre-war year. R -16] Honourable gentlemen with a long enough experience of these matters will recall that it was in the years between 1939 and 1941 that a government led by the present Prime Minister laid the foundations for what was to become the most remarkable expansion of secondary industry in the history of Australia. Not only were those foundations laid by that government, but throughout the term of office of this Government these industries have flourished. When this Government came to office there were, in round numbers, 40,000 factories in existence in Australia. By 1956 there were over factories has increased from 890,000 in 1949 to 1,061,000 in 1956. I have gone into these details only to show those people who may think we attach relation to the Australian community that the Government recognizes the large pro» portion of our economic production and effort that is associated with the manufacturing industries of Australia, and how vital are those industries to our continuing prosperity and national development. The continuing prosperity of our manufacturing industries has a special importance, as I have personal reason to know, to the success of a continuing immigration programme. Our primary industries, although they have expanded quite remarkably in recent years, provide comparatively few additional employment opportunities, because machines have taken the places of many of the farm workers, who would otherwise have been needed as a result of the expansion that has occurred. Australia would not have been able to provide employment for anything like the number of immigrants we have attracted in the postwar years, as well as for our own natural increase of population, had it not been for the rapid expansion of our secondary production. If we are to go ahead, as we intend to go ahead, with a rate of population growth giving us about 60,000 addimanufacturing industries for many of the for Trade has all these considerations in mind. He is just as much aware of these facts as are his colleagues in the Cabinet. He had them in mind when he outlined the safeguards that he will be quick to apply should the necessity arise. There is one otherimportant safeguard thati 1 feel should be stressed.. 1 doi not thinik that it. has beenstressed in the course of. this discussion. I refer to the: attitude of theJapanese: Government itself. Are we to imagine that a> Japanese Government would be so unwise as, to endanger its hopes for a> long-term, trade association with Australia, andi for: a growing share in our market as the base of oui: economy expands through increased population and national, development,, by a course of action that would be damaging to. the-Australian industrial! structure?: Would: it adopt such a course of action and. thereby discourage' this, or another government' from, carrying on these trade' arrangements in thefuture?-' I believe that we can reasonably expect the Government of. Japan to supervise the operation of this, treaty from its end with good sense and restraint, just as we, as a government, shall' be exercising a careful supervision from our own. Another point that: I think should be our farms. Over the last three years, stressed' is the importance of Australia's primary export income has amounted to export income' from primary productionmore than 92' per cent; of total exportto our manufacturing industries, as has income against 6 per cent, from' our manubeen, shown by the. Minister for. Trade. In factured' exports. the first place,, it provides income in the hands of the farming community, which, touches, off a chain, of purchasing power manufacturers will find agrowing need to for, the. products of.

Here is very clear evidence of it: Another point that I ask trade with countries: such as Japan and the the House to consider is the necessity to expansion of our own manufacturing prodiversify our export range: The United duction.. These things go hand in hand Kingdom remains our biggest and most valued, customer.. It gets preferential treatment in ourtariff arrangements: But the trend over recent years has been for the United.

If we. are, to expand, our farm exports, significantly,, Australia must look to other countries and in particular to the enormous potential market of Asia. Nor can we be satisfied to look indefinitely to the farm exports to provide so large a proportion of our export income. We need the export incomefrom our manufacturing industries.

They have gone hand in hand in the United States of America as well as in Canada. We heard references by the right honourable gentleman to what has happened in Canada. I have in my hand the "" Financial Post"" of Canada, dated 24th August, referring to Japan's cotton exports to that country. Our own Minister told us of the strong position of our wool and textile industry, but admitted that cotton textiles were more vulnerable. According to an article in the newspaper I mentioned, the total Canadian imports of cotton fabrics in 1956 amounted to 259,000,000 yards. Japan's exports of cotton cloth to Canada were 16,000,000 yards, or about 6 per cent, of the total of Canadian imports of cotton goods. SoJ say these things go hand in hand, and it is the policy of this Government to ensure that they do. Adermann) -Order! The Minister's time has expired. ister for Labour and National Service( Mr wool annually when there was no agreement Harold Holt) commenced his speech in a very unfortunate manner indeed. He made reflections upon the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) and then, of course, he went on to elaborate his reasons. He took exception to the remark that was made by the right honourable member for Barton that we did not necessarily have to send to Japan as much as Japan sent to us, or that the value of our exports to Japan should be the same as the value of our imports from that country. Of course, that is absolutely correct. We do not trade only with Japan, and Japan does not trade only with us; she trades with the Americas, South Africa, and all of the islands of the Pacific. To some of those countries Japan sends quite a considerable quantity of manufactured goods. Those countries purchase goods that are essential to their own industries, and this country purchases goods that are essential to the development of Australia, such as rubber, oil, raw cotton, coffee and tea. Of course, if we have credits with Japan and Japan has credits in the countries that produce these commodities she can send to us the commodities we require in liquidation of its debt to us. Apparently the Minister did not know that. R. [7] statedThis treaty which has been negotiated by the Government is designed to contribute to the preservation of Australian prosperity and the avoidance of fluctuation in our economic experience, to provide stability in employment and stability of profits in commerce and in primary and secondary industries, to provide more strength to the base of our national development, and, among other things, to enable the continuation of our immigration programme. I shall show conclusively that none of those high-sounding phrases is correct. In reality, this agreement will make it very difficult for us to maintain our overseas balances. It will deter overseas investors from investing in this country; it will weaken Australia's secondary industries; it will cause unemployment; and it will prevent the absorption of immigrants in Australia. The Minister for Trade pointed out not only in the statement that he made to this House on Tuesday night, but also in statements that he Japan will take over £100,000,000 worth of wool from Australia annually. But she was already taking over £100,000,000 worth of in operation. The Minister said that Japan will take from Australia hides, sugar, barley and some wheat. When he was asked how much wheat Japan would take, he said that he did not know. I emphasize that every article that Japan takes from this country is needed to further the development of Japan and the expansion of its industries. Not one person in Japan will be put out of employment as a result of the importation of goods from Australia. As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, Japanese buyers have fought at auction sales on the open market to secure our wool, because Japan wanted our wool, which is essential to her development and to the expansion of her industries, and essential also to the trade that she desires to establish overseas. When the right honourable gentleman was asked, while making his statement, what type of products would come to Australia from Japan, he shrugged his shoulders and said, "" I do not know "". He was unwilling or unable to say what types of products would come into this country from Japan under the agreement. When he was asked what the monetary value of those commodities would be annually or for the three years period, he said, "" I am unable to say that"".",77,Japanese Trade Agreement

146,The Minister For Trade ( Mr Mcewen),"ber say what it will be? say what will come to this country. The products of light .industries and of textile factories, pottery and all kinds of commodities ithat will weaken Australian industries and endanger the 'employment of Australian people will come to this country from Japan. And when will this happen? It will happen at a time when, our economy is also menaced by imports from other countries. Tn 1951-52, there was a flood of imports into this country. The Prime Minister informed the people that our overseas balances were likely to be dissipated and savage import restrictions were imposed. They were relaxed over a period of years and were ultimately lifted. But in 1956 they were again imposed because the conditions .that existed in 1952 had recurred. Those restrictions have now been gradually eased and at the present time are being totally abolished. Experience shows what will happen as a result. Goods will come from the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and elsewhere. Even if Japan was not being induced to send more manufactured goods to this country, in a few years-^no t a very 'long period-the flood of imports from overseas would create the need 'for restrictions to 'be imposed on our imports from European countries. But when the commodities that will come from Japan are to be added to those imports, the position becomes immensely more dangerous. If Japan sends £70,000,000 worth of goods to this country annually, in three years the total will be £210,000,000. What does that mean? It means that Japan will send to Australia three or four times the volume of goods that could be purchased in any other country for £210,000,000. It will put on the Australian market £210,000,000 worth of commodities which would cost £900,000,000 to produce in Australian factories. I have evidence of that here. I have in hand a shirt similar to that referred to by the Leader of the Opposition. The landed cost of it was 13s. 7d. I have not the slightest doubt that this shirt is of much better quality than the shirt being worn to-night by the Minister, although his probably cost from £2 10s. to £3. It must be obvious that Japan will send to this country three times the number of shirts that could be produced here for the same cost. If it is blouses, we will have three or four .times the number. If it is electrical equipment, we will have three, four or five times the quantity that would come from Germany, Italy, England or could be manufactured in Australian factories. That is the menace. We on this side of the House are not opposed ito the Japanese. This is not a question of one race against another. We bear no grudges. We .'hope the Japanese can get out of their difficulties, .but we .say to the Japanese government and the Japanese manufacturers, "" Instead of exporting your commodities to other countries and trying to export more than other countries .send to Japan, reduce the hours of labour of the Japanese people and .increase the purchasing ,power of .the average man, woman and child in Japan so : that the Japanese market will, absorb a-vast amount of your manufactured goods"". In this atomic age, which is an age of invention and of rapidly increasing production, that certainly can be done. The Minister for Labour and National -Service mentioned '.the industries that 'have been built up in -this country, and he is right. They have -been built up in this country. The vast majority of people, whether they be new 'Australians or Old Australians are employed in secondary industries. Although the population has increased by 2,000,000 in'the past 10 years, the number of rural employees has declined by 36,000. That means that more than -2,000,000 people have been absorbed in secondary industries or in industries dependent upon secondary industries. Because of expansion of our secondary industries during the past few years, more than £'200,000,000 has been spent each year on additional buildings and equipment for secondary industries. Destroy the secondary industries or stabilize them, as some people suggest-that means prevent them from advancing as they have been advancing-and the employment in the building trades created by the annual expenditure of that £200,000,000 will be destroyed. This treaty can do the things I have mentioned.

We have heard two speakers from the Oppoment will cause a crisis in the textile indussition side of the House ostensibly discusstry, and, on the other hand, we have direct ing the Japanese Trade Agreement, but they evidence in the facts that I have just related, jnade .very litde reference to the agreement itself, .and to its real implications. In the short time that I have, I shall not'traverse again the material that has been placed 'before the-House by the Minister for Trade the matters that have been raised by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), and the several points that were raised by the honourable member for .Scullin( Mr Peters). .First, .1 -say .in all sincerity .that the state.ments .made .by the -Leader of Uhe .Qppo.sition about most-favoured-nation treatment for Japan were comparatively dishonest. I listened very .carefully, and on:three occasions, I.heard the right honourable ^gentleman say that this agreement,places Japan on the same basis as other countries. He did not .mention that .the.agreement does .not.interiere with the .British .preferential tariffs, .which, in fact, have only recently been confirmed in the lUnited.KingdomrAustralia Trade Agreement. Lcouldrhave understood it if .he jhadoverlooked that :fact in a single -reference '.to :the matter, but, since :he did jiot.mention.itin any of the three: references that he made,.Lean only think that heswas .endeavouring publicly to xonvey rthe .impression, that this agreement -does. something that it .does mot -do, and that it interferes .in some way with-the British preferential .tariffs. The jight honourable gentleman discussed at some length what he claimed to be an [impending crisis in -the textile industry in Australia. In November, 1956, which is not -very long ago, strong representations were made to the Government by people importing and using textiles that the level of import licences fixed for imported textiles was causing shortages, and forcing manufacturers to reduce staffs. It was claimed ,that, unless relief was given immediately, a considerable number of people in New South Wales alone would be out of employment before Christmas of last year. The Government gave relief by issuing special licences for textiles, and overall general relaxations for textiles to the tune of £10,000,000 a year were made by fhe authority of the Minister for Trade from 1st January last. The significant point is that, on the one hand, we have the Leader of the Opposition claiming that this agree-",81,Speaker Mr Made Previously That Under This Treaty
149,Mr Swartz (Darling .Downs) [9.33],,82,Speaker Mr Made Previously That Under This Treaty
150,( Mr Mcewen). 1 Prefer.to Discuss Some Of,"and in a matter that I shall mention in a moment, that imports are the lifeblood of the industry. It is a fact that manufacturing industries use a little more than 75 per cent, by value of the imports of materials into Australia, and that many of our manufacturing industries depend solely upon imported materials. Many factories need imported goods for processing, and imported plant and equipment, motor vehicles, petrol, and many other things. But all these imports have to be paid for out of export earnings. There is no other way of paying for them. Prewar, we did in fact finance a considerable volume of our imports by raising loans overseas, but that source of funds now provides only a trickle. Therefore, manufacturing industries, and the workers in those industries, are dependent upon a high level of export earnings. The United Kingdom is no longer a certain source of loans, as it was before World Wai II . That is one reason why we have to do all in our power to increase and stabilize our export earnings. Yet this agreement, which is designed primarily to do that, is criticized, and the true position of industries under it is misrepresented, by the Leader of the Opposition! Honourable members will now understand why I have said that the statements made by the Leader of the Opposition about one aspect of this agreement, and about the textile industry, were dishonest. The right honourable gentleman also dealt with the low-cost factor of goods from Japan, and the honourable member for Scullin even went so far as to produce in the chamber an article of apparel that he claimed was obtainable from Japan at a very low price. In this connection, I should like to mention a matter that was raised by the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt), who asked, "" What about red China? Is not red China a low-cost country?"" That point has already been dealt with, but I should like to direct the attention of the House to the fact that we have already been trading with other low-cost countries for some years. Trade with great textile manufacturing countries, such as India, which are low-cost countries, has not so far caused any crisis in the Australian textile industry such as the Opposition now predicts will result from the entry of another low-cost country into the field of Australian trade. The great textile manufacturing centre of Hong Kong was supplying the Australian market for years before import licensing was introduced, and has continued to do so since. We have heard nothing about trade with those low-cost areas having any significant effect on the Australian textile industry. This agreement provides for a definite form of protection, which I shall discuss more fully in a moment, should any serious threat to any important Australian manufacturing industry arise. The Leader of the Opposition said also-and I think, again, that he was using his terms rather loosely -that Australian industry has progressed only because it has been given protection by measures enacted by this Parliament. Exactly what the right honourable gentleman meant by that I am not sure. It is a fact, of course, that the Australian tariff system provides protection for Australian industries, and that the textile industry frequently applies for a hearing before the Tariff Board. That form of protection to Australian industries through the tariff system is a normal function, and I assume that that was the system to which the right honourable gentleman was referring. However, it is interesting to note that is what happened before the war, despite the fact that we had then a simplified trading arrangement with Japan. There was no agreement. We traded as normal customers without any government to government agreement. Nevertheless, in 1935, under circumstances of that nature, the Government of Japan imposed some restrictions on imports from Australia, due to some disagreement at that time. There was no reason, of course, in the absence of the protection of some intergovernmental agreement, why some form of restriction of that nature should not have been applied again. whole purpose of the speech of the Leader of the Opposition was to endeavour to create a fear complex on this matter in the minds of the people of Australia. He was doing a great disservice to the Australian people. f desire to refer briefly to Japanese trade with Canada since an agreement was signed a few years ago. It has been referred to twice to-night by the two previous speakers. Attempts were made by those two speakers, and by other people during recent weeks, to",82,Speaker Mr Made Previously That Under This Treaty
151,Mr Timson,What year was that?,83,Speaker Mr Made Previously That Under This Treaty
152,Mr Swartz,"That was 1935. Thedecry the voluntary restraint arrangements in the agreement between Japan and Canada. During the last couple of years the Australian Government has made it its business to keep in touch with the way in which the Japanese-Canadian agreement is working out. Speaking in broad terms, the Government feels able to say that Canadian industry has not been impaired and that the Japanese have carried out their undertakings in respect of restraint of exports. It has been asserted that in some items such as T-shirts-w e are still on the subject of shirts-Canadian industry has been damaged. Evidence of the damage has not been given. No unemployment figures have been produced and no other factual indication of damage has been given. The responsible Minister of the Canadian Government-thi s was confirmed to-night by a quotation from a Canadian newspapersaid that Japanese textiles-that includes the whole range of textiles-ha d gained only between 5 per cent, and 6 per cent, of the Canadian market. That of itself gives a conclusive answer to the points that have been raised by the Leader of the Opposition. I was shocked to hear the Leader of the Opposition make the categorical statement did not confer wtih representative industrial bodies before the signing of the agreement and that he conferred with those bodies only after the agreement had been signed. That is completely untrue, and I am sorry to say that I am sure the Leader of the Opposition knows that that statement is untrue. The Minister for Trade conferred with the Associated Chambers of Manufactures, the Associated Chambers of Commerce and the National Farmers Union. Indeed, while negotiations were going on between the Japanese delegation to Australia and our own officials, press statements were released from time to time showing the progress of the negotiations. Criticism has also been levelled at the safeguards contained in this agreement. I think it only right at this stage to refer again to those safeguards, because, although they have been criticized to-night, no reference has been made to the specific safeguards. Firstly, there is the voluntary restraint which can be introduced by the Japanese Government, within the constitutional powers it possesses. As I have already mentioned, to a large degree that is working R -[8 ] well in the agreement between Japan and Canada and also in the trade arrangement between Japan and the United States of America. Then special duties, if necessary, can be imposed to safeguard Australian manufacturing industries. As all honourable members know, last year this Parliament passed a bill which amended the Australian Industries Preservation Act to enable that to be done. The next safeguard is that restrictive import limits, quantitative limits may be imposed on Japanese goods, if necessary, to safeguard local industry. Those limits can be imposed by the Minister for Trade, and it is not necessary to obtain the consent of the Japanese Government to their imposition. For the purposes of the record, I felt that reference should be made at this stage to those safeguards. I shall now refer to one of the most extraordinary statements that a responsible member of this House could make. The Leader of the Opposition said that he did not consider this agreement on commerce between Japan and Australia was necessary. That, coming from a responsible member of this House, was an astounding statement. The firm policy of this Government is to consolidate, by intergovernmental trade agreements, Australia's existing export markets and to open up assured new opportunities for export. In conformity with that policy, this agreement has been signed, as was the recent agreement between the United Kingdom and Australia, and ',. is to be hoped that in the future it will be possible to negotiate trade agreements with other countries. As I have said, the policy of this Government is to consolidate our existing export trade and enable it to expand into new markets. Any honourable member who disagrees with that policyby disagreeing with the signing of this agreement, he is doing so-show s a degree of irresponsibility which I am sure the public will recognize. It seems to be quite conclusive that a very definite advantage is to be gained by Australia in consolidating the present trade situation with the Japanese nation. There is one other thought I want to leave with honourable members. A point was raised by the Leader of the Opposition in relation to the wool trade. It was partly answered by the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt), but I should like to make a comment on it.",83,Speaker Mr Made Previously That Under This Treaty
153,That The Minister For Trade ( Mr Mcewen),"because I feel the matter is important and that it could have an effect on Australia's most important export industry. Australia did not wish to maintain a course which would put the Japanese Government in such a position, because of our uncooperative and uncompromising trade attitude, that it would come under pressure to facilitate or encourage a switch-over in Japan from natural wool to synthetic fibres. It is nonsensical to argue that Japan must buy our wool, in the same way as we must buy oil. There is no threat to natural oil from man made oil. We have a policy of wool research and wool publicity to help wool to maintain its place in world trade against competition from synthetic or man-made fibres. Jt would be foolish to frustrate that by an unthinking trade policy. That is an important point to remember in relation to this trade agreement. I shall conclude on this note: In the total pottage, made in this case of soft wheat. picture, we gain substantial export benefits -ne w markets in the case of soft wheat and security for existing trade, particularly in the case of wool. In return we get benefits by way of normal foreign country treatment and we give foreign country treatment to Japan. But to ensure that our local industry is not disrupted we have added escape clauses or emergency action provisions which give full power to the Government to protect Australian industry. In conclusion, I say that this agreement is one that the Government believes will help the whole Australian economy. It will contribute towards a stable balance of payments to Australia, and reduce the fluctuations which make import restrictions necessary, whilst not adversely affecting the Australian manufacturing industry. edly this Japanese trade agreement will deal a devastating blow to many Australian industries. That is evidenced by the grave concern and anxiety shown by the Associated Chambers of Manufactures and many trade unions, whose members will be affected by this agreement. The safeguards that were announced by the unimpressive and very unconvincing. That is further evidenced by the statements of Mr Withall, the federal director of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures; Mr Among the light industries of Australia none Curphey. the general manager of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures; Mr Hall, the director of the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures; Mr Loft, of the Australian Textile Workers Union; and Mr Markham, of the Australian Glass Workers Union. ** It may interest the House to hear some extracts from a statement made by Mr Hall on the safeguards contained in this agreement. I shall quote from an article which appeared in the "" Sydney Morning Herald"", of 18th July, under the heading, "" Japanese trade safeguards criticised ""There was not a single worthwhile safeguard against Japanese imports in the Japan-Australia trade agreement, the Industries Preservation Act, the Tariff B«ard, or in the concept of Japanese businessmen voluntarily restricting exports, Mr C. R. Hall said yesterday. Mr Hall, who is Director of the Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales, said the Australian industry's birth right for a mess of Under the agreement, signed in Japan on July 6, Japan will provide a market for, among other commodities, soft Australian wheat, which has previously been unsaleable in Japan. I do not intend to read the full article because time would not permit, but I will read a further extract which quotes Mr Hall's statement"" Another disturbing factor is that on Mr McEwen's return from Tokyo he was reported as saying that safeguards in the trade agreement ensured that no worth-while industry in Australia would be wiped out. "" The keyword is worth-while. In the early 1930's the word was 'unnecessary'. But who is to determine whether an industry is ' worth-while' or not? "" Are these industries-to mention some particularly vulnerable to Japanese trade-textiles , aluminium, hand tools, cement, chinaware, glassware, toys and tiles? "" Industry is alarmed, to say the least, to find a Minister of such senior standing and prestige in the agreement by the use of the word ' worthwhile '."" Mr Hall added, "" We do not for a moment accept the assurances of the Government that the ' safeguards' claimed to exist are worthy of tbe name "". I do not think anybody could say that Mr Hall is a Labour man. NowI would like to quote from a circular issued by the Federal Council of the Australian Textile Workers Union, one of the main unions whose members will be affected by this agreement. It statesis more susceptible to the impact of imports from overseas than the textile industry, and no other",84,Speaker Mr Made Previously That Under This Treaty

157,As Mr Mcewen Hedging On So,"called ' safeguards'light industry has expanded, nor developed to the advantage of the national economy to a greater extent in the post-war years than the Australian textile industry. As one of Japan's greatest export industries is, and always has been, her textile industry, we cannot regard the Trade Agreement with anything but alarm and anxiety on behalf of our many thousands of members, because Japanese textiles will flood our local market and our members will be out of their jobs. Already the indirect adverse results of the Agreement are in evidence. Because of uncertainty of trading conditions in the immediate future firm orders have been cancelled, with the result that some hundreds of our members have lost their employment. This has occurred particularly in Tasmania and New South Wales, but in due course other States will certainly experience similar effects. Since the announcement of the signing of the Agreement, numerous statements have been issued from Canberra to the effect that the Agreement contains safeguards against damage or injury to local industry, but with these so-calied safeguards we are not at all impressed. We recall that in pre-war years, and particularly in the late 'twenties, the Australian textile industry was devastated by Japanese competition, and only the drastic tariff introduced by the Scullin Administration saved the industry from extinction. We have no reason to believe that the position will be any different to-day, once the Agreement is firmly established. The safeguards referred to in Article V. of the Agreement look very well on paper, but when it is realized the time which must elapse between the commencement andfinalizationof negotiations between the respective governments, where it is expected that "" INJURY"" will be caused, it should not be difficult to imagine that our industry would not only be seriously injured, in that period, but permanently incapacitated. Our Union therefore seeks some much more speedy and effective method of safeguard, and suggests the provision of a quota system of imports by which the local textile industry would be assured of the major portion of the local market for its goods. Only by this or similar means can the continued employment of our members be assured. Undoubtedly, primary industry cannot employ them, and our members themselves do not want a government unemployment hand-out. They want their jobs protected. And quite rightly so. Now, Mr Acting Speaker, if further evidence is required of the value of the safeguards, I point out that any one who has been reading the papers lately will have noticed a sharp downward trend in shares in the textile industry. Surely that indicates that the safeguards are very very unconvincing, because nobody in his wildest imagination could say for one moment that the investor would not know what is contained in this agreement. That is why he is trying to get rid of his shares. When the Minister for Trade spoke last Tuesday night he made no announcement of the volume or value of Japanese goods that would be accorded most-favourednation treatment. He gave no interpretation of what the term "" serious damage"" means. Does it mean the closing down of factories, working part time, a catastrophic drop in share values, or does it mean a major recession? Just what does it mean? When I interjected the other night the Minister said that it means a sensible per' son's thinking. Well, I would like to get a clear interpretation of "" serious damage "".. The phrase covers a very wide field, The textile and ancillary industries did"" yeoman service during the war. In many instances they were working three shiftsper day. I have with me a letter from a. textile mill in my electorate which indicates just what a splendid contribution to the war effort was made by this industry. This mill is one of the largest in Australia and I will quote from this letter in order to prove to the House what an essential part the textile industry plays to-day in Australia. It readsDuring the whole of Uie war period, our factory worked three shifts per day, and our total output, which exceeded 5,000,000 lb. of yarn per year, was directed completely to supplies for defence and essential services. During this period, we installed additional plant at the instigation of authorities and subsequently our company has operated efficiently and made full-time use of the capacity available. During the past two years, staff in our factory has been increased by almost 1,000 employees, and we have recently embarked on a modernization and expansion programme which is now well under way and which will cost approximately £1,500,000. Our successful trading over the past few years has influenced the decision to expand, but our plans are now seriously jeopardized by this Japanese Trade Pact. Surely that is evidence of the great effort that was put forward by this industry during the war. It must be protected, because we cannot expect such industries to come to the nation's help in times of emergency if we do not protect them. They must be fostered and encouraged to expand in peacetime so that we can lean upon them in times of emergency. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has already indicated that the wool and worsted industry of Australia pays £14,000,000 a year in salaries and wages, that the minimum value of plant and buildings is £45,000,000, that it produces £70,000,000 worth of goods a year, and that it employs 25,000 persons directly and many more thousands indirectly. It is absolutely ridiculous to talk about trying to compete with Japan when she is treated as a most favoured nation. Surely the figures that have been cited by my leader would convince any one of that fact. I refer now to hours of work. We in Australia work a 40-hour week. We also enjoy long service leave, annual leave, sick leave and workers' compensation, and awards are policed to ensure that juvenile labour is not employed in factories. Let us compare such conditions with those of a Japanese worker. The average Japanese worker works 48± hours a week, he does not receive payment for annual leave, he does not receive workers' compensation or sick leave, and he is not paid for public holidays. How the dickens can we compete with a nation that has such a low standard of living? ( Mr Lawrence) -Order! The honourable member for East Sydney must not interject. that was made by the Chamber of Manufactures. Order! If the honourable member for East Sydney interjects again, I will take action. is not correct, he should take up the fight with Mr Hall and Mr Withall publicly. Is any one so naive as to think for one moment that the Japanese buy wool from us because of a good neighbour policy? Japan buys wool from us because it is essential for her to do so. If she could buy wool of the same quality for a few pence a pound cheaper from some other nation, she would certainly do so. and would not buy it from Australia. The real reason behind the conclusion of this agreement is the getting rid of unsaleable second-grade wheat. Why should we sacrifice or place in jeopardy many Australian industries just for the sake of pandering to a small section of our primary producers? The completion of this agreement has been a great victory for the Australian Country party. It is the smallest party in the House, but it has had a great victory. The signing of the agreement will have repercussions. It will place some of the Liberal members who occupy safe seats in the city areas in a precarious position at the next election. They are not too happy about the agreement. When references were made to what happened when a similar agreement was concluded between Canada and Japan, no one said that the Canadian Government, which initiated it. was soundly trounced at the last election. Apparently every one has received varying press reports from Canada about the outcome of the agreement between Canada and Japan. I propose to quote a report which appeared in the "" Three Rivers, Quebec, Chronicle"", of 14th February last. It readsIndeed, the only distinction between Canada and other members of Japan's pre-war co-prosperity sphere is that Trade Minister Howe continues to advise the Japanese to avoid direct competition with Canadian producers. Then, under the heading, "" Flood of Japanese Goods "", it readsNow that they have their long desired entry into the Canadian market, the Japanese have abandoned their early pretences of accepting this advice and are rapidly over-running toy, textile, electrical appliance and other domestic markets. The year before Canada granted most-favourednation status to Japanese imports, Japan sold only $14 million in manufactured goods on the Canadian market. In the first half of 19S6, Japan sold more than double this amount and Japanese sales in Canada for the whole of 1956 totalled $65 million. By the end of 1957, Japanese sales to Canada will surely reach $100 million. Meanwhile, Canada's sales to Japan are not moving so fast. Mr Howe's rosy forecasts of Japanese interest in Canadian uranium, iron ore, and oil-and grain, of course-mus t be heavily discounted against traditional Japanese insistence on a balance of trade in their favour in their trading accounts with individual countries. Surely what has happened in Canada will happen in Australia. I should like to conclude by reminding the House that this morning my colleague, the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard), referred to the present serious unemployment situation in Australia. There is a vast amount of unemployment in the electorate of Watson, which contains most of the major industries in Australia and which is the greatest industrial electorate in this country. How the dickens will the Japanese Trade Agreement improve the situation? It will worsen it and will do so much more quickly than many people would care to see.

167,Mr Ian Allan,"That is a considerdo so by the officers of the Department of Trade; and I think it is quite feasible that they could find a marketa small market perhaps for a start-in Japan itself. I return now to Japan as a new market for wheat. It may seem strange that Japan should seek to pay hard money for wheat when she can very easily get wheat cheaply, or for practically nothing, under the American concessional aid programme. I believe the reason why the Japanese have resisted pressure-and it is tremendous pressure, because there are over* 3,000,000,000 bushels of wheat carry-over in North America this year-to accept what is virtually a gift of wheat, is that Japan is determined to establish herself as a wholly independent Asian power, and to establish her own markets in Asia and the Pacific. I think that we should respect her for adopting the view that she must remain independent and develop her own individual policies. The third and final aspect of this treaty, which is probably the most important, is the general effect it will have on the Australian economy. As the Leader of the House( Mr Harold Holt) said earlier this evening, we all benefit when the farmer has a good income. That is one benefit that we, as a community, will derive from this treaty, because the incomes of the farmers will be underwritten by the treaty. I believe also that we are going to see, as a result of the treaty, a lowering of the cost structure in Australia. That does not mean that great masses of people will be thrown out of employment, because 75 per cent, of our imports are raw materials used by Australian manufacturers, and are capital goods required to improve our standard of production and our productivity. Manufacturers will be the first to benefit from this treaty. The safeguards that have been included in the treaty are, I believe, quite adequate to prevent any serious damage to any section of Australian industry. We have had ample assurance from the Minister in that respect. The main effect of increased exports to Australia by Japan will surely be felt not by Australian manufacturers but by the British and continental manufacturers who export to us at present. It is a strange thing that we have not had one word of complaint from the British Government .about this alleged threat to British trade in Britain's best market, although the British Government has had ample time to comment on the treaty. I believe the reason is that the British people welcome competition. The British are a great, aggressive trading nation. They are meeting world competition and expanding their economy. They expanded their exports by 6 per cent, in the first six months of this year against competition from Japan and every other nation. If the British can accept serious competition so philosophically our own manufacturers would do well to take the same attitude. I am sure that when they realize what is going to happen and get over their immediate concern, they will welcome competition as an aid to increasing efficiency in their industries. To the Australian community, the treaty will mean stability and, because it will hasten the removal of import restrictions, it will lead to a new era of prosperity and industrial expansion. I commend the Minister and his staff for negotiating this very complex treaty and its predecessor, the United Kingdom Trade Agreement. As forecast, they will ensure stability and avoid to a great extent the sharp fluctuations which we have had over the past few years in our export income. Debate (on motion by Mr Bird) adjourned.

That the House do now adjourn. numerous occasions, members of the Australian Labour party have directed attention to inaccurate and misleading answers given by Ministers to questions. I have a particular instance to which I want to direct attention, because I regard it as a most serious and important matter. It concerns the attitude of the Government to the illegitimate children of Australian ex-servicemen and Japanese mothers. I raised this matter earlier this year and asked the Minister for Defence( Sir Philip McBride) a series of questions.

Because he used 140 sheets Government regarded itself as having some of Army foolscap paper without authority responsibility in this matter and, if so, what in this worthy, humane cause, the Governplans it had evolved to assist these innocent ment and the Army authorities stepped in victims of warfare. The Minister repliedThe matter involves a question of policy which has not yet been determined by the Government. Well, it is about time that the Government did determine it. The war has been over for a number of years, and I think the Australian Government has to accept responsibility for the unfortunate position of these illegitimate children. But what are the facts? The Minister has said that the children are being well cared for. A newspaper published the statement the children. It stated that they and their mothers are social outcasts, slaves in road keep the children clothed and fed. That The fact seems to sibility in this matter. This is what the The Government is prepared to allow church organizations to carry out this work without the Government making anyfinancialgrant to them.

It is about time that the Government accepted responsibility for these womenfolk and their children. I do not know the answer to the problem or the best method of handling it. There are many ways in which it could be approached. The Government does not escape its responsibility by simply washing its hands of the problem and saying that this is one of the things arising from war for which governments cannot accept responsibility.

If the Government wants the Christian churches to attend to the matter, let it give financial support to them. Alternatively, orphanages or similar institutions could be established in Japan, under Government supervision and care, to ensure that these unfortunate people will be properly cared for. In my opinion the parading of these children with placards round their necks reading "" I am the child of an Australian serviceman "", begging and seeking alms, must lead to disparagement of the Australian Government and the Australian nation. It is a disgraceful state of affairs. When I raised this matter eight or nine months ago, I expected the Government to do something about it. But the Minister merely said that the figures are exaggerated, and that there are no more than 40. Now it is disclosed that there are over 1,000 of them and instead of them being well cared for, as the Minister indicated at that time, many of the women have to walk the streets, selling themselves to get food to maintain themselves and their unfortunate children. If Ministers did a little more acting and less talking it would not be so necessary for members of the Opposition to be continually directing attention to this disgraceful state of affairs. I hope the members of the Government will now do something and stop merely talking.

The Minister for Defence( Sir Philip McBride) has given information which, knowing him, I have no doubt was based upon the best advice and information that he could secure. for judgment. IfI had the choice of relying on a statement made by the Minister for Defence or a statement made by the honourable member for East Sydney, I would prefer to accept the officially based statement of the Minister. I only add that the honourable member for East Sydney has bandied around, very wildly and loosely, a charge that 1,000-that is the figure he used, as contrasted with the figure of 40 supplied by the Minister-illegitimat e Australian children or children of Australian service fathers are in Japan. That is a very grave reflection on the quite small number of Australian serving men who were in Japan at any one time. I only ask the honourable gentleman to weigh that consideration before he makes general charges of this character. a grave and serious problem and it should be treated as such. I think the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) has done a service in drawing attention to an aftermath of war which is always, apparently, unavoidable, but which leaves a stigma on the nation concerned, and ere this something should have been done about it. In regard to the figures cited, it is obvious that the Minister for Defence( Sir Philip McBride) was woefully misinformed. During 1948, when I had the pleasure and honour of leading a delegation to Japan, I went through Kure, where the existence of this tragedy was obvious to all. I remind the House that allied forces other than Australians were located there, and that there are difficulties in identifying those responsible. I think we can take it from the survey made by a responsible newspaper in New South Wales that there are 1,000 mothers and children who probably are the offspring of Australian ex-servicemen. Not all of the chitdren are illegitimate. In quite a number of cases the women are the wives of Australian servicemen, either according to a Shinto ceremony or by Christian marriage, whose husbands have left for Australia with some promise to return. The women have been left with the children. If the Minister will look at a series of pictures in the Sydney magazine "" Pix"", he will see the evidence of the genesis of these children in front of his own eyes. The photographs show the characteristic appearance of young Australians who are half castes. There is an unmistakable mark of the sire upon them, if I may say so, and it is a tragic thing.

The Leader of the House( Mr Harold Holt) has adopted the usual tactics in replying to the honourable member for East Sydney. Possibly, he learned them from the former Vice-President of the Executive Council, Sir Eric Harrison, who used to do the same thing.

In other words, if we tell the people about something that has happened, we are casting a grave reflection. Whether or not it is a reflection is for the Minister to say.

The people who represent Japan in this country, and who are sitting in the ambassadorial corner of the House, want action from the Minister, not a lot of glib promises, not a lot of talk about what the Government is going to do and what it has already done. What the Japanese and the people of Australia want to be told by the Government is what it proposes to do about the children whom the Minister admits are the sons and daughters of Australian ex-servicemen. The Minister for the Army refers to Army files and argues about the number of illegitimate children. He says it is not as great as the honourable member for East Sydney has stated. He is forced to admit that what the honourable member for East Sydney has said is true in substance, but he is haggling now as to whether 1,000 or 999 are affected. Fancy this Minister talking about Army files! I recollect an occasion when I brought to his notice in this Parliament a complaint from an ex-serviceman. I told the Parliament then that I knew I was wasting my time in bringing to this Parliament the complaint of an ex-serviceman. I told the Parliament then that I knew that all that would happen would be that the Minister would go to the Army and ask for a report from the people against whom the charge was levelled. That is precisely what he did. After months and months of delay, he went to the Army authorities against whom the charge was levelled and said, "" Please, sirs, is what Clyde Cameron says about you in Parliament true? "". They waited for months and at last prepared a report in which they said, "" My dear Minister, we are pleased to advise you that what Clyde Cameron said about us is not true "". Whereupon the Minister sat down and wrote a letter to me saying, "" The charges that you made are not true. The Army has investigated the matter. After calling for a report from the people who were really guilty, those guilty persons have assured me that they are not guilty, and therefore the poor sergeant against whom the injustice was committed is actually a liar and is suffering some hallucination."" The Minister complained that the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) is stirring up the emotions of the people of Australia on this matter. Of course he is stirring up the emotions of the people of Australia! It is to the credit of the people of Australia that they are capable of being stirred on a matter such as this. It is to the eternal credit of the people of Australia that their emotions are moved by this terrible tragedy that is happening in Japan. What the Government must remember is that these little children are entitled to have some protection, some safeguards against the inevitable consequences of the poverty from which they are now suffering.

If the wife of a serviceman who served in Japan in the Australian forces came in here to-night, she legitimately could draw the conclusion that the whole of the Opposilion believed that every Australian serviceman who served in Japan was nothing but a complete libertine. Opposition members interjecting, -opposite may laugh, but I am not now being funny about this matter. The Opposition has had its fun to-night and I have joined in it, but this is serious. We all know that one of the consequences of war is a relaxation of the moral standards of the people who are involved in it. We all know that war leaves in its train awful, pathetic and unhappy personal consequences. These are not subjects for joking, as the honourable member for Hindmarsh has joked. I am not aware that the honourable member has himself made much contribution to avoidance of the sort of conditions of which he complained. The honourable member for East Sydney sits there and laughs when this matter is talked about, but I am not aware that he has much personal knowledge of the kind of situation in which the matters of which he complained are likely to occur. I do not know that the honourable members for Hindmarsh and East Sydney are the best qualified members on their side of the House to speak about these things. T think that there are people better qualified to speak about the consequences of war than either of them. WhatI want to tell the House is this: I have seen to-night, engendered by the honourable member for East Sydney and supported by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, an attempt to land on the side of the Government responsibility for inattention to and neglect of, the welfare of a large number of illegitimate children in Japan. the responsibility belongs? tralian servicemen, I ask, "" How many servicemen of Allied nations served in Japan in post-war years? What was the total number, including Americans and United Kingdom forces? How many servicemen did those other nations have in Japan in the relevant years, and how many did Australia have? "" It would be easy to work out the proportion of Australian servicemen to Allied servicemen. What was that proportion? I suggest that it was small. On the evidence of some photographs in a notoriously irresponsible weekly journal in New South Wales, apparently the Opposition is prepared to believe that all these unfortunate illegitimate children are the children of Australian servicemen. I ask you, sir, and I ask the House to consider the implications of this charge. Is the Australian so much more of a libertine than is the Englishman, the Scot or the American? Is he so much worse than everybody else? I think we ought to think about these things before we make charges of this kind.

212,Mr Osborne,"It is not the first timefirst honourable member opposite to make such a charge, and from my experience of human nature I do not expect this will be the last time such tactics will be employed. The Opposition has been quite ready to believe that all the misfortunes of war in Japan are attributable to Australian servicemen. I do not believe that to be the case. Honourable members opposite, particularly the honourable member for East Sydney and the honourable member for Hindmarsh, would be well advised to reflect on the fact that the Australian serviceman, in all theatres of war, has established for himself a reputation for decency, gallant behaviour and proper respect for women and children. Minister's time has expired. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.1 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated:Overseas Freights. Mr Duthie asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice1. What was the extra annual cost to Australian producers and exporters when overseas freight rates were increased by 7 i per cent.? 2. What will be the extra annual cost as a result of the 14 per cent, increase? 3. What would be the added cost involved in a 5 per cent, increase? honourable follows:The freight increases referred to applied only to exports to the United Kingdom and Europe, and affected only those commodities classified as liner cargo. Certain important cargoes such as wheat, sugar, coarse grains and ores and concentrates not classified as liner cargoes are shipped at rates which are related to the prevailing rates for charter tonnage. Subject to these considerations and assuming the level and composition of cargo for 1955-56 to be common to all of the years concerned the following estimates have been made of the increase in the total freight bill attributable to the increases in the various rates of freight:(1) September, 1953-7 ± per cent, rise, annual increase £A. 1,850,000; October, sioners, 455.551, or 82.25 per cent., received a 1955-7 4 per cent., annual increase £A.1,990.000. (2) February, 1957-1 4 per cent, rise, annual increase £A .3,960,000. (3) Further5 per cent, rise, annual increase £A.l.610,000. No estimate has been made of how much of the freight increases referred to has been borne by the Australian exporter or producer and how much has been borne by the importer in the overseas country. Mr Laszlo Megay. Mr Ward asked the Minister for Immigration, upon notice1. Has his department received information regarding a Mr Laszlo Megay, now resident in Australia, who is alleged to have been guilty of a number of grave offences in Hungary when a resident of that country? 2. If so, what action has been taken to ascertain whether these aUegations have any basis? able member's questions are as follows:1. Some time ago, a letter published in a New York Hungarian periodica], named "" Az Ember"", was brought under the notice of my department. This letter dealt with the alleged conduct of Mr Megay when he held the position of town mayor of Ungvar, Hungary. Mr Megay left Hungary in 1945. 2. Full inquiries have been made in regard to the allegations contained in that article. These inquiries revealed no evidence to support the allegations made. Mr Megay was cleared by the War Crimes Commission in 1947. Number of Pensioners. Mr R. W. Holt asked the Minister for Social Services, upon notice1. What is the number of (a) females aged 60 years and over and (b) males aged 65 years and over? 2. What is the total number of persons in receipt of the full age and invalid pensions, showing separately females, males, married couples and unmarried persons? to the 3. What is the number of age and invalid penmember's questions is as sioners in receipt of (a) the maximum permissible income, (b) half or more than half the maximum permissible income, and (c) less than half the maximum permissible income? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The latest distribution of the Australian population published by the Commonwealth Statistician is that for 30th June, 1956. It is estimated that at that date there were in Austraha 641,266 women aged 60 years or more and 353,039 men aged 65 years or more. 2. On 30th June, 1957, there were 554,017 age and invalid pensioners, of whom 343,286 were women and 210,731 were men. Of the total penpension of £4 a week or more. An analysis of age and invalid pensioners by sex, conjugal condition and the rale of pension is not available. However, a sample survey undertaken in Victoria early in 1956 indicates that ahnost two-thirds of age pensioners are single, widowed or divorced.",96,Adjournment

217,Mr Mcewen,"The answers to the5. I am unable to precisely answer this question because it is impossible to predict the value of licences which will be issued in future periods. However, imports in January-June, 1957, were 4,933 tons, valued at £1,291,305. Should this rate be maintained, imports for 1957 would be 9,866 tons, valued at £2,582,610. 6.
