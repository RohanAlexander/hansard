2,Mr Fisher,"Majesty the K in g. It ie dated Buckingham Palace, 29th A p r i l , 1915, and is as follows: I heartily oongratulate you upon the Bplendid conduct and bravery displayed by the Australian troops in the operations at the Dardanelles, who have indeed proved themselves worthy sons of the Empire. Minister of Defence told us yesterday that the Government has resolved to increase the separation allowance of women whose husbands are at the front. Have Ministers given further consideration to the request thab I made yesterday' that the allowance to widows who have sons at the f r o n t on whom they depend may be increased ? with the Minister of Defence this morning, and am in a position to say tlhat it is the intention of the Department to increase by 10s. a week the allowance paid to widows with sons at the fron t who are their sole support, thus putting them on the same footing as the wives of soldiers abroad. vernment received any report in regard to the physical condition of the troops who have recently been in Egypt, with special reference to the alleged defects in the medical examination of the troops ? receiving reports from, those in command at the front. I do not know of any special report such as the honourable member asks for, but I shall make inquiries, and let him know. Minister consult the issue of the Argus of the 24th A p r i l , in which a letter purporting to come from a leading medical officer attached to the First Expeditionary Force to a practitioner in Melbourne, saysYou would not believe the number of derelicts who have been passed as medically fit, but who have now to be returned to Australia at the public expense. How such cripples ever passod the medical and riding tests I cannot conceive. I ask the Minister also whether he will not inquire why a leading medical officer who was a member of the First Expeditionary Force should not have communicated with those .who are in authority rather than with a friend in Australia? I further ask how it is that the oensors who are fairly well paid for the services they render, have been so wanting in their duties as to allow such a paragraph to appear In the press in Australia? comply with the request of the honourable member in regard to the lebter which has appeared in the Argus. It is right that The Assistant should communicate with the Defence Department, seeing that he is in such a responsible position. ister any information later than that ' which appeared in this morning's newspapers regarding the series of actions in which our troops are or have been engaged in the Dardanelles? If he has not, will he make an effort to obtain that information, Beeing that there is now considerable I had a consultation anxiety in the minds of many persons in Australia ? the subject is not materially greater than that which has been made available to the public. We have invited the Imperial Government more than once to supply us with all details as soon as they can. give permission. Whatever our feelings may be, we must, I take it , stand by what they consider the necessities of the war. Minister inform the House whether, if additional equipment were provided, the recruits offering would enable us to send more troops to the fronfJ than the Government can despatch at the present time? despatching every man that the British Government has requested. that the Imperial Government has at any time made any request for the desptch of troops from Australia, and is it the policy of the Government to -despatch only such troorjs as may be requested by the I m perial Government? patched from Australia an offer is made to the Imperial authorities. We have now two further brigades undergoing preparation. They have been offered and have been accepted. Sometimes it is two or three weeks after the making of an offer that the Imperial authorities accept it.",4,Despatch Of Troops War

Almost all the departmental stores differ. tion of the Postmaster-General to a letter that I received this morning, on whicb I desire to base a question. The letter These offices are being rewas in reply to a request made by me for furthe r consideration for the mail contractors who had been so badly h it by the I hope that high price of fodder. I draw attention to this passage in it The general question of granting relief to mail contractors on account of the drought has already been given careful consideration, but it is not seen how, without inflicting a grave injustice on tenderers, and striking at the fundamental principle of public tendering for mail services, any consideration cnn be shown to contractors by way of increasing their subsidy during the currency of their contract. The contracts are let both in good years and in bad years, and tenderers understand that they must make provision in their tenders to meet the vicissitudes of the weather. The communication adds that the concession offered by the Department is that services may be reduced 50 per cent., w i th a subsidy of"" 25 per cent. I ask the Postmaster-General whether he is not aware that horses have to be fed, whether they make two trips a week or a t r ip a day ? It is impossible, at the -present time, to tur n them out when they are not running. I ask h i m to again consider the representations that have been made to h i m on behalf of the mail contractors. It is stated in to-day's entered into over 5,000 mail contracts, many of which are being carried out w it h motor cars. Since the drought, some of Isi t in the contractors have substituted motor cars for horse-drawn vehicles. Of the contractors who are still using horses, while some have to feed their horses, others are able to obtain grass. All are not in the same position. The problem with which the Department has to deal is a most difficult one. A large number of the contracts were let last December, in the middle of the drought, and the contractors knew the conditions when they ten-",6,Tasmanian Pruit Growers

The Department does not demand a refund when seasons prove to bp Tinexpectedly good, and it would be an unsound business arrangement to increase subsidies when a bad season was being experienced. To do this would be unfair to those persons who, having calculated the probability of a bad season, had tendered at a higher price than those who succeeded in getting the contract. To increase the subsidies in the manner now proposed would cost an enormous sum of money, and could not be done in the offhand way that seems to be thought possible. organized state of the country mail services consequent on the increased price, of fodder, the weakening of horses, and so forth, will the Postmaster-General and his Government take the advance step, where possible, of instituting motor services?

There were unionists transported to Australia-respectabl e men-wh o had not committed any offence, bnt because»they had chosen to become members of a union "" ? 2. If correctly reported, w ill he inform the House when and where any person has been transported because he had chosen to become a member of a union? honourable member's questions are1. The quotation is substantially correct, so far as it goes. 2. The English Court records covering the last quarter of the 18th century and the first quarter of the 19th century disclose thousands of cases of persons Who were fined, imprisoned, and, in many cases, transported, because they had exercised what they conceived to be their rights as free men to combine w i th their fellow-workmen in order to obtain decent wages and conditions. I refer the honourable member to one typical case cited by the honourable member for Barrier, who is reported in Hansard, Vol. LXX., page 752, as follows:I have here a pamphlet which gives an account of the arrest and t r i a l of six men simply because they proposed to form a trade union to improve the lot of their fellow-workers. They were agricultural labourers, and were anxious to obtain a living wage for those employed on the farms of England. They had been receiving 7s. per week, and when they were told that this rate was to be reduced to 6s. per week, they formed an association with the object of securing a wage of 10s. per week. In opposition to their scheme, placards were distributed throughout the agricultural areas of England setting forth that any one who joined the union would be sentenced to seven years' transportation. In the words of this pamphlet""This was no idle threat; within three days of the publication of the notice George Loveless and five other labourers were arrested and lodged in Dorchester gaol."" George Loveless was not only a Labourite, but a Methodist local preachera fact that should appeal to the Prime Minister"" The five other labourers were James Loveless, brother to George, also a Wesleyan local preacher; James Hammitt, their brother-in-law; These tents have Thomas Standfield, another Wesleyan local preacher;' John Standfield, his son; and James There are no trained Brine."" These men had to stand their t r i a l because Six hospital huts have now they had formed a union with the idea of raising the wages of agricultural labourers to 10s. These huts will take the per week.

We have injured no man's reputation, character, person, or property. We were uniting together to preserve ourselves, our wives, and our children from utter degradation and starvation. We challenge any man or number of men to prove that we have acted or intended to act different f r om the above statement.""",11,Shipping Accommodation

102,Mr Hughes (West Sydney,"Atmatters arising under the Constitution or involving its interpretation; and by the amending Judiciary Act passed last year, in all matters of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. The present measure gives the trials of indictable offences against the laws of the Commonwealth. There is a broad, general reason for the passage of this measure. It is, first of all, an eminently desirable thing that the Federal Court should have jurisdiction to deal witli offences against Federal laws; and, secondly, it is very desirable that the power possessed by the Attorneys-General of most of the States to submit cases direct to the Court without any preliminary commitment, should be vested in the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth also. In South Australia that power is conferred by the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1876, section 334; in Western Australia by the Criminal Code 1913, No. 28, section 579; in Queensland by the Criminal Code 1899, section 5 6 1 ; in Tasmania by 19 Victoria, No. 9, section 4 ; and in Victoria by the Crimes Act 1890, section 386. By those Statutes the Attorneys-General of those States are enabled to do what it is proposed to empower the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth to do under clause 3 of this B ill . By clause 4, section 72 of the principal A ct is to be amended in such a way as to prevent a conflict of jurisdiction and prolongation of procedure. As the section stands at present it would be possible for a person tried in the High Court to require tliat Court to reserve a question of law for the F u ll Court of the State or the F u ll Court of the H i g h Court. This clause amends the law so that it will be possible to reserve such a point for the F u l l Court of the H i g h Court only. It is proposed to amend clause 4 by striking out of the last line the words "" the Supreme,"" and inserting in lieu the word "" a , "" so that the last line in the B ill will read "" if the t r i al was had in a Court of a State."" The-reason for the alteration is thab in some States indictable offences can be tried in other State Courts than the Supreme Court, for example, in a Court of Quarter Sessions. I do not wish to labour this matter. The measure that stands next on the notice-paper must be regarded as complementary to, and consequential upon, this B ill , and I ask my learned friends to look at the B ill in that light, so that we shall not be traversing the same ground twice. As this is a measure which does not appeal to members generally, but only to those learned in the law, and deals with matters quite"" familiar to the learned members for Court original jurisdiction in Angas and Darling Downs, I will confine myself to the reasons I have advanced in support of the B ill , and without further remark move the second reading. [11.29] -I propose to offer no objection to the passage of this and another related Bill, but what is running in my mind is this: I understand that the Attorney-General desires to have these proposals carried into effect because of something connected with the war-that they are in reality war precautionary measures. If that be so, why not limit the whole of this jurisdiction to the duration of the war 1 in any case to be passed; original jurisdiction ought to be given to the High Courti n this regard. that there is much difference of opinion as to that, even amongst legal authorities. The outstanding fact remains that it is proposed to set aside some of the ordinary privileges which have hitherto been exercised by persons indicted. to do is to remit these matters to the High Court instead of to the State Courts. would it not be wise to arrange that this legislation may be reviewed at the end of the war, retaining such portions as may prove themselves to be advantageous, and omitting others? man will look at section 76 of the Constitution he will see what this Parliament is empowered to do, and this B ill represents one of the powers. section this morning, but it does uot follow that because the power is given we should, therefore, pass Statutes for any purpose that may not be immediately and also ultimately desirable. TheB ill is, of course, a grant of power; and I am not disputing the right of the AttornevGeneral to introduce the legislation, but merely discussing its expediency and wisdom.

133,Mr Jensen (Bass,"Assistant M i ntlie commencement of the war. It contains no important principles. Its object is really to fill up gaps that have been discovered, the most important of these being the fixing of the application of the Army Act. Under section 55 of the principal Act, when Defence Forces of the Commonwealth are called out for active service the Army Act applies, but the application of that Act is somewhat vague. It is desired to make it more definite and to put it beyond doubt'that it applies both within and without the limits of the Commonwealth. An amendment of the existing law in that respect is therefore embodied in this Bill. At the beginning of this session, we passed an Amending Defence Bill, which was designed to legalize the raising of Expeditionary Forces. At the outbreak of"" the war the then Government took the necessary action to raise those Forces, but there was really no complete authority in the Defence Act for that action, and an Amending Bill was therefore introduced to legalize it. Unfortunately that Bill, which was introduced at the beginning of the session, was not dated back to the commencement of the war, and therefore it became operative only as from the date on which it was assented to, which was subsequent to the raising of the Expeditionary Force despatched to New Guinea. It is desirable that we should bring these actions of our predecessors within the scope of the law, and this Bill will have that effect. Then again, under the law as it stands, no power is given to surveyors in the Department to enter upon private property to carry out certain necessary surveys. to surveys for acquisition purposes? is sometimes necessary for our surveyors required by law. Under the law as it to enter upon private property in the stands, if it be proved that a member of neighbourhood of defended ports in order the Citizen Forces is dismissed from his to put in certain pegs that will enable employment because of attending drill or our Forces to know exactly the radius a camp of instruction that he is comwithin which they have to operate.

Since cases-that a citizen soldier has been the commencement of the war the Dethrown out of work owing to the action of partment has found it necessary, as an his employer in dismissing him because of act of justice, to adopt a certain course, although it was doubtful whether we had the legal right to do so. For instance, as I mentioned in this House a few days ago, certain men enlisted for active service under assumed names, and stated they were unmarried. After their departure for the front, however, it was discovered that they were married, and the Department has assumed the responsibility of paying for the maintenance of their wives and children a portion of the money due to them. It is contended that under the law as it stands, these men, if they returned to-morrow, could claim a refund of the money so paid unless the authority for which we ask in this Bill be given to us. declarations'? tions, but on ascertaining the true facts, the Department allotted to their wives and children, whom they left behind, a proportion of their pay.

We endorse the action of our predecessors, and commend them for it . We should have done just what they did had we been in power, and we feel sure that they would have similarly honoured our obligations. [12.2] -There is no opposition to the B ill , which is largely a validating measure. It validates among other acts some done by myself. It adds another technical arm to the Defence Porce, and makes further detailed provisions which, T think, on the whole are wise. time authorities cannot stop to consider whether a necessary action is legal; it must be done at once. That was what we felt when war broke out. During the six weeks that we were in office, we did many things that were not strictly in accordance with the law, nor consonant with the expression of fine sentiment of which we have heard so much lately When war breaks out there is no timeto theorize. The duty of the authorities is to make the country safe, so far as they are able to do so, leaving all political and social obligations to be dealt with afterwards. It is an old maxim that the safety of the State is the highest law. TheB ill validates any informalities and illegalities that may have occurred during The Court the trying period to which I refer. As to the compensation of employees who are unjustly dismissed from their employment for attending d r ill , I am inclined to think Under that the matter is best l e ft to a Court. It is better that a magistrate should determine what compensation shall be paid than that a Minister, Labour or Liberal, whose decisions in many cases would be looked upon by the public as influenced by political or personal considerations,should have the matter l e ft in his hands. Employers who prevent their assistants fro m undergoing training should be severely punished, but the Court must act at its discretion, according to the circumstances. There are cases in whicli the employer is not wholly to blame. vision in clause 7, that the Court may direct that the whole or any part of any penalty recovered from an employer for penalizing an employee for attending training is related to a provision that is already law, which enables the Court to impose I do not think that there penalties for this offence. I would poiat out, however, that an employee may not be injured in any way by an attempt to penalize him or prejudice him in his employment. Yet, notwithstanding, the Court is empowered to direct that the whole or any part of the penalty recovered from his employer may be paid to him.. I think that the clause should be drafted to meet the case in which iii is proved that the employee has been penalized or injured, so that the magistrate may then assess reasonable compensation, and direct tliat it shall be paid out of the penalty recovered from the employer.

145,Mr Glynn (Angas) [12.7],"The prowider power is given than is intended to be given. Section 55 of the principal Act is to be amended by making it apply to troops on active service, whether within or without the limits of the Commonwealth. If I am not mistaken, tlie ImperialA r m y Act of 1881 applies to our troops when they are outside the limits of the Commonwealth only if there is a provision in our local legislation to permit it to do so, or if those troops are serving with Imperial troops. The amendment to which I refer is intended to give the A r m y Act application, whether our troops serving abroad are with the I m perial troops or not, and whether they are within or without the Commonwealth. It is an amendment that is clearly necessary. I understand that Imperial reservists domiciled in Australia are being paid by the Department the difference between the Imperial rates of pay and the Australian rates of pay, but, unfortunately, this practice is not being adopted with regard to Imperial reserve officers. This seems to me exceedingly unjust. that the men receive the same rates of pay as the men of the Australian Forces is that they have become citizens of Australia, and have entered into our -national life, so far as their Imperial obligations will permit, and that consequently they ought to be treated as Australians are treated. to Imperial reserve officers. I know of a case of a second lieutenant who has taken up land in Australia, and has n ; curred obligations in connection with it , but who, now that he has been called away to the front, is being paid only the Imperial rate of pay, although the rank and file of the Imperial reservists receive the Australian rate of pay. under the notice of the Minister. of these cases, but if there were only one, the injustice should be removed. in connection with Imperial reserviststhat they must have resided twelve months in Australia? should be required would be that they are domiciled or settled in Australia. ciled? intention to make his home permanently in Australia would be regarded as domiciled here.
