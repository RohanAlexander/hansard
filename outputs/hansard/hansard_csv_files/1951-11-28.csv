Wednesday, 28 November, 1961. took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. tell the House, if possible before the Par-' such material as it has before it, but liament goes into recess, whether he and the Treasurer have been able to consider the case of the well-known musical society, Musica Viva, and the desirability of giving aid to it in order to enable it to consibility of the Government. tinue its activities? I mentioned this matter on a previous occasion. I trust that the Prime Minister will be able to make a positive announcement in respect of it before the House adjourns for the recess. that I shall be able to make a statement on the matter to which the right honourable 'gentleman has referred, I .cannot definitely undertake to make it within the period he has suggested hut I shall have something to say about it within the nest few days. Minister a question supplementary to one that has just been asked by the Leader of the Opposition' concerning the future of the Musica Viva Society Will the Prime Minister give consideration to the fact that this society is now the only notable group regularly engaged in thc performance of chamber music in the eastern States, and possibly in Australia ? Consequently, if it is allowed to disband, the Australian Broadcasting Commission will probably be obliged to form another such group in order to fulfil its obligation to present balanced musical programmes, and it oould only do so at a considerable cost a lower standard than that maintained by the Musica Viva Society. Wil] the Prime Mmister consult the chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission on this subject and bear in mind the widespread requests for help to be given to this very meritorious group to save it from disintegrating? Leader of the Opposition asked me a similar question, and of course I thoroughly appreciate the interest in .this matter of the honourable member himself. As far as I know, the Government has had no communication from the Musica Viva Society. We therefore have no detailed information of any description about the position of the society, so far as I am aware. I have indicated that the Government will give consideration to I think that it may not be inappropriate to say that the music lovers of this country have themselves some responsibility which is quite independent of the responSocial Services whether he has received any correspondence from the Premier of South Australia in connection with the War Service Homes Bill which the House passed last evening? If so, has any decision been made upon the matters that were raised; and were the replies to the Premier's requests favorable? South Australia would not correspond with me upon such a matter, and I have not received any communication from him about it. He may have communicated with the Government, but I have no knowledge Whether he has done so. I shall have inquiries made into the matter. Minister for Social Services aware thai the Government's direction to the War Service Homes Division to sell all homes occupied by tenants is causing greaf hardship to persons who have occupied these houses, in some instances for periods up to twelve years ? Is he aware that war service homes that were valued and probably at under the contract for sale as far hack as 1931 at £797, and upon which no rebate is at present owing, are now being revalued to be sold in accordance with the Government's direction at £1,774?

Will he also take appropriate action to protect tenants who have taken great care of war service homes fliat they have occupied for long periods? ledge of the particular cases to which the honourable member has referred. The accepted practice in the division is similar to that which is normally followed in ordinary commercial life. I shall be pleased to investigate the matter that the honourable memher has raised and will let him have a reply. Each of these cases is considered on its merits. If the honourable gentleman will furnish further information about the cases that he has in mind, I shall be pleased to examine them. THE PAELIAMENT. ter will doubtless recall that he requested honourable members, who attended the all party meeting that was addressed by Lieutenant-General Sir Horace Robertson, to maintain the strictest secrecy about any of the statements which the Lieutenant-General might make, and that sueh an assurance was given. Does not the right honourable gentleman consider that it is evidence of a most regrettable and disgraceful breach of confidence that any statements, distorted as they are, should appear in a newspaper and be attributed to honourable members who were present at that meeting? able gentleman's question is apparently based upon a statement that has appeared in a newspaper. the honourable member for Corio asked me how it could happen that a statement could he made in a newspaper about a private meeting of memhers of the Parliament. I agree with the opinion of the honourable gentleman that such a happening is deplorable. I think that it was originally suggested by the honourable member for Wilmot that a meeting should be held in order that Lieutenant-General Sir Horace Eobertson could offer views, make a report, and be entirely intimate with members of this Parliament T. myself was asked at a certain --""tap-c whether the meeting was to be open to the press, and I ventured to replyI think with the approval of honourable members-that it was not open to the representatives of the newspapers. I considered that members of this Parliament, who have their own particular responsibilities, would be glad of the opportunity to hear, without any inhibitions, the views of a distinguished serving soldier about this most important campaign in Korea and matters which are associated with it. As honourable members who were present at that meeting-and most of them were-wil l recall, I indicated at once that Lieutenant General Sir Horace Robertson was under no control on this matter, that he was to state his own views, that he was not present to expound any government policy, and that any honourable gentleman who wished to ask him a question would, within the limitations of time, receive an answer from him. The great advantage of such a meeting is that honourable members, who occupy positions of peculiar responsibility, should be able to hear things which are not necessarily matters of public statement. I am perfectly certain that 99 per cent, of the honourable members who were present at that meeting full recognized that fact, and attached value to it. It is a great misfortune that there should be even one honourable member who, in those circumstances, was so little aware of his duty, not to the Government or myself, but to the other members of the Parliament, as to furnish a somewhat sensational and distorted report of a speech which, I am sure all honourable members who are present will agree, was one of the greatest frankness and value. addressed to the Vice-President of thp Executive Council, in his capacity as responsible for the arrangement of the order of the business of the House. Upon what principle, if any, does the honourable gentleman determine the speed with which a private member's motion shall be considered, and whether or not such a motion shall be put to a vote of the House? My question is prompted by the facts that a vital private member's motion upon aborigines was delayed for months and subsequently lapsed and that an impor tant motion upon soil erosion has been",13,Housing

13,Mr Beazley,"My question isdelayed for months and has not yet been voted upon, while a motion, not of comparable importance, of which notice was given only yesterday is to be discussed and voted upon to-day. Is the determining factor not the public importance of a motion but its value for party propaganda purposes? the honourable gentleman is aware that I was appointed only recently to discharge the duty to which he has referred. One of adequately trained and equipped to cope the motions he mentioned was on the notice-paper and was dealt with before 1 assumed this duty. The subject of soil erosion was discussed in the House during a private member's day by the honourable gentleman who placed the motion on the notice-paper. The principle upon which I act is the urgency of a motion, in thc light of Government business. I. asked the Minister for Immigration a question relative to persons who broke the implicit agreement, which is associated with the issue of a passport, by going behind the "" iron curtain "" and to other countries to which the passport was not applicable. The Minister indicated that he was considering methods to overcome that difficulty. Can he now inform me whether he has contrived any means by which the tactics to which I have referred can be circumvented in future? raised this matter with me some time ago and I intimated then that the Government had given some consideration to it. There has been a delay in giving him a precise answer because decisions on such that there is close co-operation between, matters, after discussion with the approthe Navy and the Air Force. priate authorities in Australia, must be conveyed to our officers overseas. I shall ascertain whether before the House adjourns for the Christmas recess, I can give the honourable member a full official statement on the policy that the Government proposes to adopt in the future. This Government, like every other government in the British Commonwealth, recognizes that we must keep uppermost in our minds the right of our fellow citizens to travel freely to all parts of the world, subject only to the requirements of national security. Eussia is increasing its already substantial fleet of submarines and is developing a chain of submarine bases in the Pacificwhich would constitute a grave menace to Australian shipping in the event of war, can the Minister for the Navy and the Minister for Air assure the House that the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force are being, with this type of warfare ? priority of the Royal Australian Navy in the unfortunate event of a third world war would be to engage in anti-submarine protective work. ""With this fact in mind, both the Navy and the Air Force authorities have established a joint anti-submarine school at Nowra,. where officers and men are at present in training. Most of the programme of the Navy is devoted to anti-submarine activities; I think that it would becorrect to say that at least two-thirds of its preparations are directed to that end. I give the honourable member a positive assurance that the Navy and the Air Force are co-operating to the limit of their ability in order to cope with this problem and that our construction programme has been planned to provide for the maximum of anti-submarine preparations. WhilstI have heard that the Communists are establishing anti-submarine bases in Hainan, I have not heard that they are establishing a chain of bases in the Pacific area. However, 1 assure the honourable member that the problem receives constant attention and planation of a question that I addressto the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, I quote the following statement that a farmer has made in a letter to me regarding cornsacks:I wanted a bale and was told I could not get it unless I had 900 acres of wheat in. The letter goes on to say, "" one has to have cornsacks for farms "". I ask the Minister",14,Housing

19,Mr Tuenbull,"B y way of exwhether the supply of cornsacks is adequate for the harvest, whether it is necessary for a farmer to have a certain acreage under crop before he can purchase cornsacks, or whether farmers can ' purchase cornsacks for general farming requirements ? estimates that have been made, I am able to say that there is an adequate supply of cornsacks available for the harvest, nnd I think that there is no doubt that that is so. It is necessary, however, for a person who seeks to buy cornsacks to prove to the satisfaction of the authorities his own need for them whether they are required for wlieat or other grain, or for potatoes or any other valid purpose. 'Die reason is that last year certain people who anticipated shortages of cornsacks, or an increase of prices for them, bought thom for speculative purposes, and hoarded them. This action deprived other people of their needs. The only test that is applied in relation lo the purchase of cornsacks is that a person who requires to purchase tliem shall establish the validity of his need for the number of cornsacks that lie wishes to purchase. That requirement having been complied with, the cornsacks are available for purchase. whether you will take steps to see that answers to questions that are placed on the notice-paper are furnished expeditiously by the departments concerned, and that when the Minister receives the necessary information from a department he will convey it expeditiously to the House. The reason that I ask the question is that some months ago I put a question on the notice-paper, addressed to the Minister for National Development, in relation to the possible abandonment of the Snowy Mountains hydroelectric scheme. No answer has been given to that question up to date, although a number of other questions that I placed on the notice-paper, which required the compilation of a good deal of statistical information, have been answered. It seems that some Ministers take advantage of the fact that they are under no definite time limit in respect of furnishing answers to questions on notice, and leave them until the last day of the session when the required information is supplied. I ask you, Mr Speaker, whether you will take action in respect of this matter ? gentleman is asking me to do something that is completely outside my powers and responsibilities. Ministers are not obliged to answer questions unless they choose to do so. If they choose to answer questions, it is for them to decide when the answers will be given. I know, from my own study of the notice-paper, that some questions have been on it for some considerable time, but that is the responsibility of Ministers. It is not my responsibility, and I quite certainly do not seek any control over ityou, Mr Speaker. A few weeks ago the honourable member for Moore made the excellent suggestion that copies of questions asked upon notice should be distributed from week to week. That procedure, which is now being followed with great success, is of educational benefit to honourable members. In view of that fact, will you consider discussing with the President of the Senate whether he could arrange to have distributed to honourable members questions that are asked upon notice in the Senate? ply with the request that the honourable member has made. the Postmaster-General. On the 27th October, the new premises of the New South Wales Bush Nursing Association's cottage hospital at St. Alban's were opened. Early in October an application was made to the Postmaster-General's Department for the transfer of the telephone from the old premises to the new premises. Up to date no action has been taken on that request.

26,Mr Anthony,"I am notcase to which the honorahle inember has referred, but I shall have inquiries made aud if it is possible to give effect to his request, it will be done. General whether it is a fact that more than 4,500 postal employees have heen dismissed under the Government's scheme to reduce the Public Service by 10,000 employees ? Is it proposed that any additional postal employees shall be sacked under this scheme? Can he inform me what delay has occurred in the installation of new telephone services as a result of the dismissals of linemen and technical staff under the scheme? that, in accordance with the announced policy of the Government, a considerable number of postal employees have been retrenched, the number being 4,500 as the honourable member has said. It is not proposed to increase that number. We have narrowed the number of staff down to those persons who can be gainfully employed in accordance with the materials and resources at our command. The dismissals of staff would not have bad a very great bearing on the delay in the installation of telephones. The moat potent reason for that delay is the shortage of eahle and materials which is not affected by the retrenchment policy. OATS. for Commerce and Agriculture inform the House whether he intends to issue licences for oats to be exported this season ? In view of the shortage of fodder which has been aggravated by the drought and bush fires in Queensland and northern New South Wales, will thc Minister ensure that ample stocks of oats are held before licences for export are issued ? question of the honourable member is "" Yes "". In accordance with customary practice, export licences for oats will be issued this season, but the quantity permitted to be exported will be dependent on the volume of oats harvested and the prospective demand for them. It has not heen the practice to issue licences for the export of oats except after consultation by the oflicers of my department and I with the respective State Ministers for Agriculture and the officers of their departments. During my term of office and, I think, during that of my predecessor, no--"" export permits have been issued which have not had the approval of the State governments which have taken into account the prospective needs of their areas. However, it is not reasonable to expect the grower of oats to hold hit commodity unsold against the contingency that some graziers may .need fodder at a later date. Graziers should protect themselves by making their own purchases of oats if they do not grow them. question which I address to the Prime MinisterI desire to point out that the promoters of entertainments and other public functions held in order to raise funds for charity must pay entertainment tax if their expenses exceed 50 per cent, of the gross proceeds of the function. In view of the increasing cost of presenting entertainments in the country will the Prime Minister consider introducing amending legislation in order to permit a greater percentage of expense to be incurred in the conduct of entertainments for charity without payment of tax. by the honourable member is one of Government policy and is therefore outside the standing order relating to questions. provision in the free medicine formulary of several important life-saving commodities, will the Minister for Health give consideration to providing free cylinders of the life-saving gas oxygen?

As the movement wishes to maintain its ballet and opera groups on a full-time basis, with a view to touring the whole of Australia, including provincial towns and cities, at regular intervals, is ihe Government prepared to grant a reasonable subsidy to it to enable it to achieve this highly desirable objective? 1 have already made in respect of the Musica Viva apply to the National Theatre Movement. I have had the opportunity of receiving certain representations on that matter and I have told the House that the Government will give due consideration to them, but I believe that it would be a grave misfortune for the arts in this country if it were thought that they depended entirely upon government patronage. COAL. Labour and National Service recently said that, as a result of the challenging of the National Security (Coal MiningIndustry Employment) Regulations in the High Court, legislation had been prepared to take' the place of the regulations and that a draft copy of the bill, which has not been presented to this House, has been forwarded to the Government of New South ""Wales with the object of securing the concurrence of that Government in the matter of having complementary legislation enacted by the State Parliament. Has the State Government yet replied to the communication from this Government? Has it rejected the proposed legislation, or does it propose to enact complementary legislation, as it did in 1946? If it has rejected the bill, will the Ministeimake a statement to -the House is not enacted to replace the regulations? questions cannot be answered easily in a few words. Therefore, if the House will give rae the necessary permission, I shall make a statement on the subject at the end of question time. At this stage, all I shall say is that the Government tried to impress the urgency of the matter ou the Government of New South ""Wales, that our draft bill has been communicated to that Government, that we have since been in touch with it by urgent telegram to ask for a reply, and that we have pointed out that the measure that is now before it is substantially in the same form as that whicb was agreed upon between it and ihe Ohifley Government. I shall supply the honorahle member with further details later, but I want to impress upon this House and those interests that are directly affected that this Government has done all that could reasonably be expected of it in order to bring the matter to finality. All that is holding us back at the moment is the absence of a decision by the New South ""Wales Government.

46,Mr Holt (Higgins,"Minister forJames) asked a question in relation to certain projected legislation affecting the coal-mining industry and industrial tribunals that relate to it. The position, briefly, is that the Government is still without any advice from the New South ""Wales Government on the amendments to the Coal Industry Act that it proposed to submit to the Parliament during the current sessional period. Our draft bill was forwarded to the New South Wales Government on the 12th November, that is, more than a fortnight ago. That may not seem to be a very long period, having regard to the relationships that exist between governments. However, the real point is, as 1 3tated in this House last week, and as we pointed out to the New South Wales Government at the time, that this draft bill is substantially in similar terms to a bill remind the House, particularly members agreed in 1949 at the request of the Chifley Government. Honorahle members will recollect that another draft bill dealing with some of the matters with which it is proposed to deal in the measure that we are anxious to bring before this House was submitted to the New South Wales Government in March last. 1 pointed out that that matter was one of urgency, and I am certain that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) will recall certain arguments that he advanced in one of our courts to the effect that amendments of the arbitration legislation in 1947 had brought into question the validity of decisions made by the Coal Industrv Tribunal since that time. In our legislation we hope to remedy that position as well as other matters that were covered by that legislation. Notwithstanding our efforts to get a reply from the New South Wales Government, we have no record of having received a reply since March of this year. We do, however, hold a letter signed on behalf of the Premier of New South Wales on the 17th July, in which he inquired what we proposed to do in relation to the 1949 bill which was agreed upon between his Government and the Ohifley Government. the same form as the one that we now wish to introduce. [94] for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) says ""substantially"" in an inquiring tone; but I believe that the Government is entitled at least to know what the views of the New South Wales Government are. We have been waiting virtually since March of this year to ascertain what that Government proposes to do. Honourable members will appreciate that, in these circumstances, the New South Wales Government must accept the responsibility for the present delays that have occurred in Sydney. I repeat that the issues involved in the bill that the Government now desires to introduce have been under the notice of the New South Wales Government for a long time. I of the Opposition, that if the bill that we desire to introduce now is not passed this session, the craft unions in the coal mining industry will return to the jurisdiction of normal arbitration tribunals. Officials and members of the craft unions concerned must realize that if this happens the fault cannot be attributed to the Australian Government. They should not be misled by statements that have heen made by certain officials of the miners' federation in relation to the bill. The provisions of the bill that relate to the constitution of the local coal authorities are in terms that were agreed upon in the discussions with the unions concerned. The draft b ill I emphasize this point because I understand that a certain amount of propaganda on the part of spokesmen of the miners' federation has suggested that the contrary is the case-doe s not require the Coal Industry Tribunal to be guided by decisions of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. That matter was discussed earlier with them. Their opposition was noted, and in the draft bill that we submitted to the New South Wales Government that matter was taken into account and no provision was made that the Coal Industry Tribunal should necessarily be guided by decisions of the court. to amend the 1947 Coal Industry Bill ?",19,National Theatre

Mr Gallagher acts as the Coal Industry Tribunali n relation to the miners' federation and also in relation to certain disputes in New South Wales that affect the craft unions; but outside that State he acts under regulations as the chairman of a board of reference. The purpose of our bill is to enable him to act as the C'oal Industry Tribunali n relation to not only the miners' federation but also the craft unions. That is the principal purpose of the bill, and I gather tliat the opposition that is being maintained by the miners' federation and also, in consequence, by the New South Wales Government-althoug h because we have not received any advice from that Government-is due to the fact that our legislation provides that decisions of the Coal Industry Tribunal shall be enforceable in the same way as are decisions of conciliation commissioners. think that he should make statements that are based on pure supposition? that it is likely that this House w ill rise this week.

They acquired half-control of station 2WL Wollongong measure of ownership, falling short of control ownership, in 2HR Hunter River, 2LT Lithgow, 2PK Parkes, and 3AW Melbourne. I invite honourable members to examine the background of those transactions. The Bartholomew interests are extremely wealthy London interests, although the source of their wealth continues to be a little obscure. They publish, in the main, two London newspapers and own two companies the Daily Mirror and the Sunday Pictorial. Those, two companies are interlocked by 23 per cent, shareholding, one in the other. Each company has seven directors. Four of the directors in each of those two companies are common to both companies. They are Mr prietary Limited is completely under the Bartholomew, Mr King, Mr Coope and Mr Cooke. Those two groups, the Daily Mirror and the Sunday Pictorial, formed a dummy company which was known as Australasian Nominees Limited, and, through it, they bought the Argus newspaper. The Argus is controlled by a board of four, consisting of Mr known as the Macquarie network. Bartholomew, who is the head of the Bartholomew group, Mr Elliott, who is a inember of the board of the Sunday Pictorial in London, Mr Patience, a Sydney solicitor, and one other. But I direct attention to the fact that, in the report of the chairman of the Argus organization on the 25th August, 1949, Mr Elliott and Mr Patience described as representing the London interests. Three of the four members of the board are thus representatives of the Batholomew group. That group exercises complete control, first, because it owns all the ordinary shares and, secondly, because three of the four board members are its nominees. The next event was the formation of another holding company known as able member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde M.P.A. Productions Proprietary Limited. Cameron) must remain silent. I am not It is not clear what, the initials M.P.A. going to allow the debate to degenerate represent, but they are generally thought into a display of unseemly levity.

Mr Wentworth. imagine that, in all probability, this paper was no longer a normal commercial and some substantial venture because the Argus, instead of showing profits, had been sustaining losses which last year alone amounted to> £122,000. This venture is now being bolstered up with moneys that are being fed to it by the Bartholomew group in London through its subsidiary, M.P.A. Productions Proprietary Limited. There are five directors of the subsidiaryBartholomew; Cooke, who is one of the directors common to both of the London firms; Patience, the Sydney solicitor who has been described officially as a representative of the London interests; a Mr Mclntyre, whom I understand to be a partner of Mr Patience; and an accountant who holds no substantial interest. Thus, M.P.A. Productions Prodomination of the Bartholomew interests. As I have said, this company on the 9th August, 1951, bought complete ownership rights of Broadcasting Associates Limited and Macquarie Properties Limited for £287,000. By that means it obtained control of the whole of what is The Macquarie network consists, not only of stations that I have named as being in its ownership, but also of a number of ' other co-operating stations that are bound more or less closely to it, perhaps with some freedom of policy and some freedom to break away, but were officially generally under the control of the network because of the nature of their commercial association. Those other stations are, 2MW Murwillumbah, 3CV Maryborough, 4BH Brisbane, 4BU Bundaberg, 4GY Gympie, 6IX Perth, 6MD Merriden, 6WB Katanning, 7HO Hobart and 7LA Launceston.

76,Mr Wentwoeth,"That is the concept which differentiates the system of empire from the colonial system that preceded it. I believe that if we do not stand firm and stop this transaction from being completed we shall sooner or later have a return to that old colonialism. This is not a question of whether or not there should be any investment in our economy by Great Britain or other countries. Indeed, generally speaking, we wish to have such investment, and would encourage it. But this matter has nothing to do with the general subject of investment. Anything which touches public opinion and the way in 'which it is expressed should be sacrosanct from outside interference in the same way as the ballot-box should be sacrosanct from manipulation. We cannot brook any interference with public opinion even though we wish to encourage British investment in our general commercial life. The reason is that our general commercial life is set in the frame of public opinion so that we must avoid any interference with public opinion by overseas or foreign interests. I have said "" overseas interests "", and in this case they are British interests, but let this House take warning lest foreign interests, in the proper sense of the term, follow up a move such as this. I do not like to remind the House of what has happened in other countries and in other times, but I do remind it that the fall of Erance, and the rotting of the soul of France, were due to the fact that Nazi and Communist agencies gained control of the Parisian press in the years before the last war. allowed to happen in Australia, and the time to stop it is now. This Parliament has a direct responsibility in relation to radio broadcasting, and the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) will forgive me if I quote certain words that he uttered in this chamber on the 2nd June, 1942. According to Hansard, volume 171, at page 1879, he saidBroadcasting is such an all-pervading agency that, in its effects for good or ill , it cannot he compared with the daily press. People may refuse to huy a newspaper, or may read only portions of it , and then throw it away. But broadcasting enters right into the centre of the family. A wireless station can send its message, into the domestic hearth, and i>vcry member of the family will hear it . Mr Wentworth. That is one of the reasons why we should pay to the control of radio even greater attention than we do to the control of newspapers. Another reason is that every radio channel is, in its way, a monopoly, and we should scrutinize such monopolies with particular care. The third and overwhelming reason is that this Parliament has a constitutional power and a constitutional responsibility in relation to radio broadcasting. We have no such power in respect of the penetration of the Australian press by foreign or overseas interests. That is a matter for the States and not for us. But control of broadcasting is committed to the charge of this Parliament. What powers have we in relation to it? Section 49 of the Australian Broadcasting Act gives to the Minister disciplinary powers of suspending, revoking or cancelling any licence for a commercial broadcasting station, when there has been a breach of the act or when he considers it advisable in the public interest to take such action. It may well be that the transactions that I have ref erred to do constitute a breach of the act. That is a debatable point, and a matter on which honourable members may form their own opinions. Quite apart from the question whether the transactions constitute a breach of the act, the Minister has power and responsibility to act if it is in the public interest for him to do so. In these matters it is overwhelmingly in the public interest and in the interests of the Australian nation That kind of thing must not he for him to act. It is true that section 6K of the act gives to the Australian Broadcasting Control Board the right to advise the Minister, but the Minister is not in any way dependent on this advice. He is quite free to act whether the board advises him or not. In this case there are two reasons why the board is perhaps a little reluctant to give advice. The first is an incidental reason. One of the members of the board, who was appointed by the previous Labour Government, was Mr Clive Ogilvy. He has just recently retired from the board to take over the position of managing director of the Macquarie broadcasting interests and is, perhaps, the man most intimately concerned in this whole transaction. The board may well feel some reluctance to intervene in the affairs of their late colleague. That, however, is a minor reason. The more fundamental reason is that in a matter such as this is the decision should not be made hy any arbitrary body or any board without reference to the people's representatives in this Parliament. In a major matter such as this is the only people who should determine it are the members of this House and of the Senate, to whom is committed the charge of protecting and fostering the interests of the people. An important principle like this should not be left for decision by any board, howover unbiased it may be. The decision rests with us in this Parliament. If we pass this motion we shall show to these people that Australia means business. It will then be for the Minister to negotiate cannot be allowed to remain.

Thirdly, I have used the word power of this Parliament. We want him "" Australian "". By"" Australian "" . I mean to know also this Parliament's opinion of a person who is a bona fide resident in what is really in the public interest. I do the Australian community and, of course, not believe that the large and arbitrary that includes any British person who powers that are reposed in the Minister comes here with the intention of living by the Australian Broadcasting Act, permanently amongst us. I say these which was passed in 1942, should in fact, things as one whose family conbe exercised by the Minister without an nexion with Australia is as long expression of opinion from the Parliaas that of any honourable member of ment. In fact, it might well be that this House. In the interests of Great whatever is done in this matter could best Britain and in our own interests we must be done by statute. In the meantime, preserve the identity of the Australian let there be negotiations and let there be community. We should not permit given to those people a warning that this interference in our internal affairs any House and the Australian people mean more than a daughter brooks her motherbusiness and will not tolerate what they in-law's interference in the domestic are proposing to do. I should support an amendment to the act, if any should be brought down, to curtail the arbitrary powers of the Minister, because I do not believe that they should be exercised without the concurrence of both Houses of the Parliament. Nor do I believe that the commercial broadcasting stations should be left without any security of tenure, as they are now, or that they should be dependent on the whim of the Minister of the day. L believe that we require to amend the. act to give them security of tenure and to make certain that that security of tenure is not interrupted except by a vote of both Houses of the Parliament. That is a problem for the future-perhap s for next session. But the present position must not be allowed to flow under the bridge indefinitely. Notice must be served now upon these people by this Honourable members will notice that I",24,Opposition Members A British To Return Even By The Back Door Just
77,Mr Speaker,"Order! The honorHouse that what they have done is antimanagement of her house. We want to have the closest possible ties with Great Britain, but this action of the Bartholomew interests is designed not to strengthen but to sever those ties. We do not want them to be severed. We are loyal to Great Britain and the Empire and that loyalty can best be expressed by us as Australians with our Australian identity. The glory of Great Britain is certainly a glory of the past. Whether it be a glory of the future only time can tell. Looking to the past, we share with pride those traditions of British glory. For the future, it may well be that British glory will lie in the British nations overseas. It may well he that we shall take up the running just as a son will take up the running from his parents. WhatI wish to say may, perhaps, best be summarized by quoting two lines that were written some time ago by my great-grandfather, who expressed a wish thatMay Australasia float with flag unfurled, A new Britannia in another world. second the motion of the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) very eagerly because the matter before the House is of tremendous importance. The acquisition of a large network of Australian commercial broadcasting stations and the purchase of the interests of the Argus and Australasian Newspapers Limited must occasion some considerable concern to those who have given any real thought to it. There are extremely serious if not sinister, implications in this far-reaching transaction. There have been moves connected with it which, to say the least, are highly suspect. The action which has been taken by the overseas interests concerned constitutes as great a threat to honourable members of the Opposition or sections of them, as it does to honourable members on this side of the House. This huge combination of major newspaper and radio organizations constitutes a threat to the existence of a free Australia and, for that reason, transcends party politics and personal issues. It is a tremendous propaganda medium in the making. mind. If subtly applied, it follows a long-range plan. Honourable members on both sides of the House should view this huge monopoly of newspapers and broadeasting stations as a threat to the freedom of this country. When I first raised this subject in the House by way of a question to the Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony), the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) piously asked what objection there was to British capital coming into this country. The same question was asked from the Opposition side of the House to-day. But let us examine the position closely and find out just how British this alleged British capital is. M.P.A. Productions Proprietary Limited is a company which was incorporated in Victoria, in 1949. Its 866,500 shares are held equally by or on behalf of Daily Mirror Newspapers Limited and Sunday Pictorial Newspapers Limited, two public companies which are registered in England. M.P.A. Productions Proprietary Limited has purchased the whole of the interests of the Denison Estates Proprietary Limited including the vast Macquarie radio network and other radio interests. Attempts are also being made to take over the Svdney Sun and attempts have been made to purchase other newspapers in this country. This infiltration of Bartholomew interests into a vast section of the Australian press and commercial broadcasting bodes evil for the Australian way of life. MrH . G. Bartholomew, chairman of the Daily Mirror group of interests, is vice-chairman of M.P.A Productions Proprietary Limited, the company that now controls the Argus newspaper and the Macquarie network and other radio interests. Several other directors are common to both organizations. No doubt honourable members will recall some of the articles and cartoons that appeared in the Daily Mirror during 1941 and 1942, which incited discontent and rebellion against the war effort. One cartoon depicted a distressed shipwrecked .seaman on a raft in mid-ocean. The caption to the cartoon read, "" The price of petrol has gone up a penny "".

78,Mr Kekwick (Bass) [3.48],"Ienable oil companies to make bigger profits. This cartoon was the culmination of many similar scurrilous cartoons and articles. It was the culmination of a spate of anti-British and anti-war effort people who have taken over the Melbourne propaganda. Mr BE. G. Bartholomew, who controlled the newspaper which published those cartoons and articles, now has a controlling interest in newspapers and radio stations in Australia. The cartoon to which I have referred was the subject of a question which was asked in the House of Commons. At page 1,666 of volume 378 of the Parliamentary Debates of the Mouse of Commons, Mr Woman's World, Australian Farm and Spens is reported to have addressed a question to the then Home Secretary, Mr Herbert Morrison, in which he asked whether it was considered that such propaganda was calculated to discourage seamen and all classes of readers from serving the country in its time of need. He certainly thought so and requested preventive Morrison, who was a Labour member of the British Parliament, stated that the cartoon was only one example, but a particularly evil one, of the policy and methods of a newspaper intent on exploiting the appetite for sensation, and with reckless indifference to the national interest and prejudicial effect on the war effort. The Daily Mirror had repeatedly published sourrillous misrepresentations, distorted and exaggerated statements and irresponsible generalization. He then said that such insidious attacks were inexcusable and that they created a spirit of despair and defeatism. Mr Morrison further said that the Daily Mirror had already been warned officially. Later, during the debate that followed. Mr Morrison said that certain articles in the Daily Mirror had caused British army authorities grave concern as they co-operating stations concerned in this were calculated to undermine confidence transaction. Therefore it will be seen and discipline. He then expressed that almost the entire broadcasting systhe view that reasonable criticism tem of Australia is involved in this plot. on specific points was one thing, hut general violent denunciations manifestly tending to undermine the army are 3BA Ballarat, 3BO Bendigo, 3MA and depress the whole population was Mildura, another.

Yet these are the Argus and Australasian. These are the people who have acquired the Macquarie radio network. These are the people who were negotiating to take over the Sydney Sun. In assuming control of the Argus and Australiasian they have also taken over its subsidiaries. Those subsidiaries are the Australian Post, the Argus War Beport, the Australian Turf Register, Home and Your Garden. All these newspapers are now exposed to the threat of the same evil influence that pervaded Great Britain during the last war. The same persons who are interested in those newspapers have now acquired tbe huge Macquarie broadcasting network, action. Mr Herbert ancl other radio stations, and I propose to give a list of the stations that are concerned so that honorahle members opposite can take stock of the position. It has been said that the notorious Hearst press of the United States is closely tied up with the Bartholomew interests. Repeated questions asked of Mr Morrison in the House of Commons failed to elicit a denial of that fact. I shall now detail the broadcasting stations that are involved in the acquisitions of this company in Australia. The honourable member for Mackellar gave the House a list of the radio stations directly concerned. I propose to give a list of the broadcasting stations that co-operate with the Macquarie direct network. These stations broadcast the Macquarie programme as and when directed and are 'known officially as co-operating stations. There are 21 direct stations and 44 The co-operating stations in Yictoria 3SR Shepparton, 3WB The New South Wales co-operating The stations are 2AD Armidale, 2KM 2AY Albury, 2GN Goulburn, 2TM Tamworth, 2MO Gunnedah, 2BS Bathurst, 2DU Dubbo, 2BH Broken Hill, 2QN Deniliquin, 2GI"" Grafton, 2BE Bega, 2RG Griffith, 2HD Newcastle and 2XL Cooma. In Queensland the co-operating stations are 4CA Cairns, 4BL Charleville, 4LG Longreach, 4MK Mackay, 4MB Maryborough, 4EO Rockhampton, 4GR Toowoomba, 4ZR Roma, 4WK Warwick, 4TO Townsville and 4AY Ayr. I am glad to say that there are no cooperating stations in South Australia. In Western Australia, the stations that co-operate with the direct stations of the Macquarie network are 6AM Northam, 6GE Geraldton, 6KG Kalgoorlie, 6TZ Dardanup and 6CI Collie. In Tasmania the co-operating stations are 7BTJ Burnie, 7AD Devonport, 7DY Derby and 7QT Queenstown. That is a very impressive list of radio stations and indicates the widespread nature of the network that may be influenced hy the Bartholomew interests. It must be remembered that all these cooperating stations work in conjunction with the 21 direct radio stations and are dispersed throughout the States of Australia. It will be realized how powerful a weapon has been forged when the words of the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) about the effectiveness of radio are considered. He saidTlie all-pervading power of radio to penetrate the public mind is beyond all other forms of propaganda. In the light of the record of the Daily Mirror during war-time in England, honourable members should ask themselves for what purpose this great network has been built up in Australia? that the honourable member has mentioned broadcast John Henry Austral every day. that they do broadcast programmes of entertainment. Naturally they would do so if they wanted to earn income; but I suggest that this radio network eould be used as a powerful medium for the spread of propaganda in the same way as the DaUy Mirror was used in Great Britain. It is not in the public intemst for any organization to have control of such a vast radio network and of so many newspaper channels. The record of the Bartholomew interests iii Great Britain is decidedly unBritish and it is most likely that their record in Australia will be decidedly iinAaistralian. This House has a duty to see that such a great medium for the dissemination of news and propaganda should not be in the hands of any person or organization outside Australia. Eveni f an organization such as this were in the hands of an Australian we should ensure that he had resided here for some considerable time and that a suitable check had been made of liis bona fides. The broadcasting medium is too influential to be in the hands of those who might prove to lie disloyal to Australia and its interests. Opposition) [4.4] -This is one of the most extraordinary motions ever to be put before the Parliament. A perusal of the motion will show that it has nothing to do with the Bartholomew interests. The honourable member for Bass( Mr Kekwick) has realized the force of the argument that he knows will he advanced against it. The motion is anti-British and is directed against the investment of British capital in Australia. Therefore, the honourable member for Bass has argued that the Bartholomew interests have proved to be un-British. But the motion relates not to the Bartholomew organization, but to any British investor. It refers to "" any person not an Australian It covers investment in the form of either direct ownership and control of broadcasting companies or substantial shareholdings in such companies or groups of companies. If the Times of London wanted to have interests of that kind in this country, this motion would apply to it. applyto any British organization that wanted to invest capital in an Australian commercial broadcasting station, irrespective of whether the organization was approved by the honourable member for Bass.",27,Opposition Members A British To Return Even By The Back Door Just

83,Dr. Evatt,"The motion wouldThe real purpose of the motion is concealed. Why do the proposer and seconder object to the investment of British capital in this form of Australian enterprise? They have not objected to the investment of British capital in Australian shipping and airline companies, which render services that are vital to the nation. It is well known that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited is controlled largely by British shipping interests. Honourable gentlemen opposite do not object to that form of investment, but they object to British investment in Australian commercial broadcasting companies. The reason for the objection was disclosed by the honourable member for Bass, who does not object to those organizations being used for propaganda purposes if the propaganda is in his favour. He does not object to chains or groups of newspapers when they are opposed to the Australian Labour movement, but he takes the view that, if one newspaper proceeds to give the Labour party a fair deal, it should he dealt with, although not by law. If these overseas investors are breaking the law of the land, let the Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony) enforce the law. The object of this motion is to alter the law retrospectively. The Bartholomew organization, rightly or wrongly, has bought shareholdings in Australian companies. Does the Government propose to rip up the documents in relation to those transactions? There is uo answer to that question. The Government would not dare, and probably has not the constitutional power, to do so, even though it would like to do it. by the principle that was enunciated by the Postmaster-General and we apply it in future"", the Government has adopted the circuitous device of a private member's motion, the purpose of which is to prevent the utterance in Australia of any political opinions of which it does not approve. That is why I say that this is a most improper motion. Government members orable members on my right to give a fair hearing to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt). If they are not prepared to do so, I shall have to take action against them. I do not want to do that, because Christmas is coming. what is involved in this preposterous motion. It is not limited to the Bartholomew interests. It applies to any British investors, even to those who would be considered to be desirable from every point of view. Broadly speaking, and subject to one condition that I shall mention, the policy of Australian governments, both Commonwealth and State, -should be, and always has been, to encourage British investment in this country. The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) referred to a very distinguished Australian in the person of his great-grandfather, who founded an Australian, newspaper. I venture to suggest that the capital that was put into that newspaper was British capital, because the honourable member's great-grandfather brought British capital to this country. The figures that show the degree to which capital from overseas has been invested in this country are very impressive. At the 30th June, a total of £337,900,000 was invested in Australia by other countries. United Kingdom shareholdings in Australian companies were £88,400,000. Inter-company accounts owned by Australian subsidiary companies to parent companies in the United Kingdom, which represent British capital invested here, amounted to Instead of saying, "" We stand £36,300,000. The assets of Australian branches of United Kingdom companies were of the value of £127,000,000. The total United Kingdom investment in Australia amounted to no less than £251,700,000. The United States of America had a total investment of £48,200,000, and other countries, including Holland, of £33,000,000. The aggregate of the capital invested in Australia at that date by other countries was no less than £337,900,000. Between 1947 and 1950, the paid-up capital in Australian interjecting, companies held by shareholders in the United Kingdom increased from £64,300,000 to £88,400,000, that held by shareholders in New Zealand increased",29,Opposition Members A British To Return Even By The Back Door Just
84,Mr Speaker,Order! I ask hon,30,Opposition Members A British To Return Even By The Back Door Just
85,Dr. Evatt,"Let rne examine closelyfrom £9,800,000 to £10,100,000, that held by shareholders in Canada remained at. £3,500,000, and that held by shareholders in the United States of America increased from £22,000,000 to £28,700,000. The aggregate increased from £105,400,000 to £137,600,000. The reason for the increase is. that, when the war ended,, this country sought capital, investment from overseas. The policy of the Chifley Government was to attract to Australia capital from the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The then Opposition approved of that policy. Because it was considered that during the war years there' had been a lack^of capital investment in Australia, capital investment from overseas was encouraged, so much so that we made an agreement with the United Kingdom for the avoidance of unfair double taxation. The relevant bill was presented to the Parliament and was agreed to unanimously. Its object was to encourage investment in Australia from the United Kingdom. Investment by United Kingdom citizens or companies in Australian enterprises is welcomed, subject only to the condition that the people of Australia shall be protected by-law against the possibility of exploitation by unfair trade practices or by monopoly practices. That should apply to all capital that is embarked in this country whether it is overseas, or Australian, capital. Subject to that condition, it is a help to Australia to have overseas capital. that are expensive must be supported by adequate capital. this proposal is revealed when we examine anologous enterprises. I refer to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, which is one of the two airline companies terests in this country. British capital is indirectly embarked in that company, and, to a large degree, it is contributed by British shipping companies. There is no objection to it on that score; but the Parliament controls the operations of airline services and under the general law it deals with any exploitation of the people through such services. Dutch, British and American capital is invested in oil companies in this country. What objection can there he to such investments? Dr. Evatt. That capital is of valueto the country so long as the Parliament protects the community against the unfair employment of it. The honourable member fbr Mackellar referred to the radio as a medium of information or propaganda. What are the film interests in this country ? Surely, they are more decidedly propaganda, media than are radio broadcasting organizations. What is the true origin of the capital that is invested in the Australian film industry? It is true that we have Australian companies, but they are representatives of overseas companies. Again, the same principle applies. There is no objection to the investment of overseas capital in that way so long as the laws of the country prevent it from being used unfairly. Subject to that condition, the investment of overseas capital should be encouraged. The late Mr Chifley, when his Government was in office, encouraged the establishment of hundreds of enterprises in this country,, especially from Great Britain and the United States of America. I refer, for instance, to. the Courtauld organization. ( Mr Bowden) -Order! The right honourable gentleman is getting away from the terms of the motion, which readsThat, in the opinion of this House, it is undesirable that any person not an Australian Undertakings should have any substantial measure of ownership or control over any Australian commercial broadcasting station,, whether such ownerThe sham of ship or control be exercisable directly or indirectly. The motion does not referto general investment of overseas capital. Substantial there is a recognized practice under which overseas capital is encouraged to come to this country; and, no doubt, under that practice these particular capital investments took place. In respect of radio broadcasting companies, such capital was encouraged to come here, in a sense, at the general invitation of the Government just as the Chifley Government, in 1946, encouraged the investment of overseas capital in Australia. The Parliament is entitled to control the employment of capital in the country. It makes laws on how it should be used.",30,Opposition Members A British To Return Even By The Back Door Just
86,Mr Acting Deputy Speaker,,31,Opposition Members A British To Return Even By The Back Door Just
87,With Great In,"Dr. EVATT I am pointing out thatThat practice should not be abused. Subject to that consideration, overseas capital should be encouraged. However, the motion before the Chair is not designed to uphold that principle. The motion is not genuine. It attempts to rip open and destroy a particular transaction that has been completed and as a result of which new rights have been acquired. honourable gentleman know that? of those who have engaged in research in respect of this matter, Apparently, the transaction has been completed. That being so, it would be completely unjust and improper to interfere with it. Such interference would constitute a complete repudiation of a transaction that has already been entered into and is past and done with. The real object of the honourable member who submitted the motion and of the honourable member who seconded it is to frustrate the establishment of broadcasting interests in this country that might give a fair deal to the Labour movement. In deed, supporters of the Government wish to establish a monopoly of propaganda for the cause in which they believe. They are not entitled to succeed in that respect. At present, during general election campaigns and at other periods they are used to conditions under which radio broadcasting stations give to their political broadcasts a colour adverse to the Labour movement. They are not used to having propaganda dished out to them. is to ensure a greater measure of protection for Australian interests. protect the precious political interests of the Government parties, and the honourable member knows that to be so. I ask the House to examine t.he motion carefully. Honourable members opposite do not object to British capital. Indeed, they would welcome British capital in this instance if they thought that the new interests would ensure that propaganda would go their way. Why do they fear this investment of British capital? The fact is that the same interests already control the Melbourne Argus. That newspaper has given a fair deal in its news and editorial columns tp the Labour movement. Honourable members opposite do not like that. Honourable members interjecting, -Order! If honourable members do not maintain silence, I shall take action to ensure that they shall do so. ' I have taken the word Acting Deputy Speaker, shows that Government supporters can dish it out but not take it. The House should reject the motion, Honourable members who read it will see that it is directed against British interests of a particular character. The proposition that it conveys is completely untenable from the standpoint of the Parliament. Therefore, it should be rejected. ister) -[4.22] -The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has worked up what I must describe as a synthetic passion on this matter. The truth-and it has already clearly appeared from the other side pf the House--is that the Opposition is entirely beguiled by the fact that the particular group from overseas that has set out to purchase these wireless broadcasting stations is one that runs a newspaper of the most violent Labour kind and, therefore, honourable members opposite believe that this is an attack upon their friends. Of course, I entirely understand their view in that respect. It is a very spirited thing, indeed, to defend one's friends, and I am delighted to think that honorahle members opposite should be doing that; but, in the course of doing so, they have, I need hardly say, completely falsified the issue.

But the problem is not whether there should be overseas investments in Australia. This Government believes that Australia has a shortage of capital expressed in terms of real things. Therefore, it is in favour of the overseas investment of plant and man-power and investments of all kinds that will be productive for Australia. But this motion has nothing to do with that problem.

Of course, the moment I say that, the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard), following the honourable memher for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), says, "" That is easy; let us nationalize them"". It is a pretty rum argument that we should say piously to overseas investors, "" Please bring in your money, and when by its use you have become established in a wireless broadcasting undertaking we shall nationalize your undertaking"".

124,Mr E. James Harrison,"Th erises for the Christmas recess, is an admission of the Government's failure to meet its responsibilities. A bill should have been introduced weeks ago to deal with the position that has arisen. But what has happened ? The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) has submitted a motion which can be construed to indicate that this Parliament is becoming anti-British in its outlook. Obviously, the purpose of the motion is to prohibit a British group from participation in the dissemination of news from broadcasting stations. In my opinion, that is an un-Brit'ish act, which ill-becomes the honourable member for Mackellar, who is the great grandson of a great Britisher. It is unworthy of the support of a man who occupies such a high political office as that of Prime Minister. The Prime Minister said that the Labour party had been beguilled in respect of the attitude of the Argus newspaper, and the honourable member for 13ass stated that this Government did not control the press. statements have only one meaning. The press and the radio, so long as they say the things that suit this Government, may go on their merry way. The transaction regarding the Macquarie network, which was discussed by the honourable member for Bass, was made possible by the lethargy of this Government. The relevant facts are published in the second annual report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. I agree that such transactions should not be allowed. This Government, if it were honest, would introduce legislation to prevent the control of Australian stations by overseas interests. A motion of this kind can be construed only as a motion of censure upon the Postmaster General( Mr Anthony)., who administers the Australian Broadcasting Act. He must have been aware of the tie-up of 44 stations, about which the honourable mem-i ber for Bass complained, and it was his duty, if a danger of syndication of broadthe formation of the United Nations, cast news existed, to direct the attention of the Parliament to the matter. The opportunity for him to do so arose in June, 1950, yet this House has not discussed the matter until to-day. The Government is branded by this motion as an Administration that is capable of adopting any principle that suits its own miserable political ends. Beference has been made to business relations between newspapers and broadcasting stations. A visitor who was not aware of the situation could be excused for concluding that the tie-up between the Argus newspaper and broadcasting stations was unique. The facts are that at the 30th June, 1950, newspaper companies or companies and persons that are substantially interested in newspapers, owned nineteen of the 102 commercial stations throughout Australia and held shares in 25 other stations before the Bartholomew group turned its eyes towards this country. The honourable member for Mackellar is well aware that the tie-up between the newspapers and the broadcasting stations suited the Government and himself during the recent referendum campaign on communism. The Government, and the honourable gentleman, were very pleased to provide the money that Such was required to defray the cost of propaganda broadcasts over the Macquarie network and from other stations. The Postmaster-General must have known of the plans of the Bartholomew group because the arrangements for the purchase of the stations were made some time ago. This motion should not have been introduced at such a late stage of the present parliamentary period. Only one construction can be placed upon it. The purpose is to place in the hands of the Postmaster General a big stick that he may wield during the recess against a company that commercial broadcasting is taking control of a network, in the existence of which this Government acquiesced while it was broadcasting the sort of propaganda that suited the Government. Therefore, the Opposition is not falsifying the position. We are fearful of the results that may flow from this motion. The Postmaster-General knows as well as anybody does that, since Australia's broadcasting systems have been kept closely in touch with world organizations, such as Unesco, that have been established by the United Nations. Imagine what will happen in the councils of the United Nationsi f this motion is adopted. Foreign members of that body will say, "" Here is a member of the British Commonwealth declaring that it does not trust its British brethren to operate commercial broadcasting"". Any honourable member who votes in support of the motion will help to brand this country as a disloyal member of the Empire. The Prime Minister said that broadcasting licences applied for periods of only twelve months. But he knows also that, if the Macquarie network tomorrow broadcast any propaganda that was not in the best interests of the people, the honourable member for Mackellar the Postmaster-General would have the power to take control of the offending stations out of the hands of the owners and operators. The Government would not support the motion in the dying hours of this sessional period, if it had any confidence in the Postmaster-General, unless its ulterior motive is to provide him with an excuse to use his statutory power while the Parliament is in recess in order to achieve its party political ends. ""Why should an anti-British motion be introduced at this stage of the sessions ? The obvious answer is that it will provide the Minister with some measure of justification for the use of his powers under the Australian Broadcasting Act for the advantage of the Government parties. If the danger to Australia is as great as the Prime Minister would have us believe it is, this House should remain in session next week and deal with the matter at once. Instead of passing a disloyal motion, it should enact legislation to deal with the situation. I am not concerned about the welfare of the Bartholomew group or any other group. But I am concerned because, according to that great exponent of free liberalism who spoke earlier, the Government would have no objection if , for instance, that leading Australian Communist, Mr Hughes of the Federated Clerks Union, became the agent for the investment in Australia of the funds of the Bartholomew group or any other 2reat financial organization. That would be all right, according to the Government, because Mr Hughes is an Australian. The Government's support of the motion represents the greatest admission of weakness that any Australian government has ever made. In its view, apparently, an Mr 23. James Harrison. Australian may propagate all sorts of objectional doctrines without interference. The Government had no objection to group control of broadcasting stations and newspapers until the Bartholomew organization came ou the scene. That was because the controllers of broadcasting stations and newspapers generally saw eye to eye with it on political issues. But now there is an intruder on the hunting grounds of the Liberal party, and a counter-attack has been launched by under the direction of the playboy who leads the Government. The action of the Government in lending its support to the motion will be construed throughout the world as the first sign of a schism in the unity of the British Oommonwealth. 1 am astonished that the motion was submitted by a back-bencher. If the words of the Prime, Minister were true-and until now we have not had reason to doubt his truthfulness although his sincerity has been questionable at times-the Government should never have left the task to. a relatively insignificant supporter. As the motion has the backing of the Government, it should have been presented by the Postmaster-General as the Minister who is in charge of broadcasting in Australia. If the Postmaster-General, because of his own lack of courage, has induced a backbencher to provide him with an excuse for exercising restrictive powers over a broadcasting organization that is inimical to the Government, retribution will surely follow in his footsteps. The Australian Broadcasting Act embodies safeguards against the dangers of which the honourable member for Mackellar spoke. The honourable gentleman is not ignorant of that fact. He referred to sections of the act in order to demonstrate the nature of the powers that are reposed in the Postmaster-General. He must have known that his arguments were so shallow as to be incapable of withstanding close examination. He contradicted himself when be declared that a Minister should not be vested with the powers that are specified in the act and that amending legislation should be passed. This resolution will go down in history intend! MrE . JAMESHARRISON certainly go down in history, but it w ill be in a different category from that which is intended by the Government and it3 supporters. It w ill be remembered as the first un-British resolution ever adopted by an Australian parliament. It w ill be classified as a shameful attempt by a weak-kneed Government to instil strength into a Minister so as to enable him to commit an act behind the back of the Parliament that the Government is not game enough to commit on its own behalf. The very wording of the motion is shallow and almost meaningless. According to the arguments of Government supporters, the Government would be prepared to give control of broadcasting to Jack Hughes, but not to Bartholomew. They should be ashamed of themselves. trust many native Australians any more than I would trust the Bartholomew interests. Some of those Australians may be in the ranks of the Government at present. The Government believes that Australia is menaced. Therefore, if it be sincere, its duty is to barricade the door against the threat, not to support an un-British resolution. Let us examine the m'otion. If we did not know thc educational background of the honourable inember for Mackellar, we might be excused for thinking that it had been drafted by some "" m u g "" MrE . JAMESHARRISON motion isThat, in the opinion of tliis House, it is undesirable tlui.t any person not an Australian should have any substantial measure of ownership or control over any Australian broadcasting station, whether such ownership or control be exercisable directly or indirectly. Before the Bartholomew interests ever invested any money in this country, 32 broadcasting stations were tied up with the press of Australia. The Government now contends that the investment of English funds in such a commercial organization is dangerous to the country and represents an intolerable transgression of the British way of life. The motion could have been framed so as to name the Bartholomew group or any other group, Communist or other. T h a t is what we Why did not the honourable member for Mackellar specify the ^Bartholomew It will group ? The reason is that the honourable gentleman and his colleagues know that there is no difference, from an Australian point of view, between the Bartholomew group and the Liberal group. The Liberal group is fighting to retain control of the big financial interests of this country. I never dreamed that, in the first two years of my membership of this Parliament, I should witness an attempt to convert this chamber into an arena for a fight between opposing financial groups for the right to control commercial broadcasting. The honourable member for Mackellar said that the Bartholomew interests were disloyal to the British Commonwealth. If he was sincere, surely he does not suggest that the Postmaster-General should I would not negotiate w i th those interests behind the back of the Parliament! That is not the way to deal with any threat to Australia. The proper way to do so is to introduce -legislation to safeguard the nation from the danger that is supposed to threaten it . The Government should have the courage to introduce legislation' to protect the people against, not only the Bartholomew group, but also any other group that may endanger their well heing. A f t er all that the playboy had to say against such groups the honourable member that he will not be allowed to continue in that vein. withdraw the expression out of respect for your opinion, Mr Speaker. MrE . JAMESHARRISON Mr. Speaker w ill decide what I must do. We have only one Speaker in this chamber, thank goodness. It is a tragedy and a disgrace that pressure groups should be permitted to turn this chamber into a rostrum in order to argue over the control of finances in the British Empire. able member's time has expired. the noisy epithets that sprang so easily to the lips of the honourable member for",35,Opposition Members A British To Return Even By The Back Door Just

132,Mr Osborne (Evans) [4.58],"Al lBlaxland( Mr E. Jamea Harrison); have 1 only, served to give -point to the fact that; this motion is aimed, at a: pressing, novel and' serious danger to the integrity and. freedom of the broadcasting system, of Australia. It is directed to. the danger of a major section of the commercial broadcastingstations of Australia falling; completely under the control of a. group, of individuals who are no.t Australians, who owe no loyalty to Australia and who are resident abroad. Any observer of thepolitical scene in this House sees some extraordinary reversals of form and opinion, but I did not expect, when I first came to this Parliament, to see the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) in the role of the defender of British, capital. That role ill becomes, him because it fits so uncomfortably on his shoulders, particularly in view of his known attitude in thepast and his frequent expressions of it. However, I suppose that he has been forced to some such shift by the evident discomfiture of the Opposition. It is plain that honourable members opposite are seriously divided concerning the correct approach to the matter. The whip is cracked and. the dissident voices are silenced. It is plain that there is no substantial agreement among honourable members opposite on this issue. The only way in which the Leader of the Opposition can justify his defence of British capital in this instance is to suggest that the danger to which this motion directs attention is no greater than the' danger that is inherent in the investment of British capital in any commercial enterprise in Australia, and that is plainly not the case. We need, and we welcome, the investment of British capital in Australia, just as we welcome British citizens who come here to settle. But there is an essential difference between the investment of British capital in ordinary commercial enterprises and its investment in an industry which controls an important information and propaganda. Capital from abroad invested in agricultural enterprises, secondary industries and transport avenues of commercial activity, increases our capacity to expand our indusMr Osborne. tries and enterprises, and puts, us in a better position to extract, thp wealth that lies in ouicountry. We welcome it. Bnt we can control it. We can. dictatethe ter.ms, on which such capital, may be invested and. on which the dividendsmay he taken out, of this country. We can control wages, hours, and conditions of labour, and all other matters pertaining, to theinvestment of either British or foreign capital in Australia. We can control what itr takes, from, us-and generally it seeks to ' take from: us onlyits legitimate dividends. But investment, in a chain of broadcasting stations can take from us, something far more important, than, dividends. It can. take from us the capacity tq inform,, instruct and mould, our pwn. public opinion.. That isa matter which, must remain in Australian hands. Our ideas, oursentiments, even, our habits and aspirations, can be affected by the news^ information and amusement that are conveyed to usthrough the broadcasting services-. More important still, our own and our children's moral and mental development can be very greatly affected by what we hear, broadcast. It is right and necessary to insist that the control of our broadcasting services shall remain in Australian hands. The honorable member for Blaxland objectsto this, motion, which is in general terms, bceause, he claims, it is aimed at -a single group, of investors. He argued, by some process that I could not clearly follow, that general motions of this sort shonld not be supported because they constitute an attack on the activities of a single group of people. The fact is that the activities of the Bartholomew group are impinging for the first time on the Australian broadcasting system. They point for the first time in Australian broadcasting history to the danger of the control of our broadcasting stations passing out of our hands, and to the danger that could follow if we allowed source of Australian our broadcasting stations to be controlled from abroad. The warning is underlined by the fact that the activities of the group elsewhere have come under very services or in ordinary serious criticism, as the honourable member for Bass( Mr Kekwick) has pointed ont. I remind the House of the Labour party's past policy on broadcasting. In 1942, the Australian Broadcasting Bill that it introduced to control the activities of broadcasting stations revealed its policy. no substantial number of stations should fall into the hands of any person or group of persons. That provision is contained in seotion 53 of the act, which reads(1.) A person shall not own, or be in a position to exercise control, either directly or indirectly, of, more than(a) one metropolitan commercial broadcasting station in any State; (6) four metropolitan commercial broadcasting stations in Australia; (c) four commercial broadcasting stations into the hands of a few persons. Section in any one State; or (d) eight commercial broadcasting stations in Australia. The policy of the Labour party, quite clearly revealed in that act, was that there must be a limit to the number of broadcasting stations that may be controlled by any one individual or group of. individuals. The reason for that provision is quite clear. When the Labour party was in office it realized the enormous importance of the broadcasting services to Australian life, and it determined that they should not fall into the hands of a single individual or a group. It wa3 plain to the Labour party at that time that a mere legal restraint in respect of the number of stations that could bs controlled by a single person or group would not prevent effective control being exercised over an even larger number of stations than is permitted by that section. It is very easy to see how that can be done and, in fact, has heen done in-the past. A commercial broadcasting licence can be held by a company the shares of which are ordinarily saleable on the stock markets, and it is very difficult for the -Government, the Minister or anybody in accordance with the Government's else to say at any given moment precisely policy, but is also in accordance with the who exercises the control of that compolicy of the Opposition and with the pany. Another expedient can be, and opinions of the Australian people-that frequently is used. The licence for a the broadcasting services of this country, broadcasting station can be held by a with their enormous capacity to influence holding company, the shares in which Australian opinion and to determine Ausare held by another company, so that tralian' sentiment, shall not be misused. technically the ownership of the station There will be a very grave danger of their -does not vary from year to year although, being misused if they pass into the control the real control of the station being held by the shareholders in the second company, it may be passed from one group to another without the immediate control of the station being legally affected. The measure provided that Consequently, the wording of the section was deliberately made wide. It used these wordsA person shall not own, or be in a position to exercise control, either directly or indirectly. . . . The word "" indirectly "" was used in order that subterfuges of the kind that I have mentioned might be avoided, but it was plain that even that provision of the act was not sufficient to ensnre that control of a number of stations would not fall 49 of the same act therefore gave to the Minister discretion to revoke any licence if he considered it to .be in the public interest that he should do so. It is quite plain, there for, that the policy of the Labour party at that time was to ensure that the broadcastig services of Australia should not fall into the hands of any one individual or group of individuals and the then Minister was given very wide powers to carry out that policy. If the Labour party was at that time determined that monopolistic control of radio stations should not be permitted, how much more important would it have considered the pursuance of that policy if there had been any suggestion that the control of Australian radio stations might pass out of Australian hands, and how much more strongly would it have insisted that that control must remain in Australia? In view of those facts I ask the House to realize that this pseudo defence of British capital, which is a new linefor the Opposition to take, merely indicates that that is the only ground that the Opposition can find on which to oppose this motion. I suggest that the motion is not only of persons resident outside Australia. I paganda is as important as is the broadhave often criticized the Opposition in casting service. che past for what I have described as express its view to-day on an important its narrow nationalistic viewpoint. It is question of principle which is: Should astonishing to me that honourable memAustralian broadcasting stations be hers opposite find themselves able to controlled by Australian citizens who criticize the proponents of this motion have all the responsibility of Australian for what they describe as an anti-British citizenship to guide them, or should they motion. The honourable member for be controlled by a small group of people, Blaxland, moving from one shift to resident abroad, whose only legitimate another to find a ground for opposing interest in Australia is commercial? the motion, which is apparently not inconsistent with his own views and those has suggested that the Government and of his party, was forced, accompanied the Minister have resorted to some subterby sympathetic but meaningless noises fufge in having allowed this motion to be from the honourable member for Watson submitted by a private member.

I have never heard such -private members who spent considerable nonsense advanced in this House before. time and energy in securing the acceptguilty or not guitty? observe that the honourable member for private members are acting at the instance Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), as a member of the Government, because that is not of the parliamentary committee of which so.

135,Mr Haylen (Parkes) [5.15],"One' san extent that they are entitled to a job in Wirth's circus. The honourable member for Mackellar propounded his Australianism, but forgot to tell us that he was educated in England. He spoke of his new-found devotion to Australia, but the circumstance that made him pin the Australian flag to the mast is that some one is trying to "" horn in "" on Australian interests which have had a monopoly of 21 broadcasting stations and 44 subsidiary stations I have not heard any pious platitudes expressed previously about the Macquarie network. Apparently that organization was acceptable to Government supporters. Suddenly, it occurred to them that to be Australian is not to be monopolistic. According to them the ownership of 21 radio stations and 41 associated stations by Australian capital does not subject the Australian community to the danger of subjugation by propaganda. forward from the opposite side of the House are so superficial that a child could see that this debate had been forced on the Government. The honourable member for Evans( Mr diatribe against the Daily Mirror and its Osborne) "" let the cat out of the bag"". He said that it was appropriate that this matter should be raised by private members who have been listening to the current gossip in Sydney and Melbourne. If high drama and a great deal of publicity could have been imparted to this case the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) would have taken the brief himself instead of leaving it to a junior who is usually not even allowed to carry the brief bag. The"" hogwash "" which Government supporters have poured out on the subject of liberty has nothing to do with the case. Opposition members know to their cost how liberty is subverted by propaganda on behalf of the Government. During 1949, British capital was heavily used in order to destroy the Chifley Government because of its banking legislation. Then freely flowed the word from pole to pole. But circumstances alter cases, and since a tiny voice may be raised in a general and democratic way in support of the Labour movement, the new broadcasting and newspaper interests have been accused of subversion. It has been alleged that they wil] create all sorts of dangers and destroy Australian initiative. I have never known the Liberal party to be worried about where capital came from. Its newborn conscience is so much "" poppycock "". The honourable member for Mackellar has presented his argument in a way that is most distasteful to Opposition members because it reeks with insincerity. There is no substance in his proposition that this development represents a threat to Australia. If this organization which will operate 21 broadcasting stations and 44 associated stations occasionally says a word in favour of the Labour party I consider, as a journalist, that it wiil be a result of the balance of fair reporting and nothing else. For the last 50 years the balance of fair reporting has been lost and it is time that it was restored. It is utter nonsense to allege that the acquisition of these interests The arguments put represent a danger to this country. The honourable member for Bass( Mr Kekwick) decided to ignore the question of whether a non-Australian company should be permitted to own a group of broadcasting stations. He launched a associated publications in England. All newspapers, because of the nature of their activities, become involved in court actions at some time or other. The Daily Mirror aroused the British people to action during the war and destroyed the influence of the "" Colonel Blimps"" by means of a rugged form of publicity which helped the war effort. The only real crime of this newspaper organization, in the eyes of the honourable member for Bass, is that it might disseminate Labour propaganda. That prospect is enough to give him a turn. If he examines the situation more carefully he will see that he has been used as a tool and that the r.reuared propaganda that was handed to him did not ring true. The lampooning of the English press in which the honourable member engaged did not assist the House to analyse the facts of this matter. I noticed with regret that there was more than a tinge of anti-semitism in the remarks of Government supporters. Thev did not use the word "" Jew "", but it was obvious that the name "" Bartholomew "" worried them. Why did they not voice their fear that this organization might refuse to become a tool of the Liberal party? It is disgraceful that the Government should have engaged in this propaganda. The Prime Minister presented the most atrocious case. He fished for interjections and refused to deal with the issue. He is quite capable of debating brilliantly, but he was not on the wicket and did not want to; otherwise be would not have permitted the irresponsible honourable memher for Mackellar to submit this motion. Not very much .can be said in rebuttal of the Prime Minister's statements because he merely used an occasional interjection to score the sycophantic laughter ""and giggles which may always be expected to follow his remarks, but which are no indication of the strength of his jokes. When Labour was in office, the present Opposition members endeavoured to have some of the more horrible programmes on B class stations terminated. Screaming, horrific serials, crime and murder stories case, Government supporters revealed the and stupid money quizzes are of no value to the community. Government supporters have asked why the Labour Government did not take action in regard to matters of this nature. In doing so they have paid an eternal compliment to the Opposition by implying that the Australian Labour party is the essence of government and its mistakes will always be theirs. The Labonr Government had a war on its hands and a period of reconstruction followed. Because the Labour party had no money to rebut the "" John Austral"" series of lies, it was defeated at the general elections. Does the Government contend that there is nothing questionable in its complete misuse of the stations and, except for the execution of propaganda medium of B class stations in that way? While the Labour party was able to spend pounds the Government parties were able to spend thousands of pounds on propaganda. The arguments of Government suphave said is correct the Postmasterporters have no validity and they General, by approving this transaction, are .shockingly insincere in asking has permitted subversive influences to the Parliament to debate this matter gain control of a large part of Australia's as if it were some threat to the broadcasting system. If the Postmasternation. Mr Haylen. asked why the Opposition is so suddenly in love with British capital. We have never attempted to keep British .capital out of this country. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) pointed out that we attempted to encourage it here for the development of the country. To state the position in the crudest possible terms, the only reason why honourable members opposite are squealing is that their own racket is being spoiled by the intrusion of newer, and indeed, fairer interests. Consequently, they are capable of making all sorts of scandalous inferences with the object of instilling in the minds of the people the conviction that something dreadful will happen as a result of the transaction that has been mentioned. What could be more dreadful than the programmes of the B class radio stations? Government supporters have, in the past, prated about free enterprise. Here is an opportunity to give full scope to an enterprise in broadcasting which would state both sides of the case. Having presented an appallingly bad unenviable position in which the Postmaster-General has been placed. He had agreed to the acquisition of these broadcasting stations and the matter would never have been raised again had not little private whisper journals published in Sydney canvassed it on behalf of some owners of broadcasting stations who had an axe to grind. Coffee-shop conspirators talked about this matter until it reached the ears of the little group of Liberals who initiated this debate. They then approached the upholder of all spurious causes, the honourable member for Mackellar. As I have said, the Postmaster-General has approved of the transfer of ownership of the the usual formalities, it is an accomplished fact. If this motion is intended to extricate him from the position in which he has placed himself, it indicates that he has failed in his duty and should resign. If what Government supporters Government supporters have General has "" pulled a boner"" it would not be his first. Let him take the consequences. If this motion has been devised as a means of enabling the Postmaster-General to introduce by the back door legislation that will absolve him from blame it is contemptible. When the honourable gentleman was asked a question on this matter in the House recently he skated over it. When a further question was asked on a second occasion he still deGovernment has such a low view of the clined to give the information sought. On the third occasion on which an inquiry was made he finally stated the position. The interests that have bought the stations will not quietly submit to action against them by the Postmaster-General. The only effective way of taking action against them would be by the introduction of legislation in this House. They would take action in the highest courts in the land. would defend them. they would have a splendid advocate. The Postmaster-General has so far taken no part in this debate. No doubt he is completely disgruntled because the honourable member for Mackellar has attempted to take the . whole matter out of his hands. Perhaps our gentle invitations will ultimately bring him into the debate. The honourable gentleman has failed in his duty if the charges of his colleagues have any substance. If they are not true then he has a mere rabble behind him who give him no support. In either event, he should rise forthwith and protest against the presumption of those honourable members who sit behind him. The honourable member for Mackellar has made considerable use of the word "" Australian"" for party political propaganda purposes. The Labour party has been charged in this House with having a rabid Australian approach to all problems. We have been told that our attitude has been unfair and indelicate, and is offensive to people outside this country. We have ahvays adopted an Australian attitude towards all national matters because we have believed that that attitude was for the general benefit of the community. We have been deridedand scorned for our attitude. However, the political new Australians on the Government benches have risen here to-day for the sake of wealth and filthy lucre rather than for patriotic reasons. It has seemed to me that they have been chagrined because somebody has cornered the very lucrative business of propaganda and they have been left lamenting. It is quite horrible to think that the intelligence of the Australian people that it believes that there is a grave threat to them because some organization is attempting to gain control of a broadcasting network. I suggest that the people prefer to hear both sides of any argument. If the Government were to conduct a gallup pollI know that it would not do that because gallup polls are rather unpopular with it at the present timeor if it held a referendum, which are J. HARRISON -Dr. Evatt anathema to it now, it would find that most Australians believe that everybody is entitled to a "" fair go""; that both sides of an argument should be presented. It is also a fact that, when both sides of any political question are put fairly to the electors, the Labour view always prevails because it is invariably the more reasonable. I am sure that the general public believes that the broadcasting stations should be controlled in such a way that both sides of all questions may be put fairly before the people. The honourable member for Mackellar and his supporters are merely "" flogging a dead horse"" in submitting this motion, and it is quite clear that the honourable member himself does not care a tinker's dam Adermann) -Order! The honourable member must not use that word. information, Mr Deputy Speaker, that a tinker's dam is a small receptacle in which the tinker puts his spirits of salts. It has nothing to do with another word which might describe the state hereafter of the Government. The honourable member for Mackellar told us the illustrious story of his grandparents. I agree that that story is illustrious, and in fact is now a part of our history.

It is most extraordinary to find lionorable members on tbe Government side stating that the use of British capital for the development of this country is obnoxious and traitorous. Perhaps honourable members on the Government side, having been chided for their antipathy to British capital, will say that they did not mean us to view the matter in that light, and that they did not like the name Bartholomew "". The honourable member's time has expired. I am happy to support the motion before the House. I support it for reasons that are far removed from those that actuate honourable members opposite. The attitude of the honourable memher for Mackellar (-M.r. Wentworth) reminds me of the old adage that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. The honourable member is to be congratulated because his vigilance has been so keen that he has been able to determine that this important public matter should be aired in a public forum. I am not concerned about the Bartholomew group, as such, or any other financial group. I cannot say whether the principle of gaining control of an organization such as this will be a menace to Australia or will not. However, .1 do say that the whole matter warrants the most serious and careful consideration of this Parliament if the interests of the Australian people are to he protected. There is a definite principle involved which has been completely glossed over by lionorable members opposite. On the battlefield' of international affairs the tongue is mightier than the sword. There is a relentless cold war for ultimate supremacy being waged in the world to-day by opposing ideologies. If the Australian viewpoint is to prevail in Australia we must be aware of all the weapons that may be used against us. We can lose the battle only if we are unaware of or indifferent to those weapons. ber does not suggest that the Bartholomew Middle East, Asia and parts of Europe. group is a Communist organization? speech, if the honourable member will world is very active in having its listen to me, he will know a lot more than he knows now. I believe that if war broke out to-morrow the Government would resume control of our broadcasting system, and of all means of disseminating news. That would be tantamount to closing the stable door after the horse had gone. It would be equivalent to doing too little far too late. Honourable members opposite have said that no government can legislate to protect itself against everything that may do damage to it. I say that every government must take aetion to protect the country against those, whoever they may be, who are inimical to its best interests. It is shameful to hear honourable members opposite, who claim to be so intensely Australian, acquiescing in a principle that could apply equally to some Russian group that wanted to buy our broadcasting 'system, as it does to some British group. Would they agree wholeheartedly with the Russians buying all our radio stations? I want to expose the hollow sham of the alleged Australianism of the Australian Labour party before I finish my speech. It is, said that the founder of the Rothschild family fortunes, Baron Rothschild, once said that, he cared not who occupied the parliamentary benches or who made the laws of the country as long as he controlled the banking system. With how much greater force can that principle apply to-day to the means of publicity. Who controls the means of publicity may be said to be a long way towards controlling the country. The greatest power in the world to-day is the power of propaganda, and the greatest means of wielding this power is broadcasting. The Opposition believes that this great means of propaganda need not necessarily be controlled by Australia. According to the Opposition, anybody can control it for his own interests and profit. No matter how many divisions of soldiers we had they would be of no avail to us if the fibre of our people had been' weakened beforehand by propaganda.

The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) essayed the task of demolishing the arguments that have been advanced by Government supporters. He performed the extraordinary feat of talking for eighteen minutes without mentioning the terms of the motion. He talked of the principle of British investment, ancl of everything except broadcasting. was temporary chairman of the committee during the time that the Leader of the Opposition spoke.

When a pro-Australian policy will not do so, the Labour party abandons it. The Labour party, which claims to be intensely British and which gibes at the Government parties for being, as it alleges, antiBritish, is a party which, when it was in power, scrapped the British passport that gave to Australian citizens the right to travel to any part of the British Empire and substituted for it an Australian passport, with the result that now we have to obtain visas if we want to travel to any part of the Empire other than Great Britain.

One is ashamed to be a member of this Parliament when a group of honourable members put their party political interests before the interests of their country. The nature of the preparations for a war determines the outcome of the war. The education of the people to accept the need to defend themselves is one of the most potent factors in defence preparations. Broadcasting networks can be used for that purpose, but honourable gentlemen opposite are prepared to hand over an Australian broadcasting network to-ther e is no need now for camouflage a socialistic group overseas. It is a socialistic group; otherwise, the Labour party would not support it. Honourable gentlemen opposite do not care what form of propaganda that group will disseminate, provided that it will serve the interests of socialism.

Honourable gentlemen opposite are facetious about this matter, because they cannot conceive that a person may have a mind that rises above party politics. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) said that he would oppose the acquisition of this network by conservative interests. So should I . If we cannot manage our own broadcasting system and disseminate our own news and views, we are becoming demoralized as a nation. I am not concerned about whether this group owns the Melbourne Argus. That newspaper has changed its political tone, but it has reframed the mottoI am in the place where I am demanded of extricate his supporters from the difficonscience to speak the truth, and therefore the truth I speak, impugn it whoso list.

The Argus gives a very decided twist to easily impressed; but to the intelligent the news in order to make it accord with its views. That is done by headlines. In a newspaper that is opposed to the democratic system, the news will he similar toits views. This is a matter that should transcend party politics, but, in the view of some honourable members, it does not. Their minds cannot rise above party politics. The education of the Australian people to an appreciation of the need to make preparations for the defence of this country is a task for our own people. The Australian viewpoint must prevail over viewpoints or ideologies imported, from other parts of the world. I support the motion because I believe that we have a right to challenge the authority of any organization outside this country to disseminate the news and views that are necessary for the education of the minds of the Australian people. and shipping? those issues. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) has referred to banking. During the last two or three years, the Labour party has received a very extensive education in what the CommonAvealth can and cannot do in relation to banking. We are discussing broadcasting now. The attitude of the Labour party is that, because the acquisition of this network by overseas interests will redound to its advantage, it should agree to the acquisition, and that the effect upon Australia is a matter of secondary importance. Sitting suspended from 5.5S to 8 p.m. The motion that the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) has submitted is, in the opinion of the Opposition, sheer nonsense.

166,Mr Calwell,"If supporters of the volume 2 of his Gallipoli Diary.true. of the Executive Council may deny the truth of that statement; but my authority for it is not a Labour man but Mr Eric White, who was publicity officer for the Liberal party at that time. The motion before the Chair threatens to reduce the Parliament almost to a shambles. The honourable member for Evans( Mr Osborne) said that Government back-benchers had forced the Government to sponsor it, that those honourable members had held a pistol at the head of the Government. The Postmaster-General could have refused to sanction the transfer of the Macquarie network to the Bartholomew interests. If he had done so, no need would have arisen for this motion; but he either wanted to be pushed on by those backbenchers or was afraid to take action without the approval of the Parliament. And what will the decision of the Parliament be? It will be merely that of the tory reactionaries, who in this the Twentieth Parliament are, for the time being, in a majority in both chambers and control the destinies of Australia. The honourable member for Mackellar has completely debunked the idea of Cabinet control. The Government is sheltering behind its majority in this House; it is certainly not leading its supporters as it should do. Of course, the honourable member for Mackellar struck a pose. He said that "" Australia means business "", that we must see that "" these overseas interests shall be broken"", and that the Parliament must ensure that "" this wrong shall be righted"", Those are histrionic expressions, and, in uttering them, the honourable member struck a histrionic attitude. Is there anything wrong with British capital? That is the question before the House. The Laboui party says that there 1 is nothing wrong with British, American or any other capital, provided that it is used in Australia for the purpose of earning a fair profit and of advancing Australian interests We object to foreign capital only if it be used to exploit the Australian people. Buti f radio broadcasting is to be dealt with in this way because it is a medium of influencing public opinion, what about films, newspapers and other media that can he utilized for that purpose? I have a haunting suspicion that supporters of the Government would not raise any objection at all if the Rothermere, Beaverbrook or any other British conservative group sought to acquire the interests that the Bartholomew group has acquired. Yet the Labour party is being attacked because a group has bought an interest, not in the whole network, hut in one or two stations. That group has also bought into a newspaper, and may even buy the Sydney Bulletin and a number of other newspapers. Government supporters believe that if there is a fair presentation of the opinions of the Labour party over the broadcasting system and through the newspapers, the days of the Liberal party and of the Australian Country party will be numbered. They have a fear complex. They favour monopoly control provided it is their monopoly. They believe that if somebody else comes in to take a section of control over some forms of opinionforming media, such a group must be stopped. One Government supporter said that we must prevent interference by overseas interests with Australian public opinion. What a grandiloquent phrase! Opinion in this country has always been subject to interference by persons overseas. Some people in other countries have frequently tried to mould opinion in this country to suit their own interests. The great-grandfather of the honorahle member for Mackellar was a man who, in his day, fought against attempts to control opinion in Australia, but his descendant as not so forthright in his Australianism as he proclaims. Everything is satisfactory so long as the opinion is his way, and the interests are serving those that he represents. It would be all right if an Australian group were to establish a company to take over the Denison network. If Sir Malcolm Ritchie, the former federal president of the Liberal party, who is a very wealthy man, were to join with the present federal president of that party, Mr Anderson, who is the chief accountant of the Shell Company of Australia Limited, Government supporters wonld",49,Opposition Members A British To Return Even By The Back Door Just

168,Mr Calwell,"The Vice-Presidentsee nothing wrong with that form of control over radio broadcasting stations. We would be told that the Shell Company of Austraha Limited was either an Australian company or a reputable British company. The truth, of course, is that the Shell Company of Australia Limited is only a section of the AngloDutch Petroleum Company Limited, and when we think of the Shell Company of Australia Limited, we think of the shades of Sir Henri Deterding, Sir Basil Zaharoff and other persons of unhappy memory. The Anglo-Dutch company is a part of a foreign empire. Radio broadcasting in Australia to-day, no matter what any government may say and regardless of the laws that are laid down, is not always controlled by the people who own the broadcasting stations. The honourable member for Paterson( Mr Fairhall) knows perfectly well that Colgate-Palmolive Proprietary Limited, and many other businesses which have big advertising contracts to offer, establish their own business networks and their own extra-legal control. over the operating stations. has taken control over them. The honourable gentleman knows better than, anybody else that one of those groups of companies took a contract away from the Macquarie network because it was not able to use that group of stations in the way that it wished to use them.

It is evident that some members of the Labour party are even more far-sighted than is the honourable memher for Yarra, and I am sure that if they were free to express their opinions, they would ask whether the Government is taking any action to avert this danger, which, apparently, is swiftly moving into the Australian radio [95] broadcasting field.

I shall not read the whole of the letter that I wrote to Mr Patience, but I make it clear to the House, and to the public, that from the commencement of this business, I have indicated to those persons the Government's disapproval of the transaction. I wrote to Mr Patience, as follows:It does not appear from your letter that you are seeking my approval to this transaction, which, indeed, you indicate has already been completed. It was necessary to obtai n m y permission. The letter continued In order to remove any doubt, thiB letter is not to be construed in any way as an approval to the transaction or any part of it . I also desire to make it clear that the Government cannot accept the position which you appear to take that such considerable changes in the structure of Australian commercial broadcasting must be automatically accepted because they are not, or may not be, contrary to any express provision in the Broadcasting Act 1042-1950. Thus, the position of the Government has been clear since I was first notified of the transaction. The law confers certain specific powers upon the Postmaster General, and I remind the House that it was passed during the regime of the Chifley Government. That Government did not enact those provisions just for fun. The act providesThe Minister may, by notice in writing, suspend for such period as is specified in the notice, or revoke and determine, any licence for a commercial broadcasting station on the ground that(b) he considers it advisable in the public interest to do so. Mr Anthony. 1 have informed the purchasers of the stations that their broadcasting licences will not necessarily be renewed automatically merely because they went over the head of the Government in carrying ont the transaction. The position was stated by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) this afternoon when he said that the situation could be dealt with either by Executive act under the terms of the provision that I have quoted or by the enactment of new legislation. The problems that arise from the acquisition of broadcasting stations by The purchase has only just outside interests and by diverse interests have engaged the attention of the Parliament from time to time over a long period. The act provides, in fact, that no organization shall have a controlling interest in more than eight commercial stations in Australia, but all kinds of devices are resorted to in an attempt to overcome that aspect of the law. Mr C-ALWELr. By Australian capitalists! individuals. The principal device is to form a holding company to buy the lease of a station so that, as in this instance, it will not be necessary to apply to the Australian Broadcasting Control Board or the Postmaster-General for a permit. The danger of foreign control of broadcasting stations is recognized by every government in the world. Eestrictions are imposed on transfers of licences and shares for specific reasons. In Australia there is room for only a limited number of broadcasting stations. We have been allocated about 120 frequencies under the international arrangement that governs the establishment of broadcasting stations, and when those frequencies have been allotted it will not be possible to establish a single additional station in this country. Most of the frequencies have been allocated already and most of those that remain are reserved, in major areas of population at any rate, for national stations. Not many new commercial stations can be established. Therefore, the owners of existing stations have a virtual monopoly. They can disseminate without competition any sort of propaganda that they choose to broadcast. It would be most dangerous to allow",52,Opposition Membebs Hear Hear
182,Mr Anthony,"B y all sorts of.an overseas group to gain a monopoly of commercial broadcasting in Australia merely because it bas sufficient money to buy tbe available stations. I shall not discuss the motives of the group that has gained control of the Macquarie network, but I point out that the interests of overseas organizations, whether British or foreign, invariably -diverge, in some respects at any rate, from intended to buy it, I was quite agreeable those of Australia on various important issues. Our interests in general are inclined in one direction, but in relation to certain matters associated with trade, for instance, they are not identical with those of other countries. ""For that very good reason it is necessary that we should -be able to prevent any overseas interests from infiltrating the homes of hundreds of thousands of Australians. No other propaganda medium is so effective as is radio broadcasting. Propaganda from -that source seeps into the house day and night. The average housewife listens to the broadcasts whenever she is at work in the home. She hears all sorts of statements, at least in part, and they have an influence on her mind. The importance of this fact is best -evidenced by the action that was taken by the members of the Opposition when they were in power to ban the "" John Henry Austral"" broadcasts. The Labour Government outlawed all broadcasts that purported to dramatize any current political event. I do not quarrel with that action; I merely point out that the Labour party realized the power of such propaganda. That party considered it to beof such importance as to warrant the enactment of special legislation. But the party that was fearful of that danger is cheerfully prepared now, because it suits its political purposes to do so, to permit -overseas interests to dominate this field of communications. In my opinion-and I have good reasons for expressing it-n o Australian organization, person or company, apart from the Munro group, was given an opportunity to invest in the Macquarie [8.40] -Tw o very important and ennetwork.

I did not carry grudges over from the time when I was a member of the Opposition. The importance of keeping impartial the broadcasting system of Australia is best demonstrated by the Australian Broadcasting Commission.

189,Mr Allan Eraser (Eden,"Monaro)in the speeches of the honourable member for Mackellar and the honourable member who seconded the motion. The real purpose, as distinct from the ostensible purpose, is to use this Parliament as an instrument to aid one powerful outside financial group in its efforts to strangle another powerful outside financial group. The ostensible object set out in the motion is of extreme importance to the Parliament. Placed on its highest level, I define it as an attempt to facilitate the promotion of a truly Australian viewpoint and sentiment and to prevent the perversion of Australian thought and aspirations in the interests of any other country, British or foreign. That, I believe, is a fair statement of the highest interpretation that can be placed on the ostensible object of the motion. Provided that the object is pursued in accordance with democratic concepts and not in a totalitarian way, it should command the support of every member of this Parliament. It is an objective to which the Australian Labour party has always loyally adhered, although honourable members on the other side of the House were not conspicuous champions of it before to-day. ber going to vote for the motion? shall tell the House why I shall not do so. If some great sea change had finally affected the thinking of members of the anti-Labour parties so that, for once, they were prepared to he proud of their own country and not of every country but Australia, the proposal that is now before the House would be worthy of general acceptance. Let us consider briefly the importance of the ostensible object of the motion. We need to develop Australian patriotism, to fan theflameof Australian enthusiasm, to encourage a moral sense of responsibility to the nation. The press, broadcasting, and films could be of much greater assistance than they are in the achievement of those results if the .financial groups which control those instruments of public information would permit them to ,be used correctly. If an alteration of the constitution of those groups would permit progress to be made towards the achievement of those objectives, there would be a commanding case for such an alteration. This motion, however, is too restricted to provide for any such change. It proposes no alteration of the financial control of the press, of the film industry, which is largely foreign in its make-up, or of commercial broadcasting. Nevertheless, no matter how weak and ineffective the motion might be in these respects it is .still worthy of consideration if the carrying and implementation of it would achieve any of those ostensible objects. We do need Australian independence. We ought to have the proud independence of a partner in the British Commonwealth of Nations. We ought to be able to formulate and express a truly Australian policy. We ought to be able to differ even with Great Britain in our viewpoint on British Commonwealth matters. We ought to be proud to belong to the British Commonwealth of Nations, and prouder still to be Australian, first of all things. The greatest enemy of these splendid aspirations of the Australian people has not been overseas control of commercial broadcasting in this country. It has' been the deliberate rjolicy, fostered and encouraged in this country right np to to-day by fhe anti-Labour political parties, which are composed of Australians. They are the .parties which have consistently maintained, and have endeavoured to develop, the attitude of colonial inferiority among Australians. They are the people who, from time to time in the last SO years, have advanced the proposition that we should be the hewers of wood and drawers of water for the industrialists of Great Britain. They are the people who have consistently said until very recently that Australia should have no foreign policy except that which is dictated by Downing-street. They are the people who have in turn declared that Australia should not have a navy of its own, that no Australian government bank .should be conducted, and that no Australian secondary industries should be operated. They are the people who a few weeks ago sold on the stock markets of the country the Government's shares in Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia)",54,Opposition Members Oh

This motion has not been brought in for any academic purpose. It has been brought in in the crowded closing hours of the session with the single aim of preventing a British financial group from obtaining a substantial interest in the Macquarie broadcasting network. The fact is that the adoption of the motion would not, and -could not, achieve any of the objects stated by honourable members opposite who have advanced in support of it the argument that adoption of it would tend to assist in the development of Australian, would in no way affect the purtralian sentiment and broadcasting truly Australian expression of views over commercial broadcasting stations. It would not do so, because, in the first place, many British citizens, even among those who have recently arrived in this country, are better Australians than are some people who have spent their whole lifetime in Australia. -citizenship is no guarantee of patriotism or loyalty to Australian principles or -aspirations. In order to obtain proof of that statement we have only to consider the activities of some Australians who control means of propaganda, either press, film ment of the best interests of the Australian people. In the second place, it could not succeed because capital has no nationality or patriotism and, because of its very nature, could have neither. Capital located in Australia can he employed just as injuriously to Australian interests as can capital brought into Australia from overseas. Thirdly, it could not succeed because any Australian who manages a broadcasting station or, for that matter, a network of stations, and will be permitted to do so under the terms of this motion, can frame the policy of his station, if he so desires, to attract the rich advertising contracts that are available to Australian commercial broadcasting stations from foreign corporations-no t merely from British corporations, but also from foreign corporations. The manager of such a station or network, even if he were born in Australia, had spent every day of his life in Australia, and was financed solely by capital the owners of which reside in Australia, can set aside the best interests of Australian culture and development in the conduct of his station for the profit that he gains by selling commercial programmes to the representatives of foreign corporations which can deny him the finances that he requires. That is actually happening every day in Australia, and there is nothing in the terms of this motion to prevent it from continuing to happen. The ownership of a network or of one station whether it be British or Auschase time for talks or plays of a kind that we hear over commercial stations, which sap and weaken our highest national aspirations. Whether the capital invested was British or Australian would not affect the presentation of low-grade, and sometimes debasing, programmes wholly provided and paid for by the Australian representatives of foreign companies which operate in Australia and which have absolutely no interest in Australia except the exploitation of Australians,",55,Opposition Members Oh

Whether the capital in the station or network was British or Australian would not affect the provision of finance to the owners of it by banks or other financial institutions that are located in Australia hut have overseas capital and overseas directorates, and are able to impose their controls on the policy to be followed by the owners of the station as a condition of financial assistance being granted to them. The carrying of this motion would in no way affect the presentation of foreign films, which have such a tremendous influence on Australian propaganda, or the publication of foreign comic strips, which openly glorify the way of life of another country and teach young Australians to grow up to he good little Americans. It would do nothing whatever to stem .the betrayal of Australian interests which occurs every day in sections of the Australian press in every capital city. All those things show the insincerity of the proposer and seconder of the motion, because they are making no attempt to attack the real evils in this country that stand in the way of the development of national patriotism and the highest national aspirations. The motion does none of these things. It is not intended, and never was intended, to do any of these things. It is not intended to promote Australian patriotism, to develop an Australian viewpoint or to foster Australian sentiment. It does not touch the fringe of that problem. It clearly could have no effect in that direction. It uses that ostensible object, which it clearly could not achieve, as a mask and a cloak to conceal one specific object, which was made perfectly plain in the speeches of the mover and seconder of the motion. That one objeel;-and there is no other-is to prevent the Bartholomew financial group from obtaining a controlling interest in the Macquarie broadcasting network. master-General( Mr Anthony) says motion have achieved-and they have "" Hear, 'hear! "". He agrees that that is achieved it accidentally-is that they have the sole suhject of the motion, although, directed the attention of this House and, of course, the Bartholomew interests are not named in the motion and although the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), from his place at the table, declared that the motion had no specific relation to the Bartholomew interests. But the Postmaster-General, with his usual frankness, has admitted that to be the truth. The motion has been presented deliberately and solely in the interests of another rival financial group. The presentation of the motion to the House was preceded by the most intensive lobbying on behalf of that group both in Canberra and in other capital cities. The reason why the honourable members who proposed and seconded it ai'e prepared to take a step that is calculated to benefit one financial group and to disadvantage another financial group has not, of course, been stated by them to the House. Nevertheless, just as their purpose is clear, their reason for seeking to achieve that purpose is equally clear. They wish to support a monopolistic financial group which has used in the past, and would continue to use in the future, if able to do so, all the methods of publicity and propaganda that it has at its command for the purpose of defeating the Australian Labour party. That is tinreason why they wish to support that financial group and wish to attack thc rival financial group, which, up to the present at any rate, has shown no disposition to make itself the servant of the Government in attacks on the Lahour party. The motion is therefore in effect -and the notice given by the Prime Minister of his intention to take further action either by Executive action or by legislation if this motion is carried supports my contention-the expression of a political conspiracy in the interests of one financial group directed against another financial group, which would defraud those interests that have purchased a financial share in the Macquarie broadcasting network. From that point of view this is one of the most shocking and disgraceful proceedings ever presented to this House for its consideration. The only useful thing",56,Opposition Members Oh

We cannot tolerate this power in the hands of anybody who may be ill-disposed towards this country. Anstralia is only now laying the foundations for its cultural advancement. We have to develop the Australian sentiment and this country's future will best be served if we reserve this field to Australian capital and Australian entrepreneurs. If this is purely a commercial venture the worse that can be charged against Government supporters is that they are overcautious. If we are being over-cautious our motive is to guard the national interest. We must be careful to ensure that what began as a commercial venture to serve the public shall not become a protected monopoly that will serve merely private interests.

207,Mr Allan Fraser (Eden,"Monaro)speech, the authority has heen observing three Commonwealth awards and seventeen awards of the Industrial Commission of New South Wales, without having been obliged to observe them. Therefore, so far as I can see, its employees have not had the opportunity to obtain legal redress if they believed that the authority's observance or interpretation of the provisions of any one of those twenty awards was incorrect. In those circumstances it is not remarkable that industrial disputes have occasionally occurred between the authority and its employees. Indeed, in all the circumstances, it is remarkable to me that more disputes have not occurred. In that respect, I pay tribute to the common sense and reasonableness of the union officials on the job and to the Commissioner, Mr Hudson, and the industrial officers of the authority. I support the view that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has expounded. He has submitted that the Government should agree to an amendment of clause 7, which requires that the judge who is to be appointed under the bill-I have heard the name of Mr .Tustice Wright mentioned in this respect-shall have regard to the orders and awards of the Full Court of the Commonwealth Arbitration with respect to standard hours, the basic wage, female rates of pay, periodical leave with pay and long-service leave with pay. Generally, this legislation is modelled on the Stevedoring Industry Act. But that act does not contain that particular provision. Under paragraph (d) of proposed new section 24E the court will be required to pay regard to the orders and awards of the Full Court of the Commonwealth tration Court with respect to periodicals sick leave and long-service leave with pay. If this provision is retained in the bill as drafted, employees of the Snowy Mountans Hydroelectric Authority are likely to be placed in a worse position than they are in at present. I understand that at present all employees of the authority have the right to go before the Public Service Arbitrator. In any event, officers and temporary oflicers of the 'authority have ifr. Allan Fraser. that right and it has been stated, although I understand that some doubt exists upon the point, that all its employees have -that right. that are registered with the Commonwealth Arbitration Court have the right to apply to the Public Service Arbitrator. that now, before the passage of this measure, they would obtain sick leave and annual recreation leave on a far more liberal basis than the Full Court would award. They would obtain a minimum of twelve days' sick leave annually on full pay and three weeks' annual leave on full pay from the Public Service Arbitrator. Buti f the single judge, whom it is now proposed to appoint as a tribunal to deal with these employees, is obliged to pay regard to orders and awards of the Full Court he will not be able to award to those employees more than a fortnight's recreation leave annually or one week's sick leave on full pay. Thus the bill as drafted will place those employees in a worse position than they are in at present in that respect. the Public Service Arbitrator. Court that I am trying to make is that, whilst that right will be preserved in respect of officers and temporary officers of the leave with pay, sick authority, it will be taken away from employees of the authority. ever have that right? Arbitrator can make awards, he cannot settle or adjudicate on disputes. object of this measure is to promote content and harmony among employees who are working in a special area it would be a bad thing if in one important and material respect they were given cause to feel that their conditions had been worsened compared with those that they have been able to obtain up to date. The single judge should not be obliged to grant, as a minimum, conditions that are worse than those that the Public Service Arbitrator would grant.",64,Second Readin G

The first part of the amendment gives to employees the right that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) emphasized in his second reading speech; and the second part of it stipulates that the court shall pay attention to that fact. It may be argued that a direction cannot be given to the court on this point, but I believe that the first part of the amendment answers that objection and guarantees continuance of the existing rights of these employees. for Supply) [9.57] -The Government cannot accept the amendment, which is designed to give a right to employees with respect to recreation and sick leave which the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has suggested they enjoy at present but which, in fact, they do not. I am instructed that these employees are working in respect of such leave under awards, or decisions, of State tribunals. If the Government accepted the amendment it would give something additional to that which these employees enjoy at present. The right honourable gentleman has admitted that this legislation is more or less in the experimental stage, and that the last word has not been said upon it. However, the bill represents a genuine attempt to bring order out of disorder. The Government is not prepared to accept the amendment at present. There is no reason whatever to suppose that the judge who is to be appointed as a tribunal to deal with these matters will not take every factor into consideration and will not give justice and satisfaction to the employees con. . . . cerned. hope that the Minister for Supply( Mr Beale) will give further consideration to the amendment that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has submitted. The clause as drafted will oblige the judge who is appointed to deal with matters that affect employees of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority to observe decisions of the Full Court of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in respect of four matters. They are the basic wage, standard hours, female rates of pay, and the periods of annual leave, sick leave and long service leave with pay. The decisions of the Full Court in respect of such matters are to be regarded as standard determinations. Whilst it might be said that those standards might well be taken as a basis in respect of employment by the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority, I pointed out at the time that the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill that was passed some time ago with the object of transferring to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court the sole right of determining the periods of periodical leave, sick leave and long service leave with pay, would be likely to give rise to anomalies and to cause conflict. The very reasons that have been advanced for the establishment of a special tribunal to deal with industrial disputes among employees on the Snowy Mountains scheme are, themselves, reasons why the judge of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court should not be required absolutely to follow the decisions that may be made by that court in respect of such matters. The very nature of this scheme places it in a class apart from works for which standard provisions have been made by the court.",65,Second Readin G

The honourable member for Bendigo contended that employees of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority are entitled to special consideration because they work in a cold climate and in an isolated area. Many men in other occupations, such as workers at the guided weapons testing range, might use similar arguments. The Government has brought down this bill, after discussions with union representatives in an atmosphere of general goodwill, in order to obtain better conditions for the men and to establish a reasonable degree of uniformity in our arbitration system.

Opposition) [10.16] -The Minister for Supply( Mr Beale) correctly stated that the trade unions were consulted, but they certainly did not express a view contrary to the proposal of the Opposition in this amendment. The Minister simply stated in his second-reading speech that the organizations wished to have an authority appointed for the Snowy Mountains area. Therefore, to say that numbers of the men who have vested rights are willing to have those rights thrown into the melting pot when at present they are regarded as settled, would be to draw an extraordinary inference. It is true that the area in which the bill will be effective is limited, but why should an act of Parliament permit the circumscription of existing rights in relation to leaves? The Opposition considers that this is an important matter and that the Minister should have accepted the amendment. Question putagreed to . The committee divided. ( THE CHAIRMAN-ME . C. F. ADEKMANN.)

The purpose of this short bill is to grant allowances to former State officers transferred to the Commonwealth at federation. Their pension rights which originated under Stabe law are preserved to them by section 84 of the Commonwealth Constitution, and entitled them to retire on the pension which would be permitted by the law of the State, if their service with the Commonwealth were a continuation of their service with the State. The majority of the officers concerned were transferred to the Commonwealth service from the Western Australian State service, and their pension rights flowed fro m the Western Australian Superannuation Act of 1871. These pensions are on a more liberal basis than those payable under the Commonwealth Superannuation Act, and are payable without contribution by the officers. Latei n 1947, the Western Australian Parliament passed legislation to increase the pensions payable, under the Western Australian act of 1871, to its own retired officers by 25 per cent, but so that the pensions, together with the increase did not exceed £360 per annum. Oflicers whose pensions exceeded £360 per annum did not participate. Although the Commonwealth was not under any legal obligation to increase the pensions payable to former State officers transferred to the Commonwealth, nevertheless it was considered that there were moral grounds for similar action by the CommonAvealth. Accordingly the Com(by Sir ARTH UR FADDEN) monwealth Parliament passed the Transferred Officers' Allowances Act in .1948, so that former State oflicers would be placed in the same position as they would have been in had they remained in the State service. The Western Australian Parliament has now passed further legislation to increase the pensions payable to its own retired officers under the 1871 act, and the Government considers that former State officers transferred to the Commonwealth should be granted allowances on the same lines. The increases are as follows:(a) Pensions not exceeding £260 per annum-increas e by 20 per cent, the maximum increase being £52 per annum. (b) Pensions exceeding £260 per annum and not exceeding £650 per annum-increas e of £52 per annum. (c) Pensions exceeding £650 per annum and not exceeding £702 per annum-increas e by such an amount as w ill raise the pensions to £702 per annum. I commend the bill to honourable members. The Opposition supports the bill which is consequent on the transfer of officers from the Western Australian service to the Commonwealth service at the time of federation. A t the time of the transfers, the pensions to which the affected officers were entitled as a matter of right were estimated in relation to their estimated salaries at the date of retirement.

In consequence two adjustments have been made by act of Parliament to do justice to those transferred officers. On each occasion the Western Australian Parliament passed an act which gave effect to the increase for public servants who had remained in the employment of the Western Australian Government. Also on each occasion the Commonwealth Parliament has followed suit, as in 1948 and as is again proposed now. This bill only does justice to State servants who transferred to the service of the Commonwealth and completed their service on far higher salaries than had been anticipated at the time of their transfer. On the last occasion that an increase of these pensions was granted by act of Parliament, a ceiling was fixed above which increases would not be provided for. That practice is to be followed again in this measure. There is an element of injustice in that procedure, because those persons who retired on higher salaries than the average did not obtain the f u l l benefit of the increase of pensions that was granted. That position resulted from the fact that these were not pensions for which they had subscribed, but pensions to which they were entitled as a right.

248,Mr Mcewen (Murray,"Minister f o rhave agreed on a common plan to meet difficulties which gravely concern each one of them. Those difficulties cannot he overcome hy isolated action, and cooperation is needed because of the widespread range of the wheat industry in our Australian economy. The need for action arises from a situation which has developed gradually over the years. The wheat industry is now carrying a burden which must, in justice to our wheat growers, be removed. In the latter war years, and since the war, a price has been paid for all wlieat sold in Australia which does not bear any fixed relation to the export price. Within limits that situation is reasonable, but as the years have passed there has been a great disparity between the local price and the export price. There has also been a steadily increasing demand for stock feed wheat in Australia, and a failure to develop the production of the feed grains which normally should supply the demand for stock feed in Australia. The result has been unfair to wheat growers, and harmful to our agricultural economy. As time went by, wheatFood and Agriculture Organization figures for 1949 show how wheat dominates cereal production in Australia and the greater proportionate production of feed grains in other exporting countries. The figures are in thousands of metric tonsAustralia Canada United States of America Argentina This shows that wheat formed tlus following percentages of thc grains given, for thc j'ear 1949 :Australia, 84 per oent.; Canada, 54$ per cent.; United States of America. 23$ per cent. ; Argentina, 67 per cent. Thc United States of America also produced 152,000,000 bushels of grain sorghum, or 3,800,000 tons from 6,600,000 acres harvested for grain. Another 5,000,000 acres of sorghum were used for silage and forage. The reduction in wheat acreage in Australia in recent years clearly demonstrates the need for a greater incentive to wheat production. Australia has a commitment, under the International Wheat Agreement, to supply 88,000,000 bushels of wheat for export each year during the remainder of the life of the agreement. That quantity is needed from Australia, by the importing countries for food, and it is within Australia's productive growers found themselves supplying ever increasing quantities of wheat for stock feed at low prices. There was a great overseas demand for that wheat for use as food, yet here in Australia the wheat had been used as stock feed. By using the wheat as cheap stock feed the production of our feed grains has been hampered, and the balance in our economy between wheat and coarse grains has been disturbed. I have been advised by the officers of my department whom J. requested to make investigations that wheat constitutes 84 per cent, of the total grains produced in Australia, leaving a balance of only 16 per cent, of coarse grains for stock feed and other purposes such as malting. In Canada wheat constitutes only 54^ per cent, of total cereal production. In the TJnited States of America it constitutes only 23-J per cent, of total grain production, and in the Argentine 67 per cent. There is obviously an unbalance as between the grain industries in Australia. With the consent of honourable members. I shall incorporate in Hansard a short statistical table on this subject. Wheat.

This measure will add to our capacity to supply food by encouraging greater production of wheat and by encouraging greater production of feed grains, which will replace wheat for stock feed, and so allow a greater proportion of our wheat to be used for human food. The plan which has led to the introduction of this bill may be summarized briefly. It is intended to ensure a price of Wheat Board from the 1st December, 16s. l d . bulk a bushel for stock feed wheat 1951. It will apply for two seasons, and sold in Australia. The States, by an amendment of their respective Wheat Industry Stabilization Acts, will provide for a price of 2s. a bushel higher than the guaranteed price during the 1951-52 season. In the 1952-53 season the price is to be fixed on the same basis, but with a maximum of 14s. a bushel. This special price will apply to wheat for the pig, poultry and dairying industries. The Oommonwealth will meet the difference between the price mentioned and 16s. l d . a bushel during the two years, for the quantity used for pig, poultry and dairy feed, up to a limit of 26,000,000 bushels annually. The price to be fixed by the State governments for other stock feed wheat will be 16s. l d . a bushel. It will be observed that the outcome of this arrangement will be that the wheat growers will receive 16s. l d . a bushel for all wheat used for stock feed, whereas the three named industries will obtain their wheat at a lower price. The necessary provision to enable the .1 wish to emphasize the point that the Australian Wheat Board to pay the needs of our stock feeding industries will freight on wheat delivered to the prinbe provided by adequate wheat for feed, cipal port in Queensland, and also in and by the encouragement of increased Tasmania, will be embodied in the State supplies of other grains.

A limit of 26,000,000 bushels for each of the two seasons has been set as the quantity of stock feed wheat on ' which the bounty will be payable. That is a reasonable limit, and it was determined after discussion at a conference with State Ministers for Agriculture. In fact it was the quantity of wheat used for stock feed purposes last year. Besides the fact that the quantity agreed on is reasonable in the light of the consumption of feed wheat to date, there is the fact that the Australian and State governments, by their joint action in this matter, are providing a stimulus to the production of other feed grains. Those feed grains should, froin now on, provide a growing proportion of our needs because their production will not he restricted by the uneconomic competition of cheap wheat.

On my return another conference was held at the request of the State Ministers for Agriculture, and, after a full discussion, the State Ministers put forward a proposal which was accepted. In accordance with that proposal State legislation is designed to establish the higher price for stock feed wheat, contingent on the Australian Wheat Board, in effect, bearing the cost of freight necessary for wheat shipped to Hobart and Brisbane to meet the needs of the importing States. The Commonwealth will provide a bounty for the benefit of the pig, poultry and dairy industries, and through these industries for the benefit of Australian consumers. It is the consumers who will receive the benefit of the I expenditure now proposed for the approval of this House, through the food that they buy.

252,After Mr Calwell,"The Opposition willand against all precedent to resume a debate of this importance at a later hour this day, which would mean, of course, in the early hours of the morning. I reel it necessary to put on record my view of the subject. We shall divide on the question if the Government will not give way. able member for Melbourne ( Mr. Calwell) is well aware, the Government has a certain programme of work to get through. My desire that the debate shall be adjourned to a later hour to-night is for precautionary purposes only. There is no intention on my part to go on with the bill unless the Government runs out of business. If that happens the Government must be able to proceed with other bills the consideration of which has not yet been completed. of the Executive Council to reconsider the matter. decided on the basis of whether the Government will r un out of business in tbe early hours of Thursday morning. The Opposition desires an opportunity to consider this bill. In the long run, no time will be lost if the ordinary procedure is followed and the debate is adjourned until to-morrow. quest is a reasonable one. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( M ' \ McEwen) knows that for two years the wheat-growers of Australia have been asking the Government to honour the promises that it has made in connection with the wheat industry. He knows that when he was a member of the Opposition he was a critic of the current wheat stabilization legislation. The Minister delivered a long second-reading speech upon this bill, which is a most complicated one. Apparently he expects the Opposition in a short space of time to digest the contents of that speech, contrast these proposals with the existing act and consider the effect of the proposals upon the dairying industry, the pig-breeding industry ancl. other industries, as well as upon the general economy of Australia. The proposals involve the payment of a subsidy of about £12,000,000 a. year. It would be utterly impossible for me or any other member of the Opposition, in a brief period of time, to give adequate consideration to the proposals. The adjournment of the debate until a later hour this day would be unfair, unreasonable and a traversy of parliamentary procedure. Surelyi t is not suggested that even the Minister, with his knowledge of the wheat industry, could make an adequate contribution to the debate after having considered the bill for so short a time. I suggest, in all seriousness, that the attitude that the Minister has adopted is an attitude of cowardice. mark is completely out of order and must be withdrawn. Minister is not prepared to allow the Opposition an adequate opportunity to examine this measure. He has been in I ask the Vice-President, trouble over the wheat industry ever since he became Ministerf o r Commerce and The question should not be Agriculture.

Ministei wishes to rush off to his f a r m is not a reason for why the Opposition should not have an opportunity to study this measure properly. for Lalor( Mr Pollard) has talked a lot of nonsense. No one knows that better than he does. He knows that the proposal to adjourn the debate upon this bill to a later hour this day has nothing to do with me. The Vice-President of the Executive Council( MrE r i c J . Harrison) is manager of the business of the House. The honorahle member for Lalor knew that he was talking utter trash when he suggested that I wanted to run away from a debate on this measure. with great interest to the remarks that have been made. I am a reasonable man. Having consulted with the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr. Calwell), I am willin g to agree that the debate be adjourned to to-morrow.

Opposition) [21.20],-This very important bill marks a new stage in the history of the universities of Australia. For the firsttime, we have placed upon a definite basis the conditions under which the Oommonwealth, for a fixed period, will make grants to the States for payment to universities by State governments. As the Prime Minister( Mr done in connection with the amount Menzies) pointed out in his second reading speech, the object of making the grants to the States is to avoid direct grants by the Commonwealth to the universities. The Opposition supports the bill. We welcome the provision that ihe Commonwealth grants shall be used, not for capital expenditure but for current activities. Some of the money will be expended upon research work, but I am afraid that most of it will be used by the universities to meet increased costs. The Opposition would Sikea greater and more significant iSnaneial contribution to be made to research, especially scientific and medical research. I am especially pleased that in the grants there is some recognition of the value of residential colleges within tbe universities. For the first time, the Commonwealth has done something which shows that it recognizes tbe value of thy work that they are doing, not only for tive proposal for assisting educational the States but also for Australia as a institutions.

The scheme for giving financial assistance to outrun by events, due to rapid increases of costs. Some universities are faced In the view of the Opposition, there should be a further investigation of this matter by the Commonwealth next year. From my survey of the figures, it appears that it would be impossible to alter the amount that is called the first level grant, or the basic grant, without disturbing the relative position of the universities, but something might be that is called the second level grant. If the grant made to a university by the State plus the fees charged to students by the university reached a certain level, the total amount of Commonwealth aid could be greatly increased. I asked the Prime Minister, during his second-reading speech, whether he could help the Opposition by giving an estimate of how the scheme will work out in practice. He has been good enough to do so. He has pointed out in a communication to me that it appears to be -certain that in 1951 each university will receive from a State government a grant sufficient to enable it to qualify for the -Commonwealth grant. That elucidates a matter that puzzled me when the bill was introduced. The position for 1952 and 1953 is hy no means so certain.

[12.5 generally appreciate the assistance that the Government is providing under this measure in respect of university education. About three weeks ago, I asked the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) whether the Government would provide funds to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization that would enable it to give to university students opportunities to gain practical experience during the coming Christmas vacation before they enter their respective callings. I refer particularly to students in biochemistry who, unless such facilities are provided for them, will finish their courses next year. The only other organization in which such students can gain practical training is but the latter, because of technical obstacles, cannot engage sueh students except in such work as filling bottles and the like. I point out that up t ill last year, students in biochemistry enjoyed the advantage of gaining practical training in the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization during their vacations. [12.7 a.m.] If u l l y appreciate the four principles that the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) enunciated in his second-reading speech. The first of them was that the Government, in making this grant, laid down no conditions except to specify the basic use to which it should be applied.

AU research into that aspect clearly indicates that only a limited proportion of the members of any community is capable of really benefiting from university, or higher technological, education. Experience in scientific circles throughout the world indicates that no nation is so rich in talent that it can afford to neglect any aspect of higher education. It is also said in some quarters that there is too much university education. I admit that a country can have too much of the wrong kind of education. A t the same time, one of the most important requisites in our democracy is that we shall avoid education of the kind that was fostered the Parke Davis organization, in Nazi Germany which was based on the principle that it was sufficient merely to give people scientific education of the highest standard. No nation can live by bread alone. We must accept the dictum that was enunciated hy Dr. Burchard, when speaking recently in the precincts of this House, that it is not sufficient that man shall be educated to certain high level; he must also, for ethical reasons, use his powers to the fullest degree.

The Government now wishes to increase the amount to 4d. a man-hour. Obviously, it is progressing backward. The Treasurer ( Sir Arthu r Fadden) stated, in his second-reading speech, that the Government requires this money in order to meet higher costs. The present rate of 2£d. a man-hour w ill yield £435,000, and the extra charge of 1^-d. a man-hour w ill provide an additional £130,000, making a total of £565,000 for this year. I do not know why the Government requires the increased amount, unless its case is based on the fact that wages have risen substantially and the cost of livin g has increased in consequence. Probably the Government does not wish to have to make such admissions. Perhaps the amount that is paid in attendance money at the higher rates is substantial, or mismanagement by the stevedoring industry of the available labour on tbe waterfront, which causes many persons to be idle and increases the payments of attendance money, may have made heavy demands on the fund . Either one of those factors, or a combination of them, has caused a large raid upon it . Perhaps the Government is admitting, by implication, that it has failed to put value into the £ 1 .

Adequate tests and surveys were made before the original clam site was selected. The site of the dam has, however, been changed for the following reasons:-(a. ) The general plans for the development of the power resources of the Snowy Mountains area were prepared by a technical committee consisting of representatives of tlie Commonwealth and of the States of New South Wales and Victoria before the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority was constituted. Tliese plans provided for a water storage at Adaminaby nf about 1,000,000 acre feet at the original site. (6) The technical committee could not iu the limited time available to it prepare sufficiently accurate data for the complete developments in the Snowy Mountains area. Detailed investigations carried out by the Snowy Mountains flydro-electric Authority-surveys , river gaugings, diamond drilling and comprehensive oflice computations-hav e revealed that the total power capacity of the Snowy scheme could be water can be provided for irrigation than was originally contemplated. Moreover, these increases can be attained with overall economy of the scheme. (c) The increased power and increased water for irrigation are based on a number of factors, including greater storage of water at Adaminaby with consequently a much higher dam. A high dam could be constructed at the original site on the Eucumbene River, but it is more economical to build the larger dam a.t another site 5 miles down the river. (ti) Non-recpverable expenditure of £140.000 has been incurred at the original site, but the economic advantages whicli will result from the increased From 1938-39 topower and the additional water for irrigation shown to lie possible from the detailed surveys and investigations far outweigh the expenditure incurred on tlie preparatory work. % 0/o / % NATIONAL DEBT. 21.4 18.3 30.2 5.4 0.6 19.9 Mr ""WARD asked the Treasurer, u p o n 0.6 3.8 20.8 notice 1 4 .3 1 8 .7 9.2 1.
