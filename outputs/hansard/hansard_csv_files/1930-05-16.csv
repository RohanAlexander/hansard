Prime Minister said that later he would make a statement on the proposal of the Government to assist, by a money grant, in what is described as the repatriation of wheat-growing States become parties to excess coal-miners. Is he yet able to make that statement? Leader of the Opposition a detailed answer to his question now. It is realized before the guaranteed price will be that on tbe resumption of work in the coal-mines there will be a large number of miners who cannot possibly be absorbed in the industry. The proposal is that in conjunction with the State Government this Government should form a commit'tee, on which the mine-owners and.miners would be represented, to see what can be done to repatriate, at least to some extent, the miners whose services will no longer be required in the mines. The Government has offered a contribution of £100,000 to make itpossible to do something in this direction without delay. This is a special provision.to meet special circumstances. Minister for Trade and Customs yet beeu able to make arrangements to meet the spinners and knitters of Victoria, as he promised to do; to discuss the position in relation to the use of Australian cotton yarn ? ments to meet the representatives of the spinners and knitters' in Melbourne os Monday afternoon next to discuss this subjeot.

9,Mr Parker Moloney,"PressMr 'BERNARD CORSER I have received a telegram from the Premier of Queensland ( Mr Moore) emphatically protesting against the amendments to the Cotton Bounty Bill moved by the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr paid to war pensioners suffering from tuberEorde) particularly that for the setting up of special tribunals to determine the wages and conditions in all branches of the cotton industry. Mr Moore contends that the introduction of these amendments is a definite breach of the agreement entered into with his Government, in that it involves it in heavy financial obligations. Has the Minister received a similar wire from the Premier of Queensland, and if so, has he sent a reply to it ? ; gram from the Premier of Queensland which, forces me to the conclusion that that honourable gentleman entirely misunderstands the position. probably due to the publication of garbled press reports. It has been customary for years to provide in bounty bills that reasonable wages and conditions ' shall be .observed in ""the industry.

It has already been announced that the Government proposes to ask the House to meet four days a week, instead of three, beginning with the week after next. As a rule this action is taken only towards the end of the session, but I doubt whether any honourable members believe that we are approaching the end of the session.

I realize that it is difficult for the Prime ing such matters this session, because the Minister to make any definite statement as to the future, for the decision is dependent to some extent upon the action that will be taken in regard to certain referendum proposals. Buti t was understood that certain business before the House, such as the tariff and the tariff surcharges and prohibitions, would be discussed immediately after Easter. As honourable members have many calls upon their time and energy, it would be of great assistance to them in making future arrangements if the Prime Minister could give any information as to the probable course of business. Though he cannot speak with any certainty, any information that he can give will be much appreciated. -Before the transfer of the Seat of Government to Canberrai t was agreed at a conference between the then Prime Minister, Mr Bruce, and the Leader of the Opposition at that time, Mr Charlton, that if it could be avoided, Parliament would not meet in Canberra during the winter. That was a definite understanding. I should like to know what the Prime Minister has to say, upon the subject. I have ho objection to the .Government ordering its business in any way it pleases, long distances to get to Canberra, and.a except that I think that honourable membersshould have an occasional opportunity to submit private business to the House. In'.the past there was a definite arrangement that one Thursday should he grievance day' and the next ; Thursday private members' day; but that was altered. 'We .now deal with grievances and private members' business on the same Thursday Although we are only at the commencement of the session and have had but one opportunity to deal with either private members' business or grievances, the Government is proposing to deprive us of any other regular: opportunities of dealing with these matters. Seeing that it is proposed to increase the weekly sitting days by'one, which means a 25 per cent, increase in the time ParliaThese facts should be taken into considerament Avill sit, I think the .Prime Minister ought to arrange for one Thursday in four or five, if he cannot agree to one in three, being made available to honourable members to discuss private business. There will be few opportunities for raisbudget and Estimates have been already passed. Eor the next three or four months honourable members will have no opportunity for initiating discussions except on motions for the adjournment of the House, a procedure likely to take Up more time than the allocation of a special day to private members' business. Last week, in order to allow another motion to come up for discussion, the debate on a motion standing in my name was adjourned. Now, through my courtesy in allowing that to be done, the discussion will not be resumed and members who wish to speak on the motion will be unable to do so. It has been the practice in the past to take away private members' day towards the end of the session, but on this occasion this is being done practically at the beginning of the session. I ask the Prime Minister how long.this session is likely to last, and whether it is proposed to sit right through the Winter? to be done. The unemployed are sleeping out in the open, although it is winter, and surely we'can come to Canberra in that season. membered that members have to travel good deal of illness has already been caused among them as a result of having to travel to Canberra during cold weather. Some honourable members are advanced in years, and should not be subjected to the fisk involved in travelling backwards arid forwards to Canberra in the depth of winter. The year is long enough to enable the work of Parliament to be done in the months in which the weather at Canberra is almost perfect, and without any danger to the health of honourable members. Our position is different from that of the memhers of State Parliaments.

A great deal of time is taken up with the discussion of private members' motions that give no practical result. If honourable members have grievances to discuss they can discuss them on the motion for the adjournment! of the House. Seeing that the session is likely to be a long one, and that many important matters, including the tariff, have yet to be dealt with, I ask the Prime Minister if he will give consideration to the avoidnecessary* The present Government asance of night sittings in favour of day sittings? There was an objection to that in Melbourne because of the attractions of the city; but in view of the severity of the winter in Canberra, the Government -might well consider the advisability of -keeping Parliament sitting from 10 o'clock in the morning until 6.15 in the evening and thus avoid the necessity of keeping members and officials at the House until late at night. am not at all concerned with the cutting out of private members' day at this stage of the session. Every member elected to this House comes here with great ideas as to what he will do, but he finds after a while that he can do nothing except in support of, or in opposition to; the government of the day. His proposals, when he has an opportunity of getting motions discussed, are dealt with in a purely perfunctory manner. A motion such as that now before the House is usually passed when it is desired to clear the board in readiness for an adjournment or an election. If we have done our duty we need not fear an election; that is my conception of what the motion generally connotes. But I should be most dissatisfied if that is to be the outcome of the motion we are now considering. The list of government business includes the Wheat Marketing Bill which, I think, will be passed, and no doubt will be beneficial to the farmers. There is also the Central Reserve Bank Bill, which leaves me as cold as stone. It is Only a measure for readjusting the pieces on the financial chess-board and eventually the .same position of stalemate will he reached.as we have had before. There are also the Development and Migration Bill, the Nationality Bill, the Forestry Bureau Bill, and a string of other bills which are merely something to talk about. is overlooking the Cotton Bounty Bill. sion on that bill furnished an illustration of how tenaciously honourable members opposite will fight anything which cuts across ,the interests of those whom they represent. I intend to be just as tenacious in pressing for the things I believe to be sumed office because of the mal-administration of the party opposite. In the midst of prolific production the Commonwealth, through bad government, finds itself in want. The present Ministry was put into power to correct, the ills for which its predecessor was responsible; bur, what is there in the programme I have read which is likely to correct anything? We merely get to a dead end, with the same results as before. That does not satisfy me. Until we have made an appreciable effort to get results, I shall not be satisfied. The unemployed situation was never worse than it is to-day. Some years ago, when unemployment was bad, this party took drastic and necessary action to correct the position. The former member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) asked that £50,000 be made available for the relief of the unemployed, and the proposal was acceded to by the then Government. That was not enough. Later another effort was made on behalf of the manual worker. The best we can can offer him is the use of military equipment as a shelter, under which he will live in conditions similar to those of a blackfellow in his wurley. If that is not the position, let me be told what this programme connotes. We are not impotent; We can do something. If nothing can be done, then we should tell the unemployed that we are powerless to help them. I am not prepared to hold my position under false pretences. I say that something can be done. I believe that after wealth is produced it should be better distributed. We should not hear this eternal wail about unemployment and starvation.

35,Mr Yates,"I am uot. The discusper cent, of the population is unemployed, and many of them have heen out of work for two or three years. If we can do nothing to remedy this position, let us throw up our jobs, and let somebody else take them on. I am prepared to give up mine if we cannot find a solution of our troubles. A. solution can be found. Before the motion is carried and we prepare to flit to warmer climates, and seek the comforts of our homes, let us at any rate make an attempt to do the job before us. The Government must find some comprehensive means for occupying the men who are unemployed. Have they not produced enough ? Compare the statistics of Australia with those of other countries. We have more money in our banks; have surpluses of wine, of fruit, of wool, of coal; yea, and a surplus of unemployed .into the bargain. What are we going to do? Cannot we do anytbing? We can do something, and we must do it.. If we don't we deserve to be exposed. I must confess that after 50 years' experience of parliamentary procedure and 41 years in parliament, I am disappointed with what one can achieve as a member of Parliament. On the advice of an officer of this HouseI put clown for the 29th May a notice of a motion for the establishment of the initiative, referendum and recall. It took 25 years to convert the Age newspaper to this idea. The Sydney Bulletin, for many years, has advocated it, and rhe strongest friendly society in Victoria, of that State to provide work for the unrhe Australian Natives Association, has adopted it. The Labor Party in every State of the Commonwealth has placed it on its platform. But governments .come and go, and private members' business is always relegated to the background. A private member in a State Parliament may bring a measure forward with some hope of having it carried, but it is almost impossible for a private member of this Parliament to get any proposal agreed to. I protest against this attempt to take away the opportunity of discussing private members' business. Next week 1 mu3t attend a large meeting of the unemployed at Carlton. MustI tell them that this Government is hardly moving in the direction of affording any relief for unemployment. I had hoped that with the institution of the initiative, referendum and recall the people who elected parliaments would be able to control them, and in that way ensure that something should be done in a crisis like this. Forty-one years ago, under the shadow of the Melbourne gaol, I addressed a meeting of the unemployed, and said that I did not know what hunger meant, but I had felt thirst in its direst form, and that if hunger was as bad as thirst, I would take; let people call it stealing if they would. If I had a wife and children depending on me I would do far more. To-day there are men, women and children in want, yet Australia is doing practically nothing for them. Why do not honourable members opposite join with honourable members who sit on this side in tackling this question, as all parties combine whenever war is declared ? No sooner does the tocsin of war sound in any part of the world and imperil our safety than we combine to raise troops and the funds necessary to arm and equip them. But when it is a case of the people suffering hardship a different attitude is adopted. Every honourable member knows that the banks to-day are restricting credit. I realise fully whatthat means. Have we, as was the case iu war time, stabilized interest as we should have done? Is it not a fact that the banks can charge almost any rate of interest on advances, and are they not in a position to call up overdrafts at 24 hours' notice ? In Victoria the municipalities were urged by the Government employed, but they have been prevented from doing so by the Commonwealth Bank. That Bank has been called the people's bank. It is nothing of the kind. The stigma of infamy will attach to any honourable member who calls it the people's bank to-day. It is a banker's bank. I shall relate an incident to show that that is so. A man who is known personally to me wished to obtain from the Commonwealth Bank an advance of £750, so that he might discharge an obligation to a private bank. His properties were valued by his bank for banking purposes at £1,580, but the valuation placed on them for land tax purposes was £2,000. He approached the manager of the Commonwealth Bank in Melbourne; having previously sent in a written application.",16,Importation Op Paper And Paper Pulp

I love this Ministry; and so imbued am I with the idea that the Leader of this Government is honest and straightforward, and that he is doing his best, that, God permitting, I should give half the remainder of my years to extend his life and his usefulness. After the speeches of the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates) and the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney), the desire of the Government to curtail the discussion of private members' business is quite intelligible. During the last election campaign honourable members who now sit on this side of the House were charged by those who how sit on the Government side with a desire to reduce the wages of the workerswhich you are amply familiar, arid on the of this country. The wages being paid to adult workers to-day is from 14-Jper cent: to 15 per cent, less than it then was. I do not say that the Government is responsible for the reduction; -but it is remarkable that .it should have occurred, and that the Government should have done nothing to fulfil its promise to provide work for all. 1 that there is no motion in the name of a private member on the business paper that deals with either rates of wages or unemployment. I ask the Deputy-Leader of the Opposition to confine his remarks to the question before the Ohair. general way to the programme of the Government. Other honorahle members have discussed unemployment and the opportunities that are open to the Government to relieve it. I recognize the extraordinarily difficult financial position in which the Government finds itself to-day. But I suggest that there are two sources of revenue which might be exploited for the relief of the unfortunate workers. They are 'the two sources which, on the eve of the last general election, the late GovernThe Chair, in exercising strictness, is ment proposed to tap. If this Government is really anxious to find money for the relief of unemployment, it should impose the amusement tax that was brought forward hy the late Government. mit, sir, that the honourable member for Henty is disregarding your ruling. Government business take precedence of all other business. I submit that the nature of the Government's programme, promised and actual, is relevant to a discussion of this matter. -rthat has been raised: The motion before the Chair is quite familiar to all parliamentarians, and the lines that the debate has followed are equally familiar. But I would'point out that if you, Mr : Speaker, uphold the view put by the Leader of the Opposition, it will mean that every item and ramification of government policy is open' for discussion on a motion of this kind.

"" I cannot permit, on the motion before the House, a debate such' as would he permissible during the discussion of the Address-in-Reply or of a ministerial statement. The whole ambit of. political action cannot be discussed on a motion of this kind. All that is now permissible is a debate having direct relation to the question whether Government business should or should not take preference of general business on each sitting day. Certain honourable members, I am afraid, have considered the Chair too strict when it has not allowed them to express theiriselves as fully as they would have wished; but what has taken place this morning shows clearly that the Chair must confine discussion closely to the question before it. protecting the rights of honourable members, and preserving due decorum. motion, and am giving my reasons for so doing.

""Whether we agree or disagree with the policy of the Government, it is our duty to afford it every one of them, if passed would give facility for bringing its business before the House. Spend so much time in arriving and departing from this outpost of Australia, it is certainly desirable for this Parliament to sit in Canberra for not less than four days a week. I was pleased to hear the remarks of some of the Government supporters, because I am satisfied that they are now beginning to realize that we in Australia must learn to live by industry and not by politics. I have heen here on two private members' days, and the last was very disappointing to me, because much of the discussion that took place was not in keeping with-the best traditions of the House. It would not do much harm to the country if the number of private members' days were reduced, and, on the whole, I think that it would be better to give the Government ah opportunity to put its business before Parliament, and to finish the session as ringah) [11.52,] I propose to make a suggestion regarding the days of sitting, which, .1 presume, will be in order. It has occurred to me that the hours of sitting on Fridays are badly distributed, and I suggest that the Government might consider meeting in the morning from 9.30 until 12 noon, resuming at 1 p.m., and arranging for the train to depart at a slightly earlier hour than it does at present. That arrangement would not inconvenience any honourable member; in fact, it would be a convenience to quite a number of members. I sympathize with the views of the honorahle member for Adelaide( Mr Yates) ancl the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney). Most honourable members could not but be deeply stirred by poignant remarks of the honorahle member for Melbourne, and I . . am quite sure that he would not have spoken with such deep feeling of .the sufferings and miseries of the unemployed had he not had the greatest sympathy with them. I agree with the honourable I understand that the honourable member fof Adelaide, and the honourable member for Melbourne, that not one of the. orders of the day or notices of motion appearing on the notice-paper is designed to make the butter the least fraction thicker on the bread of the worker.

On the other hand, the whole policy of the Government, as enunciated on the. notice-paper, will have no effect other than to increase the hardships and miseries which the workers of this country are suffering and which will increase as the winter progresses. I have the deepest sympathy for the honourable members who spoke from the Government side. Of course, it would be idle for honourable members on this side of the House to speak in similar terms, because the Government would not give to our words the notice' that they deserved. It is, however, more likely to take heed of its own supporters.

I defy any honorahle member on either side to show in what way this Government is improving the conditions of the masses, or attempting to solve the unemployment problem, either on the coal-fields or in any other part of Australia. [11.56] -The motion that I moved this morning was simple, and quite a usual one, though it has been brought forward earlier in the session than is customary. I take no exception to the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) aud the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page). They addressed themselves to the motion in proper terms, and properly asked to be informed as to the probable duration of the session. It is not possible for me to indicate' when the session will close; it will close when the programme that the Government has set down for consideration is completed. My object in moving this motion is to get this business concluded as early as possible. 1 know, of course, that the members of this Parliament come from all parts of tli is wide Commonwealth, and are in a position different from that of the members of State Parliaments. Consequently, T should like to meet their convenience as far as possible. But our first consideration must be the conduct of public business. We ask honourable members to sit four days a week because we believe that there is need for us to sit four days a week. If necessary, we shall sit five days, the purpose of this motion. He knows and even six days a week, and have both day and night sittings if more time is required for our deliberations. But quite a lot of Canberra enthusiasts who at one time advocated winter sittings, and have now had an opportunity of experiencing tbe winter f ro3ts in the Federal Territory, taking the earliest opportunity of flitting arc .anxious to depart. The motion is not designed to abolish private members' days, and an opportunity will, I hope, he given to honourable members to discuss the motions of which they have given notice. In any case, I remind them that private members' motions seldom get us anywhere. The real business of this Parliament is that put forward by the government of the day. Last year, before the Christmas adjournment, after a similar motion to this now under discussion had been passed, a special arrangement was made under which one honourable member was able to put a motion before the House and to have it carried. a bargain. ment which the Government need not have carried out. Tho carrying of a motion giving precedence to Government business does not take away private members' opportunities for voicing their opinions. The discussion on grievance day, although it takes place under a motion which comes under the heading of Government business is usually devoted wholly to the expression of private members' opinions on public matters in general; there is no discussion on Government business then. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition did not follow the good example set by his own leader and the Leader of the Country party. He ""merely seized the opportunity to makean attack upon the Government, and, as usual, was supported by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Archdale Parkhill). the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates). bers followed the lead of the honorahle member for Adelaide, who made an unwarranted attack upon the Government. He misinterpreted and misrepresented full well that the Government is going right through with its programme until it finishes it, aud it was merely a gratuitous affront on his part to suggest that in moving this motion the Government intended to finish its business, and, from Canberra, to run away from its job. be inferred from the honourable member's remarks.

The. . building of the road was part of the policy of the Bruce-Page Government to connect Canberra by good roads with all the State capitals. The road between' Sydney and Goulburn is constructed of the' best material, and is of a high class.

The New South Wales Government generously agreed to help the Commonwealth Government to construct a good road between Goulburn and tihe Capital City, although from the point of view of settlement and production the road would not be so valuable to the State as its other arterial thoroughfares. Canberra should be made accessible to all the State capitals. I find that all the visitors to Australia from overseas are anxious to visit the Federal Capital even though they may have very little time at their disposal. Despite what has been said this morning as to the advisableness of scrapping this city, I assert that nothing about Australia appeals more to the sentiment of people who come here, from overseas than the construction of the capital city in this beautiful spot.

111,Mr Lacey (Grey) [12.25],"The readvanced in support of this project. In the early stages of the development of this city I strongly criticized the whole project, in Parliament and outside of it. But we are here now, aud we should provide the facilities and utilities necessary for a capital city. The honorahle member for Perth( Mr Nairn) is hardly justified in criticizing this Government for the expenditure of this money, for the work was put in hand by the Bruce Page Government. It let contracts for earthworks that were necessary to make the road. It was only after the work had been put in hand that it was submitted to the Public Works Committee for investigation and report. Honourable members on both sides of the House at that time pressed the Government to push on with the construction of this road in order that the capital city might have worthy approaches from outside. The road from Canberra to Goulburn, via Queanbeyan, is not the kind of highway that should lead to the capital city of the nation. The committee has made its inquiry into this project since the last election, and it is unanimously of the opinion that the work is well warranted. In passing, I should like to say that the Public Works Committee knows no party politics. It makes its investigations entirely without bias. Moreover, it is iu a position to form a reliable opinion upon the kind of road that should be constructed. I am glad to say that it will be possible to open this road for traffic within a few months. Seeing that the previous Government en-' rered into a contract with the New South Wales Government to construct the road, there seemed to be nothing else for us to do but to m£ke the best possible road for the purpose at the least possible cost. The committee is satisfied that a gravel road of the kind proposed is advisable. In fact, a gravel road of that kind is necessary for all forms of road construction intended to be finished with a sealed coat. It is not sound practice to construct a new road and immediately finish it off with a permanent bituminous or tarsealed surface. Experts are firmly of the opinion that such roads should he given a gravel surface, subjected to traffic for twelve or eighteen months, and then when they have become thoroughly consolidated, [72] given a permanent surface. In this case it is particularly desirable to follow such a course, because investigations are now being carried out to determine whether Australian tar can be used for surfacing instead of imported bitumen. By the time we are ready to go on with the surfacing of this road, those experiments will be completed and the restilt kt.own. Honourable members opposite have accused the Government of extravagance in connection with this undertaking, but the work was authorized and undertaken, not by this Government, but by the last Government. I do not condemn the last. Government for that. If Canberra is to continue to be the seat of government we must have good roads leading to it. It is not true, however, as has been suggested by the houorable member for Perth( Mr Nairn) that the present Government is responsible for this expenditure. We are responsible only for carrying the work to completion. I wish to add my protest to that of the honourable member for Perth against the continuation of expenditure on what is purely a luxury at a time when the Government is compelled to cut down expenditure on urgent developmental work, nnd on scientific research. The people are shortly to be asked to give extended powers to this Parliament by a Government which proposes to spend large sums of money on luxuries such as public baths in Canberra, and on an ostentatious luxury highway between Sydney and. Canberra, while men are being thrown out of work in the Northern Territory owing to shortage of Government funds. The Northern Territory, which is strategically the danger point of Australia, is having its development retarded because funds are not available to keep the stock routes in order'by the provision of adequate water supplies. While this cheeseparing policy is in operation in the Northern Territory, which is the special responsibility of the Commonwealth Parliament, we are being asked to vote additional money for luxuries in Canberra, partly for the convenience of a handful of residents here, and partly for the benefit of members of Parliament and occasional tourists. Canberra is quite well provided with roads, and has an",25,Federa Lhighwa Y
112,Mr Hawker (Wakefield) [12.35],"excellent train service for so small a popuhaving heen begun, should he finished, hut lation. There is a good main road leading from Sydney to Canberra, and it is only eight miles longer than this new Toad will be. The only return the public will receive for this expenditure is the little extra money that will be spent in the Canberra hotels, which are already losing on practically every guest they entertain. Not only is this expenditure extravagant from a national point of view, but it will encourage extravagance in that people to go ""joyriding"" or to take trips to see their own country, but there are plenty of places accessible hy present methods of communication without furnishing additional encouragement for the burning of American petrol and the wearing out of American motor cars. Not only is the Northern Territory being stinted through lack of funds, but scientific research which, of all Government activities, holds out the greatest promise of giving a profitable return, is being severely restricted. I am convinced that every member of the Government is reluctant to reduce expenditure on scientific research, but while the money is not available for it, money should not be made available for public baths in Canberra, and for new highways which are purely luxuries. I hope that even at this stage the Government will delay the completion of this work so that more important things, upon which the real security and prosperity of the country depend, can be proceeded with as far as the limited funds available will permit. -The honourable member who has just resumed his seat may be excused for what he has said because he was not a member of this House when the subject was last discussed. This road was approved by the predecessors of the present Government. Authority has already heen given for the spending of £200,000 on this work, and much of the money has already been spent. That expenditure will he useless unless the work is finished. The previous Government had a penchant for starting big jobs and not finishing them, a fact borne witness to by the idle foundations for the administrative block here in Canberra. It is necessary that this work, personally, I am sorry that it ever was begun. It was, apparently, the policy of the last Government to allow the main arterial roads leading to Canberra to be neglected. I wish that the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker) would take a ride over the road from Yass to Canberra. That road was worn out during the building of Canberra, and the last Government, although responsible for its destruction, did nothing to recondition individuals. I do not say it. I congratulate the Government upon it is always wrong for recognizing the necessity for good roads in, and adjacent to, the capital city. I was pleased to hear the honourable member for Grey( Mr Lacey) announce that investigations were being made which might lead to the substitution of Australian tar for imported bitumen. We are already buying too much from America. If I had my way I would declare bitumen "" black"" at once. I should use tar for road treatment if possible, and if that were not suitable, I should use cement which, while more costly, would provide a permanent surface. Members of the Opposition seem to be suffering from that complaint known as psittacosis; at any rate, they keep on uttering parrot-like cries about the need for economy. One after another gets up and condemns any proposal to spend money; but it is this persistent refusal to spend money that is aggravating the present depression. Governments should .spend money in times of depression so as to provide work for the workless. Road work is probably the best form of unemployment relief there is because practically the whole of the money spent is paid in wages. There are many plutocrats in this House, and many more outside it, and I think that the time has arrived when the Government should draw a little more on those in receipt of £10,000 a year and upwards in order to obtain money for the relief of unemployment. As I have said, I do not approve of this road which reduces the distance between Sydney and Canberra by only eight miles, for which insignificant benefit the country has to pay £200,000. Moreover, because it had embarked upon the construction of this road, the last",26,Federa Lhighwa Y
113,Mr Cusack (Eden,"Monaro) [12.40].Government allowed other main roads leading to Canberra to fall into a disgraceful condition of disrepair. I cannot see any great advantage in reducing the distance between Sydney and Canberra by eight miles. A few miles extra is nothing to motorists provided they have good roads to travel over. Yass and Queanbeyan are well-known now throughout the length and breadth of Australia, and tourists visiting Canberra will naturally desire to visit those towns. Therefore, the better policy would have been to have put in proper order the approaches to Canberra through Yass and Queanbeyan. proposal to construct this highway should have been referred to the Public ""Works Committee before being authorized. The Public Works Department should he more particular in that regard. We all know that the committee is doing very good work, and it will be to the advantage of the Department and the Government that no attempt should he made to evade the provisions of the act. I have not the slightest doubt regarding the need for this road. It would be useless to have a fine capital city here unless proper means of access to it were provided. Prom time to time suggestions have heen made for the construction of railways to Canberra, but I urge the Government to consider in every case whether it would the law insisted upon the matter being not be better to build a road instead of additional railway's. I commend the Minister for proposing this motion. The completion of this work will, I believe, add greatly to the comfort of those who have to travel to Canberra by road. General) [12.48] I do not know that it is necessary for me to reply to the criticisms that have been offered to this motion. I have justified the proposal only on the ground that a definite contract had been entered into with a State Government, and. that it would be a breach of that contract if the work were not completed. It is desirable, however, that I should place on record certain remarks of the Public Works Committee, so that that point may he made perfectly clear. reportedI n considering the 68 miles of road from poses of a bill for an act relating to the marGoulburn, via Bungendore and Queanbeyan, to Canberra, it was recognized that 37 miles between Queanbeyan and Tarago was badly located with sharp curves and steep grades; some of it was partly paved, and other portions were not paved at all. Another section of 21 miles between Goulburn and Collector was already in existence, and was portion of a through road to be carried out with federal aid over a period of ten years. After a conference between the then Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) and the New South Wales authorities, it was decided that it would be better to construct the Goulburn-Collector road, rather than improve the old road, and an agreement was reached to proceed wit h the woik as a special measure, rather than allow the usual development to take place over a period of ten years. Under this arrangement the State undertook to construct 22 miles of road from a point 54 miles from Collector to the boundary of -The the Federal Territory, at an estimated cost of £200,000-two-third s of the money to be found by the Federal Government, and onet h i r d by the State, over a period of two years. The Commonwealth undertook also to continue the road over a distance of approximately 0 miles from the boundary of the Federal Territory to the boundary of the City of Canberra. I take it that the reason for the nonsubmission of the proposal to the Public Works Committee by the previous Government is that it felt that that course was not necessary, because this Parliament had approved of the contract that had been entered into between the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales. When the attention of the present Government was drawn to the fact that referred to the Public Works Committee, it had no option but to comply with the law in that respect. The committee approved of what this Parliament had previously agreed to; therefore, we cannot do other than keep faith with the Government of New South Wales, and complete the contract.

Debate resumed from 15th May (vide That the bill be now read a second time. way of amendmentThat all words after ""That"" be omitted, and that the following words be substituted in lieu thereof:"" this House is of opinion that, while present circumstances justify a guarantee by the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States of a minimum price of 4s. per bushel for f.a.q. wheat, season 1!)30-1031, delivered at railway sidings, legislation providing for such a guarantee should he introduced separately from any legislation providing for the establishment of a monoply in the marketing of Australian wheat by means of a compulsory pool"". ringah) [2.17] -When the House adjourned last night I was pointing out that, from compilations and estimates that I had made, wheat, for which the Government is guaranteeing 4s. a bushel, may cost it at least 5s. H i d . before the whole of the wheat in the pool is sold, and, in addition, it will not be able to recover more than 4s. 6d. a bushel. pointed out that on 160,000,000 bushels this would involve a loss of £8,000,000, which could be recovered only by adding 3s. a bushel to the local price of wheat, and, as a result, the price of the 4-lb. loaf of bread would be increased by 2£d. It has been said during the course of this debate, more particularly by the honourable member for Grey( Mr Lacey) and the honourable member for Echuca( Mr their necks in a noose for the next two Hill) that no matter to what height the price of wheat rises, the price of bread will remain unaffected. able members quoted statistics in support of their contention, but I submit that it is an impossible conclusion. One would think that wheat was no longer used in the manufacture of flour, or flour in turn, an ingredient of the loaf II dissociate myself entirely from the views of those honourable memhers. The effect of the pool on the price of bread will he felt, if not immediately, then so soon as the present stocks of flour are exhausted and fresh flour is made from wheat purchased at increased prices. Not only that, but the increase in price will affect the poultry farmer and any other person who has to purchase wheat and wheat products in connection with his business. It is idle to think that we can get this money from some unknown source, or that it will come as a mist appears in the morning. The money has to come from somewhere. The citizens of this Commonwealth, in order to recoup the pool for the loss that it will incur by the sale of its wheat overseas, will be compelled, either by an increase in the price of bread or in some other way, to find the millions necessary to make up the shortage. The honourable member for Echuca admitted, in the course of his speech-anc l he apparently is to be an influential member of the State pool in his State-that he would advocate that the price of wheat for local consumption should be 5s. 6d. or 5s. 9d. per bushel. increase of ls. in the price for local consumption means that the taxpayers will have to find from £2,000,000 to £2,500,000, in order to make up the loss on the pool. This Government has no I right to permit any State Board or other organization to impose such a penalty on the people of this country. The farmers should pause before they hand themselves over body and soul to the Labour party. They should not sell their birth right for a mess of pottage. To obtain a fleeting advantage this year they should not put years. This Government is not susceptible to the opinions of the farmers of this Those honorcountry.

The honourable member's interjection shows how easily the farmers of this country are beguiled. If the honourable member is sheltering himself behind the thought that this Government cannot appoint price fixing tribunals, let me remind him that there are other bodies, such as State Parliaments, which are able to institute a system of price fixation. I already see signs that the practice, which has been in operation for many years, of making the local consumer pay for the loss on exports, is going to stop. There are signs of a revolution against that system, and that is evident in at least New South Wales; and I believe in all the other States. It will not be long before the Government will be forced to take action to stop the practice of husbanding our products hy sending the surplus overseas at the expense of the consumers and citizens of this Commonwealth. The farmers in their own interests should refrain from joining the pool. They should consider their position before it is too late, because in this House by supporters of the Goif they join the pool they are likely to suffer as did the farmers of Russia. The Soviet Government said to the Russian fanners "" You must deliver all your wheat into our government depots and allow lis to do what we like with it . "" Certain arrangements have been made for pooling this year, but in regard to the pools for the next two years there is nothing to prevent the Government from following the example of Soviet Russia. We should he guided by our experience of previous pools. The present proposal provides for the same machinery in respect of the inauguration and control of the pools, as was in operation during previous pools. ' In 1917-18 the wheat yield was greatly depreciated hy the ravages of mice and weevil, and for that the board then in existence, could not escape responsibility. As a result of its neglect to institute preventive measures, this country lost £3,000,000 worth of wheat. The farmers had to bear two-thirds of that loss and the Government made up the balance. Take the experience of Brazil. A few years ago a coffee pool was established in that country and even now holds the world's requirements of coffee for twelve months. It has been unable to get rid of its holdings because the other nations of the world had obtained their supplies and substitutes elsewhere. New Zealand had a butter pool, but when the loss to the producer reached £2,000,000, pools werediscontinued. Honourable members who advocate this wheat pool have referred to the pools established iu Canada and the United States of America, yet the government of the latter country has already refused to assist its producers any further by means of the pooling system. Mr Coolidge, the ex-President of the United States of America, stated:Any form of price-fixing, once started, has alike no justice, and no end. It is an economic folly . . . no man can foresee what thu effect on our economic life will be of disrupting the long-established and delicately adjusted channels of Commerce. That it will be far-reaching is undeniable, nor is it beyond the range of possibility that it will threaten the very basis of our national prosperity through dislocation, the slowing up of industry, and the disruption of the farmers' market. Judging by the way in which Lord Beaverbrook has heen quoted vernment, apparently the Labour party is adopting w associations. The bill n o contains provisions whit-h, I suspect, are deliberately ambiguous. I refer particularly to clause 1.2 of the schedule, and I ask the Minister in his reply to indicate exactly what the equalisation provisions mean.. For instance, will New South Wales and Victoria, which have a large home market, pay to the States having a small local consumption a proportion of the extra price yielded by the local trade"" Unless the New South Wales farmer is assured that he will get all the benefits of a large home market, which yields a higher price, he will not be very enthusiastically in favour of the pool.",29,Moloney

Does it expect to gain benefits from the pool and not to share with its partners any of its existing advantages? Will Queensland be able to retain all its own wheat for home consumption and exclude all interstate and foreign flour? Its government is already straining the Constitution in an endeavour to keep off the Queensland market the flour of other States, and unless the pool will permit that policy to continue it will not he of much benefit to the northern State. In the event of defalcations, mismanagement, and inefficiency such as occurred in connection with the pools during the war period, will the offending State boards be responsible, or will the Central Board accept the liability and make good the deficiency from the funds of the nonoffending State boards? The honourable member for Angas( Mr in this matter have taken a'dvantage of Gabb) read, with much sound and fury, long extracts from the report of a royai commission that inquired into the transactions of the South Australian wheat merchants in 1907. After all his fulminations regarding the alleged scandalous handling of the farmers' wheat by the merchants, he disclosed that the royal commission recommended that no action he taken. The honourable member for Grey( Mr Lacey) also attacked the merchants. farmer whether his wheat is dealt with through the agency of merchants who have the open market before them, worldwide resources and capital abroad that would be of value in Australia at the present time, or through the agency of so-called farmers' associations in the various States? The latter will not be less anxious to make profits than are the merchants , therefore, they are not 1 more likely than private agencies to give anything away in regard to charges for handling, &c. The farmers who put their wheat in the pool will not share in the agency profits of these organizations that will handle the wheat for the pool; the Mr Archdale Parkhill. profits from which the merchants are to be excluded will go to the shareholders in the societies, many of whom are not wheat-growers, or even graziers. So far The honourable as I can see, the farmer may be leaping out of the frying pan into the fire. The attacks which have been made upon the merchants are unwarranted and unjustifiable. I believe in the pooling of wheat. The voluntary pools which have operated in Western Australia and Victoria have done excellent work for the producers within the limitations imposed upon voluntary pools, but I am convinced that to be fully effective a pool must have some measure of compulsion behind it. Most of the argument in opposition to the bill has centred on the principle of compulsion. We have just heard a characteristic speech from the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Archdale Parkhill), whose forcefulness makes his speeches interesting, even when we disagree with his views. In regard to this matter he has been gravely misled by the figures which have been supplied to him. Certain gentlemen who are interested the guileless innocence of the honourable member in regard to the wheat industry. Last night he quoted figures to show the damage which the war-time compulsory pool had done to the consumers of Australia. He stated that in 1920, the last f u l l year of the pool, the Australian price was in the vicinity of 9s. whilst the oversea price was 6s. 8d. The facts are very different. During 1920, the price charged for wheat throughout Australia What does it matter to the was 7s. 8d., and the overseas price rose as high as l is . 4d.; the average over-all in New South Wales, taking into account overseas and local prices, was 8s. 4d. Prom these figures it is apparent that even in a State which has a large local market, the average price was increased considerably hy that proportion of the wheat which was sold overseas. In Western Australia, 'because of the smaller local consumption the difference was even more marked. The local price was 7s. 8d., but the average realization over-all was 9s. 4d. In Victoria the local price was 7s. 8d., and the average over-all price 8s. Id. In South Australia, the prices were 7s. 8d. and 9s. Id. respectively. It",30,Moloney
126,Mr Paterson (Gippsland) [2.36].,"is 1920, which was a dry year, Victoria and South Australia put on the market exactly the same quantity of wheat, namely, 12,000,000 hushels. Vet in one State the average over-all price was ls. per bushel more than in the other. The explanation is that of the 12,000,000 bushels produced in each State, in Victoria 9,000,000 bushels was locally consumed at 7s. 8d., and only 3,000,000 bushels was exported at the higher price, whereas in South Australia the figures were reversed. In that year, at any rate, the Australian consumers did not suffer as a result of pooling; on the contrary, the pool enabled the consumers to get their wheat at less than export parity. We are f requently told that the local market is better than the export market. In that year it was much less advantageous to the growers, and had they heen free to export the whole of their wheat, they would have reaped a much higher return. I shall give another illustration of the ingrowers in the dried fruits industry. A correctness of the figures quoted by the honourable member for Warringah. I do not suggest that he was deliberately inaccurate. the source of the honourable member's figures ? tics of the compulsory pool. mine from the same source. bear the closest investigation. The honourable member in endeavouring to show that marketing organization was a bad policy, said that butter was sold in Australia for about 2s. a lb. when it was being sold in London at ls. 4d. As a matter of fact, the difference between the wholesale prices in London and Australia is only 2£d., and as the Australian consumer gets his butter fresh from the churn, whilst the people in the United Kingdom buy it when it is two to three months old and frozen hard as wood, the higher price in the local market is justifiable. At any rate, the difference in price is only about one-third as. great as was stated hy the honourable member last night. figures were qr^ted from London. are absolutely wrong. Returning to the subject of compulsion, which is the bugbear of those who oppose the bill, if we examine the measure carefully, and compare the powers which it is proposed shall be conferred upon a wheat board with the powers that have already been given to the board controlling the export of dried fruits, we find that the powers conferred under this bill are practically identical with those given by the Bruce-Page Government in the case of the dried fruits industry. In 1924, a measure was passed under which the Parliament gave export control powers to the dried fruits industry. But the board found those powers insufficient, and asked for authority to deal also with interstate trade. Consequently, in 1928, a measure, small in compass, hut important in its effect, was passed, giving the industry control of interstate trade. There will be no more compulsion under the present bill than has already been applied to precedent has already been established for what is now proposed by the present Government to be done. We gave that industry all the powers it was possible, is under the Constitution, to grant to it, and, in addition, powers were given by the various State Parliaments just as will require to be done in connection with this bill. If we examine the governing clauses, we find that clauses 16 and 18 are the main provisions on which tl \ powers of the board rest, although claui i 20 summarizes those powers. ClauseJ J is identical in its wording with sectw l 14 of the Dairy Produce Export Contavl Act, section 13 of the Dried Fruits Export Control Act, section 13 of the Canned Fruits Export Control Act, and a similar section in the Wine Export Control Act. Clause 16 does neither more nor less for the wheat industry than has already been done for the other industries that 1 have mentioned. As I have already said, the dried fruits industry had powers conferred on it in 1928 which are precisely similar to those which the , Government proposes to give to the wheat growers under clause 18, which deals with interstate trade. In 1928 a little measure was brought down hy the lata Government which broke entirely new",31,Moloney

132,A Strange Coincidence That I N Mr Paterson,"In any case theyperhaps, did not receive the attention that it deserved. It gave to prescribed' authorities power to regulate interstate trading in dried fruits, and it was based on the latest interpretation by the High Court of section 92 of the Constitution. So what, the former Government did, in 1924 and 1928, in pioneering marketing legislation, has now been embodied in one measure ancl applied to wheat. It must be remembered that when the former Government brought down what was then considered very drastic legislation to control the marketing of primary products-I refer particularly to the dried fruits legislation-we had to be first satisand submit the proposal to a ballot of the fied that the position of the industry was such that the proposals were necessary in the interests of the growers. In the second place we had to be sure that there was a very strong feeling amongst the producers that such powers were desired by them for the protection of the industry. Of course, no government can gauge the strength of such a demand until a ballot has been taken. The former GovernmeJit brought down five export control measures, and in four cases the ballots ment was apparently in favour of grantproved that we were not mistaken in estimating' the demand for them. .We had successful ballots in favour of the measures relating to dairy produce, canned fruits, dried fruits and wine. A. bill was brought down also with respect to the marketing of apples and pears, hut the ballot proved that there was not a majority of the growers in favour of the proposal. To every 44 growers in favour of it, 56 were against it, but those figures last approach that was made to me was justified the late Government in bringing down its bill. A year or two ago there was no general demand among wheat-growers for a compulsory pool. The honourable member for Grey( Mr Lacey), in -i speech last night, rather criticized the previous Government for not having done anything in this direction during the past six years. During the last year or two the growers iu both New South Wales and Victoria have, by ballot, rejected proposals for State compulsory pools, and during the three and a half years in which I had the honour to be Minister for Markets, I was approached only on three occasions with regard to the marketing of wheat. On the first occasion a Victoriau deputation, representing a proportion of Mr Paterson. the, Victorian growers, asked me if the Government would be prepared to consider giving the wheat industry an export control board similar to that of other industries. They did not ask for a Commonwealth pool, but for an export control board. I replied to those gentlemen that they represented only one section of the wheat-farmers in one State, but that if they could get into touch with similar organizations in Victoria and the other States as well, and could satisfy me that there was a general desire for such a board, I had no doubt that the Government would be prepared to bring down legislation to give effect to their wishes, growers. Apparently they were not able to obtain support from the other States because I heard no more about the matter. The next deputation I received with regard to wheat was made up principally of representatives of co-operative companies and growers who were keenly interested in voluntary pooling. These gentlemen had heard that the Governing an export control hoard .if the growers wanted it, and they informed me that they preferred to adhere to the pooling arrangement that they then had. On the first occasion I was asked if the Government would be prepared to grant an export control board, and on the second occasion I was told by other representatives of the industry that they did not want such a body. The third and shortly before the late Government went out of office. In October last year, I was asked by a number of gentlemen interested in the wheat industry how a compulsory Commonwealth pool could be brought into -effect. I pointed out that, the Commonwealth alone could not give the growers a compulsory pool because the Constitution would not permit of it. I said that all we could do was to appoint export control boards with power to regulate oversea and interstate trade, and that so far as the internal part of the working of a compulsory pool was concerned, it was the function of the States, and they would have to secure legislation in their own Parliaments. £ pointed out that if the growers could induce tlie States to do their part in providing local legislative machinery, the Commonwealth would he prepared to consider granting to the wheat-growers statutory powers similar to those given to growers in the dried fruit industry, There was a compulsory pool in operation in Queensland at the time, and in New South Wales there was a marketing act; hut the wheat-growers up to that time had refused to take advantage of it, having rejected the proposal by will be enjoyed by the individual proballot. In Victoria there was no marketing act, and the growers in that State had rejected by ballot a proposal for a pool. But, in October, 1929, when these gentlemen came to me, the prospects of the wheat industry were poor. Prices were falling and growers who had refused to entertain the proposal for a' compulsory pool were beginning to think that in that course alone lay their salvation. A desire for this change certainly appeared to be Setting iu at the time when the new Government came into office, and whether that desire is overwhelming or not can only be determined by taking a ballot. The ballot will not be taken by the Commonwealth, hut the Commonwealth will rest its case on the result of ballots taken in the several States. I think that the demand appears to be sufficiently strong to justify giving to the growers an opportunity to accept or reject the proposal in the bill. So much on the subject of the demand for this legislation. Now let us see if there is need for a compulsory pool. I believe that with the fall in world prices of wheat it is neces.1 believe that if a ballot were taken tosary for the grower to have every penny paid by the consumer which can be returned to him, without one unnecessary intermediary. Whether this result can be achieved through pooling depends entirely on efficient management. If a pool comes into operation, I hope that full adtain a local price which otherwise could vantage will be taken of the services of persons who have proved themselves efficient and good commercial men in conducting existing voluntary pools. I certainly do not believe that the desired result can be obtained without pooling. Undoubtedly, enormous fortunes have been made in the past between the producer and the consumer. This bill depends upon the passage of State legislation, and that bears out what I have already said, that the Commonwealth alone cannot establish a compulsory pool. In my opinion, this hill involves no greater degree .of compul sion than already obtains in the dried fruits industry. I know that it will be said that in the dried fruits industry there still exists a greater measure of freedom to the individual seller than ducer of wheat; but that issue does in>t really come into the diseussion on the text of tbe bill. Although in the dried fruits industry the growers may not choose to make such full use of the powers provided for them as presumably the wheat-farmers may do, one cannot say that the Wheat Pool Bill is essentially different in substance from the legislation dealing with the dried fruits industry; there is merely a difference in the amount of use that is made of similar powers. It may be asked, however, what is the necessity of compulsion in either the dried fruits industry or the wheat industry? That is a fair question, and the answer, in my opinion, is that without compulsion ensuring that all growers rnusr. take their fair proportion of the local and overseas prices it would he impossible to maintain an Australian price for dried fruits in harmony with Australian living standards. The export parity rate would govern the price of dried fruits inside Australia as well as outside, were it not possible to compel all producers to accept their fair share, and only their fair share, of both, markets. day of the dried fruit growers, 95 per cent, of them would be in favour of the continuation of the present marketing legislation. The huge majority of the dried fruit growers would voluntarily submit to compulsion in order to mainnot be maintained. I believe that there are many wheat-growers in Australia who are prepared to do the same thing. Ever since the wheat industry reached the stage of having a surplus over and above what could be consumed in Australia the growers have bad to be content with export parity prices, or something closely approximating them, for local as well as for export sales. It is true that during the war they received less than export parity rate; but, generally speaking, export rates govern the price -both for the local market and the overseas market. There may be a variation of Id. a bushel or so, but it is rarely more than that. What does this phrase "" export parity rate "" mean ? The honourable member for Echuca( Mr Hill) dealt with the point in his speech last night, and, to my mind, he made the position very clear; but perhaps it will not weary honourable members if I briefly cover the ground again. If the price of wheat in London is 5s. a bushel, and if it costs ls. a bushel to get the wheat on the London market,' the export parity price would be 4s. a bushel. While pay 5s. a bushel for Australian wheat, the Australian buyer would pay only 4s. for the same wheat. The wages of most of those who consume bread in Australia are higher than those of the consumers in Great Britain, yet the consumer here obtains a present equivalent to the cost of sending overseas wheat that is never transported. world prices for the wheat, less the cost of grower suffers a reduction of ls. a bushel transport costs, not merely on what he sends overseas, but on what he sells here. He has to suffer the cost incidental to the transportation of the wheat 12,000 miles, not merely on what he exports, but on every bushel he sells to the protected Australian consumer. We are frequently told that the Australian market is-the better, but if' export parity rates are to be maintained indefinitely as a basis for local as well as for overseas sales, there is no advantage to be obtained by selling on the local market. The grower does not enjoy a local market value for even part of his production. freights rise by 3d. a bushel-and this seems a remarkable paradox-the tralian consumer pays 3d. a bushel less for his wheat, because wheat automatically becomes worth 3d. a bushel less f.o.b. for transportation to the markets of the world. the wheat becomes more and the Australian consumer pays more. From the point of view of the Australian consumer it is better that freight rates Mr Paterson. between Australia, and other countries should remain as high as possible, so long as local prices are on the export parity basis. This is a highly protected country. The grower pays an Australian price for everything' he requires for his farm and his home. The consumers in the big cities, who buy the farmers' wheat in the form of bread, are working for the most part under Arbitration Court or State wages board awards. Wages in this country are made, to a great extent, independent of wage rates ruling in other parts of the world. The wheat-grower naturally asks himself whether, as a citizen of a country where these conditions obtain, and where such a high standard of living exists, he also is not the London buyer would entitled to something like an Australian price for the wheat he sells in Australiato something approaching an Australian wage for that part of the wheat consumed by Australians. He argues-and his view is reasonable, I think, despite the honourable member for Warringah-that at the very least he should get world prices, without any deduction, for the wheat sold He pays in Australia. That is to say, if the world price for wheat is 5s. a bushel, and it transportation. Conversely, tbe costs Is. a bushel to send it overseas, making the net Value in Australia 4s. per bushel, he should be entitled to receive the f u ll world's price of 5s. per bushel for what he sells to the Australian consumer. He is entitled to at least this, even if he does not get import parity rates such as are enjoyed by the secondary manufacturers in Australia. The question is frequently asked, how does the price of wheat affect the price of bread? The honourable member for Warringah said that it was only natural to suppose that if the price of wheat went up the price of bread also would be raised, If , for instance, with the result that the purchasing power of wages would fall. As a matter of fact, Ausdespite variations in the price of wheat ranging from under 4s. to 6s. 8d. a bushel over the last few years, the price of bread has remained practically constant, which shows that If freights fall there is such a margin between the price valuable, of wheat and the price of bread that the baker, the miller, and others who come between the producer and the consumer, can afford to have that margin reduced to some extent. When wheat is 4s. 6d. a will prevent those who are selfishly , inbushel there is approximately 3d. worth of clined from taking advantage of the wheat in a 4-lb. loaf of bread which is situation and placing their wheat on the sold at about ls. If *wheat goes up to 6s. a market when it is desirable to withhold bushel-and that is comparatively highthere is 4d. worth of wheat in a 4-lb. loaf pool is that it makes it possible to have of bread. In England, although wheat only one charterer of shipping, space is considerably dearer than in Australia, instead of half-a-dozen or a dozen combread is cheaper than it is here. I believe that most honourable members are of opinion that in a country in which conditions are artificial the wheat-grower is just as much entitled to receive an Australian rate of remuneration for that part of his product consumed in Australia as is any other member of the community. If that is conceded, then the only way in which two different prices can be maintaineda local price and, an export parity price-is hy means of a compulsory pool, which will compel all and sundry to accept a fair share of both markets. Immediately it becomes possible for an individual or group of individuals to obtain more than the fair share of the more valuable market, the whole thing collapses like a house built of cards. argument in favour of compulsion. I do not like compulsion, as such; it would "" be much pleasanter if we could get along without compulsion of any kind. The fact remains, however, that we are subject to compulsion in many directions, and it is certainly the only way to obtain an Australian price for primary products sold in Australia, where the individual producer has to be dealt with. desire to obtain an Australian price is action of the wheat-growers in demanding a compulsory pool, they are also actuated by other reasons. One is to prevent cut-throat competition in selling, due to there being many sellers, and only a few buyers. That position must he met by reducing the number of sellers, which can he done only by pooling. Another reason is that a compulsory pool would make it possible to spread sales over the longest possible period, instead of having most of them take place at low prices almost immediately after the harvest. There are times when it may be considered wise in the interests of all to reguwould enable both to benefit at the exlate shipments; and a compulsory pool it. Another advantage of a compulsory peting against each other. It has been argued that private marketing has proved superior to pool marketing to the extent of 3d. a bushel; and the statement has been made that those figures refer to average prices. I find it very difficult to give credence to such a statement. I believe that individual holders of wheat who have sold at peak prices may have obtained more than the average of the pool prices; that is perfectly easy to understand. Buti f the average of the free market sales were ascertained and compared with the average of the sales of a well-conducted pool, I believe that it would be found to he lower, or at any rate not higher, than the average of the pool. In any case, it has to be remembered that the fortunate inThat is the great dividual who holds his wheat aud sells it at the peak of the market has had the price made for him by the pool. That explains' why many farmers vote for a voluntary pool when they are given the opportunity to do so; not because they propose to put their wheat into the pool, but because they want the pool to come into existence so that they may enjoy the stabilized market thus created, and at the same time have reserved to Although the themselves the right to put the whole of their wheat on the market when peak the main motive behind the prices are reached. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) has moved an amendment to separate the guarantee from the pooling machinery. I cannot support that amendment, because it seems to me that it would be unworkable and that it would, open up many avenues for corruption. One can readily realize that if a guarantee was to be paid in connection with a transaction between an individual wheat grower and an individual wheat-buyer, collusion would be possible of a kind that pense of the treasury. That really places this proposal out of court. I admit that, in the event of this compulsory pool being rejected by the farmers, it might be practicable for the Government still to give a guarantee in connection with wheat marketed through voluntary pools which it was prepared to recognize; but it would be quite impracticable to give the guarantee to all and sundry. The guarantee itself I regard as a concomitant of the Government's insistence that the growers should increase their areas under wheat. It could not very well urge the growers to increase their areas and at the same time leave them to their fate should the greater production result in lower prices. I consider that the guarantee should be for three years instead of one year. I compliment the honourable member for Echuca( Mr Hill) upon the informative speech that he made last night, and agree with his statement that the responsibility for the guarantee should be borne wholly hy the Commonwealth. I say that because, in certain States, such as Western Australia, if by any chance the average price realized was considerably below the 4s. a bushel guaranteed, the responsibility into consideration and accounted for to the upon that State to make up half the loss would result iu its being impoverished. Only two nights ago, whpn the Cotton Industries Bounty Bill was under discussion in this House, the Government adhered to the principle that the CommonAvealth should pay the whole of the bounty, despite the fact that an amendment was moved providing that the bouuty should be paid partly by the Commonwealth aud partly by the State of Queensland. If the Government considers that it is a fair thing that the Pederal Treasury should stand behind the cotton bounty, when practically the whole of our cotton is produced in one State; if it believes that the wine bounty should be a federal responsibility-althoug h that case is somewhat different on account of the fact that the bounty is to be found by the proin favour of that State? If we go a little ducers themselves; if it considers that the steel bounty, which is paid almost wholly to New South Wales, should be a federal responsibility; and that the same principle should apply in regard to the canned fruits bounty, the greatest proportion of which is paid to Victorian canners. why should there be this discrimination in connection with a guaranAfr. Paterson. teed price for wheat? There would be very much more chance of inducing a State like Western Australia to come into the pool if the (Sommonwealth were to accept the whole of the responsibility rather than attempt to place half of it upon the States. I shall vote for the second reading of the' bill in the expectation that, at a later stage, amendments will be moved that will improve it. I understand that the Government is prepared to accept a considerable number of amendments that have been suggested hy those who are engaged in the industry. To my mind the proviso at the end of the schedule requires to be amended. I agree with an interjection that was made yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham.) respecting the looseness that is noticeable in the drafting of clause 12 of the agreement. There is room for a great deal of tightening-up in the last few lines, which readProvided that prior to the effecting of such equalization any geographical or other advantage enjoyed by .a State before the coming into operation of thu scheme may' be taken State Wheat Board concerned accordingly. I know what those who are engaged in rhe industry consider those 'words to mean.; but we mu3t be prepared for what the High Court, if asked for an interpretation, Avould decide that they mean. They are not sufficiently explicit. For example, the phrase "" geographical advantage "" can readily be understood to refer to the advantage which Western Australia enjoys to-day in regard to freights. But the proviso goes on to say ""enjoyed by a State before the coming into operation of the scheme."" Does that mean that only the advantage at present enjoyed by Western Australia in regard to freights shall be enjoyed in the future, even though, after the scheme has come into operation, there may be a bigger difference further along that line of thought we find that the proviso refers to "" any geographical or other advantage enjoyed by a State."" What is meant by "" other advantage"" ? In certain States there are big local consuming populations, while in others they are comparatively small. The proviso could he construed to mean, either that the States whioh have alarge consuming population shall enjoy the totaladvantages arising out of that population in the selling of a bigger proportion of their wheat at a local price; or that only under review, 1928-1929, offered few those advantages whioh they enjoy before the formation of the pool, and which may amount to Id. or 2d. a bushel, shall be enjoyed proportionately in the future. I suggest to the Minister that it is necessary to amend clause 12 of the agreement in such a way as to make perfectly clear what it is intended to embrace. I have said that I propose to support the second reading of the bill in the exattacks on high tariffs. pectation that amendments will be moved to improve it . That course is dictated by ths fact that I believe in pooling, and that a compulsory pool is the only method by which a local price may be secured. Whether the farmera of Australia desire this or not. can be ascertained only hy submitting the measure to them for their acceptance or rejection. HAM) adjourned.

137,Mr Crouch (Corangamite) [3.25],"I would not like it to go out that inefficient management waa in any way responsible for tbe fact that this company haB not been receiving so many orders lately as it did formerly. Despite what has been said regarding the company, it paid last year a' dividend of 8 per cent, and carried forward a balance of £1,448. I should like the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Forde) to say why the officer of his department, who, apparently, made an adverse report egarding the condition of this company, did not bring to his notice tjhese facts, which are contained in a sworn balance sheet. I understand that, about nine days ago, the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) asked the New South Wales Government for an explanation as to why the amount that had been allocated to it under the Pederal Aid Roads Agreement has not been expended, and that no reply has yet been received. Will the right honourable gentleman state whether there is any possibility of expediting tbe receipt of that explanation. It is regrettable that, when there is so much unemployment, the State Government not only fails to expend money that is provided, but also neglects to supply information that is asked for by the Prime Minister. I should also like to know whether the Prime Minister has received a reply from the New South Wales Government with regard to the distribution of clothing said to have been made available hy the defence authorities for the use of the unemployed in the various States. [3.81] I believe that the honourable member raised the question of the expenditure upon roads the week before last. My records show that we have sent two letters to the State authorities and have not yet received a. reply. I also sent a telegram to Mr Bavin two days ago.
