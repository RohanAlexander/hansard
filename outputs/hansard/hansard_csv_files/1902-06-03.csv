General),"I desire, with the permission of the Honse, and without notice, to move That the Commonwealth, profoundly rejoicing in the restoration of peace, most cordially congratulates the British Government and people upon its attainment, with fervent hopes for the unity and prosperity of South Africa. A cablegram was' received yesterday from . the Sucretary of State for the Colonies announcing that peace had been declared* and it appears to me that much of the value-of the response given depends upon its promptness. I trust, therefore, that bothHouses will agree to this very simple resolution which it is proposed to cable f o London -. immediately, so that amongst the felicitations which flow in from every part of the' Empire, that of the Commonwealth may not be absent. It seems to me that the rejoicing here described as profound, is, indeed, of the most deep-seated character, and that without any distinction of party or of opinion, the whole of the Commonwealth may unite in congratulating our fellow countrymen upon the declaration of ' the peace so long hoped for. We also express a hope for unity and prosperity in South Africa, which, I believe, will be shared without reference to any past events by the whole.of the people of this country.

Minister representing the Prime Minister, without notice, whether he has received any further communications from the State Premiers in respect to concerted action in -dealing with the present conditions arising from the drought, and whether the Federal Government have agreed upon any definite -course ? last week I have received replies from the Premier of South Australia and the Premier of Queensland. The effect of thereply from the Premier of Queensland was that he joined very cordially in supporting the prowhen he was at Fremantle on the 12th posal of the New South Wales Gdvernment that the duties should be suspended. The Premier of South Australia stated that there was a drought in existence in that State, but that, whilst having every sympathy with those who were suffering, he hoped the cluties would not be suspended.' I have this afternoon received the following cable from Mr Lewis, the Premier of TasmaniaBeplyiiig to your telegram of 29th inst. re suggested suspension of duties upon imported grain and fodder, I think it would be very undesirable to. temporarily alter the Tariff for the sake of affording relief to sufferers* from present drought. Tariff should not be subject to fluctuations of sunh producers in States not feeling effects of drought, and might act prejudicially upon merchants, shippers, and others who hare purchaser! or entered into contracts upon faith of existing Tariff. It seems to me that the better course to pursue would be for Federal Parliament to consider direct contribution to States chiefly affected by drought, such contribution to be hased on difference between duty free and duty paid grain and fodder. The returns whicli I promised to-obtain were at once asked for, but all have hot yet been received. They are expected to come to hand to-day or early to-morrow. The States of Victoria and Western Australia have not replied to the communication returns and of replies from all the States,, the Government have not arrived at a final decision as to the best course to be pursued. I may add that I have received a further telegram from the Premier of New South Wales, which reads as followsRe duties on grain and fodder the action proposed must be token by your Government.

That is somewhat strange, a recommendation as to the deposit in these cases being usually made by Elections and Qualifications Committees.

The committee appear to practically admit that an informality did take place in regard to the nomination, ancl, although that informality was not, in their opinion, sufficient to justify the disturbance of the election, it was sufficient to justify the lodging of a deposit and a petition.

26,Mr Watson,"It goes without saying,Mr Hiirtnoll should not also be considered in this connection. In New South Wales on several occasions, 'when elections have been upset, because of informal proceedings on the part of returning ofiicers, the expense of the first election to a reasonable amount has been defrayed by the Government for both candidates. That was the case in no less than perhaps half-a-dozen elections, which I have in my mind's eye. cases where there were second elections 1 present instance the only reason why there is not a second election is that the number of votes polled was overwhelmingly in favour of one candidate, and the committee did not feel justified in putting the country to an expense on the ground of the informality. But that does not absolve the returning officer or the Government from some degree of responsibility. Of course, the Government were not aware beforehand that the returning officer would not do his duty : but the error having occurred, the Government are bound to make some recompense to those who have suffered. If ' Mr mittee as a precedent. The Tasmanian A ct Hartnoll has been put to expense he should be considered, and certainly Mr Whitelaw has a fair claim against the Government. Some time ago I raised objection to the Chairman of the Committee, Sir Edward Braddon, acting in that capacity, considering the part he had taken in the election. I was accused, or the labour party generally were accused, by the Melbourne Argus of taking that action merely from a desire to see Mr Whitelaw returned. But at no time were the labour party in Parliament interested in securing the lodging of the petition, nor were they anxious in any way to prejudice the decision the committee might arrive at. On the part of the labour party it was purely a protest against what they conceived to be a -wrong act on the part of one of the members of the committeea protest dictated by neither party motives nor prejudices. I agree with the honourable member for Kennedy that we should, at the earliest opportuclared, because there was only one nominity, pass the Electoral Bill, which will send nation, should be disallowed, the telesuch inquiries to a body outside Parliament, and away from party and political influence. In the meantime I ask the Government to consider the question whether the deposit whether some consideration should not be extended to that gentleman in view of the expense he has been put to in consequence of an official mistake. not say I agree to the adoption of the report with reluctance, but I do so with a certain amount of hesitancy. I should be sorry to see this finding used afterwards as a precedent for the guidance of the Elections and Qualifications Coinmittee. Naturally, if I looked at the matter from that not apply in the point of view of a mere party man, I should be very glad to see Mr Hartnoll returned; but we can adopt a line free from party bias in matters of the sort, and regard them from a point of view which is purely Commonwealth and national. I can quite understand that the committee, seeing noll, hesitated, or, in fact, declined, to decree that a second election should be held. There was such a small possibilitjof changing the result that a second election would merely have been putting the electorate to trouble and the Commonwealth to expense. A t the same time, I do not think we should adopt this finding of the comseems fairly clear, specifying, as it does, that the nomination must be made in a certain way, namely, that the written consent of the party nominated must be received by the returning officer. nated is out of the countiy. prescribes that one of the most essential parts of the election, namely, the nomination, shall be evidenced by the receipt by the returning officer of a document signed by tlie party nominated before the nomination takes place. Let us imagine what might occur. Suppose there were only two candidates, and one was duly nominated and declared elected because there was no other nomination properly signed before the returning officer. Could any one say that because of a telegram received before the nomination by a returning officer from another candidate, the election degram being strengthened after the election by the receipt of the written consent of the second candidate?

No member could sustain such a position; and yet that follows from the adoption of this report. Whether there were two, three, .or five nominations does not affect the question of the validity of the did not embody my own views of the situanomination of Mr Hartnoll. If we accept Mr Hartnoll's as a valid nomination, and thereby may be placed in the absurd position of upsetting an election in which only one candidate has .been properly nominated, that is a result which I affirm with some hesitancy. A t the same time, I should be sorry to see the tribunal which decides these cases in England substituted for the political tribunal. There is a via media suggested by the South Australian Act of 1896, under which the Elections and Qualifications Committee have tlie guidance of a Judge of the Supreme Court, and in the long run I think that will be found to be the best tribunal. I can answer at once, satisfactorily answer, just out of my teens. Two candidates the question which has been put by the honourable member for Bland in regard to Mr AVhitelaw's deposit. That deposit will be returned. It is not proposed to deduct anything whatever from it, and as a matter of fact the costs in this case differ somewhat nomination day I examined the nomination from costs in connection with higher tribunals in that they are comparatively insignificant. In fact, I do not know that any costs were incurred. As to the report, I shall adhere 1 to it loyally as one of the persons who signed it . A t the same time. I desire to say that it does not entirely embody my views regarding the position. For my own part I think that Mr Hartnoll, iu giving his consent to be nominated as he did, although not formally complying with tlie wording of tlie law, did substantially and sufficiently comply therewith to satisfy a court of equity. Of course the object of the A ct is to prevent a dummy candidate, without his consent, from being put up at the last moment to split the votes for some other candidate, and thus defeat the latter. matter too much. propose fco argue ifc, because I have not attempted to force my .opinion upon the committee. signed is that of the committee, without any demur on my part. honourable member's position is to be found in the unanimity of the coinmittee. very glad that the committee were unanimous, and, therefore, I was pleased to attach my name to the report, even though it tion. bane) -I do not concur in the report of the committee. If I did so I should be swallowing all the common sense that I have gathered since attaining the age of manhood. I do not think the consideration that a large number of votes were cast in favour of Mr Hartnoll should have constituted a factor in the decision of the committee. Of course, I congratulate the noll, that he has not to submit himself for re-election, but I wish to give honourable members a parallel case in which I was concerned, and which happened when I was were nominated. for aldermanic honours in the largest provincial town of Queensland.

The second nomi-. nation paper was duly signed by the candidate, and several nominators had attached their names, addresses, and occupations to it, but others hacl not. I think that seven names were requisite to each nomination paper. When the crowd assembled to hear the speeches of the candidates, I intimated that as one nomination paper was in perfect order, whilst the other was irregular, I had no option but to declare the person whose nomination paper was in order duly elected. I would not argue the Needless to add there were some cheers ancl a few groans. Prompt action was taken by I do not the ratepayers, and the matter was referred to counsel for opinion.

Consideration resumed from 30th May (wife page 13144). Division 26 (Minister's Office), £3,150. Sir AVILLIAMM c MILLAN (Wentworth) I told my right honourable friend, the Minister for Trade and Customs, that when we came to discuss this depart' ment of tlie Estimates, I should like to say a word or two with regard to some matters connected with its administration. I know very well that in dealing with questions of departmental administration one is considering a very different subject from the text of a Bill, or a question of policy arising out of the statement of a Minister. In dealing with u Bill, honourable members know exactly what they are criticising, and it is our duty as legislaamount of revenue possible, to make its coltors to subject every Bill to the most drastic criticism possible. Similarly, when a Minister puts before the House a statement of policy, it invites the strongest and most precise criticism ; but I realize that when a legislative body comes to deal with the details of the administration of a department, every possible allowance should be made for the difficulties surrounding a Minister. Even then it is impossible for this House to know all the intricate relationships which exist between a Minister, his officers, and the public. I wish the committee to clearly understand the principal charge which I intend to make, or, at any rate, upon which I seek for information; because I can assure the Minister for Trade and Customs that my present action is not prompted by any party spirit whatever. It is simply a question with regard to the administration of this great engine of taxation. Indeed, if I were to follow my own selfish bent, as we will have to .appear before our constituents within about eighteen monthsI should say that the more unpopular and tlie more vexatious this extreme form of taxation became, the better would it be for the ultimate result from my point of view. But I wish to read, as the text of my indictment--if I may so term it-the following words from a police magistrate. They are not the words of a Member of Parliament, or even of a member of the Opposition, but those of a man in judicial authority. The same words, if not stronger, are reiterated by a JudgeI do not know whether he belongsto the Supreme Court, or to the District Gourt-who m I shall bring into evidence a little later on. The case to which I refer was tried in Brisbane. It is one in which the difficulties arose to a large extent out of the intricacies of the Tariff, out of the mischievous and very difficult classification which we set up in that Tariff, and which the Minister and honourable members ""opposite were warned by myself and others would be likely to engender a great deal of difficulty and possibly charges of fraud. I take it that the Minister himself, and everv honourable member of this House, irrespective of the party to which he belongs, must hold that whatever taxation may be imposed upon the people, we ought not to do anything that is vexatiously unjust. Compatibly with the due punishment of fraud, we ought,, whilst endeavouring to obtain the largest lection as easy as possible to the citizens. That is a rule the soundness of which will be acknowledged by every right-thinking man. This case of Mc Whirter, of Brisbane, arose out of the difficulty of determining between a line of goods in the piece, and practically the same class of goods under the denomination of ""articles."" I will read! to the committee the exact words of themagistrate, Mr Bankine. MrL . E. GROOM -He is a very capablemagistrate. Bankine saidHe said that he had made up his mind to find, against the defendant, but, at the same time, he wished to express the opinion that the Customsdeportment did not treat importers fairly by not giving full publicity to all charges of duty and decisions of the Comptroller. He also wished to say that in his opinion the action of tbe defendant was absolutely without intent to defraud the Customs of the duty, and the whole matter was purely an error. For thab reason he had decided to inflict the lowest penalty he was able to do. He then fined the defendant £5, with £4 4s. professional costs, and costs of one witness, £1 Is., to be paid within seven days, in default, levy and distress. What I'want to know is this: When we passed the Customs Act, in which there are certain words used which I will read in a moment or two, did we intend that an absolute error was to be punished as a crime ?",19,Election Petitio N Whitelaw V Hartnoll
41,Sir William Mcmillan,"MrI know how difficult it is to discriminate between one individual and another, but thepoint I wish the coinmittee to consider is whether, when we sanctioned certain very drastic provisions to deal trenchantly with fraudulent importers, we did not conceive that the same administrative latitude would be allowed under the administration -of the present Minister for Trade and Customs, as has been allowed under previous administrations ? The Customs Act is remark-ably worded, but Parliament cannot be held to be entirely free from whatever blame attaches for that fault. withAll goods in respect of which any entry, invoice, declaration, answer, statement, or repre.sentation which is false otwilfully misleading in for merchants, to understand the position. any particular, has been delivered, made, or produced.

But the Customs Act applies to the.whole of the merchants of Australia. more, in 999 cases out of 1,000 the principal in the business-the person whosuffers-acts through an agent. gotten that during many months the provisions of the Tariff were changed by the members of the Committee of Ways and Means like the colours of a kaleidoscope, -and it was therefore very difficult for any-one to understand exactly how they applied. Surely fair consideration should be shown under such circumstances? that a Ministry which has made as many blunders as any half-dozen other Australian Ministries should refuse to consider pure errors or mistakes due to want of judgment as anything but frauds. If the same construction had been put upon their mistakes, every one of the Ministers would to-day be in gaol. The position of the merchants of Australia has for months past been one of extreme tension. It has been bad enough Sir William McMillan. for them to find it almost impossible to ascertain from day to day the rate of duty upon various articles, and to ' discover that the classification adopted in the Tariff is in many cases imperfect, and that no satisfactory information was to be obtained from the Customs department. When the administration of the Customs was in the hands of the States authorities, it was centralized, so that those concerned could obtain definite information and uniform decisions. Now, however, the collection of customs duties throughout Australia is being adSection 229 deals ministered from Melbourne, .and in those States where previously the system in force wasdifferent from the Victorian sys.tem, it has been difficult, both for Customs officials and I , myself, am largely interested in the importing business, and would be the last man in the world to say a word against the firm and strong administration of the Customs department. I can point with pride to the record of my firm, and I gladly recognise, that strong administration protects us against would be fraudulent importers. But, surely the community expected some elasticity in the administration of the Custonis Act. When mistakes are made in regard to Inter-State certificatesa very foolish arrangement which the provisions of the Constitution require the department to carry out-the y are mistakes which for the most part cannot benefit those who make them. In most cases the Victorian importer has Furtherpaid more under the Victorian Tariff than he will be called upon to pay under the Commonwealth Tariff'. articles which were dutiable under the Victorian Tariff are free under the Commonwealth Tariff. when the sums involved are very small, and the mistakes cannot benefit the importer who makes them, it is surely ridiculous to It is curious charge him with fraud, and subject him to the unpleasant ordeal of being dragged before a court of justice and having the case blazoned in the newspapers. Tho Tariff contains an enormous number of items, some of the duties having a protectionist incidence, and others being merely of a revenue producing character, and the classification is not of the best. Many firms have had to increase their staff of clerks in order to satisfactorily make (Jut the entries",20,Department Op Trade And Customs

His Honour said it seemed that a case of the least possible gravity had been made out against the defendant, so he would allow no costs except those of four witnesses. I cannot believe that such an extreme step was taken without fully informing the Minister for Trade ahd Customs of the circumstances. But here is a case which the Judge said need never have been brought into court, and which only required a little consideration and the exercise of that elasticity of administration permissible under every Act. In the next case I come to what is no doubt a difficulty with the Minister. I am quite willing to admit that we have made difficulties ourselves, both in the Constitution and in this Act. The provision to keep on the Inter-State arrangements for two years is very ridiculous. Six months would have answered all purposes, and it might have been better from a common sense business point of view if no provision of the kind had been introduced into the Constitution. ' The provision was introduced for a certain 'purpose, whicb I venture to say has never been carried out. It was introduced to avoid the danger of importers' in free-trade States, or in States where the duties were lower than any others, importing largely and flooding the local markets. That has not been done, and there has never been any danger of the slightest interference with trade and commerce in this connection. Some of the items in the Tariff, especially when they are manufactured articles, are so complicated with the products of the States, that it is very difficult to discriminate, and when we have discriminated, the sum involved is so small that a wise administration would practically let it go. Another complication is caused by tlie fact that during the bookkeeping period we have to allocate certain duties to the different States. In large matters, where goods can be traced, it is possible that a State might be injured financially, though not to a very greatextent, by even purely accidental errors in the making out of invoices or certificates. ber propose that we should overlook all small cases 1 Sir AVILLIAMM c MILLAN administration would not deal in a drastic way with such cases as arose in Sydney the other day, when an article worth about 2s., ancl another worth only Id., were in dispute. The man with the I d . article asked the Custom-house officer to calculate tlie 20 per cent, on that amount, as he found it beyond his arithmetical ability. There is a business, common-sense way of dealing with such cases. AVe all have liigh respect for the law, but this is a law that applies to the everyday business of the people throughout Australia. There should be some consideration shown, especially in States whore import duties had been levied for years past, and paid by firms who have never had cast on them the reproach of attempting to deceive or defraud the Customs. There should, be an_ all-round business administration of the department, and not a purely technical, drastic administration, especially in this early period, when errors must arise out of absolute ignorance of the Tariff and its conditions. I will now take the case of Alcock and Co., in regard to which I have received the following :We beg to furnish you with particulars as under, and also enclose copies of certificates concerning Customs case re goods exported per s.s. Talwne to Tasmania :We supplied to the order of Mr E. Emmett, of Hobart, a miniature billiard-table, which was manufactured by us at .Russell-street, and when entered for export was enumerated as Victorian, manufacture. Our customer, on presenting this certificate, was requested to furnish further particulars ; and we then sent him an amended certificate, specifying the slates, cloth, and rubber, which our clerk omitted iu the first certificate. I know how difficult it is for a Minister to get his officers to intelligently carry out his behests, but such a Minister ought to be a little careful that he is not unfair to other people who have also to employ agents. It is not the matter of the money, but the sting of the public prosecution, and the allegation of fraud, which these people feel very keenly. levelled against them. only give the coinmittee the information which I have. This firm is worth plenty of money, ancl any trader would trust them to ten times the amount of which the Customs could have been defrauded.

Is that equality of trade, or free-trade throughout Australia ? Trade is being absolutely obstructed by an unbusinesslike, drastic, and cruel administration of the Customs law.

As the former are admitted free, what is more natural than for a man to 'imagine that the latter come within the same category? I will instance another case which I think proves the objectionable character of the Customs administration. The case to which I refer is that of a man in Adelaide who imports cigarettes for his own use. He saysI have the honour to bring the following matter before you. l?er Himalaya there arrived for my private use 2,000 cigarettes. The ease was shipped in the ordinary way, as cargo, properly entered aud reported by the captain afcfcheCustom-house. On desiring to clear the package, fco my intense surprise, our collector, Mr Bingwood, declined to allow me to do so. I now ask that you will kindly allow me to pay the customs duty, so that delivery can be granted me. As previously mentioned, bhe cigarettes are solely for my own personal use. I have imported bhese cigarettes in same sized lots for years. From the Customs department he received the following reply :Referring to your letter offche1st instant, rethat this is the first occasion upon which questing delivery of 2,000 cigarettes imported for your personal use, lam directed by the Minister for Trade and Customs to reply that the Act aud Regulations are imperative, and without power of relaxation. That is the whole principle involved. The Minister can do nothing, even where a palpable error occurs, or where the case calls for the administration of the Act with a certain amount of elasticity. I do not suggest that the statute should be trenched upon, but in a case of that kind I hold that there was no necessity for the Minister to i exercise the full power vested in him. I would further point out that in the Customs Act particularly the most drastic provisions are embodied. Those provisions were intended to prevent smuggling, and to .apply to aii altogether different state of affairs from that which I have described. There is another matter in which I find a very curious decision on the part of the Minister. Mr Butler, a member of the firm of Sargood and Co., in addressing some of his ' fellow merchants, saysIn the first instance, when, his own firm had been affected by this altered condition of things, they wrote to the Commissioner, and even paid over a cheque as deposit for the amount in dispute to a Customs officer. An answer was afterwards received stating that no money would be accepted on deposit. mistake, and was put right as soon as it was bring other people before the Court for brought under my notice. Sir WILLIAM ""McMILLAN*-Section 167 of the Customs Act saysIf any dispute shall arise as tofcheamount or rate of dnfcy, or asfcofcheliability of goods fco duty, the owner may deposit with""fchecollector, the amount of duty demanded, and thereupon bhe following consequences shall ensue :1. The owner upon making proper entry shall be entitled to the delivery of the goods. 2. The deposit shall ""be deemed the proper duty; unless by action commenced by the owner against the collector within six months after making the deposit,fchecontrary shall be determined, &c. Yet here is a deposit which is absolutely refused through the ignorance of the Customs officers. WhatI contend is that in the early stages of the operation of the Tariff, when the importers and their clerks have to become familiar with its provisions, and when the Customs officers themselves are continually making mistakes, some consideration should be extended to the former. Such a state of things as exists to-day never existed before under any Customs administration in Australia, and is it to be suggested the law is being properly administered ? I claim that the Minister is simply administering it in a hard legal way, without displaying -any business acumen, whatever. The merchants desired to meet the Minister for Trade and Customs, but the latter is so easily induced to do anything that he feared his natural pliability would be worked upon if the gentlemen in question waited upon him. Mr Butler saysThe latter had not always had their way. but they had invariably foundfcheCommissioner of Customs of the day willing bo listen to reason. The present occupant offchatseat, however, had absolutely refused to see the merchants. In effect a Minister says-"" I administer the law ; and you can thank tlie law."" Mr Butler addsi Prior to federation a traveller going to Tasmania had to fill in two sheets of paper, containing a few entries. Subsequently, however, the forms contained 400 lines, each with six or seven divisions, making about 2,400 distinct entries, to get the traveller away. that state of things was altered by us ?

Continuing, the same writer sajsNo attempt was made by the Customs department to discriminate between a glaring attempt to defraudfcherevenue and tlie trifling mistakes inseparable from such a great change in the administration and system. Section 150 of the CustomsA ct refers to foundry used in manufacture of furniture, samples. It saysSmall samples of the bulk of any goods subject force. The landing waiter, however, thought to the control of the Customs may, subject to fche the goods should pay duty, and the case was prescribed conditions, be derived free of duty. There has always been a business-like reguviews took place between importers and lation relating to samples. But in this concollector. There were also quite a numnexion, I have in my hand a letter from a ber of letters sent in by tlie importers to gentleman, who saysAVe herewith give you particulars offchearbitrary way our Customs authorities are acting, goods, which were still on the wharf, were not ""by statute, but by instructions from Melbeing pillaged ; they then notified the Cusbourne.

On 11th No one likes paying taxes afc any time, and it appears to us wise and statesman-like, not to make February last the Customs informed the the application of them unnecessarily harsh fco importers that they had decided to fine them honest traders.

On arrival, our May, beyond acknowledging receipt of the customs clerk went down with the usual forms, above-mentioned letter dated 15th February, and tendered original invoices and the amounfc of the Customs had done nothing, and the goods duty.

We then asked upon what authority landed, in the first instance, in July, 1901. the Customs were imposing a duty upon us above I should like to know from the Minister, and beyond the amount fixed by the House of when he replies, whether his attitude is that Representatives ; the reply was, they simply had every error must be dealt with through the to obey instructions.

In another case the Customs department proceed against the individual owing to were approached by Messrs.

In other words the Customs agreed that. Messrs. George and George Sir William McMillan. should not have paid the duty upon tlie goods and yet refuse to refund it . The Minister's ipse dixit made the goods free at one time and dutiable at another. I would further direct attention to the case of an importer who, on the 5th August, 1901, entered as free-eight cases of metal as specified in the Victorian Tariff then in reported to the collector. Numerous interwhich no reply was' forthcoming. In January, 1902, the importers learned that the can satisfy the proper officer that it is only an error? Must the officer in question distinctions between one man and another, his purpose by all kinds of schemes and machinations. But is it not possible to administer this department as the Lands dements of the States are administered, so the magistrates as trivial and palpable department errors 1 Surely the Minister need not go from cue extreme to another. He has evidentl) found the system in -vogue in his T department, in ""Victoria at least, to be a loose one, but does it follow that he should therefore s a y "" I shall take advantage of the tremendously drastic provisions of the A ct and prosecute all offenders, even where errors are trivial and unintentional "" ? Surely not. Surely where un error has been committed by a firm of undoubted reputation, which has never, in the history of its dealings with the Customs, had a black mark made against its name, and its principals make a solemn declaration upon oath, for which, if untrue, .they are liable to enormous penalties, explaining the error, the Minister should exercise some discrimination ? Once a case is taken into court it is tried almost wholly upon questions of law, and decided upon technical grounds. But surely there should be some elasticity of administration in a department whose officials, who are themselves fallible, come into contact with many thousands of clerks ? I am at one with the Minister, as every honest trader must be, in desiring that fraud shall be put down, and therefore I think that his department should be administered so as to strike terror into the hearts of those who attempt to defraud. Buti t is a scandal to bring before the courts some of the errors which have arisen in connection with entries under a Tariff which is not yeb settled, and whicli underwent kaleidoscopic changes in this Chamber day after day, ancl week after week, so that even the Customs officials could not always interpret it, while some of its provisions cannot be satisfactorily interpreted by any one. While the Customs were collected by the States, those who dealt with the departments were, perhaps, better known to the authorities; there was a tradition whicli was to some extent observed : there was a greater regularity of judgments ancl a more systematic knowledge of the Acts, arrived at by long experience of their working. Those facts helped to prevent many of the scandals which have arisen under the Commonwealth Tariff. A t the present time there must be great difficulty, first in obtaining thoroughly intelligent Customs officials for the administration of the Commonwealth Tariff, and, in the second place, in making those officials understand its intricacies and complexities. It is also very difficult to leave to distant officials the consideration of questions of equity. The cases which I have put before honourable members, however, demonstrate that there has been harshness of adminstration, and a desire to send every cose before the courts, no matter how small and palpable the error concerned. The Minister is well known to be a man of strong character and of great resolution, and his reputation is sufficient to protect him against the attempts of fraudulent importers. Therefore, he might very well conduct his administration with more leniency, and with more consideration for the fallibility of those who have to transact business with his department. ' I trust that in the future he, while in no way playing into the hands of fraudulent importers, will conduct the administration of his department upon broader lines. the difficulty of importers and traders in regard to the Commonwealth Tariff, which is constantly undergoing changes, and in regard to which the authoritative interpretation of the Customs authorities is not readily procurable. W it h regard to the Inter-State trade in particular, there is a great deal of force in the complaints which have been made by, the acting leader of the Opposition. I have seen a number of the forms which traders are asked to fill in, and, to my mind, the Minister, in his desire to give f u l l effect to the provisions of the Constitution, has gone further than is necessary to do justice to the interests of the States concerned. I know from practical experience, and from the information which has been put before me, that, because of the requirement of particulars which it is very difficult, and sometimes almost impossible to obtain, the merchants of the various States are in many respects worse off now in regard to Inter-State trade than they were before the Inter-State customs barriers were removed, and they had to pay duty upon the articles which they exported from State to State. I know of one case in which a firm wits asked to give the bond marks of goods which they had taken out of bond two or three years previously, which eveiy one who has been in trade must know is impossible. It seems to me that justice might be done to States like Tasmania and Queensland by merely requiring statements as to the dutiable constituents of the goods in question, and the Minister might very well reconsider the form of the certificate, with a i view to facilitate Inter-State trade, and at",26,Department Op Trade And Customs
87,Mr Watso N (Bland),"I appreciatethe same time to comply with what I think a foolish provision of the Constitution. It seemed to me, however, that the acting leader of the Opposition took up a wrong position in regard to false entries made concerning goods imported into the Commonwealth. Although he charged me with being an extreme protectionist, aud therefore liable to be prejudiced against importers, I deny that I am either an extreme protectionist or prejudiced in the way he suggests. It is, however, as much to the interest of honest traders and importers as to the interest of the community as a whole, that proper invoices and other information should be given to the Customs in regard to imports. I know of cases, and I dare say the honourable member for Wentworth can recall similar cases, in which men who should be in gaol for frauds against the revenue were let off by Ministers, and I consider it safer to have no Ministerial star-chamber investigation at all.

If the courts cannot discriminate between those who manifestly make errors and those who attempt to defraud, we should pass an amending Bill to enable them to do so. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN is wanted. They cannot discriminate now. them power to discriminate. Buti t would be a bad thing to allow the Minister to do so. Oncei t was known that the Minister was attempting to discriminate as to the degree of criminality in connection with wrong invoices or entries, he would be subject to all kinds of influence, political and otherwise; and, with all Australia to provide cases for investigation, he would find his time very fully occupied. I object to the decision of these cases being left to any permanent officer. They should be brought into the open light of day, and if the court should decide that-merely an error has been made, the magistrate or Judge should have the opportunity oi inflicting u nominal fine, or of dispensing with the penalty altogether. Mr V. L. SOLOMON -The honourable member would haul respectable merchants before a police magistrate for every paltry offence. Mv. WATSON -If a man breaks the law, let him be brought before the court. honourable member think that business can be carried on without errors ? Mv. WATSON -No; but in Sydney merchants have fallen into the habit of employing boys of fifteen and sixteen years of age to do the very important work of filling in these entries for the Customhouse. importers cannot afford to employ men, but all the larger importers do so. take care to insure himself against errors must expect some trouble. It is undesirable fraud, and that is the danger that confronts ns, unless some degree of firmness is shown I do not pretend to by the Minister. We must protect the revenue, and also the honest traders. Notwithstanding that complaints have been urged for a long time, even up to the present day, regarding tlie congestion of work in the Custom-house in Sydney, I find that only last Saturday, the Minister discharged every temporary hand who had been employed there. Further than that, he has given instructions that the permanent hands, who are already working at high pressure, shall work overtime as well. what I state is correct, and I think it is about time that we organized a union among the Custom house officers, and brought them out on strike. The Minister has been treating the men in the Sydney Custom-house in an absolutely outrageous fashion. In Melbourne, the Customs staff have to do only three-fifths of the amount of work performed in Sydney, and yetthenumbev of hands employed in the Melbourne Custom-house is greater, and the salaries paid are higher than in Sydney.

The permanent hands are required to work overtime. whether or not the reduction of hands was decided upon the advice of his local officer 1 improper that the business should be allowed to become more congested than it is now, owing to the direction of the Minister. is impossible for the staff in Sydney to cope with the work, and the sooner a strike is organized amongst them the better. If they have any backbone, and are not a lot of spineless creatures, they will strike. continuously, some of them without being paid a fraction for overtime. They have been required to work night after night, after working during the day, and all night in some cases. Some ofiicers go to work at eight o'clock in the morning, and work until five in the afternoon, and at five minutes to five are told that they must come back and work until eight the next morning. They work on from eight to five next day, without having one extra fraction allowed to them in consideration of their long hours. Yet this is called a liberal Government. If these officers are employed on behalf of a private firm, they are allowed Is. 6d. per hour overtime, but if they are required to work on behalf of the Government they get nothing. Notwithstanding that section 84 of the Constitution provides that all accrued and accruing rights of officers shall continue, and that the outdoor officers, of whom I speak, prior to the imposition of the Federal Tariff received 15s. per night under such circumstances as I have described, they are not now allowed any overtime whatever, although they are put to the expense of finding their food for . several meals in succession, whilst they are away from their homes. Customs Regulation No. 12 provides that outdoor officers, including tide waiters, boatmen, and searchers, .shall be paid overtime at the rate of Is. 6d. per hour from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m., and 2s. 6d. per hour from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. This is interpreted to mean that officers shall only be allowed these rates when their services are paid for by private individuals. If outdoor officers are employed in doing exactly the same work for the Government, they do not receive one penny of overtime, even though they work glut continues in for 36 or 48 hours at a stretch. It is the meanest and most contemptible thing in the world to ask men to pay for their dinner, supper, and breakfast out of their own I should like the Minister to say pocket under such circumstances. I trust that the Minister will see his way to make an immediate alteration. any criticism that I have to offer upon the administration of the Customs department, I feel a certain amount of sympathy with the It Minister, who has had to perform the great task of bringing into existence a Tariff for all Australia, and to administer it equally and promptly in all parts of the Commonwealth. I also agree that the fact that the Minister was so long bound to the table These men have been worked of this House during the consideration of the Tariff affords some excuse for imperfections in the arrangements for administration during that period. But we ought now to see some order emerging from the chaos which has prevailed throughout Australia. We ought to have ' some indication from the Minister of when and how he proposes to remedy the state of affairs which has been rightly complaiued of. It is a mistake to suppose that these are merely difficulties in the way of merchant traders and importers. They are difficulties in the way of conducting the trade of Australia, and they impose an extra charge upon the people, making the burdens of conducting business under federation heavier instead of lighter. One of the first necessities in the Custom-housea necessity which will always exist-is that of prompt decisions. Even if wrong, decisions ought to be prompt, so long as they apply equally to all. A wrong may be remedied later, but trade cannot go on unless decisions be made at once. This promptitude is essential in the Customs department more than in any other department of the Commonwealth. Some provision must be made by which, from one end of Australia to the other, the provisions of the Act, and the decisions under it, shall be made known to all concerned, so that uot merely the man in Melbourne or Sydney, but the man in Port Darwin or Fremantle may know how to quote his goods aud give",29,Mcmillan Suppose The That Errors Should Be Made Excuses For

Before federation a State had only two or three ports within close hail to deal with, but now the Customs department have under their control the enormous free board of all Australia. To recognise the difficulties is easy, but these difficulties must be remedied if we are to be equal to the task we undertook with federation. A body of officers must be established who will decide, subject to the Minister's veto; officers who, in the light of their experience, will be able to decide even better than can a Minister. Some plan must be found by a collection of samples at each port, with a number, code, or other means of promptly arriving at these decisions, and having these made known at Once throughout Australia. I am not going to give examples, in addition to those furnished by the honourable member for Wentworth, showing how unnecessary have been the actions in court in connection with errors in entries. I resisted several of the drastic clauses in the Customs Bill, but these were passed on the assurance of the Minister that discretion would be used in administration. But how can there be any discretion when officers are told that errors, however slight, are sufficient to justify law proceedings 1 The Government has been accused of being a lawyer's Government, ancl it certainly is so in its composition. an accusation; it is a wholesome fact. learn that the Government is going to administer Acts for the benefit of lawyers.

As a matter of fact, a case of that kind did occur in Melbourne, where a firm, in connection with two cases of kerosene, were prosecuted for putting, or omitting to put, a little stroke on the customs entry, though no one was affected by the act. The Minister says that he cannot discriminate, and in that I agree with him to some extent. A Minister is particularly exposed to political influence. However that may be, there is nothing to prevent the appointment at the principal centres of two or three leading officers to recommend whether or not prosecutions shall ensue; and, unless for very good' reasons, these constant appeals to the law courts should not be allowed. If all the departments of the State were administered as the Customs department now is, the Commonwealth would involve nothing but a series of law cases day after day I do not know whether the Minister prosecutes firms who make an error of Is. in favour of the Customs. many cases. in which higher duties than necessary have been paid. claimed immediately. he will not give refunds.

I presume that gristing in bond is being done in Melbourne. when ship's stores were required, which it was to our advantage should be supplied by Australia, and an application was made to grist in bond for that purpose^ the Collector of Customs declared that.he had no power to give the necessary permission.

Minister must show his capacity. He must adopt a system which will produce uniformity. He will have to leave things to some extent to his officers. I am afraid that in the strength of his. own self-confidence he does not lean sufficiently upon the large experience of hisofiicers. Regarding the matter alluded toby the honourable member for Bland, I wish to point out a rather extraordinary piece of administration. I quite agree that it is very undesirable to permanently increase the Customs staff. As the Inter-State duties disappear, and the fearful Inter-State certificates vanish, the Minister ought to have available a staff more than sufficient to copewith the Custom-house work of Australia.. It would be unjust to permanent officers who have been a long time in the service if hewere to appoint new officers permanently,, and if as a result at some future date, when reductions became necessary, some of the older officers had to go. But where there is congestion and it continues, as it has continued in New South Wales, an effort should be made in the interests of the department, of the community, and of the employees of the Custom-house, toend it by the only means possible, namely, by employing temporary hands to any degree that is necessary to overtake thearrears of work, and to enable the department to deal day by day with the work of the day.. I think that the Minister ought to give his. attention to this. It is quite evident from the returns of imports and exports that a great deal more work is done in Sydney with the same staff than is done in Melbourne. permanent officers in Sydney. in the statement that the Sydney staff is not larger. I was merely looking at the relative cost of the two staff's. A t any rate the Sydney staff is not as expensive as is the Melbourne staff, and yet it is doing a much larger quantity of work. It will be remembered that the Minister for TradeI admit the Minister's and Customs promised that these officers should get consideration, and that they should be given leave of absence. Let us observe the way in which it is proposed to redeem that promise. Documents have",31,Mcmillan Suppose The That Errors Should Be Made Excuses For

The Minister's instructions are(a) Every officer who is in ill-health, or is suffering from over-work, may have leave as approved ; (b) That officers who have worked overtime may also have leave, subject to the approved conditions. The conditions mentioned in paragraph (b) are that any officer who has worked not less -than 50 hours' overtime may, subject to the -approval of the Comptroller-General, be allowed one day's leave of absence for every -eight hours' overtime, but not exceeding in any case six weeks.

I understand that in consequence -of the temporary officers being removed upon the 31st May, leave of absence for -overtime has not been given to any officer. If the congestion complained of continues ""to be as permanent as it has been in the past, relief should be given. It is becoming accepted in Sydney, though it ought not to be, that important entries, or any large number of entries in connection with one shipment, take 24 hours to be got through. That should not be. I am not blaming the staff, because I believe that they are doing their utmost to meet the new conditions. Of course, the-Sydney office is put to a more severe test than is the Melbourne office, because the Commonwealth Tariff is somewhat similar to the Victorian Tariff, and the amount of business, done in Melbourne is not so great as the amount done in Sydney. I think that the Minister should provide sufficient temporary assistance to allow the leave of absence, which has been promised, to be taken, and to get the work up-to-date. It is only when it has been got up-to-date that he will be able to determine how many permanent officers are needed to keep it so. that the relief the..honourable member refers to was ordered before the end of March. of merchants, that [for a quarter or half a century they haye been dealing with the Customs without 'once having their names on the black book, .is worth maintaining by the Customs authorities; but it will be destroyed if merchants feel that, do what they will, they cannot escape being dragged before the courts for what are trifling errors. formerly, merchants' were willing to assist the Customs against fradulent importers, they will cease to do so if these prosecutions are continued. success of the Customs officials in collecting revenue and restricting illicit importation has been due to the active assistance given by honest importers. WhatI suggest is that the Minister should appoint two or. three of his leading officers to form a committee to recommend whether prosecutions should or should not take place, he, of course, overlooking their recommendations. If the feeling of pride in honourable dealing is destroyed, it will do a great deal of injury to the administration of the Customs department. Then, again, I say, do not let important Customs officials feel that because they are away from the centre of administration they can come to no decision, even in regard to the smallest matter, or after consultatiqp with their confreres in other States, until there has been a decision by the Minister. If they feel that, the spirit of the staff is destroyed. I know that, in some of the States, ofiicers are beginning to despair in regard to this matter. They are beginning to feel that they are not being allowed to perform the high duties of which they are capable, and for which they are paid, but must, like mere clerks,'wait for the decision of the Minister, even in small matters.

There have been other cases in which delay has extended over one, two, and even three months. There was some excuse for delay at first, because the departextreme powers should not be administered ment was in a chaotic state, and the Minister was busily engaged'upon the Tariff; but that time has passed, and it should now be shown that the right honourable gentleman can administer his department upon lines sufficient for the Commonwealth which must be different from those which were considered sufficient under State administration. MrV . I i . SOLOMON (South Australia). I am not surprised at the difficulties which our mercantile community has had to face since the passing of the Customs Act, because honourable members will remember that while that measure was under consideration, I on several occasions called attention to the extreme severity of its proa ship's manifest, and under seal and' control visions, and the eriormous discretionary power it gave to the Minister. The reply I received was that it was necessary for the protection of the revenue to give extraordinary powers to the Minister, but that those powers would not be used unfairly, unjustly, or in such a manner as to hamper ( trade. I am inclined, with the last speaker, to make a large allowance for errors in administration on the. part of officers in the my liberty, such as was never contemplated different States, and' for the fact that the department is administering a new Tariff, which during many months was being altered everyday, and a CustomsA c t which, while containing most of the good provisions of the Acts which were in force in the States, also containsiall the out-of-date and stringent provisions of the Customs legislation of the older countries of the world. Some of these provisions were necessary, but some of them have always been regarded as a dead letter, and are now, for the first time, being put into ,force in such a manner as'to hamper trade. , ( barism. MrV . L . SOLOMON -They are relics of the time when a coastguard had to be maintained upon the shores of England to prevent smugglers from landing dutiable goods, such as spirits, tobacco, and laces, upon lonely places on the coast. That these provisions should be literally administered, ! according to their legal and 'exact meaning, to the detriment of legitimate and fair trade, seems to me to be a hardship. I supplied the acting-leader of the Opposition with particulars relating to the importation of a small quantity of cigarettes. This case shows how necessary it is that provisions in the Customs Act conferring literally Section 53 provides that spirits, opium, tobacco, cigarettes and cigars shall not be imported except in packages as prescribed by regulation, the penalty provided for a breach of this section being fixed at £ 1 0 0 . Regulations have been framed prescribing certain sized packages for these articles, the object being to prevent the smuggling of small quantities of spirits, tobacco or opium, or other highly-dutiable articles, in small packages by sailors and others. It was never intended by such a provision to prevent any citizen of the Commonwealth from importing a small quantity of any of these articles in a legitimate manner under of the Customs. It would be absurd to say that because the regulations prescribe that cigarettes shall not be imported in packages weighing less than 10 lbs., I should be precludedfrom importing 1,000special cigarettes weighing say only 5 lbs., provided they were imported under the ship's manifest, and a proper invoice were produced in regard to them. That would be an interference with when the A ct was passed. It was never intended that any one should be prevented from importing any quantity of goods so long as it was done legitimately. The Customs Act is intended to protect the revenue and not to hamper trade. In the case to which I have referred, a gentleman imported a small parcel of 2,000 cigarettes for his own use, in accordance with a practice which he has followed for many years. These goods were always entered on the ship's manifest, and always paid the duty. It was never intended that the Act should be so strained as to apply to a case of that kind, but to small quantities of goods not appearing on the ship's manifest. When the Chinese steamers arrive at Sydney the detectives assist the Customs-house officers in rummaging the ship from stem to stern, in some cases tearing down partition? and linings, in order to discover contraband goods. They often discover thousands of cigars, and it",33,Mcmillan Suppose The That Errors Should Be Made Excuses For
136,Mr Wilks,"They are relics of baris of no use for any one to say that they intended to import these goods legitimately, because they are not on the ship's manifest. If they were, there could be no fraud. In the case referred to, the importer applied to the Customsi n the ordinary course, and presented Iris entry to clear his cigarettes, but he was told by the Customs authorities that they could not accept' the duty, that the cigarettes were confiscated, and that the law must be administered to the letter. Wasi t ever intended that goods should be 1 -confiscated under such circumstances? -am sure that the Minister must see that .injustice has been done, and that the law was never intended to be applied in , that way. was before this Chamber, I frequently pointed out the unfairness of jjroviding for a minimum penalty. It was provided that, no matter how trivial an offence might be, the fine of £ 1 0 0 could be reduced only to OJie-twentieth of that amount. deavoured to induce the committee to provide that the minimum should be reduced ""to £ 2 , or one-twentieth of the maximum fine, whichever might be the lesser amount, fout I was defeated. I contended that it ""was a mistake to provide for any minimum, and that it was preferable to give the court ful l discretion, especially as many technical breaches were likely to occur in the early history of a new Tariff. It has been pointed -out that sub-section(i) of section 229 provides that all goods in respect of which any entry, invoice, declaration, or representation is false or wilfully misleading in any particular, shall be forfeited; and clause 234 provides that a penalty not exceeding£100 shall be inflicted. Therefore, for the most trivial error a respectable merchant may be hauled before the court, and subjected to a fine of not less ""than £ 5 , in addition to suffering confiscation of the goods. Merchants are brought before the courts on charges arising out of trivia] errors, and their reputations suffer ; because the public do not understand that the breach of the law is of a purely technical character, in which no fraud is involved. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN to be amended. MrV . L . SOLOMON -Yes, in the direction of permitting the court which finds that only a trifling error has been made to inflict a nominal fine. I agree with the honourable member for Wentworth that it would be very much better if, for a few months, whilst the mercantile community are becoming used to the various-intricacies of the Tariff, the heads of the Customs department were to exercise the discretion which I think they undoubtedly possess, and inflict small fines, such as would make those concerned a little more careful in the future. I do not allude to cases of smuggling or to instances in which invoices are falsified with the object of defrauding the revenue, but to trivial errors, in which only a few shillings are involved, and in connection with which no suspicion I of fraud can lie upon the firm concerned. Can we imagine such a firm as that of Sargood, Butler, and Nicol, or that of Messrs. Stephenson, who pay hundreds, or perhaps When the Customs Bill thousands of pounds in every year in customs duties, being guilty of making wilful misrepresentation involving a gain of, at most, a few shillings. Every business man knows that he must be perfectly honest and straightforward in all matters connected I enwith the Customs department, and that any other policy does not pay. We hear of cases of under-valuation, and of attempts to defraud the Customs, and it is because of these that the Customs laws and regulations are made much more stringent than even the laws which protect our lives and property. is very strict. MrV . L . SOLOMON -The administration of small matters is, I think, too strict. I desire to make every allowance for the difficulties of the Minister. He has the department in six States, and the officers of six States to control, and though some of the ofiicers are smart enough, others may be stupid, and it must be found no easy matter to get the Customs Act administered in a thoroughly intelligent manner. Some system might be adopted by which the Collector of Customs should in trivial cases report, and make a recommendation, before a case is dragged into court; and it might be found that a small fine would meet all the circumstances. I have no desire to cast any reflection upon the competency of Customs ofiicers, who, no doubt, have had a The Act ought veiy hard time, owing to the continual alterations in the Tariff. Merchants themselves have experienced the greatest difficulty, and I have often been appealed to in South Australia as to the meaning of certain lines in the Tariff, the officers, on one occasion, placing goods under a certain heading, and on another occasion,",34,Mcmillan Suppose The That Errors Should Be Made Excuses For
137,Mr Watson,"And the administrationimposing duties on the same goods under quite another heading. No doubt merchants are patient enough to submit to the trouble which this entails, but they object to have their slightest lapse treated as a criminal offence whilst Customs-house officers go on making mistakes and giving -wrong decisions day by day. A policeman is generally credited' with a willingness to go to a great extreme in order to prove his charge, and I am much afraid that there is a good deal of the policeman in many of the Customs-house .officers, an inclination being shown to exaggerate trivial offences. There have been a great number of complaints as to the difficulties which are placed in the way of manufacturers and traders in shipping to the other States. Manufactures have been established longer in Victoria, perhaps, than in the other States, and it is here that the greatest difficulty is experienced. The Constitution provides that the duty on goods passing from one State to another during a period of five years from the establishment of a uniform Tariff are to be credited to the Statei n which the goods are consumed. In shipping a parcel of goods manufactured in Victoria to Tasmania or New South Wales, it is necessary to put on the Inter-State certificate sufficient information to enable the Government to keep an account of the amount of duty which shall be credited to the State of consumption. It is stipulated that the .certificates must show what portions of the manufactured articles have paid duty, what the duty amounts to, and what proportion is on the free list or the product of Victoria. Great difficulty arises from the fact that the Customs departments insist upon the most ridiculous details being given. Only a few weeks ago a small parcel of furniture, valued at £ 1 1 or £ 1 2 , manufactured in Victoria, was seized and detained in Hobart because a very trivial error had been made in stating the amount of tlie duty which hacl been paid on a portion of the material used in the manufacture. The difference between the Inter-State certificate and the revised certificate was something less than 3s., and yet this parcel of furniture was detained for many weeks. No one could possibly get any profit; no one could be wronged to the extent of a penny-piece, the only question being whether Tasmania should be credited with, say, 10s. or with 13s. If the details of . .everv item of material used in the manufacture have to be given, it will mean that in connection with a suite of furniture valued at £ 3 10s., particulars must be furnished of the timber, if imported, of the glue, the varnish, the webbing, tlie springs, the flock, and the covering. That will be such a hamper on Inter-State business that people will decline to . 'trade. We want common sense and 'discretion exercised by the Customs officers, and so .long as a reasonably intelligentrecord of the duties between the different States is kept, details should not be insisted upon. The people interested in this particular parcel of furniture could not even get a reply from ""the Customs-house, and though there was no power to confiscate, there was detention for a long period. There was no attempt to attribute fraud, or any idea of fraud ; the error simply arose from some carelessness on the part of a clerk. If errors of this kind occur as against one State, the chances are that on the next occasion an error may occur in favour of the same State, and in the end, after years of account-keeping, each State may safely be expected to get the amount to which it is fairly entitled. to which these errors would make a serious difference : it is "" the mickle makes the muckle."" The business done with Tasmania is mostly retail. MrV . L . SOLOMON -If I ship 100 cases of Hennessy's brandy, which has paid duty in Victoria, to Sydney, it is an easy matter to give an accurate return to the Customs. mostly in the case of manufactured goods. MrV . L . SOLOMON -T f we do not want to hamper trade reasonable discretion must be exercised. Something has been said regarding delays in the Customs department. I have had one or two instances brought under my notice. For example, in July, 1901, a Chinese merchant, at Port Darwin, had a package of merchandise seized by the Customs for under-valuation. As the sub-collector of Customs there would not act upon his own authority, the case was reported, and the d&cuments connected therewith were referred to the South Australian department. There the matter has been "" hung up "" ever since. No decision has been given, and, as far as I can learn, no legal proceedings have been taken.",35,Mcmillan Suppose The That Errors Should Be Made Excuses For

I am merely complaining of the delay which has occurred, and which is altogether unreasonable. am sure that the Minister for Trade and Customs desires that his department should work smoothly. But I ask him to interpret the Customs Act in a more liberal way to the mercantile community, and not to consider that every business trader and merchant is attempting to "" get a t "" the department. Every business firm is likely to make errors, especially under the operation of a new Tariff. I ask for no consideration to the man who is detected doing something which has even the appearance of an attempt to defraud the Customs. But in trivial cases where there is palpably no intention to defraud, I ask the Minister to administer the Act in such a way as not to inflict needless trouble and annoyance upon the mercantile community. wish to emphasize what the honourable member for Bland has said in regard to the working of overtime by Customs officials and the payment of proper allowances to them. It is a notorious fact that the department has been guilty of working its employees overtime to' an extent which is exceedingly reprehensible, seeing that ir, is not being paid for. I would also urge upon the Government to abstain, as far as possible-seein g that we are at the beginning of winter-fro m discharging men The attractions of South Africa are very, very great, and unless we take steps to retain our workers we shall be losing, them altogether. I hope, therefore, that the Government will not unnecessarily discharge men at the present juncture. There is another matter to which I wish to direct special attention. Some eighteen months ago, in the Victorian Parliament, I moved for a return -showing the number .of Government employees who were working seven days a week. 1 have that return in my hand, and it reveals the fact that eighteen watclimen, fourteen boatmen, engine-drivers, &c, the master and crew of the steamer Lady Loch, 47 light-house keepers, two labourers, six clerks and five weighers, besides the tide inspectors and surveyors, come within this category. I recognise that it is necessary that light-house We should lay it down absolutely that keepers should be employed for seven days a week, but I have yet to learn that they should not be relieved at certain .seasons of the year. are not under my control at present. As regards the other men, where they work I seven days a week, it is a special term of 1 their employment for which payment is made. a return supplied 03' the Government of Victoria. I know that the tide inspectors and surveyors, who receive a far higher salary than is paid to the watchmen and boatmen, are compensated for working upon Sunday. I do not object to that. Buti n this connection I desire to read a letter which I have received only to-day from the wife of one of the employees to whom I have alluded. She saysMy husband has to work 365 days a year without an equivalent in the way of extra pay or holidays at any time. The higher paid officers are allowed exti a payment or days off, and I appeal to you to do something to give these Customs employees tlie rest which is their right. of their employment that they shall work upon Sundays, and accordingly they receive a higher rate of pay. . extra pay has been given will not meet the case. These men' receive 110 holidays. I hold that neither this Government nor any other Government have any right to work their employees seven days a week all the year round. Under such circumstances what home life can there be ? A Commonwealth that can establish a public service such as we have established, and pay salaries such as we are paying has no excuse whatever for employing men seven days a week. I trust that the Minister will give this matter his earnest consideration. In my capacity as secretary of the Anti-Sweating LeagueI had occasion some time ago to issue a circular to a number of warehousemen who were employing their watchmen seven days per week. To their honour, be it said, they arranged in Some cases to allow their watchmen one day's leave a fortnight, and in others one day a week. Surely the Government can do likewise. I quite recognise that a certain amount of work is necessary upon Sunday, but surely men can be relieved from duty upon some other day of the week.",36,Mcmillan Suppose The That Errors Should Be Made Excuses For

Does the Minister consider that too much for six days' work ? I contend that the Commonwealth Government should insist, as a matter of high policy, that no man in their service shall work, even as a matter of .choice, and for extra remuneration, more than six days a week. the members of the Opposition throughout the session has shown that, while they are opposed to the protective Tariff which the Government introduced, they are anxious that duties legally imposed shall be collected, and that the administration of the CustomsA ct shall be sufficiently drastic to prevent frauds upon the revenue, and to protect the honest trader. But had the Opposition desired to obstruct business, a. whole series of motions for adjournment might have been occupied in ventilating the complaints which have been put before the committee this afternoon by such admitted authorities on mercantile matters as the honourable member for Wentworth, and the honourable member for North Sydney, who has had experience in both New South Wales and Victoria. Not only has scream ing been done by the merchants of New South Wales, but the merchants of Victoria, who have been accustomed to the How wouldlevying of protective duties for years past, have screamed still more loudly. It has been suggested that an Amending Bill should be introduced to give the courts discretionary power, when cases are brought before them under section 229, paragraph i , of the CustomsA ct dealing with goods In respect of which any entry, invoice, declaration, answer, statement, or representation which is false or wilfully misleading in any particular has been delivered, made, or produced. The phrase "" false or wilfully misleading"" amounts to a confusion of terms, since an error is in its nature false, although it may not be wilfully misleading. The Minister was complimented very highly upon tlie drafting of the original Bill, and, I suppose, Parliament) must take the blame for any fault that may be found with the wording of the Act. I think, however, that it would be well to make the provision read ""knowingly false."" a conviction. would add the words "" in the opinion of the court."" Sub-section (i) of section 229 is faulty, in so far that it does not give discretionary power either to the Minister or the courts in regard to the infliction of penalties, and I hope the Minister w i ll attach due weight to the representations made by honourable members who have had a wide experience in commercial matters as to the necessity of introducing an amending Bill. It is not because we do not agree with the policy of the Tariff that we are adversely critizing its administration, but it is our duty, whilst fully observing the intentions of Parliament, to make ib as little vexatious as possible. Appeals have been made to the Minister from not only New South Wales, but from South Australia and Victoria, to adopt a less rigorous system of administration, and to show more consideration for the trading community, and I hope that he will follow the course which has been so strongly recommended by the honourable member for Wentworth and the honourable member for North Sydney.

I admit that there have been delays, and it is a wonder that there have not been more. Some honourable members may have hacl experience in connection with the Customs work of a State and the introduction of a Tariff. Rut here we are concerned with the Customs work of six States. Complaints have been made of delay owing 'to the necessity for reference to headquarters. That is natural. In the initial stages of the operation of the Tariffi t is impossible to secure uniformity without delay. I hope and believe that a good many of the difficulties which have been experienced are rapidly passing away. But I hold that if we give absolute independence of administration in each State, we cannot achieve uniformity. What is the good of a uniform Tariff, if it is not administered uniformly? members imagine that, at my time of life, I wish to take a lot of work upon myself which I could reasonably avoid? We must, have centralization and one controlling head of the department for some time. A t a time like this the Minister ought to do all that he can for the purpose of ascertaining what is going on, and of regulating matters according to what he believes to be the wish of Parliament, instead of leaving everything to the heads of the different States, in which case uniformity would be absolutely impossible. If we have independent State administration unless we train the officers in the initial stages in the way they should go, we shall have a higgledy-piggledy mess, and uniformity will be impossible of achievement. come the day when it need not continue. I hope that honourable members will not think that I am taking their criticisms unkindly-nothin g of the sort. I venture to think that whenever I have beenbrought into contact with them in connection with these matters I have exhibited ' an inclination to inquire into the complaints made, and to set matters ""as right as right can be."" Whether 'it is privately offered in the way of a friendly hint or publicly offered in the wayof criticism I am only too delighted to consider any point which may be raised. The mischief of the thing does not lie in the Customs Act, but in the Constitution itself. It rests in the various provisions of the Constitution having reference to Inter-State trade. It lies especially in section 92, which requires certain payments', to be made for a period of two years, and in section 93, which requires certain bookkeeping, and the collection, therefore, of the necessary particulars for a period of five years. I should be onty too glad if these provisions were possible of abolition. I may have done something to soften their character as regards the collection upon goods when they are not for sale. But when goods are for sale we have to hold the scales very carefully between the traders of the various States. People, who are competing with each other for existence in the matter of trade have a right to the protection which the Constitution provides until provision is made to the contrary. Under section 92 of the Constitution we have to collect the federal duty less any amount Uo honourable previously collected, and under section 93 we are required to keep the particulars between tlie States so that we may return to the consuming States the duties that have been collected in other States upon the goods which they consume. Faced by this difficulty, what are we to do ? I do not think that the question, harassing, as it is, is of sufficient importance to warrant an alteration of the Constitution. A t the same time the Government would hail with delight any provision by which the inconveniences arising from the administration of these sections could be obviated. We have done what we could for the purpose of devising a best way out of the difficulty. We feel that the States are entitled to be heard upon a matter of this sort. It is a questioned no small importance particularly to two States, namely, Queensland and Tasmania, and especially -to the latter. Within seven months the amount credited to Tasmania, consequent upon the keeping of accounts in connection with Inter-State duties, amounted to something like £30,000, or between £4,000 I or £5,000 a month, or say £50,000 or",40,Mcmillan Suppose The That Errors Should Be Made Excuses For

171,Mr Kingston,"No, ancl I shall wel£60,000 a year. say that if Tasmania lost that amount, in addition to what she generally loses, it would be a very terrible blow to her. The relation between Victoria and Tasmania is such that Victorians often supply Tasmanian wants, and sometimes small orders of an almost retail character. Honourable members will notice that it is chiefly in connection with Tasmania that the trouble has arisen. Any laxity in administration would naturally be vehemently protested against. It has been suggested that there is laxity. ""When we consider that strict administration means £60,000 annually to Tasmania, and the prevention of Victorian goods being landed there to the detriment of Tasmanian merchants, I do not think there is room for doubt that we ought to do all we can to administer the law strictly until we get some other arrangement to the contrary. But the sooner some other arrangement is made the better. We considered this matter very carefully, and brought it under the notice informally of some of the Premiers of the several States. We will do everything we can to facilitate . an arrangement between the States, if it can be made, to avoid the necessity for these collections under section 92, with the consequent inconvenience of the keeping of books, which is troublesome, costly, and objectionable from every point of view. If we can come to an arrangement by which the Inter-State bookkeeping can be avoided, we shall not hesitate to ask Parliament to allow us to do so. It may be that the only way in which we can do it is by intimating to the House that we have the approval of the States fco its abolition, and intend to act accordingly. I have no doubt that the reception of such a statement would be of the most encouraging character, and that the necessary indemnity measures would be passed to prevent injury being . done to any one concerned. As regards Customs legislation and administration, we know no parties. I was indebted to various honourable members opposite for very valuable suggestions in connection with the framing of the Customs Act, which I think we made a very fair measure, and one which is aconsiderable improvement -upon the old State legislation. We admit, however, that there are various points which still require legislative attention. We cannot ask Parliament to deal with the matter this session, but I have already I do not hesitate to taken steps to place the Government in communication with Chambers of Commerce aryl pf Manufacturers, and with other commercial bodies possessing information upon thp! subject, whose advice may be of service to us. We intend to suggest to them that they should at the earliest date-perhap s after the holding of conferences of representatives-submi t for our consideration points in regard to which the}' are strongly of opinion that the A ct or the regulations should be altered. So far as possible, we desjre to confine these alterations to matters of general importance; we do not wish to introduce a measure to deal with a number of matters which are hardly worth considering. The recommendations made to us will receive our most careful and courteous consideration, and it is our intention to avail ourselves of the advice proffered to us after we have sifted the wheat from the straw. I have given a lot of attention to the Act itself, but I have not been able to give quite as much attention to the regulations; and I think that honourable gentlemen will credit us with a desire to make our legislation and administration as perfect as possible. W it h regard to the making of Customs entries, I contend that we should be told the truth in every cape, unless the circumstances are such that errors cannot reasonably be avoided. It is the duty of the importer to have regard to what I may almost call the sanctity of his entry, because his honour and credit is at stake when he makes a declaration. No excuse of carelessness on his own part or on that of his clerk ought to be accepted. compelled to make a declaration in regard to something of which he cannot have personal knowledge. He receives an invoice which tells him that certain cases contain certain goods; but it sometimes happens that a mistake has been made in the packing, and that the cases contain other goods. rence, I think.

An y other system would open the door to an avalanche of fraud, and dishonest importers would be assisted by shippers elsewhere to evade payment of duties.

There is a proper distinction maintained in the Customs Act between cases where fraud is charged and proved, and where it is not. It is very difficult to prove intent to defraud, and if there were provision in the Act only as regards intent to defraud, we should hardly ever secure a conviction. The Customs revenue is just as likely to lose through false entries made in innocence as through those which are made with fraudulent intent; and we cannot exempt from the consequences of their carelessness all those who make false entries without fraudulent intent. Whilei t is 'infinitely worse to do anything' with intent to defraud, still, if the effect of what is done may be to defraud, even though there may be no intention to defraud, the public and the revenue have a right to be protected. Minor penalties are provided for in these instances, and it is only in grave cases that we charge intent to defraud. Those who fail to comply with the Stamp Act are liable to certain penalties, and convictions are not necessarily followed by a smirch upon a man's honour. A man may be convicted of a variety of offences which are breaches of the law, but which involve no personal dishonour. honour which attaches to a conviction for false entry depends upon the circumstances of the case. Where fraud is proved, the dishonour is enormous, but where fraud is not charged, we cannot allow the false entries.to pass without punishment. Penalties are often exacted to secure a proper observance of the law, and these do not involve any personal dishonour. I should be sorry if, while we charged the lesser offence we were to be assumed to be charging fraud without daring to allege it. In Mr Chapman's ease, his negligence ought not«to excuse him. These Customs entries are all-important matters, and should be attended to by competent and fairly experienced men, who could be thoroughly trusted. We felt it to be necessary to do our best when we were dealing with the Act, to expressly provide against the slipshod way in which Customs business has been transacted in some of the States. I am told by the Comptroller-General that it has been his misfortune to have boys in knickerbockers, who could not possibly have had any experience, come_ down to the Custom-house, and transact important business with him. We have provided against this to some extent by enacting that no declaration shall be taken from a boy under the age of 18. Merchants who have important business to transact should place it in competent hands. Carelessness is no excuse for false entries, which may lead to loss of revenue. In some cases these mistakes are against the importer, but thelarger number are made against us. only look for mistakes which are made the one way. are only too glad to give the importer the benefit of any mistake we may discover that is against him. In view of the number of cases in which we find mistakes, we ma} form 1 some idea of the number of cases which never cometo light. I am notreflecting upon the commercial community of Victoria or any other State! WhatI have proposed is for the protection of tlie honest and careful majority against the minorit y I believe the very small minoritywho are actuated by improper motives' or are careless. It is in the interests of the integrity and the high moral character of our merchants that we prevent them from being subjected to cruel and unscrupulous competition. To allow the excuse of careThe dislessness when an entry is false would be to give opportunities to those who act from dishonest motives or who profit . man is one of those who is entitled to be held in high reputation in Queensland. What is the excuse put forward by him ? He says that he intrusted the making of the entry to his son, a boy of eighteen, who was guilty of gross carelessness. Mr Chapman,' therefore, stands condemned out of his own mouth, because he trusted the work to one who was unfit to perform it, andwho proved to be grossly careless. If I did not vindicate 'the. law in such cases, gross carelessness would always be an excuse, and I could not prosecute anybody unless I had absolute proof of fraud. Mr V. L .

There was cotton, which had previously been free in Victoria, but which ought to have paid a duty on entrance to Tasmania.

Mr Barnard, in his letter, saidIf the quantities and values taken out by the experts here are correct-wit h regard to the item on the attached copy oE certificate-it would show that some of these certificates are totally unreliable ; and in the interests of this State, some action should be taken against those persons who make these declarations falsely.

I do not believe that honourable members have realized the precise position, but have thought this to be simply a question of accounts between the States. That is not the case; the declaration made a difference to either the firm or to the firm's customers. I do not know whether there is any sympathy between the press and the commercial community, though of course we men ancl try to protect them. But, at the very least, the reports in the press of these matters were not so good as we should have liked. The honourable member for Wentworth quoted from a newspaper for which I have the highest respect, but whicli the next day, or shortly afterwards, properly qualified in a very considerable degree some statements which they had published, words having been attributed to counsel for the Crown which he did not utter. I was rather astonished to see a report iu a certain Queensland newspaper, ancl on inquiry by telegraph I hacl the assurance of the Collector of Customs that the statements made were not correct, and counsel took objection, and had them retracted. The first paper to which I referred was the Melbourne Jfarald, and the other was a Queensland paper, the name of which I forget. The excuse was made in Reid and Co.'s case that this particular error, falsity, or mistake, arose from writing down halfa-dozen pairs of something or other, instead of six dozen-that the firm debited themselves with the former instead of the latter number. In working the matter out the firm, in the first instance, speaking in round figures, distributed £ 3 as the imported material and £ 1 3 as the value of Victorian manufacture; and in the second 37 Q instance, in correcting the statement, they distributed £ 7 as imported material and £ 9 as value of manufacture. Their excuse was that they had omitted 5^ dozen ; and yet in the corrected entry they did not alter the total. I regard the excuse as an aggravation of the original trouble. this firm should attempt to make six. shillings in that way. wanted to put the money into their own If false depocket, but the effect is the same. These declarations have been the subject of abuse in Tasmania; and when our attention was called to the cases we were bound to act. This may be a little matter, but some traders live on a multitude of little matters ; ancl when we are appealed to for protection we are bound to take up the case. This is not an isolated instance, but one of many which have become burdensome in Tasmania. When I was busy with the Tariff a charge was brought, supported by merchants of considerable eminence, about leakages in the Customs department all sympathize with commercial in Queensland. The charge was, to some extent, fathered by Mr Philp, and his Treasurer, Mr Cribb. I sent an officer up to report, and he was informed by a gentleman that enough revenue had been lost in ten years to make up the Queensland deficit. ThatI think was an exaggeration; but we required that close attention should be given to the matter. We found other cases in which charges of fraud had been proved ; and under such circumstances our course was plain. The merchants of Australia have nothing to fear. On questions of honest opinion we should not dream of charging falsity ; but we do require the truth on questions of fact. There is the order and the invoice. MrV . L . SOLOMON -Fancy a wholsale warehouseman checking an invoice of a couple of thousand lines by his order ! I MrK IN GSTO N I think that would be a very orderly and proper precaution.

Immediately I ascertained the circumstances, however, I altered the practice. Messrs.

Of course they were, and as soon as I received a communication upon fche subject;, what was necessary was done. I do nofc wish to detain honourable members any about ship paints 1 longer.

I wish also that, as regards all permanent officers who have worked any considerable overtime, duly recorded in excess of ordinary and without payment during tbe special pressure of the present financial year, that they be specially credited in every care with afc least a fortnight's holiday upon full pay, and that arrangements be made for their taking this without delay.

As a representative of a firm which employs men of large experience to deal with these matters, I say that, if we wished to avoid tlie possibility of error, we should have to make sight entries in almost every case. Years ago the question whether the original invoice had been produced was one which used to arise, but now that every man shows the original invoice as the basis of the entry, the question is whether the real price of the goods is correctly totalled. Under the Commonwealth Tariff, however, there are so many difficulties in regard to classification that errors in that respect are unavoidable. It may be easy enough for large firms importing particular lines to classify their goods, but many small men have cases of general goods sent out to them which contain articles which should be classified under 50 heads. The charge I bring against the Minister is that in this initiatory period, when v>e have created a complex Tariff which few people can understand, and with which he himself cannot at all times deal judicially, he is treating honourable unavoidable errors as attempts at fraud. will put down carelessness and the making The of errors.

244,Sir William Mcmillan,"M a n y ofThe Minister for Customs, in answering the charges directed against him, has to a very great extent set up men of straw and knocked them down again. To the statement that there has been unnecessary delay, the Minister has replied that it was inevitable upon the introduction of a new Tariff. That has been, to some extent, admitted, but it is now contended that a sufficient time has elapsed to enable the Minister that there must be a head. Nobody to overcome all initial difficulties, and that something should have been done by the right honourable gentleman to remedy the present unsatisfactory state of affairs. further, that the right honourable gentleman has adopted an autocratic attitude, and has been unduly severe in his interpretation of the Customs Act and the Tariff. The Minister's reply is that it is only the dishonest people who have suffered from his administration. ""Unfortunately, however, the Minister knows very little about trade and commerce, and has no sympathy those engaged in it. His only is with tlie manufacturers, and he utterly lacks confidence in the trading community. The Minister has proceeded as though every importer is a dishonest man until the contrary is proved, and in doing that he has gi ven more trouble and caused more irritation On the question of manufacturing in bond, to the trading community than have many features of the Tariff, bad as it is. The right honourable gentleman has been knocking down "" men of straw."" When we say to him that the Act is arbitrarily and oppressively administered, he picks out cases in which the Customs department was probably quite justified in prosecuting. Minister asks, "" Shall we not prosecute a rogue?"" although it has never been advocated that people who attempt to mislead and defraud shall not be prosecuted. administration very many cases, put innocent men to the trouble and ignominy of defending themselves in respect of charges involving sums so trifling that in ordinary business circles no notice would be taken of them. has not allowed him to exercise that carefulness and consideration which is required, especially in the initial stages of this department has not used to the best advantage the helpful assistance which he could have obtained from the skill and training of his own chief officers. Most of the errors have arisen because the Minister, whose Mr O. Ji. Edwards. industry we all recognise, has endeavoured to do everything himself. It is not until the Minister has decided that the public can get anything done at the Custom-house. Matter after matter has been delayed in order to get his decision, and he has so much to do that he cannot attend to everything. He contends that such a policy is necessary in order to get uniformityhas ever contended to the contrary; but there is not less a head in any great organization when advantage is taken of AVe say, the assistance of those best able and prepared to give it . The Minister has not dealt with the question of manufacturing in bond ; ancl in many cases he has shown his utter want of sympathy with the trading and mercantile classes. The right honourable gentleman has all the sympathy in tlie world for anybody who manufactures in order to supply Australian wants ; but every one engaged in with trade or commerce has to be watched with sympathy the greatest care and vigilance. That is not a proper view for the Minister to' take, and it is a view which has irritated the trading community, and caused them to regard the Tariff with much more disfavour than would otherwise have been the case. I wish to refer to a specific grievance which those engaged in the same industry as myself have against the Minister for Trade and Customs. In the early stages of the Tariff discussions, I raised the question of allowing drawback on sugar used in the manufacture of articles which were The subsequently exported; and the Minister at once said that a drawback would be allowed. But time went on, and in spite of several letters written to the department, The no decision has yet been given. Nobody in of the Customs has, in the department seems to understand the matter, nor can any decision be obtained ; and an important body of traders, engaged in exporting to South Africa and the East, assisted by Government agents and experts, have received no aid at all from the MinisThe Minister's masterful manner ter. On the other hand, every obstruction has been placed in their way by means of delay. I do not say that the Minister acts in this way, because of any prejudice against of the Commonwealth. He those traders, but only because of his innate suspicion of every one who has dealings with the department. justified by the result. I found that in Tasmania only 36 per cent, of sugar was used",50,William Mcmillan Does The £3 15s 7d Plus 10 Per Cent
245,Mr Kingston,"And my suspicions werewhile drawback was being paid on 50 per cent. Mr G. B. EDWARDS in "" with cases of fraud. No member of o the committee will, I am sure, accuse me of falsely representing what took place between the Minister and myself. I used every effort by calling on the Minister, and writing to the department in several States, but could get no decision; and now the Minister says he refused to help honest traders because he found there were such persons as dishonest traders. I invited the Minister to adopt any precautions he chose, telling him that we were quite content to have an inspector in the factories; and yet, with the views of probably the great majority of those engaged in the trade before him, the right honourable gentleman did nothing. Again, I asked the question publicly whether the Minister intended to keep his promise, and he said he would if it were proved that the f u l l amount of sugar on which the drawback was claimed hacl been used. sequently I repeated that those engaged in tlie trade were prepared to submit to any test, and that many firms had claims against the Government, notably one firm in Tasmania, who were entitled to £ 2 , 0 0 0 ; and the right honourable gentleman admitted there was trouble, and said he would push the matter to a settlement. The committee will be surprised to learn that nothing definite has been settled, in spite of those repeated promises. Yet the Minister talks about morality. Between business men, if that sort of thing happened, we should question, J. will not say the morality, but, at any rate, the tact displayed. Commonwealth plundered as Tasmania was. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The right lionorable gentleman may say what he likes "" l e t the galled jade wince."" The department in these matters is not so free from wrong as the Minister chooses to think. The Minister has asked the question whether it is not curious that these mistakes are always made on the one side; but the honourable member for North Sydney pointed out with perfect truth that mistakes are often made on the other side, though we do not hear of them. The other day I purposely made a misstatement in my incometax returns, over-valuing my plant for purposes of my own to the extent of £700. It was. a perfectly honest purpose, because I was entering into a combination with another firm, whose values were higher, and I am not dealI wrotemine up to the same standard. I had of necessity to write down the value of the property; and when the document reached the Income-tax office, the statement in favour of the department was not noticed, but as to that against the department I was called on to explain, when I pointed out that matters were equalized. That is the case frequently with the Customs authorities, who are always ready to pounce upon the trading public, but never willing to remedy mistakes against the importers. The Minister could have shown much more consideration to the trading public than he has, and it would have facilitated commerce throughout the Commonwealth if he had understood the subject a little better. As to drawbacks the Minister has been guilty of delaying the settlement of an important matter, whicli affects the interests of a score or so of traders on a large scale-guilt y of delay which would not be tolerated in dealings between two Submerchants. If the Minister wishes to obtain credit as an able and just administrator, he. will give consideration to these matters. He ought to try to win back the approval of the people of the Commonwealth who viewed his appointment to his high office with much satisfaction, but who ha-ve by no means been pleased with his administration during the last seven or eight months. think anybody will accuse me of attempting to relax the efforts of the Minister to be just on questions of Customs taxation. A t the same time. I join heartily with those who think there has been a desire to overreach in many directions in the collection of duties on ships' stores. The desire of honourable members was to place ships which came from foreign ports, and which trade within the Commonwealth, on the same level as our local ships. In that I heartily concur, but I do not think it was the intention of Parliament to tax the small articles which are used by ships' crews when visiting a port for the purpose of taking produce away. The honourable member for Dalley has to-night instanced the use of paint on ships, and I could give many similar cases. I suppose that in the port of Newcastle more ships' painting is done than at any other port, particularly in connection with foreign-going ships. In a number of other cases Customs officers have gone",51,William Mcmillan Does The £3 15s 7d Plus 10 Per Cent

247,Mr Watkins (Newcastle),"I do notfurther, ancl attempted to collect taxation on very small items. This seems to me absolutely ridiculous, because in most instances the cost of collection is far beyond the amount of revenue obtained. I know one captain, who, like others, carried a few spare spars, and when he attempted to use one which he hacl brought with him, the Customs authorities demanded duty before he was allowed to take the spar to the workshop on shore. These are the trifling, irritating incidents which make people, dissatisfied with our ports. While I would fight for the fiscal policy in which I believe, I do not approve of imposing taxes which must operate unfairly to the people who visit our ports for the purpose of doing business. Concerning ships, such as tramps, mailboats, Ac, which compete with our own coastal steamers, it is either just that they should be prevented from trading with us or that they should pay taxation. Buti t is not fair that we should go to extremes, and compel foreign-going vessels to pay taxation upon every little item in the way of stores which they may consume during their stav in port. I have heard captains deliberately state that the)' would advise the owners of their vessels against coming to Australian waters whilst the present laws exist, affirming that they had nofc received such harsh treatment even in Russian ports. In New South Wales the practice formerly was for a Customs officer to board fche different vessels about once a fortnight, and .make an allowance in the way of stores for each member of the crew, putting the balance under seal. Why cannot a similar arrangement be adopted by the Commonwealth ? The captains of ships would be amply satisfied with such a system. To my mind, fche whole difficulty might be overcome by the adoption of fair regulations and by wise administration. think the Minister for Trade and Customs mentioned, as an apology for prosecuting in Jill cases, that the merchants ought to test the values of goods by their order books, and that they ought to be responshould tell us how the expenditure of his sible for errors in invoices irrespective of I department now compares with that of the whether or not they could easily have I State departments. checked them. of the sort. that the declaration required by the Act is £1,000,000 per annum more. as regards value. This is clearly set out by section 154 of the Customs Act, which saysWhen any duty'"" is imposed accoixling to value, the value shall be taken to be the fair market value of the goods iu the principal markets of the country whence the same were exported in tbe usual and ordinary commercial acceptation of the term, and free on board at the port of export in such country, and a further addition of ten per cent, on such market value. The value is fco be verified at fche time of the entry by the production of the invoice and a declaration by the owner of the value at the time of the entry. If that be a correct reading of the Acfc ifc seems to me somewhat unfair that whenever a slight error occurs in the declaration of value, whicli the importer cannot possibly check, a prosecution should follow. How can the importer tell what is the fair market value of the goods at the place of exportation ? Yet that is what fche declaration requires him to do. ration for securing accuracy as to value. prosecutions for some error in declarations as to value. The prosecutions, of which I have read in the newspapers, relate to false declarations. I hold that no prosecution ought to follow a mistake when that mistake has reference to a matter which the importer himself cannot possibly check. Proposed vote agreed to.
