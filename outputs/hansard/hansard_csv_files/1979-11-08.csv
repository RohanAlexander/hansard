I do not know why it would not be has done quite a bit in this area. One of the areas possible. in which we feel he has fallen down badly is simply by not acting against various schemes Regarding the importance of tax avoidance, which he knows to be operating, which have quite apart from the Government action to resbeen put to him time and time again and which tructure the tax scales inequitably, it is clear that he continues to allow to exist. Maybe it has somethe equity of the tax system is being further dething to do with the work load but it still seems stroyed by tax avoidance. This is shown by the odd that he allows this to happen. One area is figures for taxes paid by pay-as-you-earn taxinternal superannuation schemes. In this House payers-basicall y wage and salary earners-and in thefirsthalf of this year I drew this matter to by non pay-as-you-earn taxpayers in the last two the attention of the Treasurer and gave him some financial years.

The Treasurer ( Mr Howard) today made These will extend to taxpayers the benefit of the available figures giving details of estimates of the ordinary objection and appeal provisions of the amount of revenue which has been lost in this Assessment Act in the event of a refusal by the year and previous years through tax avoidance. Commissioner to agree to the taxpayer's conIt has been estimated by the Treasurer that at 30 tention that the provisions of proposed section June 1979 about $433m was outstanding in 82KL (3) or (5) should be applied in his or her terms of revenue lost due to tax avoidance favour. The particular sub-sections, which are schemes. This figure, of course, includes only proposed by clause 9 of the Bill, apply where an those amounts which have been precisely assessment has been made in the expectation tracked down to tax avoidance schemes. We do that circumstances as they unfold will necessitate not really have much idea as to how much application of the provisions designed to greater the real figure might be. Interestingly counteract the expenditure recoupment type of enough, however, of this amount of $433m the avoidance scheme. They enable the ComTreasurer estimates that somewhere between missioner to amend an assessment if, as the facts $200m and $230m relates to the previous year, emerge, it turns out that application of the pro1978-79. Leaving aside whether those figures are visions is inappropriate. As the proposed section accurate, that indicates that there has been a 82KL stands in the Bill, there is no provision for a great explosion in the last couple of years in the taxpayer to contest the issue of whether subamount of revenue lost from tax avoidance section (3) or (5) applies in his or her favour if schemes. For instance, if $200m of the $433m the Commissioner takes the contrary view. Repcan be attributed to one year only and assuming resentations that this is an undesirable state of that it has taken three or four years for these affairs have been found readily acceptable and, schemes to get off the ground, this indicates that by amendments (11) to (13), a taxpayer will be the acceleration in the amounts of revenue lost given the right to contest the issue, initially by has been very great in recent years.",114,Proposal

That is category. However, in the next period 1975-76 to a very alarming state of affairs and it reveals the 1978-79, that is the period of this Government's very great need to do something more than this administration, the rate of increase in taxation Government is prepared to do in relation to for PAYE taxpayers was 48 per cent compared clamping down on tax avoidance schemes. with only 9 per cent for the provisional taxpayers. That is a very marked difference between As I have said before, I think we can doubt the the increase in revenue from those two sources. I accuracy of the Treasurer's estimates in terms of think it reveals that there is a good deal of tax revenue losses in relation to tax avoidance avoidance going on among those people who schemes. I want to talk about another possible pay tax under the provisional arrangements.

On the assumption that revenue from and the amount of revenue received from those provisional taxpayers had increased at the same who pay under the provisional tax arrangements. rate as it had for PAYE taxpayers-and that is what I think ought to have been the position-the There is some difficulty in using this comparison revenue but to some extent I think the comparison is derived from provisional taxpayers valid.
