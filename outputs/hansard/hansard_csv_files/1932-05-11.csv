In dealing with this measure, it w ill be necessary to use such expressions as "" raising or lowering the exchange rate,"" ""note issue reserves,"" and ""gold standard."" It is essential that there should be a clear understanding of what exactly is meant -by these terms. We have become accustomed to speaking of an alteration of the exchange rate from £125 Australian to £130 Australian for £100 sterling as raising the exchange rate; that is, to speak of it from the sterling point of view, in that it raises the value of sterling expressed in Australian currency. Strictly, from the Australian view-point, we should call it lowering the exchange. I think, however, that it wil l be convenient to adopt the popular usage, and de'scribe changes following papers were pref r o m the sterling basis. Therefore, when £110 Australian equals only £100 sterling, I shall say the exchange is higher than parity, and when £90 Australian equals £100 sterling, I shall refer to the exchange as being lower than parity. The expression "" note issue reserve "" is also liable to be misunderstood, as such a reserve is not a reserve in the common business sense. The ""note issue reserve"" really means the portion of the assets representing the note issue which is kept in some specified liquid form . In Australia, by statute, a m in i mum percentage has in the past been required to be held in gold. Ordinarily,",13,Territories Of Th E Commonwealth Unemployme Nt Relief

Such a control is one of the axiomatic necessities of a central bank. appointed in 1924 exchange was operatas a result of the war upon the free ing adversely to the export trade of Ausmovement of gold. Upon the restoration tralia. Unlike the position during the of the free movement of gold the Bank past two years, the value of the AusBoard adopted the policy that the holding tralian £1 was appreciating in relation of unnecessarily large amounts of gold to sterling owing to large accumulations was economically unsound, and proceeded of Australian balances' in London from gradually to dispose of redundant gold. our favorable trade balance and from In its published reports the Bank Board loans. Exchange was allowed to fall to made it quite clear that it was pur95, but was severely rationed. If exsuing such a policy, which was based upon change had been allowed to find its sotwo principlescalled "" natural"" level, the demand for the Australian £1 in London would have put up the price, so that £100 sterling would have bought only £90 or perhaps only £80 in Australian currency. It must be remembered that neither England, nor Australia, was then on the gold standard, so that the remedy by shipment of gold was not available. The result would have been that exporters would have received reduction of their costs of production. Board. The object aimed at was the keeping crease the reserve of funds in London. It accordingly gives the board additional In 1925, both Great Britain and AusWhen the board was tralia removed the restrictions imposed (1) The desirability of substituting for idle gold, credits in sterling which could be put to work, and which would earn interest. (2) The desirability of accumulating adequate funds in the country where our external indebtedness, commercial and governmental, had to be met. This policy, which was of great benefit to Australia, was consistently followed, and, in 192S, the sterling securities held amounted to £26,000,000. The ability of the bank to sell exchange stabilized the position and prevented an immediate rise in the ra'te when overseas borrowing became impossible. The cessation of borrowing and the conamount of approximately £12,000,000 in tinued surplus of imports over exports made it clear that the sterling resources of the Commonwealth Bank could not indefinitely hold the rate at parity with sterling. Foreseeing the position which would inevitably develop, the Bank Board made representations to the Bruce Page Government for the introduction of legislation to give authority to the Commonwealth Bank to acquire the gold held in Australia outside the Commonwealth Bank. While these representations were under consideration, a .general election took place and the Government was defeated. The Bank Board immediately approached the new Government and legislation was introduced, at the end of 1929, authorizing the bank, with the approval of the Federal Treasurer, to acquire the gold held in Australia in exchange for currency of a similar nominal value. One effect of this legislation was, to all intents and purposes, to take Australia governments owing to the shortage of off the gold standard, as it, in effect, placed in the hands of the Bank Board the control of the export of gold. In addition, it had the effect actually, although not theoretically, of making the Australian note inconvertible. This was brought about by the fact that, although the law still required the conversion of the Australian note into gold, the Commonwealth Bank had the power to reacquire the gold as soon as the note was converted. From the date of the passing of this legislation a new position was created in Australia, for from that time gold ceased to perform two of its traditional f unctions. It was no longer available to individuals to meet external obligations, nnd it could no longer be used to provide for the conversion of currency into gold upon demand. This alteration in the position of gold has to be borne in mind in considering the actions that have since been taken. Mr Bruce. Early in 1930, the Bank Board applied to the Treasurer for approval to put into operation the power to which I have referred to acquire gold held in Australia. This approval was granted and the board entered into negotiations with the trading banks which resulted in the acquisition by the Commonwealth Bank of an gold. The amount held by the trading banks was about £18,000,000, but the balance of £6,000,000 remained in their hands for export to meet their increasing requirements for London exchange. This gold was gradually exported by the Commonwealth Bank and sterling was purchased with it, resulting in an increaae of the Australian moneys held in London. The result of these increased resources in London was to maintain for some time the exchange rate for the Australian £1 at a level close to parity with sterling. The London resources were also strengthened to meet the shortage caused by an absence of borrowing and the adverse trade balance by the issue of Australian treasury-bills to an amount of £10,000,000. Despite all these efforts to strengthen the position of Australian funds* in London, the situation became increasingly difficult. Foreseeing embarrassments to external exchange to meet our national commitments in London, the board of the Commonwealth Bank conferred with the trading banks and eventually what was known as the "" Exchange Mobilization Scheme"" was developed. This scheme provided that a monthly amount should be made available to governments to meet their commitments. The scheme was considered and approved by the Loan Council, and in July, 1930, an agreement was arrived at between the Loan Council, the Commonwealth Bank, and the trading banks, for its initiation. It is still operating. While the mobilization scheme covered our external interest and similar commitments, other difficulties arose which necessitated special action being taken. The London and Westminster Bank, which acted as bankers for several of the State governments, had provided accommodation to those governments to an amount of something between £10,000,000 and £11,000,000. required a reduction of this amount. As the result of conferences between representatives of the Loan Council, the Commonwealth Bank, and the trading banks, an arrangement was entered into whereby the trading banks provided an amount in London of approximately £3,000,000 for the purpose of reducing the indebtedness to the Westminster Bank. £10,000,000 of treasury-bills, to which I have referred, fell due, and owing to the position which then existed it was quite impracticable to renew them. An advance of £5,000,000 was made by the Commonwealth Bank and this money was used to redeem £5,000,000 of the treasury-bills. Tho Commonwealth Bank, however, was not in a position to provide the money to redeem the other £5,000,000 and, to meet this situation, the government of the day brought in legislation to -acquire the gold held hy the Commonwealth Bank for the purpose of meeting external obligations. The members of another place were not prepared to pass this legislation and after Sir Robert Gibson, the ""chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board had been called before the bar of the Senate, the legislation was amended limiting to £5,000,000 the amount of the gold reserve that was to be utilized for the purpose of meeting external obligations. This £5,000,000 was used for the purpose of redeeming the £5,000,000 of treasury bills. Iu spite of all the steps that were taken closely linked with the provisions ""of this to provide Australian funds in London, the difficulties of the exchange position continued to grow. The factors that contributed most materially to the development of this position were the absence of overseas borrowing and the sudden and heavy fall in the value of our exportable products. The drastic action taken-the export of £23,000,000 worth of gold, the raising of £10,000,000 by treasury-bills and the severe rationing of exchange by the trading banks-ha d made it possible to hold the exchange down to 108 up till the end of 1930. came no longer possible or desirable, and accordingly in January, 1931, it was allowed to rise to 130, at which rate it The Westminster Bank was held almost throughout that year. The result was to maintain exports, to reduce imports, and to discourage the transference of funds abroad, whether for investment or in settlement of trading debts. The influence of the exchange was reinforced powerfully on the export side by two remarkably good seasons in succession, and on the import side by the greatly diminished purchasing power of About the same time, the the Australian people and the height to which the tariff had been raised. The result was a favorable trade balance large enough to meet interest obligations, and the position of London funds began to improve. .. In September of last year, owing to the difficulties which the maintenance of sterling at a parity Avith gold was causing to British trade and commerce generally, that policy was abandoned, and Britain went off the gold standard. This fact was of tremendous imnortance to Australia, and a new situation was created in regard to the whole exchange and currency problem. Australia's external trade is overwhelmingly with Great Britain, or other ""sterling""countries and practically the whole of our external finance is with Great Britain. While our traditional policy has been to base our currency upon gold, in essence it has been based upon sterling, which, while sterling was at a parity with gold, meant the same thing. Now that Great Britain has gone off the gold standard, the question arises whether our future policy should not he to base our currency upon sterling rather than upon gold. That problem is-very bill, and I shall deal with it more fully later. Towards the end of 1931, owing to the alteration of our trade balance, and the abandonment by Britain of the gold standard, the position of our London funds improved so much as to cause financial concerns to become hesitant of holding sterling in London with so high an exchange rate as 130. As there was a danger of a severe fall in the exchange, which would have had a most disastrous effect upon the trading Then its restriction beand financial fabric of Australia, the Commonwealth Bank took action and assumed the responsibility-of buying and selling exchange at a fixed rate. rate was determined by the board, and, in last December, -was reduced from 130 to 125. This had the effect of stabilizing the had to reduce our gold reserves. We have position. Board continues to control the exchange rate, and in its hands rests the responsibility of dealing with it in the manner best calculated to maintain the credit of Australia and assist our financial and economic recovery. The provisions of this bill are closely linked to that responsibility. It provides that any profit that may be derived"" by the sale of gold and the purchase of sterling under the powers now conferred upon the board shall be transferred to a special reserve account, and shall be available to the board for the purpose of stabilizing exchange or for the purposes of the Note Issue Department. provided that such profits shall not be treated as profits within the meaning of section 60J of the Bank Act, which makes available to the Consolidated Revenue profits of the Note Issue Department. This provision will dispose of the unfounded fears that have already been expressed that an improper use would be made of any such profit to assist us in solving the difficult revenue problems that face Australia at the present time. be calculated as part of the statutory issued that they were convertible into reserve ? will continue, but may be held in either developments during the last few years, sterling or gold.

This vides against that.

Many accepted theories have had to be abandoned. Many unprecedented actions have had to be taken. We have The Commonwealth Bank had, in practice if not in theory, to make the Australian note inconvertible. Notwithstanding all these things, the internal stability of our currency has not been affected. For this fact our thanks are due to the bank board, which has consistently followed a policy of controlling the currency in accordance with sound banking practice, and the domestic needs of Australia. By all that it has done the bank board has won the confidence of the people of Australia, and it is most desirable that that confidence should continue. The Government is introducing this bill at the request of the board of the Commonwealth Bank. The board is strongly of opinion that it is essential that the It is expressly power should be conferred upon it to hold the reserve against the note issue either in gold or sterling, or partly in one and partly in the other. With this view the Government concurs, and is introducing this bill to bring about that position. Coming to the measure itself, the first point that has to be considered is what was the reason for the holding of a gold reserve against a currency issue. The reason was that, in order to ensure confidence in the currency, an gold at the option of the holder. FromI f the requiring a gold reserve to be held against was brought, about by the statutory reMany difficult and, at The bill provides that the statutory pro-",14,Commonwealth Bank Bill

21,Mr Bruce,"The statutory reserve the history which I have given of thethe note issue must be maintained, but enables that reserve either to be held in gold or in sterling, or partly in both. The next point is whether there is anything experimental or revolutionary in the proposal that the note issue reserve need not be entirely . held in gold. There is not. central banks are permitted to hold part or all of their reserves in foreign exchanges. In Belgium, for example, one-quarter of the legal reserve may be covered by foreign bank notes or bills. The Central Bank of Czechoslovakia may hold one-half of its reserve in foreign exchange; in Esthonia, the cash reserve may consist entirely of foreign notes, bills, credit balances, and cash deposits at leading banking centres in Europe and America; and the same is true in Latvia and Greece. Provisions ou those lines are to be found also in Germany, Italy, Austria, Denmark, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Finland, Colombia, Chile, Bolivia, and Lithuania. The principle underlying the statutes governing these central banks has been to provide that they shall hold their reserves in gold or partly or wholly in foreign assets which can be turned into gold at short notice. It will be recognized from these examples that the practice of not holding the whole of a legal reserve in gold has been very generally adopted. It is also of interest to remember that a number of the central banks to which I have referred have been established during the post-war period, and that the provisions with regard to their legal reserve have been accepted as being based upon sound principles. Another consideration is that of ensuring that the reserve shall be absolutely liquid. The bill will not make the note issue reserve any less liquid than at present. Under modern conditions gold for monetary purposes is required only for conversion, into foreign currencies, and, for our purposes, usually into sterling. Sterling exchange can be provided just as effectively, and more cheaply, if the Commonwealth Bank keeps liquid reserves in London. The liquidity of the reserve is fully ensured by the provision in the act that the part held in sterling shall consist of (1) balances with the Bank of England or other banks in London; (2) bills of exchange payable in English sterling of maturity not exceeding three months; and (3) treasury-hills or similar obligations of the British Government not exceeding three months' maturity. tion in the future? Will the CommonI n many countries wealth Bank Board buy them in the usual way, or acquire them from other banks ? them in innumerable ways. There may be an issue of treasury-bills, and the bank may tender for them for three months. The whole of the transactions will be under the control of the Commonwealth Bank Board, so there will not be the slightest difficulty in regard to the acquisition of securities. I now come to the consideration of the stability of the reserve. For this purpose, owing to the developments which have taken place in the world during the last few j'ears, sterling is ""probably more satisfactory than gold aud provides a better reserve. At present the value of gold is fluctuating in terms of sterling. This means that the gold assets of the Commonwealth Bank are subject to constant and undesirable fluctuations iu value. The present gold reserve was worth £10,509,000 sterling in September, 1931; on the 7th December, 1931, its value had risen to £15,698,000; on the 11th April, 1932, it was worth only £13,459,000; on the 28th April, 1932, its value had increased again to £13,981,000. This bill will give the board power, if it so desires, to convert its reserve of gold into sterling, and thus eliminate these fluctuation's. We have further to recognize that Australia is faced with a decision which has not . yet been formally and legally made-whethe r we shall link our Australian currency to gold or to sterling. That means not that we should be immediately at par with either, but that we must, follow one or the other with only such divergence ag is imposed by special Australian economic conditions. The choice is forced upon us by the virtual breakdown of gold as a basis for the world's currency and the rise of sterling as a managed currency, independent of gold.

Only a few countries, the United States and Prance in particular, have been-able to keep fully on the gold basis. Great Britain and most of the Empire, including India, the Scandinavian countries, and an increasing number of other countries are definitely off gold, and are, or are becoming, linked to sterling. Other countries such as Germany and Italy are only nominally on gold; their footing is so precarious that a slip may occur at any time, and there is no doubt that, unless these currencies got quite out of hand iu the fall, they would be linked to sterling. Sterling, therefore, seems to be the winning side. It offers the better hope of escape from the evils of continued deflation. Sterling prices havein fact been steady while gold prices continue to fall. In general, there is a good case for any country linking up with sterling rather than with gold. For Australia, the case is much stronger. Two-thirds of our Sterling means trade is with countries linked to sterling. Nearly the whole of our obligations forinterest and repayment of loans are expressed in sterling. I speak of making the choice, formally and legally, but the choice, not on a par in fact, has practically been made, It has been made instinctively, and probably unconsciously, by most of us in the last few months. It was made, in particular, by the Commonwealth Bank with the concurrence of general opinion, But in 1925 both in Australia and England, when England went off the gold standard. Our exchange, up to September last, stood at £130 to £100 gold or sterling. In October, sterling fell over 20 per cent, below gold. If we were going to take gold as our guide, the Australian exchange would have had to fall substantially, almost, in fact, to par with sterling. If gold was to be recognized, even in the smallest degree, some fall in Australian rates was necessary. Not the slightest change was made, and the official rate of the Commonwealth Bank and the trading banks remained steadfastly at £130 Australian for £100 sterling, and, therefore, £150 to £160 Australian for £100 gold. It was not until December-and then only for quite different reasons-that the Bank Board made a small reduction in the Australian exchange rate. [Leave to continue given.'] Again reverting to whether the proposals of the bill are of an experimental character, I would point out that the action which is^contemplated is in accordance with the now generally accepted theory of currency reserves. In this connection, a recent statement of Professor Gregory, of the Chair of Banking in the University of London, is of interestAustralia is perfectly justified in shipping gold That is, the note issue reserve goldI t should be shipped to New York and sold, the dollar proceeds to be transferred to London, obtaining-the maximum of profit.

Such, a statement represents views which to-day are very widely held, not only amongst members of the British Empire, but also in a number of foreign countries which have followed Great Britain off the gold standard, and are now using sterling as the basis of their currency. any limit to the time we remain off the gold standard? on the trend of world events. In introducing this bill, the Government does not suppose that the Commonwealth Bank Board will necessarily exercise the discretionary power given it to convert its gold reserves into sterling. The board will decide from time to time in what form it is better to hold its reserve, choosing the most propitious time for any conversion. It is the policy of the Government not to interfere in any way with the management of the currency by the board of the Gommonwealth Bank. The Government, therefore, leaves this decision entirely to the discretion of the board, but desires to give it additional powers to meet the disturbed monetary conditions of to-day. The bill does not reduce the percentage reserve which the board must hold against the notes on issue. Until June, 1931, the Commonwealth Bank Act provided that the board should hold a reserve of gold equal to 25 per cent, of the notes issued. Act No. 6 of 1931 reduced this reserve to 15 per cont. Parliament made this amendment to allow the board to ship £5,000,000 of gold to London for the repayment of treasury-bills which could not be renewed. The amendment provided, however, that the board should increase the reserve to 25 per cent, by the following stages:Reserve until 30th June, 1933-1 Reserve from 1st July, 1933, to .1934-1 8 per cent. Reserve from 1st July, 1934, to 1935-21 J per cent. Reserve from 1st July, 1935-2 5 On 25th April, 1932, the notes on issue totalled £52,303,426, and the gold reserve was £10,509,000, or about 20 per cent. After the passing of this bill, the board must still hold a reserve equal to the above percentages of the notes issued, but may hold it partly or wholly in sterling instead of entirely in gold. Just as with the gold reserve, no part of the sterling reserve may be used to meet maturing obligations in London, if such use would reduce the total reserve below the percentage permitted by Parliament. Any surplus over the statutory reserve secured by converting gold into sterling might, however, be used for this purpose. The conversion of gold into sterling would have certain incidental advantages of considerable value. Our £10,509,000 gold would to-day realize over £13,500,000 sterling. This would be sumcient to provide a 25 per cent, reserve for the notes now issued. As I have indicated the board is at present required to hold a reserve of an amount not less than 15 per cent., and must increase this by stages to 25 per cent, after the 30th day of June, 1935. In order to do this, under existing legislation, the board must accumulate gold, and it might be embarrassed by having to purchase it at a price involving subsequent loss in the event of its depreciation. This hill permits the board to hold its reserve in sterling, and thus safeguards the Note Issue Department from such a loss. The investment of the reserves in sterling assets would eliminate the costs of storing gold. The investments moreover would earn interest and thus be a source of profit to the Note Issue Department. Naturally, the security and liquidity of the investments would be the first concern of the board, and the rate of interest would, therefore, be low. that earning of interest have on the exchange rate? cause the amount of interest earned would be fractional in relation to the general amount to be met. 30th June, have some effect. provided in the bill that when the per cent. gold is transferred into sterling, any surplus amount over the £10,500,000 may be used by the Bank Board in connection with the stabilization of the exchange rate or in connection with the note issue, but for no other",20,Commonwealth Bank Bill

Sterling reserves can perform practically all the functions of gold, but have the substantial advantage that they earn interest. In addition to being directly profitable the replacement of gold bysterling reserves would help to economize gold and raise gold prices. This would have important indirect advantages particularly by helping to overcome the world depression. Por a country such as Australia, whose overseas trade is principally with Great Britain, sterling is a better standard than gold. sterling is adopted as a standard, gold becomes subject to disconcerting fluctuations, and tbe holding of it results in arbitrary gains and losses. The bill is a short one, and really contains only those two principles, that of holding the. reserve either in gold or sterling, and the qualification that any amount that might accrue consequent upon the transference of gold into sterling shall be used for the specific purposes set out in the measure, and cannot be taken into the revenues of the Commonwealth as would be the case if section 60.J operated. I am afraid that my explanation of the bill has been somewhat lengthy, but I wished to give the House the complete story of these recent years, and to make the pre, sent position, plain.

It is a necessary step forward, and I think that honourable members may have every confidence that the power will be handled wisely, in view of the record of the Commonwealth Bank over the last few years. adjourned. for Commerce) [4.9] I move That the bill be now road a second time. I commend the measure to the House, because of its merit, and desire to point out that the main credit for its preparation is due to my predecessor in office. In that respect it' might After the Premiers Conference that was held in August, 1930, a committee was appointed to examine cases of duplication between Commonwealth and State services, and to recommend steps to be taken to eliminate the overlapping. Mr Westhoven represented the Commonwealth. About that time there was a proposal afoot to change the slaughtering conditions in the Brisbane area by having the same inspectors inspect, at the now Brisbane abattoirs, meat for local consumption, and also that intended for export. The then Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) wrote to the Premier of Queensland on the 27th January, 1931, suggesting that the Commonwealth should take But when over the whole of the inspection. Eollow.ing that communication an investigation was carried out by Mr Westhoven and by Mr Story, the Queensland Public Service Commissioner. Later, Mr Westhoven was withdrawn to perform other work, and his place was taken by Mr J. S. Duncan. Eventually, a draft agreement was drawn up along the lines of the agreement in the schedule to this bill. It was approved by Cabinet on the 10th November, 1931, and work under it began on the 25th November. Due to delays in engrossing and examination, and those incurred in securing the signatures of the Prime Minister and the Premier of Queensland, the agreement was not actually signed until the 6th April of this year. It is incorporated in the bill because the Crown Law officers advise that such an agreement made upon executive authority alone would not be binding. The bill provides that the Common' wealth shall take over the whole of the inspection of meat at the Brisbane abattoirs. Previously the examination of meat for export was done by Commonwealth inspectors, while that for local consumption was supervised by State inspectors. There was a suggestion that the State should take over the whole of the inspection, but after consideration it was decided by the representatives of the two Governments that it would be more workable if left to the Commonwealth. The agreement provides that the Commonwealth Government shall take over and permanently appoint the five State meat inspectors who were doing the work prior",21,Commonwealth Bank Bill

As the time of our investigating officer becomes available he is examining other proposals which might lead to the making of agreements between the Commonwealth and other State authorities with the object of eliminating duplication and overlapping.

I do not desire to see any one lose his job. I am glad that the Commonwealth is undertaking the inspection work. I believe that we made a retrograde step a few years ago when we agreed to allow the State taxation offioers to collect Commonwealth taxation. When federation was agreed to it was understood that the tendency would be towards centralization or unification rather than towards the building up of dual departments to do practically the same class of work.

52,Mr Archdale Parkhill (War,"social order. Australia is entitled to protect herself in both ways. This country has had immigration laws on its statute book for many years.. The main object of this measure is to amend those laws to give the Government greater power to deal more effectively with undesirables. The Commonwealth power in regard to immigration and deportation is exercised through tbe department which I have the honour to control for the time being; and it has been exercised during my period of office with absolute impartiality and justice to all concerned. Where the presence of undesirables who come within the ambit of the immigration law has been proved, prompt action to deport them has been taken. During my term of office 53 deportation orders have been signed. I mention this as evidence that the interests of Australian citizens have been conserved to some extent under the existing law. But an amendment is necessary to enable more definite and satisfactory action to be taken than is at present permitted. were deported? Various classes, including those who were mentally unfit and foreigners convicted of crimes of violence The list is available to honourable members. was Reiraann, who took a prominent part in the riot in Adelaide in January last. He was convicted of a crime of violence, and immediately after his release from gaol he was placed on a ship to be returned to the country whence he came. If an immigrant is not content to become a law-abiding member of society, he is not entitled to the privileges of citizenship in this country. I have received many protests from secretaries of organizations with peculiar names asking that Eeimann should not be deported, but he has actually been on the high seas for several days. The bill has two main objects-first , to tion is almost prohibited. The surplus provide more effective means of controlling alien immigration into Australia; and, secondly, to strengthen the -provision by means of which undesirable persons may be deported from the Commonwealth. While the existing depression continues, and acute unemployment prevails, the strictest control of alien immigration is necessary in the interests, not only of the local labour market, but also of the intending migrants. To that principle no honourable member will object. Obviously, it would be wrong for .the Commonwealth to permit the surplus populations of other countries to come here while considerable numbers of our own people are without work. At present aliens seeking entry into Australia must obtain permission to land. These applications are dealt with by me personally, and as a rule permission to land is granted only to very close dependent relatives of persons already settled here. Due consideration, however, is given to special cases where it Would be in the interests of the community to authorize admission, and special arrangements have been made for the temporary admission of bona fide tourists and commercial visitors, as it is not desirable to hamper the entry of foreign travellers who come here to spend money or promote overseas trade. A difficulty, however, arises where a white alien arrives without a permit and is not, otherwise eligible to land. It is necessary to apply an effective dictation test to prohibit his landing. This is not a desirable procedure when an officer has to deal with an intelligent f oreigner, who may be able to speak several European languages; in any case, a simpler and Amongst them more satisfactory method would be to make it a statutory requirement that the alien who wishes to come here as an immigrant must, before embarking, obtain a permit to land. This course is followed in other countries, including the United States of America, Canada, and New Zealand. I have read in newspaper reports received from New York that the Immigration Committee of the United States of America Congress is proposing further to reduce the immigration quota by 90 per cent. The United States of America's population has practically reached saturation point, and immigrapopulations of Europe which previously America absorbed, have to seek other outlets, and it becomes all the more necessary for the Commonwealth to exercise every care to prevent an influx into this country. For the reasons I have mentioned the proposed amendment by which any alien immigrant may be prohibited from landing if , on demand by the",24,Immigrati On Bill Second Reading
53,Mr Fobde,What classes of persons,25,Immigrati On Bill Second Reading
54,Mr Aechdale Paekhill,"officer, he fails to satisfy him that he holds a landing permit, or that his admission has been duly authorized, will be of material assistance in the administration of the act. The deportation of persons who have gained admission to the Commonwealth applies mainly to three classes, namely, those who have entered illegally, those who have since become a burden on public funds through physical or mental -causes, and those who have been convicted of criminal offences or otherwise proved to be undesirable members of the community. In regard to persons who have -entered the Commonwealth illegally since the commencement of the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901, the time in which action can be taken to deport them if circumstances arise to make such a course desirable is not limited. But in the case of those who were permitted to land and subsequently became a burden upon the community or otherwise prove undesirable, it is necessary to take action within three years after their arrival, or that evidence be forthcoming that within that period they became inmates of public institutions or had been convicted of crimes punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer. An exception was made in respect of aliens convicted of crimes of violence against the person; the time within whicli action to deport them could be taken wa3 not limited. The bill proposes that the three-year period be extended to five years. This will conform to the period mentioned in similar provisions in the immigration laws of the United States of America and Canada. It is, moreover, the usual period in various countries of qualification for naturalitime during which action can be taken zation or domicile. Therefore, five years is a reasonable period of probation for immigrants who wish to settle in this country; if within that time they prove to be undesirable,there should be ready means to send them back to the places whence they came. A further amendment relates to the wives and dependants of deportees. The power to deport them is discretionary. The wife of the deportee may not wish to leave with him, and if proof is forthcoming that she will not be a burden on the community the Minister may allow her to remain in Australia. ifr. Archdale Parkhill. of a deportee being a native of Australia, what will be the position? power is discretionary, and, if the wife wishes to accompany her husband, no objection will be raised. If , on the other hand, she wishes to stay in Australia, and she can show that she has relatives with whom she oan live, and that she will not be a burden on the Commonwealth, the Government will give her case favorable consideration. for that if the wife is Australian-born. is a matter more of sentiment; whether or not the wife wishes to accompany her husband. In any case, the amendment is clear, and discretion may be exercised either way. In the case of an Australian-born wife no deportation order would be issued. to make deportation an act of desertion within the meaning of the divorce law. subsequent amendment to that effect may be necessary. Power is also being taken to compel shipping companies which bring to Australia persons who afterwards prove to be undesirable, to take them back to the place whence they came, accompanied by their dependants. Those are the main principles of the bill. It provides for about eight amendments, most of whioh I have explained. The object of the bill is to strengthen the hands of the Govermnent in dealing with the classes of persons to whom I have referred, and to extend the against them from three to five years. sub-clause c of clause 5, which eliminates the dictation test? -have already explained that.

63,Debate (On Motion By Mr Blakeley),"ACTS INTERPRETATION BILL . Treasurer) [4.55] I move That the bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Acts Interpretation Act 1901-1930, and the Acts Interpretation Act 1904-1930. As honourable members probably know, these two measures have never been consolidated and consequently in making amendments in the law relating to the interpretation of statutes it is frequently necessary, as on this occaConstitution, the whole act shall not he sion, to deal with both of those acts. Clause2 and paragraph a of section 9A contained in clause 3 of the bill relate to the same subject. Section 32 of the Acts Interpretation Aet .1901-1930 provides that where an act confers power to issue regulations, expressions used in the regulations shall have the same meaning as in the act unless the contrary intention appears. This enables definitions which are embodied in an act to be invoked in the interpretation of regulations made under it. In addition, section 32 provides that expressions which are defined in the Acts Interpretation Act shall, in any regulations made under an act, have the same meanings as are given in the ActsInterpretation Act itself. This bill takes the position with regard to the interpretanow? tion of regulations a little further. Th« Acts Interpretation Act contains provisions for the construction of statutes but these do not apply to regulations. Under clause -2 and paragraph a of section 9A contained in clause 3 of this bill, however, it is now proposed that those rules of construction shall apply also in the case of regulations, rules or by-laws which are issued under any act. In the. amending bill, the words "" rules, regulations or by-laws"" appear. It is proposed, by amendments to be moved in the committee stage, to insert the word "" instrument"" so as to make the provision read "" instruments, including rules, regulations or by-laws"", since the present wording does not embrace all that it is desired to cover. Eor instance, proclamations, notices appointments in writing may be made or issued under an act of Parliament, and it is desired that the rules of construction tion for the benefit of the people of [23] laid down in the Acts Interpretation Act should apply to them. The insertion of the word "" instrument"" will achieve that (Plinders-Assistant object. The list of amendments appears to be formidable, but this is due to the fact that, although they relate to only one matter, alterations have to be made in two separate measures. In section 15A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901-1930 is a provision applying to all statutes. The effect of the section is that where any act passed by this Parliament is held in some respects to exceed the power of the Commonwealth under the invalid, but only that portion which is held to be in excess of our power. Paragraph b of section 9A contained in clause 3 contains a provision in relation to rules, regulations or by-laws issued under any act, so as to protect a series of rules, regulations, or by-laws against total invalidity by reason of their being, in respect of part thereof, in excess of power. Clause4 deals with another matter. It provides that where any regulation issued under an act has been disallowed by either House of Parliament, under-the provision which enables that to be done, a similar regulation shall not be introduced within a period of six months. tion to that previously disallowed is prevented by this bill from being introduced within a period of six months from the date of disallowance unless the House concerned has itself annulled its own action. amendment to prevent a repetition of what occurred in connection with the regulations respecting waterside workers? law will be in the future, and the honourable member may draw his own conclusions regarding its effect. or possibly the Government on this occasion as on all other occasions is to improve the machinery of Parliament and its legislaAustralia.

It threatens them with a fine of £100 if they refuse to break that law. When we last dealt with the bill it was clearly intimated that if New South Wales public servants broke the law and action was taken against them, they would be compensated for any monetary loss they sustained. I should not like to be a public servant in New South Wales. They are between the devil and the deep blue sea; they do not know where they stand, and this Government is in a similar predicament.

Three days were devoted to a measure which had the unanimous support of the House. In one division last night only 40 of the 75 members of the House were present to vote. Replying to a question of the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Watson) to-day, the Prime Minister denied that the proposal to abandon next Friday's sitting is connected with the desire of Ministers and members to participate iu the Victorian election campaign. I do not accept that assurance. I can recollect no other occasion on which the House has adjourned at 6 p.m. on Thursday, as the Government proposes it shall do tomorrow, except when an election or some other important happening was impending. In my opinion the Prime Minister's answer was not accurate. Undoubtedly some members of this House are taking part in the Victorian election campaign, and others propose to leave by train to-morrow night in order to speak in their electorates on Friday.

On behalf of the people, I voice my protest against this Parliament acting in this dilatory fashion at a period of national crisis when all parties should be co-operating to do their best for Australia. dorse the protests that have been uttered by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr are without clothing and boots. He Scullin), and the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb). Last week the Government would not allow adequate time for the discussion of the bill for the financing of unemployment relief works, and three times I was gagged. Now the business of the House is to be held up, 1 because the Government is afraid that some of its legislative proposals may have an adverse effect upon the Nationalist party's prospects in the Victorian election. The Government fears the consequences' in that Statei f the House is afforded an opportunity to discuss some of its legislation. With the Commonwealth Government, party advantage is the first consideration, and the welfare of the people, the last. Knowing .the deplorable conditions of many people throughout Australia, this Parliament should be sitting night and day, endeavouring to relieve their sufferings. Many suggestions for the help of the unfortunates have been made, but the Government excuses its inaction on the plea that the relief of distress is the concern of the State Governments. In the present crisis all governmental authorities should be co-operating in an endeavour to give succour to those who are workless and hungry. During the Scullin regime surplus military clothing was distributed to the unemployed directly through members of this Parliament. Although the quantity available was never sufficient to satisfy all requirements that system of distribution was more satisfactory than the present method of distribution through the Salvation Army and other charitable and religious organizations. I have referred frequently in this House to the inadequate supply of material that is made available for the unemployed. I have been told by the Assistant Minister for Defence( Mr Francis) to make application for material to various charitable organizations, including the Salvation Army. Various relief organizations in my electorate have communicated with me to the effect that upon making application to Colonel Orr of the Salvation Army for surplus materials they have been informed that there is none available. I ask the Prime Minister to cease laughing and to listen to the plea that I am putting forward on behalf of people who might show a little sympathy towards them. the honourable member's rubbish. man refers to my plea on behalf of the unfortunate unemployed as rubbish. That is not a very nice statement to he recorded in Hansard. Many of these people have no boots, and many women, because of the state of their clothing, are ashamed to go into the streets. Yet the Commonwealth has stored in the army and naval stores huge quantities of materials and articles of apparel which, if made available for the unemployed, would at least give them some little comfort during the cold winter months. The Scullin Government did endeavour to make clothing available for the workless. I am not putting up this plea for the purpose of propaganda. This is a question of humanity. It is a disgrace that such a position should exist in a country that boasts of its civilization, its Christian fellowship and its love of humanity. This Government could show some little Christian feeling by making available the stocks of clothing that are to-day stored in the military and naval stores. The Commonwealth Government is, for political advantage, attacking the Premier of New South Wales, who is endeavouring to relieve the sufferings of the unemployed in' that State. up the payment of widows' pensions? ment, under the Financial Agreements Enforcement Act, seized from the banks State moneys which would ordinarily have been used in the payment of widow's pensions, child endowment, and superan-",33,Guard

When the Commonwealth Government realized the political effect of its action, it introduced legislation to enable it to retreat from the position which it originally took up. Several honourable members interjecting, I ask honourable members to observe the rules of debate and refrain from interjecting. The honourable member for Hunter is entitled to be heard in silence. for Parramatta ( Mr Stewart) has a grudge against the Premier of New Sputh Wales because the operation of the Transport Act in that State prevented him from exploiting child labour on his fleet of omnibuses at the expense of the railway and tramway services of New South Wales. The honourable member would like to shoot Mr Lang on sight. Let us be serious on this subject. ber cannot take anything seriously. unemployment, this Government has made an attack upon the State Government of New South Wales, because it is not to be given the same facilities as are being afforded the other State Governments in respect of the appointment of unemployment relief councils. The Postmaster General( Mr Fenton), when sitting on this side of the House, made a special plea on behalf of the unemployed, and he has now an opportunity to put to his colleagues in the Cabinet the case on behalf of the unfortunate unemployed who are to-day practically naked. The storing of clothing serves no useful purpose, and I urge the Postmaster-General to do something for the unemployed. that I have done perhaps more than the honourable member has to assist the unemployed. ( Mr Lyons), as a family man, knows how difficult it is to rear a family even on a comfortable income. My family i i not so large as that of the Prime Minister, but I have had the experience of rearing children. There are many unemployed men in my electorate who are to-day suffering severe -hardships by having to rear seven or eight little children on the pittance that they receive from the State Government. A certain section of the community is preaching to the unemployed the ungodly gospel of communism. Neither the Government nor the people generally realize the extent to' which that doctrine is growing, and the extent to which the credulity of the unfortunate unemployed is being played upon, and unless they are supplied with clothing so as to make their lot a little more comfortable, it will not be long before many of them become active Communists. Honourable members, who have spoken are justified in protesting against the procrastination of this Government. The business-paper contains quite a number of items for discussion. We have the tariff to debate, and the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) has stated that a discussion will take place in respect of the Ottawa Conference. Notwithstanding that, the House has adjourned at several periods during the last week when business could have been proceeded with. To-night the Prime Minister attempted to adjourn the House at half-past eight. To-morrow it is intended to adjourn the House at 6 p.m., and no sitting will take place on Friday. That is unfair to honourable members, particularly those who represent distant States and cannot visit their homes at the week-end. They are being compelled to board at Canberra waiting for the Government to bring on business next week. Only 40 out of 75 members have been present in the chamber this week. Probably the Government thinks that by postponing the business of the House until next week there will be fewer members present to discuss the tobacco and other duties. Why bring on the tariff debate during the last week of Parliament when it could have been proceeded with this week? Why not begin the debate on Friday next ? able member, when Minister for Trade and Customs, held up the debate on the tariff for two years. honourable members had ample opportunity to discuss the tariff.

140,Mr Forde,"When I was Ministerof Sir Stanley Argyle, the United Australia party leader in Victoria, so as to enable certain members of this House to assist at the final election rally in that State? Is this Government postponing the consideration of the Public Service Bill merely because its passage through this House might prejudice the election of certain State representatives? Has the tariff debate been postponed merely' because the lowering of duties in respect of about -70 items might jeopardize the election of State members who represent secondary industries? I stronglyobject to the postponement of the business of this House. ""We have had no opportunity to consider the tariff items or to discuss the Ottawa Conference. Are we to understand that the Australian delegates are going to the conference without any direction from this Parliament, perhaps to jeopardize the very existence of Australia's secondary industries without gaining any corresponding advantage for our primary industries? delegates simply going on a joyride, or will they attempt to achieve anything of value to Australia? These are matters which Parliament might well consider, instead of adjourning so that honourable members may participate in the Victorian election campaign. desire to protest against the untimely adjournment of the House. We met this afternoon at 2.30, and adjourned at 5 o'clock. Wc were called together again at 6.14 p.m., and immediately adjourned until S p.m. But for the action taken by the little . group to which I belong, the House would probably have adjourned at about five, minutes past eight, because there would . have been no opposition to the amendments placed before us for our acceptance. I agree' with the statement of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) that the Government is holding up business to suit the convenience of its political friends Such* cant' and hypocrisy is sickening. in -Victoria. It is true, I believe, that the Nationalist Consultative Council in Victoria asked the Commonwealth Government not to proceed with the tariff discussion and the Public Service Bill, because it might prejudice the interests of Nationalist candidates in the forthcoming Victorian elections. In this, as in other matters, the Government has shown itself' 'willing to obey the inner : group' of the Nationalist organization, whichreally -' directs the policy of the Government. Mr> £ .

At any rate, whether he goes or not, he is taking steps to adjourn Parliament to enable his supporters to go to Melbourne to take part in the State election campaign. This is the gentleman who is always advising people to drop their political differences, and to come together for the good of the country, There is plenty of business which the Government could go on with, but it displays no anxiety to proceed.

The Government is not justified in adjourning the House at this hour. This afternoon we sat only from 2.30 until 5 o'clock. If everything had gone to the Government's liking, we should have adjourned shortly after 8 o'clock until some time to-morrow afternoon. When we met then, we should probably have been told a little story to the effect that the Government was not ready to go on with its programme, and we should have adjourned until next Tuesday. Then no doubt, we would be confronted with true that the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page), by arrangement with the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Gullett), has succeeded in having the tariff debate adjourned so that he might visit Queensland to help his friend, Mr Moore, in his election campaign. Because it is inconvenient for him, and for his Deputy Leader, to attend at Canberra, and because other government supporters desire to visit Victoria, Parliament is to be adjourned.

I urge the Prime Minister to set his investigation department to work so that honourable members may know the ramifications of the New Guard movement, even if such action may involve a number of honourable members opposite, including the honourable member for Wentworth and the honourable memher for Parramatta. Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [9.35] I desire to make a personal explanation. I have been misrepresented. Honourable members of the corner group have made statements which are entirely unfounded, for I have not the honour and privilege to belong to the organization which has been mentioned, an organization which stands for honour and loyalty to King and country, and for which I have the utmost respect. The statements of honourable members in this regard are in accord with those they made in connection with the general business of the House; they cannot be relied upon. and Treasurer) [9.36] I am somewhat surprised at the protest that has been made by some honourable membersI refer mainly to the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) -to the arrangement of the business of the House. I am not so surprised at the opposition of certain other honorahle members. The Leader of the Opposition knows perfectly well that occasionally governments have difficulty in arranging the business of the House, and have to consider honourable members. It is not for the Opposition to determine how the business of the House shall be carried on. The Government accepts that responsibility. It is but fair that bills should not be rushed through, if that can be avoided.

The Government has nothing to worry about in that respect. The Public Service Bill has already passed the Senate. It has the approval of the Government, which accepts responsibility for it. If the Government desires to introduce an amendment it is entitled to do so. That is to be preferred to dealing with a measure hastily and introducing an amending bill later.

Nothing that may be done by either the Government or honourable members opposite can avert the complete routing of the Labour Government of Victoria on Saturday. The defeat of that administration is as sure as the fact that night follows day, and it cannot be influenced by the action of the Government in regard to the Public Service Bill, tobacco duties, or anything else. It has been suggested that I should go to Melbourne and speak there on Friday night. that this was once a Labour man. so-called Labour Government of Victoria has let the right honourable member down in his policy; yet, being so entirely inconmember has asked questions on the subject sistent, he has taken the platform with the man who let him down.

""When it. was suggested that I might participate in that campaign I agreed to do so and suggested that I should make my address on Friday night. However, those responsible for the organization of the United Australia party say-and this is the experience of honourable members generally-that addresses on the night prior to the poll cannot influence the result. I should gladly have taken part in the contest on Friday night, but the actions of the leader of another so-called Labour Government, that of New South Wales, compel me to stay here in the interests of the people of Australia to prevent his doing the damage that he contemplates to the workers of Australia. who are notat present in Canberra have with his tongue in his cheek, pretend been assured that the tariff debate will be that such a man is a friend of the worker taken next Tuesday that assurance? can injure nobody.

The honourable member cannot have it both ways. If there is any honourable member in this chamber who has no right to ask that the debate on a tariff schedule be hastened it is the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde). He knows perfectly well that nobody has kept back tariff schedules longer than he did. He, therefore, has no right to criticize the action of the present Government.

This Government has proved its bona fides in the last few days by putting through a measure that will give real relief to the unemployed of Australia, and enable them to make purchases of clothing and other necessaries out of the wage3 that they will receive for work clone. Because the Premier of New South Wales has broken his pledge to the other governments of Australia, and has destroyed every vestige of credit that his State possesses, he is preventing £600,000 being spent in his State for the relief of unemployment.
