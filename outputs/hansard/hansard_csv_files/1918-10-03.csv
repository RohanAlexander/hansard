The restriction of the importation of luxuries was done by regulation some little time ago, the Government being influenced in its action by the desire not so much to encourage the consumption of luxuries of local manufacture, as to conserve the national efficiency by doing away with articles of consumption which might be regarded as needless at the present time. a couple of Australian girls belonging to well-known Western Australian families, whose brothers are fighting at the Pront, but who are married to naturalized Germans, gave me to understand that their properties had been much injured by reason of the action taken towards them hy the Government.

"" M a j o r Carroll has been informed on many occasions that this matter w ill not be reopened, but persists in submitting his claim under a different guise from time to time. "" He again asks that the question be submitted for the opinion of the Crown Solicitor as to whether he is entitled to this recognition, notwithstanding the iact that he was informed of the opinion of the Crown Solicitor given on 29th January, 1909, viz.:-That he was not legally entitled to have the f u l l rank of major in the Commonwealth Military Forces, owing to his having; received promotion to the rank of major' in South Africa, until the Commonwealth Government consents to and approves of the appointment as major. "" Major Carroll's claim now, however, is not for the f u l l rank of major, but for the brevet rank, and it is considered that, u n t i l the Commonwealth Government consents to and approves of his appointment as brevet major, he is similarly not legally entitled in law to such brevet rank. "" Referred for decision as to whether this matter is to ibe again referred to the Crown Solicitor."" In 1901 Captain Carroll, who was serving with a Queensland contingent in South Africa, was appointed by the late Lord Kitchener (then Commander-in-Chief of the Forces there) to the rank of major, subject to the approval of the Queensland Government. approval of the Queensland Government was subsequently given, and, in my opinion, the appointment became complete. Major Carroll returned to Australia in March, 1902. At the time of his return there was a Cabinet minute in force to the effect that a l l officers who were promoted in South Africa should on return to Australia retain the higher rank as brevet rank in the M i l it a r y Forces. Cabinet minute would, therefore, apply to Major Carroll's case. A Cabinet minute has no legal effect in itself, and .it is a question of policy whether it is to be given effect to in any particular case. The Cabinet minute referred to was altered after Major Carroll's return, but as he had returned before the alteration, he was entitled to have his case considered under the Cabinet minute in force at the time of his return. In an opinion dated 29th January, 1909, on this matter, given by Mr Powers, when Crown Solicitor, Mr Powers (inter aUa) said: ""Under section 70 of the Constitution, the consent to promotion in the Commonwealth Forces should have been given by the Commonwealth Government, not by the Queensland Government, . notwithstanding the control of the contingent raised by the State Government continued in the State Government."" It is not quite clear to my mind what Mr Powers meant by this ; but it may have been considered to §ast some doubt on the validity of Major Carroll's appointment to the rank of major in South Africa. It was probably not intended to do so. In my opinion, the appointment of Major Carroll to the rank, of major in South Africa became de facto complete on the consent of the Queensland Government being given to such appointment, and its validity was not open to question on the ground that the Queensland Government had no power to ' consent to the appointment. The eifect of the appointment was not to give Major Carroll the rank of major in the Commonwealth Military Forces in Australia, and would not have done so even if the consent had been given by the Commonwealth Government, and not the Queensland Government. Major Carroll's case, in iny opinion, would come equally within the first Cabinet minute, whether the consent to his appointment as major had been given by the Commonwealth Government or by the Queensland Government.

I am sorry that 1 have not with me the numerous notes which I possess on this matter. I di d not know that this discussion was coming on to-day. The firm of P. W. Hughe3 and Company went into liquidation, giving the shareholders the option of accepting shares in a new company, or debentures carrying 7 per cent. Most of them, I believe, took debentures, thinking it better to get a certain 7per cent, than to run the risks that might attach to ordinary shareholders i i i the new company. very foolish, because, as the Central Wool Committee could tell us, the contract for wool tops which Mr Hughes was able to get fro m the Commonwealth Government enabled the company on a paid-up capital of about £5,000, and, of course, a considerable amount of debenture capital, in a year.

Hughes is not satisfied w it h the new agreement offered him, and is going to bring further pressure to bear on his unfortunate employees by keeping them out of employment. A few weeks ago I received a telegram containing words of reproach from the president and secretary of the basil workers at Botany. "" Are you aware that as a result of your action we are out of employment? A r e -you willing to help us?"" I ignored the reproach, and telegraphed back, "" W ill be pleased to help you all I can. What settlement do you propose? Are you in favour of the Government's proposal to allow F. W .

These unfortunate men are beincj used by MrF . W .

I know it is very hard for the employees, but when MrF . W . Hughes was earning these large profits, wbich, as the honourable member for Hume says, were equal to 12$ per cent, on the capital invested,, he -Hughes was not passing on to his employees any of these concessions.

I read in the press some years ago, that MrF . W. Hughes Went to Colombo, and that, as a Colombo newspaper stated, he was there inquiring into the conditions of labour, because he found there were so many labour troubles in Australia in connection with his industry that he was going to transfer his business to Colombo. When I wrote to the press drawing attention to this statement, MrF . W . Hughes denied it . I then wrote to the editor of the Colombo newspaper which had published this statement but received no reply. I imagine, because of the-conduct of MrF . W . Hughes since, that lie is one They of those men who, if it would pay him, would to-morrow shift his whole plant, box and dice, to some Eastern country, where he could use sweated labour. The Government could help in this matter. The contract has not yet been signed, and if there is any means of bringing pressure to bear on this gentleman, and there ought to be, it should be used.

There came a time when the wool-tops companies, met by that de-cision, which the Government confirmed, threatened legal proceedings for the extension of the agreement. The Government said, "" Very well, go to law."" That was our attitude up to a certain stage. The position was not very satisfactory, because there were other doubts arising out of the interpretation of the agreement, particularly as to the moneys that should be paid into the Treasury by the wooltops companies, and we were threatening law in regard to that, so that there was going to be action and cross action. It seemed to me that, as it was a business matter, based upon bond fide considerations at the start, however these might have been misinterpreted afterwards, a business and not a litigious"" settlement should be sought. . I applied my mind to it to that eridT as, if we went to law^ the industry might not only be dislocated, but permanently injured. I , with the assistance' of the Wool Committee, and of a sub-committee, spent three or four months trying to obtain a settlement, and at last we got one. I need not describe at length the many alternatives submitted by the wool-tops companies and the Committee to the Government. Broadly, the position of the Committee was this: The old agreement is dead. We want the industry to go"" on, not only to keep the operatives in' the industry engaged, b u t because many of ' our Allies are wanting tops. This industry, which has been established through the prescience of former statesmen, should be kept going throughout the war. and, if possible, permanently. They said that we should make an agreement with the companies giving them 12$ per cent, on their total capital, and as one at least of these had debenture capital, it would show a shade over 16 per cent, on the shareholders' funds invested. tization, risks, and other factors. The companies said, "" We do not object to the amount of money that we are going to get out of the agreement, but we object to the principle of remuneration;"" and that was stressed very hardly on many occasions. They said, "" If you are going to put every industry of this kind into shackles during the period of the war, we will submit with the others, b u t are we to be the only people whose profits are to be artificially limited?"" I confess that there is something in that argument. as people would infer from your remarks, in the same position as others, because they were buying their wool in a restricted and fixed market, and they wanted to sell, and were the only people in Australia who were allowed to do so at the world's extreme prices. apprehension, I would like-to say order to interject in this way. will be able to amplify his remarks later. I was about to acknowledge that there was a difference between this industry and every other industry in Australia. The question was: Was this difference so fundamental as to warrant the Government in saying, "" We will definitely limi t your profits, while we decline to do similar things to any other industry in Australia"" ? Therefore, I sought a compromise arrangement which would be no more liberal to the companies and no less decent to the Treasury, but would be based on a more defensible principle. A f t e r much argument, the Wool Committee recommended to the Government that we sliould build the reward on the poundage principle; that the amount of money these people could make should depend on what they put through. If there were a large turnover, they would then make more than if there were a small one. Instead of confining the award to a fixed percentage on the funds invested it was thought that the payment should be based on output, which would not destroy the stimulus which the other form of reward might destroy. In considering the problem on that basis we A very generous profit. found ourselves up against difficulties.

Once having taken that decision, we were faced by the consideration that two-thirds of the wool the manufacturer for tops is his own wool, in the sense that he has bought the sheep on the hoof, slaughtered them, and sold the meat, and brought the by-product, the green skins, to the fellmongery. ness, that is perfectlv sound: but in an arrangement wool from the Government and converts it from the rudimentary state, if it is wished, to arrive at what his reward is on a poundage basis, we have to decide the value of the wool when it starts, or at some stage of the operation, and at its finish, or there are great possibilities of grave miscarriage of. reward in the agency arrangements. do not know whether quite business has sometimes proved obscure to others. I think honourable members may take it for granted, without ment, that at the initial stage of an arrangement of this kind there has to be a valuation of the goods, just as when there is a sale there has to be a valuation before the goods are handed over. suggested to the good folks that they should drv their skins hitherto have come green, so that they might be appraised at the start of the operation; but they said that that would Mr Watt. so much alter the arrangements of their There was the businesses as tp be impossible. We then suggested that after the wool had been associated with sweated and rough scoured, before it beand topmaking-the came the raw material for the top-makAling industry, there should he a drying so that we could value it They said that that was impossible, owing to lack of to do with that. accommodation, and other difficulties in getting which presented themselves. Having investigated the matter in every way enterprises that the experts of the sub-committee of the Wool, Committee were able We, therefore, made them to suggest, and the company finding tops that it was impossible to comply with during our requirements, we said that they must use only appraised wool. This meant We said that if the tops that they would be placed exactly where all other men are who use wool in Auswith tralia to-day. If we had not done that, we would have said to the two adjoining factories, ""One of you must use appraised wool, while the other is at liberty to use their own wool."" There was in that posiuses tion great possibilities of misunderstanding or impropriety; and the Government, therefore, stood behind the Wool Committee and said that the fundamental requirement was the use of appraised As a cycle of busiwool. . I hope I am not wearying honourable by which a man receives members, but it is just as well to go thoroughly into the matter, so that the to the finished situation may be quite understood. Mr. Hughes' company said, "" If you make us use appraised wool, what are we to do with the skins?"" We replied, they could get them fellmongered at some other place, and put the proceeds in the I Pool, as others did. This, they said, I make that would be difficult but not impossible, and clear, because I find in this when we drew up tlie agreement they set that what is clear to me themselves to so arrange that, instead of doing their own fellmongering, they would contract with other fellmongers to take the further argugreen skins and f ellmonger them, and when finished put them in the Pool. If pursued in a bond fide way, that meant that, instead of 700 men working in Hughes' place,-there might be only 400 or 500; but I the balance would be rapidly absorbed interested amongst the sub-contractors. Mr Hughes that went to work to adopt this plan, and I heard to my astonishment yesterday that he had told his operatives that there was work for only 400 of them. On that I say, "" V e r y well; fro m every point, of view that is a breach of the spirit of the Mr Hughes likes to quietly ponder the arrangement I made last week."" pelled to have the fellmongering done elseSouth Sydney( Mr Riley) will be over in where, how can he continue' to employ his a few days, or at least in a week or two. men? he could arrange by contract for the scourshould be safeguarded, but I 'am not preing of the skins, and for the men to be pared to let that consideration weigh me employed where the scouring is done.

We recognise that, annum. but we prefer to pay the price rather than they are to get the same return, as nearly have the agreement complicated with any as it can be judged, on the figures for the of the other businesses in which they are whole twelve months' operations, but ininterested. I say that the Government stead of turning out 4,000,000 lbs., they have done the right thing in adopting this have to turn out 6,000,000 lbs., that is to policy; and if Mr Hughes, after the enorsay, we are getting 50 per cent, more mous worry the controversy has caused tops for the payment of the return than him-and it has caused him as much as it they got under the old agreement.

I ask the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Riley) to realize that we have done all we can to bring about the re-employment of the men engaged in the industry, and we shall continue our efforts to that end.

169,Mr Chariton ( H UN T E R ) [3.52],"should receive some consideration. We have often, complained that private employers do not treat their employees f a i r l y . month or t w o ; but it should be possible In this case we, as a Commonwealth, were partners in the employment of the men, and the Government would do well to consider whether they should not pay some amount to the men who have been out of employment for upwards of two months, and mauy of whom w ill not be re-employed u n t i l the industry is properly adjusted, which may take two or three weeks. I hope the Government w ill take that suggestion into consideration. know nothing about the merits of the case other than I have heard explained by the Acting Prime Minister, but it appears to me that the Government have done everything possible to bring about a f a i r settlement, and that the terms offered to the company are very .good indeed-in fact, better than the company should expect to receive for the work to be performed. At a time when it is essential, in the in terests of the Allies, that the manufacture of wool tops should continue, we should not allow the industry to remain idle for a day longer than is necessary. I hope that the Acting Prime Minister w ill act in accordance with the statement contained in the latter part of his speech, and that if the company is not prepared to do a f a ir thing, the Government w ill take measures to secure control of the industry by the Commonwealth. I rose principally to draw attention to a number of matters connected with the Expeditionary Forces. Notwithstanding the assurance given from time to time that everythng possible is being done to expedite the payments due to the dependants of soldiers who have been killed, a considerable time still elapses before finality is reached. In some cases widowed mothers who are in destitute circumstances, a.nd are anxious to receive the deferred pay of their late sons, are unable to get the money for many months. The Assistant Minister for Defence stated yesterday that these matters are generally finalized inside five months. I have received this week a letter which shows that a settlement has been delayed for nine, months, and I have known of several other cases in which the period has been even gi-eater, sometimes extending to twelve months. It appears to me that the busiuess should be and could be expedited. I quite understand that we cannot expect to receive the documents from the other side of the world in a to finalize each account within four or five months at the outside. The Minister for the Navy( Sir Joseph Cook) promised to do what he could to expedite these payments, but up to the present time no results have accrued from his action. I hope that the Government will give further attention to this matter. Another cause of considerable dissatisfaction is the stoppage of military pay for I breaches of discipline. Most honourable members have received letters from different people, who have complained of their allotment money having been stopped. In some cases married men with a wife and several children dependent on them have been fined for some breach of discipline. Often these breaches are of a very trivial character, as, for instance, overstaying leave, yet, as the honourable pointed out last week, excessive sentences are sometimes imposed. If a man has been fined for some offence, a cable is sent to the Defence Department in Australia to the effect that that soldier has been penalized, and, in consequence, the payment to his dependants ceases. In this way many women are being placed in very grave difficulties. It is not. righ t to say that because a husband has been convicted of some military offence the allowance to his wife and children should cease, or be reduced. Sometimes it hap-, pens that she has been receiving the money for some time after the fine bas been imposed, ancl the stoppage continues until the amount overpaid has been refunded. How can the wives and families of soldiers live if the Department stops the pay upon which they are depending? This is a burning' question throughout the country, and cases such as I have mentioned are doing considerable harm. They are talked about everywhere, and in the interests of our Forces should receive immediate attention. It is not fair to compel the dependants of any soldier to suffer because his field pay has been stopped on account of some offence. We ought to realize that the wives and children of the soldiers are not responsible in such cases, and we should see that they receive the means of support, whatever happens to the offenders themselves",35,Pboducing Inby Which F W Hughes And Company Contbact With British And Whiddon Brothers Were To Get Their
170,Member For Ballarat ( Mr Mcgrath),"On several occasions I have mentioned in this House the refusal of the authorities to pay pensions to men who have enlisted and have been abroad-in some instances for over a year-and then have been returned incapacitated. These men have been reported physically unfit by the doctors abroad, and subsequently by the military doctors in Australia. because the authorities contend that their incapacity has not occurred in connection with warlike operations they are refused pensions. doctor at the time of enlistment, and again at the final examination before embarkation, and while abroad contracts rheumatism or some other complaint caused by the rigours of the climate in Prance or elsewhere, and in consequence is returned to Australia as unfit for further service with the Expeditionary Forces, is it fair to say that, though he has returned shattered in health, his incapacitation has not occurred in connection with warlike operations? otherwise did it occur? have been accepted as a fit man and sent abroad unless he was sound up to the time when he left Australia? returns from military service unfit to earn a shilling, he is disqualified for a pension. instruct the paymaster to make these payThere are many such cases, and, strange to say, in almost every instance in which action has been taken by a member of Parliament, a pension has been granted. But in the meantime the man may have been in Australia for four or five months earning nothing, and dependent on patriotic funds. Such occurrences should not be' allowed. It was surely intended by this Parliament that if a man is returned from abroad, not because he had committed any crime, or because of any ""fault of his own, but because his health had broken down, he should receive a war pension. „ quibble about the incapacitation not having occurred in connection with warlike operations is being raised in so many cases; it is doing an immense amount of harm. see if it is not possible to remove this very has been drawing the allotment. No one genuine grievance. It is purely a matter of the administration of the ""War Pensions Act, and if a man is returned in ill health .and unable to engage in any employment the authorities can easily ascerMr Charlton. tain the reason for his incapacitation and grant a pension. I wish to again deal with the stoppage of payments to foster parents. I have in mind at the present time two cases in which the foster parents had reared the boys from infancy. In one case the boy Yet was never allowed to know that the people who had reared him were not his real father and mother. Both boys were killed, and neither left a will. When the If a man passes the military foster parents made application for the deferred pay the matter was referred to the Public Trustee. His duty is to take out letters of administration, but when he ascertained that the applicants were merely the foster parents of the deceased soldiers he would not pay the money to them, because they had no legal claim. Why need such cases be referred to the Public Trustee at all? If a soldier has allotted his pay to the people who have adopted him, they ought to be able to How claim the deferred pay in the event of his How could he death. I know of an old-age pensioner who reared one soldier from infancy, but he was unable to draw the deferred pay But, though he when that lad was killed at the age of twenty-three. Surely the Minister could ments without referring the matter to the Public Trustee at all. I understand that the reason why the Public Trustee will not recomjiend the payment is that there is a possibility of some other relative turning ut) and claiming the money. honourable member pay the money? whom the soldier had allotted his pay of 3s. per day. A foster parent may have been receiving that amount throughout the son's . service, but when at the I cannot understand why the soldier's death it is found that the' claimant of the deferred pay is not the natural parent of the deceased, the claim to deferred pay is refused. There is no responsibility on the Commonwealth I again ask the Government to if the money is . paid to the person who else could set up a claim for it. many claims have been put up by persons who did not receive any benefit from the son previously.",36,Pboducing Inby Which F W Hughes And Company Contbact With British And Whiddon Brothers Were To Get Their

173,Mr Poynton,"It is astounding howclear as tliat to which I have just drawn attention. I have always urged that the boys who are undergoing military training should not be called npon to drill on Saturdays. In mining districts there' is great objection to it. One Saturday in the fortnight is pay Saturday, and on that day the people in these districts like working youth has for his week-end ento get away' to picnics. The boys like to go away shooting or fishing, but they are unable to do it, because an Area Officer may have fixed on the Saturday afternoon for the compulsory drill. This matter has already been brought before the House on several occasions, and we have been given the information that arrangements were to be made whereby the boys should not be drilled on Saturdays. that they were to be drilled in the employers' time. understanding, but as the pay Saturday in the mining districts is not a working day, and the boys are called upon to attend drill on that day, it means that they are expected to do it in their own time. This has caused a good deal of objection to be taken against compulsory training. Many parents object to their boys being called upon to give up the only day which they have for a holiday. Arrangements seem to have been made to avoid interfering with employers. No consideration seems to have been given to the employee, the boy who is compelled to attend drill on the veiy day on which he could enjoy a holiday. If these little pinpricks could when honourable members did what they be obviated, we would have more harmony in the community. I bring these matters forward so that the Government may give them some consideration. hope, particularly, that attention will be devoted to the matters of military pay to which I have referred, and that something will be done to bring about finality in those matters. [4.8] I support the remarks of the honourable member with regard to Saturday training of the Citizen Forces. There are several features connected with the training of the Citizen Forces to which attention must be paid by Parliament when the more important war matters have ceased to engross our minds. By reason of some of the conditions under which men are trained, compulsory training, instead of serving the useful purpose intended, is giving a very large section of the people an utter distaste for what they conceive to be military methods, and one thing having that effect is the fact that the time which the joyment is that which is almost invariably selected by Area Officers for drills. I also support the contention of the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) with regard to the treatment of those soldiers who, having served the country, even in the trenches, and coming back in a state of ill-health, which some medical officers say is not attributable to the work done in the trenches, are deprived of the privileges that are given to many hundreds of returned men who have not seen the trenches. This is the cause of considerable dissatisfaction in every part of Australia. It is something which cannot be justified. In fact, no member of the Ministry has ever sought to justify it. Nevertheless, no one has ever sought to provide a remedy.. The same remark applies to the failure to review the War Pensions Act. Every time we have had the opportunity of discussing the matter, I have urged that the time has long since passed for this Parliament to have another say in regard to the amount of pensions to be paid aud the conditions under which they can be earned. We are bound by an Act which was pas&d in the first year of the war thought was the right thing to do, but which I venture to say the majority of honourable members to-day would not conI sider was the right thing. amending Bills, but they are not sufficient. had no amendment of that portion of the Act which creates our greatest difficulty. We are still limited as to the amount of pension that a private can get for total incapacity, which amount controls all the other pensions underneath.

It is true-not only of the Pensions Department, but also of every Department of the military service. I suppose that every honourable member has had an experience of a case having been brought te him about which he has written to the Department, and the man who has been deprived of his rights for months has had them restored to him. If the public Departments perly administered there no occasion for an honourable member to write on a soldier's behalf. An amendment of the War PensionsA c t is necessary to provide some in such matters. The chairman of the Centerpretation of what Parliament means by "" employment in connection with warlike operations."" There is also need for much more liberal treatment in regard to the amount of the pensions given. It is a most humiliating fact that many men have had to use the whole of their deferred pay in order to sustain themselves here on their return from the Front. The pensions are not adequate to keep men when they return. They are expected to suiJjdement the pensions they receive. There are two or three purely technical ways in which relatives of soldiers are deprived of their rights. If the mother of a deceased soldier does not annlv within six months of the death of her son, she receives no pension for that six months.. It is simply a case of confiscating her money, because she has had some repugnance; about applying for a pension, and, in fact, has had to be persuaded to do it . There is another section in which the same rule applies. By a purely arbitrary decision of the Department, if a right is not exercised within a certain time, it is not recognised: These provisions are harsh. They deny justice to some who most deserve it. Sentimental feelings with regard to the deaths of sons prohibit many mothers from submitting applications for pensions until they are forced to do it through their own necessities. against burden of taxation on the people, and if I desire to enter a protest the action in regard to wool tops. the necessities been compelled limited power in the hands of highly the industry quite as prosperous as interested persons, many of whom are it was when war broke out, we could giving their services from the patriotic motives, and many of whom are been applied to the wool-tops industry, Mr Hector Lamond. giving them for nothing; but, all the same, they are given autocratic powers to interfere with the industries of Australia in a manner that would not be tolerated for a moment if it were not for the fact that the necessities of the war demand it . Because they possess these powers, every action of the officers of the Boards and Committees which have been formed should be subject to the fullest possible scrutiny, and, at least, should be based were proupon some recognised principle that can would be be readily seen to be actuating it . In the wool-tops business there have been several departures from every set of principles that should be laid down in dealing with tral Wool Committee has in a very luminous document laid down the principles which ought to guide the Committee, but such is the frailty of the human mind that when it was a matter of applying them, the Committee was unable to live up to the precepts which its chairman had preached. The Acting Prime Minister( MrW a t t ) has not told us, nor has any one who supports the recent interference with the wooltops industry told us, what it is that gives the Government the right to treat this industry differently from any other industry in Australia at the present time. If the proposal were part of a scheme to go through the whole of the profiteering industries of the country and say, "" Y o u shall be confined to 12$ per cent, or 16 per cent."", or whatever may be thought to be a right percentage, then I should support it . The Government would be able to say that in a time of difficulty they made use of every resource of the country in order to ease the burden of taxation that must come about as the result of the war. If the Government had reached out to the pastoral industry at the beginning of the war, and said that those enormous profits that were coming to the wool-growers because of the greatly enhanced price of wool as the result of the war would be taken and put into the Treasuryi n order to relieve the 1 of the Wool Committee they had followed that principle throughOwing to out, and, whenever an industry beneof the war we have fited by reason of the war, taken a proto place almost unportion of the new profit while leaving highest have supported the principle which has because it would also bave been fairly apthem as to interfere with existing condiplied all round. However, for some particular reason the wool-tops industry has been singled out and treated in an entirely different manner from what has been proposed with regard to any of the kindred industries centering round the Wool Committee's operations. I understand that the origin of this industry was the perception of MrF . W . Hughes, that by eliminating some of tbe processes at the beginning of the preparation of wool for the making of wool tops, he could make a profit that could hot be secured if he bought When he set out to do this work he wanted the wool on the skins. As his operations were likely to interfere with the profits of those who dealt in skins, however, the brokers who handled the skins set to work to prevent him obtaining a supply. He had then to devote his intelligence to the overcoming of that difficulty, and he proceeded to buy the sheep, so that the skins would belong to him, and would not have to pass through the hands of the brokers. This brought him up against one of the most powerful combines in this country, the combine that handles the meat in our markets; and by the irony of fate, owing to the war, ihe time has come when these powerful interests are able to strip him of .the advantage he had, and which led to the establishment of his industry. It is an extraordinary fact that the one point upon which the Central Wool Committee remain adamant is that he shall not be allowed to fellmonger his skins, which is the actual basis-of his industry. The one thing that enabled him to secure an advantage in the course of manufacture of wool tops was that he was able, in dealing with the skins, to avoid some of the processes which this Committee now insists he shall, quite unnecessarily, carry out. Where does the Committee get the right to interfere with industries in this way? There is the kindred case of tlie small buyers of wool in country towns. only sound principle to be observed by any of these autocratic bodies that are given control of industries owing to war conditions, is that they shall not disturb the existing condition of industries . if they can carry out their functions without doing so. They have no righ t so to exercise the powers which we have to give tions in the slightest degree if their work can be done without doing so. It is the departure from that sound policy, both in regard to the wool tops industry and the position of small wool buyers in country towns, that has brought upon the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) and his colleagues most of the troubles that have arisen in connection with this matter. Every care has been taken to safeguard existing interests in other directions, even to the extent of giving a commission on war loan subscriptions to in the usual way. brokers who do nothing at all. The commission is allowed because their original business was that of selling stock, and there is no desire to deprive them of their livelihoods. Likewise, in dealing w it h the sale of wool, the Committee still allows the brokers to draw a commission, although all the work is done for .them. They have nothing to do in connection with it except to collect their commission. Thus, on the one hand, we find the big man securing his commission, while the small man-the man in the country who is asking for the right to deal in , say, £ 2 5 worth of wool at a time -is denied the privilege. The refusal of this right means that all the wool must be sent to Sydney. We find centralization at every point. If it were necessary, if it had to be done in order that the work the Committee have in hand might be carried out, one would not object; but no necessity has been shown for the action of which I complain, and which means the destruction of industries. The. small grower and the small farmer are being deprived of the readiest way of selling their wool and obtaining their money readily, while in the greater industry of the manufacture of wool tops, operations are being seriously interfered with. The industry is being placed upmi a plane different from that occupied by any other. I would rejoice to know that we were .going to place seme of our other industries on something approaching the same plane, and that all-round justice The was to be done; but I ob ject to this singling out of a new industry, recently established, aud one that has had a hard fight to secure a footing in Australia. What effect will this treatment have upon the establishment of new industries iu the Commonwealth ? If there is one duty more than another to whioh this Parliament should be devoting its energies at the present time, it is that of devising some method of encouraging new industries here. tack on this industry should have been led by a Labour member. If it were the only industry engaged in profiteering I could understand such an action, but wholesale profiteering is going on in this country, and while this Parliament, by means of the war-time profits tax, has made some ""effort to appropriate some of the results of profiteering, the position so far as the wool tops industry is concerned is that the profiteering, if any, that is going on is at the expense of foreign countries and for the benefit of our own. It is introducing money from abroad to be expended in Australia; yet this industry is singled out for special treatment, and there has been so much fighting in regard to it that the Acting Prime Minister says that when he dies the word "" wool tops "" will be found written on his heart, just as Queen Mary said that the word ""Calais"" would be found on hers. If this industry had been allowed to pursue its way as other industries have been, the life of the Acting Prime Minister would certainly have been much happier, and we would have had one example less of the difficulties of establishing new enterprises in Australia. I hope that Mr P. W. Hughes will be liament at the present time than that of able to continue his industry, since I look the establishment of new industries under forward to the time when we shall refuse the most favorable conditions that we can to allow any wool that has not been adafford to give them. vanced to at least the first stage of manufacture to be sent out of Australia.

226,Mr Mathews,"T am not blamingblame for this state of affairs? If the Government were up-to-date there would be an organizer in America buying material, and sending it here as required. The deficiency is not accounted for by the sinking of ships; and the cause must be found in lack of organization. The Government and their omcers ought to exhaust the material already in Australia before looking elsewhere. I understand that all such material in Australia has been tabulated by the Government, who have j?ower to commandeer what is required from any private owners. I am assured that there are firms here possessed of material for shipbuilding, and that it is now lying in their yards. For instance, Messrs. George Russell and Company, of Flinders-street, have materia] of the kind which should be commandeered for shipbuilding; and if there is one firm of the kind there must be others. suitable sizes. our timber is not suitable, and I know that ships are being built of oregon. It would appear as though tlie Government were looking for difficulties in connection witli the supply of material; and the present position is either due to following the course laid down by the Prime Minister or due to incompetency on the part of the men in charge. Mr Curchin, of whose capabilities I know nothing, has been imported from Britain at £2,000 a year as the head of the Shipbuilding Department; and, to my mind, his management is not worth the money. He has a large staff-al l imported men. imported. highest paid men are imported. that two' of the principal men are close blood-relations of t h e manager; and I do not believe in that sort of thing. I am willing to admit that forcing undesired men on a manager does not tend to good work; but, nevertheless, it would bo better if there were not this close connection. The disappointing results at the shipyards are the faul t df either the Government or of the immediate management. If the Government are responsible they ought to be prodded up by their own supporters, as well as by the Opposition, and if _it is the faul t of the management, the Government should see to it . A short while ago a question was asked in the House about Mr Pickering, who is in charge of the yard at Williamstown, and it was elicited that he had been for thirty years foreman in a shipyard somewhere in England. We were not told, however, in what branch he had been foreman men connected with the shipbuilding in Australia; and he was offered a much higher salary than he is getting now, if ' he would go to a position in Queensland. there are a dozen different departments, and it would be quite possible for a man to be t h i r t y years foreman in one of these, and yet not competent to take charge of a yard. In any case, if he is as competent as is claimed, £600 a year does not seem a sufficient salary; and I think he ought to have accepted the Queensland offer. The job is We are told that worth a higher salary if the man is efficient. who was then manager of Walkers Limited, in Queensland, said to me"" If you do not want that man I w ill pay h i m £750 a year to enter my service.'' that he was content with £600 if he could have got an appointment at £750.

If the Government have exhausted all their brain power, and are satisfied with the present progress of shipbuilding in Australia, I am not. would not be in any case. satisfied that everything is going on all right, but with the trouble which the Prime Minister initiated with the unions, and inefficiency on the part of either the Government or the manager of the yards, shipbuilding is making no progress whatever. The progress the Government are making is much like that of the boys in Germany, who used to stick a carrot in their caps and walk backwards, saying "" We are going to Berlin."" The poor, unfortunate Northern Territory has been handled in a most peculiar way. and Territories ( Mr Glynn) is one of those gentlemen whom we all admire and trust; therefore, anything I have to say in criticism of the administration does not arise out of any ill-feeling towards him. So far as the officials are concerned, I do not know them personally, and have no antipathy towards them either. But I do know that the"" Northern Territory has been mismanaged to' an alarming degree, and if the newspapers which are always hammering away at other alleged extravagances would tell the people what is happening in the Northern Territory, it would be of advantage to themselves and to the .people of Australia. The Administration made arrangements a couple of years ago for the purchase of a ship to facilitate official work about the coast of the Territory. That vessel has not reached Darwin yet. I believe that it put out from port some time ago, and came back on account of engine trouble. The vessel put. out again; then it was found that the borer was in the planks and that the timber generally was rotten. The vessel was again returned to port and repaired. Por two years the vessel has been departing and returning. The Minister told me about ten days ago that the vessel was at last on its way to its destination. But I have not heard that it has arrived yet. Such things almost savor of corruption. of the vessel ? Forrest. I remember hearing another story about the Administrator's motor car. It developed trouble, and was brought to Melbourne or. Sydney for repairs. Then the officers of some Government Department started joy riding in it. It was repaired again, and shipped for Darwin. At Brisbane it was taken ashore for more joy riding; then it was repaired again. That is the sort of thing that happens in connection with the Northern Territory. I read an article in the Age recently about a great flock of sheep that had been discovered in some portion of the Northern Territory. Somebody suggested to me that I should inquire where the land is situated, to what extent it has been depastured, to what extent it is available for The present Minister for Home selection, also whether the discovery is the result of recent exploration; if not, why has Dr. Gilruth not disclosed the value of the country before? The stories which de Bougemont told about riding over portions of Australia on the backs of turtles are no more exaggerated than this statement about an alleged discovery of' new pastures and flocks in the Northern Territory. I should like to know to whom those sheep belongs how they got there, and the extent of the area on which they are depastured. That story is a sample of what one hears"" about the Territory. The residents of Darwin are a most peacef u l crowd. Here is the report of a meeting of the Darwin Town Council,At a meeting of the Darwin Town Council to-night the following resolution was adopted:"" That Darwin Town Council, being, the only representative of the public, and having read the answer made in Parliament to a certain question put in April, last about the Northern Territory Judiciary, and feeling the hopelessness of any appeals to the Minister That was rectified. for redress as to Government officials here, so long as he believes and repeats the false answers supplied to him by or on behalf of the oflicials complained of, feel it our duty to lay before the Minister and communicate to the press, the following: (1) That the answers given as to the nature and extent of the legal advising done by the Judge are untrue, and were obviously prepared to deceive the southern public and Parliament; (2) that the public here know well that the Judsie is completely in the confidence of the Administrator,' and that he is consulted generally,",45,Pboducing Inby Which F W Hughes And Company Contbact With British And Whiddon Brothers Were To Get Their

Public are not deceived by the phrase about the impartiality of the Australian Judiciary Bench, when it refers to this country; (3) that when the Judge came here he went to stay with the Administrator, and -has ever since been his most intimate friend and daily companion, and the Judge, by his conduct off and on the Bench, has shown that he is partisan. For instance, when criminal trials are going on c it is evident that the prosecuting is done from the Bench, and the .Government lawyer, has little to do. Such is the case also with thc Stipendiary Magistrate. The Judge is generally considered here as the all-round legal hand, of the Government, and fast friend and invariable supporter of the Administrator. People cannot, and do not, regard him as a Judge; (4) that the Stipendiary Magistrate, who we believe receives a labourer's wage or less, was appointed after he had been by law superannuated from the Customs Department. He is considered to be supporter of and to be supported by the Administrator, and the Judge, and cannot be looked upon as a worthy or impartial or independent Magistrate. He has been referred to in the local paper as the caterpillar and sycophant of the Administrator; (5) that it is'felt that there are no Courts of Justice for citizens in the Territory, and we urge the Minister no longer to be hoodwinked by reports from the Administrator, but see that Courts presided over by able and impartial men, who will keep aloof from and independent of the personal wishes of the Administrator, are forthwith provided.""

Government not appoint one? I have received this letter from a resident of Darwin The last wire I sent you re jurors was on the best information. You know the Judge tried to do away with the jury and failed, so now they are trying to command it by limiting i i to householders. If successful, this would be the position: As 70 per cent, of the houses in Darwin are Government houses, occupied by Government servants, they could make. a certainty of a Government jury, because out of the other 30 per cent, fully 20 per cent, would be Chinese, Greeks, Russians, &c, who would not be called, and the other 10 per cent, would be business people, who are semi-dependent on the administration; or, to be correct, 5 per cent, of the latter would be so, and they could easily sand-bag the other 5 per cent.

252,Mr Mathews,"I have nothing toTerritory. Until that ia done, we shall not get true information in regard to what is happening there. ment will be failing in their duty if they do not appoint a Royal Commission such .as I have suggested. The other day I submitted a question in regard to the attitude of the Defence Department towards a few of the men who were the first to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force, and who have sought to be discharged. Sof a r as I can learn no effort is being made to meet the cases such as I shall outline to honourable members. appears to me that very little care is taken of a man who offers his services to his country once the Department gets hold of him. It is an absolute disgrace to see in all parts of Australia fine strapping men with the impertinence to go strutting about the streets in uniform while the Minister dares to tell me that men at the Front cannot get relief. Some effort should be made to get over the difficulty. This is one of the cases I have submitted to the Ministeri n correspondence. an application made by a father, who asks for his son's discharge on the following grounds:1. On account of his domestic affairs, as outlined hereunder:2. That during his absence the farm on which he has worked for five years is going to ruin, and that, whilst receiving no Teturn from the farm, the land rents and water rates are still being debited, and will have to be paid at a later date. 8. Havring a wife and child to support. 4. On account of his long service with the Forces without any mark against him. Briefly, the facts of his case are as follow :At the outbreak of the war my son was farming at Nangeenan, and had been working his holding for five years. Feelingi t his duty to enlist, he came to Perth, and with his brother enlisted early in September, 1914. He left Australia in. December, 1914, and has served continuously until March, 1918, when lie left France and returned to Australia as one of the original ANZACs, on two months' furlough, arriving here in May last. When he enlisted in 1914, arrangements were made with a neighbouring farmer to work his selection, on the share system. The cost of the first cropping being borne by my son, and the cost of cropping in the succeeding years being paid out of the profits of the previous years. Now, on his return; he visited tlie farm, and finds that a crop was put in and taken off during the first year of his absence; since then nothing has been done, and of the money due to him from the crop, he has not received one penny-the whole of the amount being taken The Governby the Agricultural Department to pay land rents falling due during his absence. Further, he finds his fences down, his horses running wild, and the land being overrun with scrub; also his machinery, whicli was partly paid for, taken possession of by the firms from whom he purchased. Naturally he is much upset at the state of his place, feeling that his previous five years' hard work, together with all his savings, in addition to financial assistance from myself to the extent of £300, have gone for nothing. He desired to at once go on the farm and try to get things into order again. Feeling that, apart from his long service It with the Forces, his domestic affairs warranted him obtaining ihis discharge, he wrote the Defence Department, explaining his position, and asking to be discharged. Has request was, however, refused. Not wishing to leave his affairs in the present unsatisfactory state, he made a further application to the Defence Department, again explaining his position, and asking that his furlough bo extended for six months, so as to enable him to do the necessary repairs, &c, to his farm, and at the same time endeavour to obtain some one to attend the place during his further absence. It is He has now been informed that his request for six months' extended leave is not approved, but that he has been granted one month's leave, without pay. Now, a, month's leave to fix his affairs is absolutely useless. Further, to stop his pay for the month seems to me to be out of all reason, especially when it is taken into consideration that lie has served with the Forces since September, 1914, and has not been away from his unit. Two brothers enlisted, one of them being a married man, who had spent five years on a farm in the back country of Western Australia, and on going away had made arrangements for its care, only to find now that it has been wholly neglected. When he asked for his release after serving four years, the Ministerf o r Defence (Senator Pearce) said that he would be granted an extra month's leave without pay. This is the letter I received from the MinisterI desiire to assure you that I have personally looked through the file dealing with the case, and recognise that it is a hard one. At the same time, owing to the largo number of applications for discharge now being received, we -have been forced to draw the line very rigidly, and many cases quite as hard have had to be refused. man, who, through the whole of his administration has been very unwise, and has always been keenly desirous of looking",47,Pboducing Inby Which F W Hughes And Company Contbact With British And Whiddon Brothers Were To Get Their

255,Mr Gregory,"No; but it was aafter the slackerAnother case which I submitted to the Minister was that of a man named Burton, who had a farm at Wickepin, in Western Australia, upon which he estimated he had spent some £2,000 during the course of six years. I have not the particulars of his history with me, but I can give some of them from memory. He was wounded at Gallipoli and sent to hospital. He sneaked out of hospital and returned to Gallipoli. was wounded again. He went to Prance and was gassed there. He was promoted, and subsequently returned to Australia on furlough. found that his partner had abandoned the farm, and sold up everything. Thinking that he might have a chance of getting a little back from his land, on which he had spent so much time and money, he endeavoured to get his release from the Australian Imperial Porce, but his application was refused. This man was No. 3, he being the thir d man to be accepted in Western Australia. I strongly protest against the treatment meted out to these men, because one finds in the Defence Department a number of men classed as indispensables; fine, strong, eligible men. I look upon it as hypocrisy on the part of the Ministers to dare to go round the country telling the people what' their duty is when we see them in their motor cars driven by chauffeurs who do not bear the badges of returned soldiers. The other day I submitted a question, asking how many chauffeurs were employed by Ministers, how many were eligible for service at the Front, and how many were returned soldiers. ritv of them are. some instruction to them not to wear their badges. Every one of them ought to be a returned soldier. men who are not wearing their badges. good many of them are frightened to do so. work if they wear them. stance the other night where a young returned soldier, sitting in a tram and reading a newspaper, was bashed on the nose by one of three great hulking brutes as they got off the car. a rule it is menwho are eligible, and are enjoying the advantage of being in a Government Department who jeer and gibe at the boys who are going to the. Front. When I was in Sydney recently there were fifteen lads on the railway platform going to the Liverpool Camp. There was not one among them of the stature of He a man, but I saw a great hulking brute gibing at them as they were going away to do their duty for their country. What can we expect from a Department that When he came back, he issues a regulation that boys of eighteen years of age can enlist without their parents' consent? with boys of nineteen vears of age. applv to boys of eighteen, but we had it altered, and it is a scandal even to-day that boys nineteen' years of age should be permitted to take the places which ought to be filled by some of these big crawling cowards, who w ill not do> their share for the country. The regulation may apply to ' a boy who is the last of his family. I have no desire to be too severe in my remarks. I realize that there are some good, sound patriotic men in the Defence Department who are only too glad to do their duty, but there is not th© slightest doubt it is the home of the slacker. In a great many cases those who have dodged their duty and returned as quickly as possible have the best billets in the Department. When we find the Minister acting upon recommendations made. I think that the majoby that class of men,what' else can we expect but the treatment I have described in regard to these applications. I cannot understand the spirit that imbues those who are in charge of the Department. I recently copied from the certificate of discharge granted to a returned soldier the. following endorsement : The practice of including a statement of character or special qualification on the discharge certificate has been discontinued. Instead of a discharge certificate showing what service the man to whom it relates has done-whethe r he has been to Gallipoli, Palestine, or France, to what Division he was attached, and in what campaigns he took part -the Department 1 now decline, as they say, to give on such certificates any statement of character.",48,Pboducing Inby Which F W Hughes And Company Contbact With British And Whiddon Brothers Were To Get Their

Consequently, Japan obtained the buildings and machinery of the combine, or so much as it would not pay to remove, practically for nothing. I have here a copy of the Tariffs of the world, and I think that any honourable member who examines them will, agree with me that the Japanese Tariff is the most up to date. It has a duty of 355 per cent, on tobacco, making an exception of chewing tobacco, which in Melbourne is sold at a. very low costI think, 4d. per oz -and of snuff. On the "" k in , "" a Japanese measure equalling about 1.3 lbs. avoirdupois, the duty is 2 yen 23 sen, or about 4s. 5£d. English money. On snuff, the duty is 10s. 4d. l 25th per kin.

While I do not think that the Administrator has been partial-and I am using a mild word-to the locking up of the land, it cannot be denied that his name has been freely mentioned in connection with Vestey Brothers. I do not think there is justification for the suggestion made, and, with the Minister, I sincerely hope that it has no foundation; hilt when such statements are repeated, it is time definite action was taken by the Government, for where there is continued "" smoke"" there is generally supposed to be ""fire."" In my heart, I free Dr. Gilruth from any suspicion. at all to do with the Vesteys.

We are nearly as far from Darwin as Darwin is from Japan. There is a difference of only a very few hundred miles. It is time the Administrator should be told that it is his duty, as an employee of a Government that believes in ithe White Australia principle, to set a good example by employing white people. them a chance; and, if he would do so, his example would be followed by one or two other prominent employing parties in .the Territory. This Cinderella of Australia must be dealt with trenchantly. We must try to make the Territory cease from continuing the great burden that it has increasingly become as the years have passed on. Home and Territories) [6.21] -The condition of the Northern Territory is not quite as bad as some persons assume. If we take away the annual obligations for redemptions-and this year they amount to £320,000-and remove also the interest upon loans-that is, if they are knocked out of the exchequer altogether-and . if .we do not .take into account the loss on other Departments, such as the Post Office, which are not administered in the Territory, the deficit for the year will amount to only about £35,000. When the Territory was taken over the actual indebtedness totalled about £6,000,000, and the annual deficit for administration, line), redemption, &c, amounted to about £241,000. We were under contract with the South Australian Government to spend about £4,000,000 in the construction of railways. So the total obligations taken over when the Territory was placed directly and for the first time in our history under Federal control, consisted of the sum of £6,000,000, and the contracted obligations just indicated, amounting in all to some £10,000,000. Since that period the Federal Government have behaved honestly over the financial aspect by facing the responsibility of interest upon debts, which had been paid out of the revenue until about two years ago. This was a factor which, in these serious times of world warfare, lightened our great burden of. what would have been heavy obligations. And this year, as I have just indicated, the redemptions amount to about £320,000. I had always stood up for that procedure, and, so soon as circumstances permitted, that was the course adopted. The annual deficit on Territory accounts is not now very great. It is being greatly reduced in relation to ordinary and works expenditure ; and, as I have just pointed out, the He can get 'them if he gives loss may be regarded as having been brought down to something like £40,000.

I have recently received reports regarding copper, tin, and wolfram; but the great drawback is the lack of capital. The wolfram field at Hatches Creek is about 600 miles from Darwin, and about 300 miles from the Macdonnell Ranges. The tin field at Marranboy is not quite as good as it was thought to be until comparatively recently. With respect to that field, I injourney Dr. Gilruth saw several pastoralterested myself closely in the matter, and ft took the opportunity, while in South Australia some years ago, to see Mr Brown, who has had great experience as a geologist in the Territory. He told me that he was doubtful about the success of tin discoveries, and added that, as one goes down, they do not improve as a rule. The conditions at Marranboy are not quite as hopeful as some of the earlier reports of geologists represented them to be. Tliere is a want of capital to test it and all such enterprises at the present time. The great difficulty is transport, and we are endeavouring to find an outlet into Queensland. Some of the miners at Hatches Creek have come from Queensland. One of the reasons for Dr. Gilruth's journey overland across the Queensland border, and on to Brisbane, was in order to learn the conditions at Hatches Creek, and to personally investigate the problem of pastoral developthe Territory, both in regard to distance ment in the interior between that field and the Queensland border. The pastoral industry is the factor to which we have to look in the Territory. Pastoralists so far have not had as fair a chance as, perhaps, they have been entitled to with respect to taking up land. The conditions of resumption have hitherto deterred some men. For example, under the pastoral laws there was a. power of resumption within two years. "" I cannot imagine pastoralists going to the Territory unless they are more fully secured, say, up to a period of ten years, in respect to the return of their capital. Some little time ago I went into this subject with Dr. Giltoralists more liberally. ruth, and decided to frame an Ordinance which would give pastoralists at least ten or fifteen years in which to secure some definite return upon their capital. pastoralists have asked for about twenty years. mer in Queensland twenty-eight years. of the conditions in Queensland, as I received the assistance of an official from that State a while ago when I was engaged in drafting the heads of a proposed pastoral measure. Upon his overland ists; and I am convinced that the best way to deal with such problems as that of the pastoral industry in the Territory is to come into direct contact with the men concerned.

The whole of that expenditure is to be upon water development'. While one recognises the very great difficulties that exist in a country such as and to the task of getting stock upon those interior lands, still the improvement has been such as to warrant hope. Pastoral land seems to be attracting attention outside; and, no doubt, after .the war, when a number of men return who, prior to their departure, had given some thought to pastoral activity in the Territory, they will be induced to settle, and assisted in settling there. I am convinced that the conditions will appeal to them as being somewhat better than before they went away.

304,Mr Falkineb,"The leases must beAustralian Act the power of resumption was held in too short a period, and it deterred some from taking up land. There is this factor existing at present, that in the Territory on large areas adjoining Queensland the rental is from about 2s. to 3s. 6d., while the rent in Queensland is from 5s. up to 12s. 9d.; in the latter instance the matter of railway communication rates is taken into account. Altogether, conditions generally are gradually becoming known, to pastoralists, and settlement will continue slowly to improve. Revenue has been increasing in greater proportion than ordinary and works expenditure during the past two or three years. Sitting propose to deal with several statements which have been made during this debate regarding the Central Wool Committee. It Was stated that the wool-tops industry is a new one. On reference to the Commonwealth Year-BookI find that in 1908-9 the wool-top manufacturers received in bounties £ 3 2 6 ; in 1909-10, £ 4 , 9 3 3 ; in 1910-11, £ 8 , 5 2 2 ; in 1911-12, for a continuous audit in our behalf. B ut £.16,898; in 1912-13, £ 1 3 , 0 0 0; in 1913-14, £12,000; in 1914-15, £ 7 , 7 0 0 ; and in 1915-16, struggling industry has received assistance in its establishment to the amount of about £70,000. The statement made by the honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Hector Lamond) that the industry was being interfered with by the Wool Committee was quite incorrect. When the British Government acquired the Australian wool clip, War Precautions Regulations were issued which provided, amongst other things, that the local manufacturer should get sufficient wool oub of the Pool to carry on his trade. agreement that the Wool Pool was to be .exploited for the benefit of any local manufacturer. The initial acquisition of the wool clip by the Home Government wlas only for the remaining portion of that year, and affected about two-thirds of the clip. _ The wool-tops industry requires a certain amount of technical knowledge, and the members of the Wool Committee knew little about the cost of manufacture. Buti n order that the industry might be carried on, we made an arrangement with MrF . W . Hughes. A f t e r a great deal of trouble, we induced that gentleman to supply us with a statement of the costs of manufacture. TheseI checked as well as I could by figures which I obtained from a woolbuyer of great experience, and I found that in almost every instance Mr. Hughes' costs exceeded the figures which had been supplied to me. However, the Wool Committee gave him the benefit of the difference. As the scheme at that time related to only the_remaining portion of the year, and .the Wool Committee was only a temporary one, without any great experience to guide us, We decided to give the manufacturers half of the profits between the cost of manufacture and the price at which the tops were sold to the Japanese Government. That amounted to about ,9d. per lb., and when it became known that the profit which the manufacsuspended front 6-30 to 7.J.5 p.m. turers would make would be something like £90,000, members of the Opposition I raised an outcry that the Committee had allowed Mr Hughes too big a price, and that he would make a profit quite out of proportion to the amount of capital he had invested. A t the end of the year, we were unable to get from Mr Hughes a completed balance-sheet, although we had arranged as we did not desire that any-men should be out of employment, we allowed him to £5,800. This unfortunate continue his operations, with a proviso that the profits over and above 9d. per lb -in the meantime the price of tops had beeni increased by the British Government-shoul d be retained by the Central Wool Committee. That arrangement was continued for some time. In the meantime Mr Hughes thought he had discovered that the agreement could be read to be continuous, while the Pool ""lasted, instead of being for only a period of twelve months, and for the manufacture of 2,400,000 lbs. of tops. That is what There was no he has been fighting for. The honourable member for Illawarra referred to the 12J per cent, of profit which the Wool Committee suggested that Mr Hughes should be allowed to make, and he reiterated Mr. Hughes' complaint that we were limiting the rate of interest on capital. We were not doing t h a t ; 12J per cent, is equal to £62,000 on Mr Hughes' capital, and that would be the approximate amount he would make in twelve months. Buti n order to express it in clear terms, we suggested that the profit should be on a basis of 12J per oent. As soon as that was arranged, Mr Hughes, thinking that he",56,Pboducing Inby Which F W Hughes And Company Contbact With British And Whiddon Brothers Were To Get Their
305,Mr Glynn,Yes. Under the South,57,Pboducing Inby Which F W Hughes And Company Contbact With British And Whiddon Brothers Were To Get Their
306,Mr Falkiner (Hume) [ 7 . 4 5 ],"could successfully claim that the agreement was a continuous one, and recognising the vast amount of profit it would yield him, not only refused to .continue his operations, and sacked his men, but he tried to bring political influence to bear in this House. He also went about Sydney, and endeavoured to bring influence to bear on the Wool .Committee by approaching the firms with which the members of the Committee were connected in order to prevent them getting any business unless the Committee proved amen-' able to reason. The honourable member for Illawarra spoke with the valour of ignorance, as most of us do at times; but if he had a little more knowledge of pastoralism, he would not have stated that Mr Hughes was content to continue operations on the basis of a 12J per cent, profit if the same standard were adopted for the pastoral industry. I assure the honourable member that the ordinary pastoralist on freehold land would be well content to continue his industry on a guaranteed profit of 1 2 | per cent, on his capital. my suggestion. that Mr Hughes has benefited the workers by reducing the price of meat is not true, because on the day he began to operate in Melbourne through a firm called Brown and Company, sheep tose 2s. 6d. per head on account of his competition. meat exporters of whom honourable members complain. Another statement made by the honourable member for Illawarra was that the brokers are doing practically nothing for their commission. The brokers are charging no more commission on the sale of wool than they charged before the Wool Pool was formed. reason why they should, because they are doing a tremendous lot more work. Certainly, the price of a bale of wool is a little higher, but the brokers have now to do a great deal of work which they had not to do before. The scoured wool is all put back into their stores and appraised a second time. In addition to that, the clerical work -now involved is enormous. brokers sent out final and complete account sales immediately after the wool was sold. Now they have to send out an account for 90 per cent, of the money, another account for the 10 per cent, retention money, and a further account for the declared dividend. As some little time may elapse before the final dividend is paid, the Central Wool Committee has now asked the brokers to send in a statement of the name and address of every person for whom they have sold wool, so that we may be sure that every grower in the Pool will participate in the final disbursement. Thus honourable members will see that, whereas formerly the broker sent out one account, he has now to send out four or five; and it will be understood that when a broker's clientele number thousands, a great deal of clerical work is involved. Further than that, the brokers must countermark the bales, a practice that was unknown in the old days. In regard to the suggestion that some of us are making money out of the Wool Pool, I can safely say, for my colleagues and myself, that during the two years the scheme has been in operation we have was not neglected our own business interests in order that the scheme may succeed. So The statement far from the Wool Committee being "" a one-horse show,"" the Chairman is intelligent enough not to decide any question of a practical nature unless all the members of the Committee are present. The appraisers are doing work for £209.000 less than they might have charged under Moreover, he is one of the the War Precautions Regulation, which stipulated that they were to receive 1 per cent., which would have represented £400,000.

Much has been said about the break in manufacturing operations involved by the suggested new agreement. We are told that the wool top industry will be ruined because the manufacturer will be required to dry his scoured wool and have it appraised. There is a reason and a necessity for that procedure. I assure honourable members that the members of .the Wool Committee are applying their best intelligence and knowledge to the work of that body, in order that the British Government, who bought the wool, may be satisfied that they have had an honest deal from the Commonwealth. We are not, as some honourable members think, merely the representatives of the growers, and resolved to get all we can out of the scheme. We cannot make the price of wool either more or less; and we were appointed for the sole purpose of seeing that the agreement with the British Government was carried out in a proper and business-like manner. Sometimes the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) and I differed from the brokers' representatives on the Committee, but I have not heard any of them make any statement which could be regarded as a narrow or selfish one. They have unquestionably devoted their best knowledge to the Commonwealth in connection with this wool deal. In regard to the break which has occurred in the operations of the Colonial Weaving, pany, F. W.

Mr Falkiner. Ultimately, the small wool appraised, othenvise when Mr. Hughes sent wool back into the Pool we oould not say whether it was shorn wool, appraised wool, or some wool of his own. The condition that all wool must be appraised was not imposed as a whim on the part of the Central Committee, but as a necessity, so that there could be no question in regard to the honesty of this scheme. -dealing w it h the matter, is there? way""* of ascertaining the quantity and value of the wool. I would also remind honourable members that the price Mr. Hughes was being paid for this extra labour was quite a sufficient recompense to him. running for more than a year without having his wool appraised. reason that we could not get his balance sheet out of him to enable us to make a fresh agreement w it h him. Finally, when we declared that the position which had obtained could not continue any longer, he intimated that he could not accept our terms, and proceeded to throw several hundreds of men out of employment. The members of the Central Wool Committee, I am sure, are just as much concerned about the unemployment of these men as is any honourable member of this House. When the present scheme was initiated, it was estimated that wool tops, in their manufactured state, were Combing and Spinning Comworth 53d. per lb.

To give honourable members some idea of the kind of examination which is conducted by the Interviewing Committee, I may quote the following questions which were put to one candidate: How old are you? When was your birthday? How do you travel to school? school do you attend? How did you reach the city to-day? What was the fare? What games do you play? Do you play tennis? Have you a court of your own? Where do you play? Arc you in any football team? What position do you play in? Can you kick with both feet when in difficulties? What other schools have you played? Are you in any cricket team? Will you be captain of it also? What is your speciality in cricket? What kind of a ball do you bowl? About what is your bowling average? Do you hold a straight bat? Which do you like better, cricket or football? How would you stop a bolting horse ? Which woman in English history do you think has done the most'for England?

Do you think the Kaiser did anything to stop or prevent the war? Did King George? How did the war commence? join? How many men has Australia sent to the war? How many men has Canada sent to the war?

The Acting Ministerf o r the Navy has said that parents are bound to make complaints, and, while I agree that that is so, I am dealing with the case of a lad who has now given up all hope of entering the Navy, though he previously strongly desired to do so.. He was a Scotch College lad, as I have said, and presented a john, the headmaster of that college, saying that he was just the type of lad who absolutely filled the bill.

Prom what is disclosed by the file, it is transparent that the Naval Board was determined at all costs not to-give in to the views of the doctors in this matter. I have made the position plain enough from my own point of view, but to show that I do not lightly make an attack upon the veracity of this Department I propose to go a little further. The Acting Ministerf o r the Navy( Mr Poynton) is doing his best in this Department; he is working all the time conscientiously and ably, but I want to show, h i m that this Department of his has made the art of correspondence the most inexact science that the world knows. I have here another instance to which I shall briefly refer to show that this experience of mine is not necessarily entirely new or revolutionary. I learned in Sydney some time ago that this Department, w it h its customary business acumen, had indulged very largely in the hirin g of launches, and that the money so spent was excessive. I therefore thought it well to ask a question or two on the subject. As honourable members know, I deal with most of these mattersoutside the House; since the war I have not done much in tlie way of raising a riot here. I wrote to the Department, asking what the motor boat hire had cost. 19th February. On 27th FebruaryI received the ordinary formal acknowledgment. On the 4th JulyI wrote again, asking if there was any answer to my inquiry. this silence, that the information I had received was correct, and on the 17th JulyI received the first answer, as follows: I licg to inform you that up to March, 1918, £12,954 was expended on the hire of launches. able friends to adopt my own practice, That was in Sydney alone. to have bought all the launches in educative. Sydney. launches in the State. I am not, however, dealing now w it h the question of whether this policy was right or wrong. The letter went on to state thatOne vessel was purchased and one conters, that one of the. assets of our Navy, structed since the outbreak of war. It was not considered desirable to further increase the gunboat Alberi, had been sold at the number of Government-owned launches, as auction, and that the speculator who it was anticipated, when .the rush work of fitting out vessels as transports, &ic., was passed, that service launches would be available to do patrol work, for which purpose the hired launches were mainly used. This anticipation has been realized, as three hired launches, which involved most of the expenditure, have now, by a re-arrangement of work, heen released and returned to the owners. I felt that these three launches must have been "" some"" launches, and, therefore, . 1 became interested, and wrote to the Department, thanking them for their letter, which was illuminating, and said I would be glad if they would kindly let me have further particulars of the three hired launches referred to in the final paragraph. That was the first danger signal that the Department got, and the next answer is a proof of my assertion that the departmental officials have made this question of correspondence a science the very reverse of exact. The reply did not give the particulars which I asked for, but said the first launch cost £6 a week, the second £8 a week, and the third £6 a week. I remind honourable members that we are still a long way off the £12,954, and I was further informed"" It w ill be noted that the hire of these three launches was only a portion of the total cost of hire since the outbreak of the war."" In the first letter, and before they realized that the thing was loaded, they told me they That was on the were going to set everything right, because they had got r i d of the ' three launches which had been costing them so much, but when they found out that that answer would not do, they said that the I had begun to suspect, from three launches only represented portion of the account!

""It is a little laborious, An expenditure sufficient but it is amusing sometimes, and it is NowI would like to make a passing reference to another matter before I leave this Department, with, I hope, my reputation untarnished.

384,Mr Kelly,"Practicall y all thebought the gunboat subsequently sold the engines for more than he had paid for the whole show, lock, stock, and barrel! But that is not all. Not only had he sold the engines at a handsome profit, but he was. imprudent enough to sell them to another Commonwealth Department anxious to find out which of my friends ou the Ministerial benches had bought these engines. I did not know whether it was the Postmaster-General( Mr Webster) or, perhaps, and probably more likely, my honourable friend the Minister for Home and Territories ( Mr Glynn), who, I underwith which my correspondence with the stand, has been building ships for the Northern Territory and Papua in recent times. Therefore, being a prudent person, and wishing to be informed, I wrote to the Navy Office on 1st August for a description of these aged and wonderful engines which some other Department had bought. privately or by auction? that they had been sold by auction, but T am subject to correction in that respect. In my letter to the Navy Office, I asked if they would be kind enough to inform me who bought the gunboat Albert, how much was paid for her, and also supply me with a description of the engines sold with . her. I wanted that information, because I felt sure that no Minister would admit having bought the engines, though, perhaps, the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Jensen) may have done so, quite innocently, of course. As I have stated, my earnest inquiry was directed to the Deject. It may be trifling to the country partment on the 1st August, and there has been a most murky silence ever since-no t even an acknowledgment that the inquiry had been received, so I now take the liberty, on the floor of the House, of askgranted what the doctors said he should ing my honourable friend, the Acting Minister for thc Navy( Mr Poynton), if he will find out who really bought the engines. this before. already explained what amount of correspondence took place over the matter. cated with me, you would have got a reply, at any rate. : being a sensitive man, I was so knocked off my perch last night by the Minister's suggestion that I had done the Department an injustice, that I decided as soon as possible to let my honourable friend I was iuto my secret. to me about this matter until you mentioned it to-night. That is hardly fair. orable friend that if I were to refer in this House to every matter in connection Department has not been satisfactory to me, he would not thank me. I ask him seriously to look into the file of my correspondence. If he does, he will see that I have treated his Department very generously.

I come now to the chief matter with which I wish to deal, the effect of the administration of the Central Wool Committee on the business of country wool merchants. Government took over the Australian wool clip at a magnificent price, it became necessary for this Government, as their agents, to establish a system whereby possession could be taken of the wool, and arrangements made for its proper classification and distribution to the manufacturers, including a l l the details of the wool trade. Government could have taken over all the wool businesses of Australia in both town a;id country, paying for .the services of those engaged in the industry either on a percentage basis or in some other way. Believing in f a i r play, I say that it is wrong to ignore the claims of those in the wool business. of men and firms only was not right. What was the position before the British Government bought our wool? Most of the wool was being handled by city merchants and brokers, but an ever-increasing proportion was being handled by country wool merchants, many of them with fifty or sixty years of business experience, who had started from nothing, and had built up large connexions, buying scores of thousands of pounds of wool for both foreign and British manufacturers. of pounds laid out in plant. representatives preach the doctrine of decentralization, and we say that the country wool merchants should have been wiped out only if it was impossible to take them into consideration in providing for the passing over of our wool to Great Britain. tended three deputations and a conference at tlie Central Wool Committee, I have not heard a tittle of evidence to show that that was necessary. Central Wool Committee is composed of able and capable men appointed by the Government, who are directly, or in directly, representative of great interests. The biggest part, that emIts members areJ. M. Higgins, Esq., gentleman, chairman and Government nominee. , W. J. Young, Esq., CBE., wool-selling broker; A. H Moore, Esq., wool-selling broker, W. S. Fraser, Esq., wool-selling broker, wool-sellers' representatives. Edmund Jowett, Esq., M.P., pastoralist; F. B. S. Falkiner, Esq., M.P., pastoralist, wool-growers' representatives. E. B. McComas, Esq., wool-buyer, woolbuyers' representative. Clearly, when the British Burdett Laycock, Esq., wool manufacturer, manufacturers' representative. These men have been at some time or another competitors of the country wool merchants. Their functions are ""to administer the sale of the Australian wool clips to the British Government."" The first thing the Committee did was to issue a regulation practically forbidding the sale of one skin throughout the country. The Commonwealth The bush settler's wife, who usually sells sheepskins to the hawker, or to the man in charge of the country merchant's delivery van, was forbidden to continue this practice. Not one pound of wool could be -sold. This regulation caused such an outcry that the Committee had to relax its draconic methods to the extent of makTo do justice to one set ing tlie purchasing of skins free, and of allowing the purchase of wool by country wool merchants up to £ 1 0 . There was a time when I belonged to the class of small wool-growers who have two or three bales which they wish to sell in September or October, being paid for it by the local dealer. The dealers' carts and vans move in thousands throughout Australia. They convey mail matter more expeditiously than many of the Postmaster-General's services, and assist settlers by bringing to them a dozen and one little things of great material value. The dealers purA n d with thousands chase poultry, eggs, and other produce, and are a link with the outside world for hundreds of lonely settlers. The business of the dealers was wiped out by the regulation preventing them from buying wool and skins. We are told now t h a t ' tlie small grower can send in his few bales of, wool for appraisement. The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) assured me that every facility AlthoughI have atwould be afforded to the small man to obtain an advance on his wool. He gets his advances through the large brokers, who charge 6 per cent, or 7 per cent.

We all know that the wool has to go to the appraisement centres, and that whether it is sent to Smith, Brown, Jones, or Robinson, it will bring the same price. It would have been simple to arrange that whatever trade a company was doing at the time the scheme was put into operation should continue to be the volume of its business. Tbe same rates of commission are being charged, and greater profits are being made than before the war. But whereas in 1913 a bale of wool was worth £ 1 2 10s., it is now worth over £ 2 2 .

The wool sent is to get half the profit, how are those profits to be distributed if indiscriminate buying in the country is allowed ? I respect the chairman of the Committee, and his argument must be answered. We are not urging indiscriminate buying in the country. We are not proposing to allow speculators to deluge tlie country with lies about the Wool Pool, and catch the unwary farmer who has a few bales of wool to sell. All we ask is that the men who had legitimate businesses established before the war should be still allowed to buv up to the volume of their pre-war business. If any profits over and above the 15£d. are made, it would be easy to make them send in lists of the people from whom they purchased wool, and thus the interests of the small growers oould be protected. If necessary, it could be arranged that any additional profits accruing from the British Government's private business transactions above the 15$d. should go into the Repatriation or some other f u n d , thus doing away with the necessity for a huge system of bookkeeping. Since we have answered every objection, we consider that our just demand ought to be acceded to. The only objection that we cannot meet-becaus e it is mythicalGovernment has is the idea which seems to be prevalent among a lot of neople that Yes ; yet we still have a tilted cart or van in the country must be an object of suspicion, and an evidence that somebody is purloining sheep cr wool, and that if all such vehicles were swept off the face of the earth it would be a great benefit to the community.

405,Mr Lynch,"The commission goes to the war has cast upon us. Having gone carefully into the question, I see not the slightest reason why country members should not insist on a greater measure of justice being given i u the administration of the Central Wool Committee to country wool-buying firms. son why th© small growers of wool should not be allowed to please themselves if they desire to sell to the man who will hand them over the money at once. We make that claim, and we have a right to make it , in spite of the fact that a number of men profess to talk in the name of the farmers, although, as a matter of fact, they represent very little more than commission-mongers. That class of customer does not represent the genuine farmer, because the genuine farmer asks that the country storekeeper or wool merchant, who has been his friend through generations, shall be given a fair go.' If not, it should be clearly proved that their business is absolutely principle on which this scheme is based. When the first restrictive regulations were issued a Chinese, who usually bought large quantities of wool, drove a coach and four through them. it by buying the "" cocky's "" sheep in the wool, and then selling them back to him shorn.

That is not a good thing. emphatic protest against the destruction of these industries in the country centres, and hope that every, country member from one end of Australia to the other will endorse that protest. wish to place on record the. serious position that is imminent in regard to the copper producing industry, one of the primary industries of Australia. quite a while the whole of the copper has been purchased by the British Government. Quite recently the contracts expired. On urgent representations being made to the Government, and cables being sent to the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) in London, an extension of three months, and a contract expiring on 31st December, were arranged. But the position is that, unless within the next couple of weeks the copper producing companies in Australia are assured that there w ill be a further contract, the mines must close down. It is quite possible that peace w ill be declared this year. If it is, there w ill be no more copper contracts, and the refusal of the Government to allow the companies There is no reato make their own arrangements will practically mean shutting down the whole of the copper mines of the Commonwealth. In America copper is worth £140 per ton; here, where the conditions are different, the price, is from £106 to £110. A couple of million pounds worth of copper is lying at grass in different parts of Australia, and all of it will be urgently needed on the declaration of. peace, whenever shipping facilities, are available to take it to other countries. It w ill be urgently required in the replacing of our ships, and in the manufacture of electrical instruments and industrial machinery generally. Australia should be in such a position that not £1 of reopposed to the whole venue need be lost when the opportunity occurs, and it would be calamitous if bur copper mines Were compelled to close down through neglect to provide for contracts.

They desire to be free to arrange contracts with our Allies, and have no desire to go outside them. All they want the Government to say is : "" Yes, we can I arrange fresh contracts,"" or "" We w ill allow you to make contracts for yourselves."" Eor ject to that? The copper produced in October w ill ibe' completely treated in December, and as the existing contracts expire on the 31st December, the result w i ll be that some time this month the mines must close down, unless the Prime Minister succeeds in arranging for a fresh term.

I appeal to the Government to make urgent representations to the Prime Minister immediately. If it is impossible for him to arrange for further copper contracts, the Government should at once allow those whose interests are jeopardized to make their own arrangements. should not have spoken but for the remarks of the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lynch), who, I regret, has not remained to hear my reply. I also regret the absence of one or two other honourable members who take a deep interest in the question, and have spent considerable time in attacking the Central Wool Committee. In the first place, I wish to entirely disassociate myself from any reflections or. aspersions that have been cast on my friend, Mr F. W. Hughes, and on Mr J. C. Watson, whose names have been frequently before us in this connection. I have the greatest sympathy with the top-making industry, and would be the last man in Australia to do anything to hamper it in any way. The honourable member for South Sydney( Mr ment should own the wool before the comRiley) and the honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Lamond) are under, a -total misapprehension regarding the fell* mongering in connection with Mr P. W. Hughes' business. They have stated, and no doubt' believe, that that Committee has in some way or other interfered with that business; b u t . I am in a position to say that they are under a misapprehension.' There is no interference whatever by the Central Wool Committee with the fellmongering branch of Mr Hughes' industry, which he ""is able to carry on exactly as before. wool from the Committee. business as before, except that his wool must first be appraised, like the wool of every other fellmonger. It has been an exceedingly delicate matter to carry on and complete these negotiations. The whole question is surrounded with great difficern to the members of the Central Wool Committee for a long time. The ComI n the same mittee, however, has honestly tried to give a fair deal to all concerned, and, in my opinion, has succeeded. The agreement come to, which apparently will be acceptable to the Combing Company, is that they should work on commission at so much per l b . ; in other words, that they should act as the agent of the Government in combing these tops. Before they can act as such agents, it is necessary that the Wool they comb should be the property of the Government for whom they act. The company had other offers, which they rejected, hut finally they agreed to the latest offer as the best way out of the difficulty. tions, some one has to give way to a certain extent. I feel sure that not one of us has ever been able to get his own way all his life, especially if a married man. I take it that this is one of those purely domestic affairs, in which all concerned have given way and arrived at an agreement. Whether or not the best method has been adopted, I am not prepared to say; but under the agreement it is absolutely essential that the Governpany commences to qomb it. It is therefore obviously impossible that the wool should automatically go from Mr P. W. Hughes' fellmongery into the Combing Company's works. done before. Government did not own the tops and the wool. the works. this agreement the Government must own the wool before it is combed, and, if the wool is the product of Mr Hughes' fellmongery, it must be purchased by the Government from Mr Hughes.

I am satisfied that nothing can tend to discourage recruiting in this country more than a practice of this kind. It is of no use for people to go upon public platforms appealing for men to go upon active service if the Government tolerate practices of this kind by the landlords of Melbourne, or of any other city in Australia.

471,Mr Gboom,"The Government haveThe circumstances under which soldiers have been marked "" A . W . L . "" are not fully known; and I venture to say that when the f u l l history of thesematters is known, it will be found that in the case of a very great many of them the soldiers have not been greatly to blame. Those of us who have been in France and in England know how easy it is for a soldier to be branded "" A . W . L . "" ; and when the news is cabled out here, his dependants are deprived of their allotment money, though in many cases it is subsequently discovered that the soldier was wrongfully branded as "" A . W . L . "" referring to cases of short absence without leave, or to cases of absence without ""leave for months? MrM c GRATH under the military law, where a man is given fourteen days' leave, he is not considered to be absent without leave until twenty-one days from the beginning of his leave. But in many cases men go to the islands around Great Britain, or they go up north to Scotland, and while they are away become ill , and are unable to get back to their units within the term of their leave. The last thing some of these men will think of is to write to tbeir Commanding Officer, though I admit that if they did write they would very often -not be charged with desertion or branded as absent without leave. They do not write, and stay away for a month or six weeks, and the Commanding Officer is then, of course, notified that they are deserters. An inquiry is then held, and it is cabled out here that they are absent without leave, and the payments to their wives' and children are suspended, although within a month the soldier branded as absent without leave may have returned to his' unit. I could quote the case of a soldier, who was killed on the battlefield, and Whose dependants here had to suffer the disgrace of having his name branded as that of a deserter. of a soldier whose pay was reduced by £37"" 10s. because her husband was charged with being absent without leave. member mean by saying that the pay was reduced ?. the woman was reduced by that amount. MrM c GRATH 1 appeal to the Acting' Prime Minister( Mr Watt) to remember that the cases of actual desertion are not very numerous. I do not wish to h u r t the feelings of any one present who may have come from the Old Country, but when I was at head-quarters in Londonf u l l inquiries were made, which substantiated the statement. I make that 70 per cent, of all the crimes committed by those wearing the Australian uniform were committed I s the honourable member by men who were not born in Australia. In some cases the men were not even members of the Australian Imperial Force, but men who by some means secured an Australian uniform and masqueraded as I understand that members of the Australian Imperial Force. In a very great pencentage of the cases of crime it can be shown that the crimes were committed by men who had not been five years in Australia. The great percentage of deserters and men branded as absent without leave are men who were not born in Australia. The real Australian-born soldiers show a very low percentage of desertions indeed. I should like that in this matter special consideration should be given to men who l e f t Australia in' 1914, and in the early days of 1915. The men who went through the landing at Gallipoli returned to Egypt, and went from there to France, and were in every stunt since then, deserve some special consideration. When they get over to England they may overstay their leave I have explained to honourable members how difficult it is for men to secure leave, and married men hesitate to cable to their wives for money to enable them to do so. I have known cases in which men have been on active service for two years before they could get any 1 leave to England. When these men overstay their leave they are classed asabsent without leave, and their depend ants in Australia are forced to be the recipients of the charity of benevolent in I know the case of a wife stitutions. I maintain that the families ofmen who have given three years' servicein the war should not be the recipients of the charity of any one. An y man who W h a t does the honourable has put in three years' service with the Australian Imperial Force has done his bit for the country.",78,Pboducing Inby Which F W Hughes And Company Contbact With British And Whiddon Brothers Were To Get Their

I have no wish to make an u n f a i r comparison. I am simply pointing out that in our enthusiasm at the beginning of the war we tried to do just a little too much. We have no reason to be despondent because of the number of our enlistments. The way in which we are keeping up the supply of men is really remarkable. If , because of the heavy casualties, the reinforcements are not quite sufficient to main; tain our divisions at their f u l l strength, that is no reason why those who have been three and four years on active service should be kept at the Front. I urge the Government not to ask those who have been so fortunate as to come unscathed through three and four years of service to give the last ounce of their energy to the cause, but rather to give them an opportunity to come back to their loved ones in Australia. No one on the other side of the world w ill think ill of Australia if something to spend, without depriving her Forces be depleted by one division as the result of her desire to give a holiday to those of our lads who left this country in 1914 and 1915. I have only to say, in conclusion, that I hope the Acting Prime Minister w ill deal with the landlords who are raising rents upon the dependants of soldiers in Melbourne.

The honorbrought home to every honourable member of the House the fact that the majority of these men who are coming back on a f a i r l y long holiday will have only the bare pay of a private with which to finance their households and enjoy their holiday. It seems to me, therefore, that some effort should be made, and that, if the Government cannot undertake to provide for this special expenditure, we should, organize some fund, and make it possible to furnish these men with sufficient money, in order that they may have their families of the means of subsistence. should like to have a statement from the Assistant Ministerf o r Defence( Mr. Wise) on this subject. . 1 understand that something was done when thg other men arrived in Australia on furlough, and I certainly think that action of a similar nature should be taken in connection with those who are now returning.
