I have made this statement in. deliberate terms because T. do not want, it to be misunderstood or misinterpreted by any one. addressed to the Acting Prime Minister. 1' point out, by way of explanation, that the Minister for External Affairs has made a definite charge in this House that the Communist newspaper, Tribune, has published a signed article which contained extracts from a confidential document belonging to tbe Australian Government. In view of the fact that the publiment or the State Government? If it is cation of confidential documents is a serious offence under the Crimes Act, will the right honourable gentleman inform me whether the Government has consulted any of its legal advisors on the matter of taking proceedings against the Communist newspaper concerned, and the admitted writer of the article?Isi t n fact that the article was published nearly six months ago, and that no-action whatever has been taken by the Governinent, despite such a long lapse of time? Does the Governinent propose to leave the Communist newspaper and its contributor free from prosecution? have the matters raised by the honourable member investigated. G 0 VERNOR-GEN ERAL. Prime Minister inform the House whether the Governor General's future engagements include the opening of a world congress of junior chambers of commerce which has been arranged for Melbourne on the Gth September next? If this is a fact, does if mean that the Governor General's term of office has been extended at least until after the Gth September next? General has already held office for more than the usual term of five years, will his endeavour to get information on the term of office finally expire this year? If not, when will it expire? know what the settled engagements of the Governor General happen to be, and I have no intention of hazarding a guess on what his future might be. the Minister for Labour and National Service been drawn to a report from Queensland that 2,000 tannery employees in that State have been dismissed because of the shortage of hides or the withholding of hides by the merchants responsible in the hope that they will get an increase iri price? Can the Minister inform the House whether this is a responsibility of the Australian Governa responsibility of the Australian Government, will he take action to have the position rectified as soon as possible? If it is a. State responsibility, will he contact the Queensland Government to ascertain whether anything can be done to get the unfortunate people concerned back to work in this important industry? of this matter, I had inquiries made through the Department of Labour and National Service. These indicated that ten manufacturers of boots and shoes in Brisbane have given a week's notice to 1,072 employees, and that possibly 60 more may be given notice by another manufacturer. I am informed that the reason is the lack of deliveries of leather from the leather suppliers to the manufacturers. I am given to understand, also, that deliveries are being delayed because of a question of cost, which is to bc the subject of a conference with tlie StateMinister to-day. The honourable, member has asked me wliether the Australian Government has a responsibility in relation to price.

Is it a fact that the university council also expressed concern at the delay in the establishment of the school and commented that the nation will not only be poorer for the lack of those facilities, but statement, has had an opportunity to that the National University would be set back in the advancement of learning in Australia for another 25 years? Ha? the Government any real intention of going ahead with this very important project? If so, will the Minister make an early statement to the House? the statement and cannot vouch for its accuracy in relation to the development of the university, but if the honourable member will take the trouble to study the Estiin order for a Minister to reply to a mates and budget papers be will see that much more is being spent each year by this Government, on the university than was spent on it by the Labour' Government.

I gather from what I have been told and read that the Minister, in speaking in this House last week, made an unqualified statement .that taxation would be higb for the rest of our lives.

MrM o EWEN used wereIn these days of high taxation we all comments w ill receive serious consideration. plain, but the cold truth of the matter is that world circumstances and Australian public opinion combine to require policies to bc followed by this or any other Australian Government,which involve the expenditure of prodigious sums of money. Acting Prime Minister a question that It is anticipated that £1,000,000,000 will relates to the fact that Preston City be spent this year. If our policy demands the expenditure of £1,000,000,000, that sum Councili n Victoria accepted tenders for will have to be raised, and taxation will be two 500-K.V.A. transformers from the high. A combination of circumstances make it and for four 200-K.V.A. transformers inevitable that whatever government is in oflice and whatever relief can be given from from Industrial Engineering Export taxation, the level of taxation will, on all Proprietary previous standards, remain high for the rest the 24th March, 1952, because no of our lives.

There are some small qualifying factors but, broadly, the policy is not to differenhalf of the Commonwealth, to proceed tiate between aboriginal and white people. Payments are made to aborigines by cheque or through a book, as it done in the case of child endowment, for example. It is not correct to say that maternity allowances are not paid to aborigines in Queensland. They are paid, but people in the islands of Torres Strait, which is a remote area, are paid maternity allowances through the Queensland Department pf Native Affairs. Speaking from memory, I should say that we pay 2,000 maternity allowances through that department and 1,000 direct to the mothers concerned. OOAL. Labour and National Service a question that relates to the facts that the legislation under which the Joint Coal Board and the Coal Industry Tribunal were established, was complementary legislation that was passed by the parliaments of both the Commonwealth and New South Wales, and that the Minister has indicated to the House that the Prime Minister has written to the Premier of New South Wales asking whether the New South Wales Government would consent to an amendment of the legislation. Has a reply to that letter yet been received from thc Premier? If so, does it signify the concurrence of New South Wales in the proposed amendments that have been outlined by this Government? cussion with the Premier of New South Wales yesterday on the course which the Commonwealth proposed to take in legislation affecting the coal industry during the present sessional period. It appeared quite impracticable, within thc time available to us, for the New South Wales Government to consider the amendment to provide for the right of appeal to the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration against a decision of the Coal Industry Tribunal. However, there is some urgency to assure the position of the Coal Industry Tribunal, which has been revealed in litigation now before the' courts. I explained to the Premier of New South Wales that I was quite prepared, on bewith the amending legislation which would make it clear that the Coal Industry Tribunal had power to deal with certain matters that were coming before it, and to defer the introduction of the legislation which related to appeals until the State Government had had ample time to consider the matter. We now propose to proceed with the legislation that is to assure the position of the Coal Industry Tribunal, and 1 have already given notice of my intention to introduce the necessary amending bill. I hope that the honourable member for Hunter will advise those foolish persons who have already taken direct action that they are fighting shadows at the moment. They are taking direct action against something that does not exist. Legislation will not be placed before the Parliament during the current sessional period to make provision for the right of appeal to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court against a decision of the Coal Industry Tribunal. Those persons who deprive themselves of a day's pay in order to protest against such legislation are simply beating the air. wish to ask the Minister for Labour and National Service concern the dismissal of 70 employees of the Coalcliff Colliery, on the soutb coast of New South Wales, at a time when miners are supposed to be in great demand. Is it a fact that Coalcliff is the mine that the Australian Government, through the Joint Coal Board, modernized at a cost of thousands of pounds, because of the neglect of tbe company that owns it? Will the Minister have inquiries made with a view to ascertaining whether the action of the company is dismissing the men was justified, and, if it was not justified, will he have them reinstated? 1",13,Social Seevices

Is it a fact that, in large immigrant camps or hostels, such as that at Bonegilla, it is the practice to draft, say, 100 men for railway work, or 50 men for fruit picking or some other kind of work, regardless of their suitability for such employment or of any special qualifications that they may possess? If such is the case, will the Minister institute investigations with a view to allocating immigrants to work which they are best qualified to do, and in the performance of which they will be most emcient and happy? In any event, will the honourable gentleman lay on the table, for the information of the House, a return showing the allocation of immigrants to various industries during the last two years, and their full qualifications? honourable member for Bass are certainly not in accordance with my own knowledge of the position. As far as I am aware, this is the first occasion on which he has brought to my notice any dissatisfaction about the placement of immigrants, or any charge that they have not been selected on the basis of their suitability to perform certain jobs. The officers of the Commonwealtb Employment Service do their utmost to ensure that immigrants are placed in the positions for which their qualifications are best suited, having regard to the number of jobs offering, and the persons available to us. I have not had any complaints from employer organizations or trade unions about the matter which the honourable gentleman has raised. I have repeatedly told the House that all arrangements which affect immigrants in Australia come under the scrutiny periodically of two important advisory bodies, on which employer organizations and trade unions are adequately represented. 1 have not received any complaints about tbe matter [44] to wbich the honourable gentleman has referred, but any specific instances that he brings to my notice will be examined. the new telephone exchange being built at St. Leonards, near Sydney. Will the Postmaster-General inform me wben the building itself will be completed, what number of telephone lines will be made available and when the installation of equipment will be completed? building will be situated at St. Leonards in the honourable member's electorate of North Sydney, and it is expected that it will be completed about the end of this year. It will eventually have a capacity of about 10,000 telephone lines, but within a measurable time it is expected that about 4,000 lines will be made available. There will be a cut-over from otber exchanges such as Chatswood and adjoining exchanges, but considerable relief will be provided for all applicants for telephones on the North Sydney side who have been waiting for some time T he remarks of the for this service. to my notice that the Prime Minister is endeavouring to purchase tanks for the Australian Army in the Tjnited Kingdom. Is the Minister for Defence aware that in Western Australia Chamberlain Industries Limited has dismissed a large number of men from its tractor factory because of its inability to obtain orders for tractors? Has any inquiry been made into the possibility of such an enterprise manufacturing tanks for the Australian Army? Why does the Government wish to reduce the number of tanks available to the United Kingdom in view of the fact that the United Kingdom has obligations to the European Army and we have not? are obtaining a certain number of tanks from the United Kingdom, which it has agreed to supply us.

Have the prisoners who wish to be evacuated to North Korea or China been segregated from those who refuse to be returned, and, if so, is the rioting general to both groups or is it restricted to those wbo hope to go back behind tbe Communist lines? What proportion do the latter group bear to the whole? Is the Minister confident that a correct understanding of the incidents at Koje has been conveyed to the Australian people by press despatches from Korea, and, if not, could the services of the Australian representative in Korea be usefully employed to have the matter put into its proper perspective? 20 miles south-west of Pusan, the temporary capital of South Korea, and is occupied by a relatively' large number of prisoners of war. A few months ago about 130,000 prisoners of war and about 30,000 civilian prisoners were on the island. Koje Island, contrary to popular understanding, is divided into about 30 compounds. Fanatical Communists are kept in certain compounds, less fanatical Communists in others, and more or less normal people in a third group of compounds. The recent disorders that have caused the military command in charge of the island so much trouble have occurred only in some of the compounds, which are occupied by fanatical Communists. I believe that the honourable gentleman has correctly drawn the inference that the Australian puhlic is not in full possession of the facts and is not aware that the disturbances have been confined to only a few of the 30 compounds. I undertake to arrange for Australia's representative on the Tjnited Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea to take a hand in the dissemination of the facts of the situation. Most of the prisoners of war held by the United Nations are on Koje Island, although some were transferred recently to other camps on tbe mainland. Health whether, under the Government's health scheme for age pensioners, any limits or restrictions have been placed by the Department of Health on the number of daily or weekly visits by doctors to age pensioners who are seriously ill. has been placed upon visits to sick pensioners, but a committee of tbe doctors concerned is investigating the matter in order to determine whether visits are being made unnecessarily, thus causing increased expense.

As the service is just as vital to the health of the nation as are the life-saving drugs and other drugs made available under the Government's health scheme, will the Minister consider whether a grant can be made by the Commonwealth to the society to ensure that this worthy service shall be kept in operation ? months ago, assistance was given by the Commonwealth to the Red Cross Society to enable fractionation of blood to be undertaken and blood banks to be established throughout Australia. The fractionation of blood bas been done by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, without charge, and substantial sums have been expended upon the purchase of equipment and buildings for the organization to handle.

BUSH FIRES. directed to the Minister in charge of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial by the Postmaster-General's Research Organization. In view of the fact that bush fires are the greatest menace that this country has to face, has the Minister directed the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization to undertake considerable research into the manner in which fires start and the means by which they can be extinguished? Have experiments been carried out by bombing the scene of a fire, as has been done in the United States of America? Has the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization issued pamphlets upon how to make country homes as fire-resistant as possible? Is it making a concerted attack upon this menace ? task of fire-fighting in Australia falls, I think quite naturally, upon instrumentalities of the State governments, but certain fundamental aspects of research into bush fires and grass fires in Australia may be said to be the function of the Commonwealth, through its instrumentality, the Oommonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. During the last twelve months, I have had many discussions with senior officers of the organization upon this subject. I have directed their attention to certain fields of research, wbich, broadly speaking, include those that the honourable gentleman has mentioned. Incipient fires in the pin-point stage, especially in hilly or inaccessible country, can be dealt with only from the air. As the honourable gentleman has said, to bomb, if one may use tliat word, the seat of a fire from the air, with some form of fire-deterrent liquid in containers that burst upon impact, is an obvious metbod of combating a fire.

Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer) I desire to inform the House that His Excellency the Governor-Generali n Council this morning approved of the Government's recommendation for the establishment of the Department of Works, in lieu of the Department of Works .and Housing. The Governor General subsequently accepted the resignation of the Honourable W. S. Kent Hughes, M.V.O., OBE., M.C, E.D., M.P., as Minister of State for Works and Housing and appointed him to be Minister of State for Works. Apart from the transfer to other departments of certain administrative functions relating to .aspects of housing which had taken place since the department was created in July, 1945, it had been found that the words "" Works and Housing"" were confusing to the public generally, and created an impression .that the Commonwealth is directly responsible for all housing activities, including those controlled by tbe housing authorities .administered by State governments. In addition, the Minister and the Department of Works and Housing were receiving many inquiries daily regarding housing matters generally, including those which concern the Department of Social Services or the Department of National Development. There is no. altera tion of the existing functions of the Department, and the change will in .no way affect the responsibility of the department to carry out housing projects for all Commonwealth departments as this class of activity will be adequately covered by the general definition of "" Works"". External Affairs) -by leave-It is about three months since I last reported to the House on the international situation. I propose to-day to confine myself to certain recent events that affect Australian interests and Australian policy. Although one of the most significant happenings of recent times has been the coming into force of the Japanese Peace Treaty, I believe that any general comment on our future relations with Japan might well be left until the mood and the pattern of behaviour of present-day Japan begins to show more clearly. I speak first, therefore, of Korea .where our men are still fighting. In the protracted negotiations for a ceasefire, the United Nations representatives continue to be subjected to interminable time wasting, frustrations, slander, misrepresentation and blatant propaganda. Lot me remind honourable members shortly of the history of the United Nations intervention in Korea. It may be remembered that in 1950, by the overwhelming majority of 51 out of 59 nations, the United Nations decided to take action to repel armed aggression by the North Korean forces against the Republic of Korea, which we know as South Korea. Aggression was in fact repelled. This",18,Questions

62,Mr Casey (La Trobe,"Minister forhas quite certainly acted as a deterrent to aggression in other areas-for example in South-East Asia. I believe that, if the North Korean forces had been able to over-run South Korea without determined opposition from the international community, the experiment there would have been tried again elsewhere with probably more serious and more widespread results. I believe that the Tjnited Nations have been successful in Korea and that the action taken bas been well justified. Moreover Communist aggression in Korea has demonstrated to the free world what we are up against, and has stimulated the rebuilding of the physical strength of the democracies, which in the few years of optimism immediately following the end of the last war, we had allowed very largely to disintegrate. I believe that the democracies are now stronger relatively to a potential aggressor than at any time since the end of the war. The purpose of this rebuilding of strength, it need hardly be said, is not to prepare for war, but to deter any one with aggressive inclinations from making war, and I believe that we have gone a long way towards achieving this end. It is still just possible that we will get somewhere with international although the evidence to support sucb optimism over recent years is not.impressive, either in respect of Europe or the East. Tbe Communists appear to be impressed with strength and with nothing else. Hence the efforts of all the democracies to strengthen themselves as rapidly as possible, although with some regard to the economic effects of overstraining their economies in the process. A weapon of war that international communism has evolved and exploited in recent years is the so-called "" peace campaign "". The latest example of this is the current so-called "" Peace Conference of the Asian and Pacific Regions"" in Peking. In recent years, Peking has become a centre for Communist activity in East and South-east Asia. tralasian Trade Union Conference "" held there in November, 1949, the Communistdominated World Federation of Trade Unions established in Peking an ""AsianMr Casey. Australasian Bureau"". The members of this bureau, the purpose of which is to maintain contact with the trade unions of Asia, echo all the catch-cries of the international Communist propaganda machine. They accuse the United States of conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea; they fulminate against "" foreign imperialists, feudal landlords and comprador capital""; they call for "" liberation of colonial and semi-colonial countries from oppression and exploitation of the foreign imperialists and their lackeys"". Recently, as honourable members know, eleven leaders in Communist China issued invitations to "" peace partisans "" in a number of countries, including Australia, to attend a conference in Peking on the 28th May to prepare for a ""peace conference of the Asian and Pacific regions"". It is clear from the terms of the invitation that this was yet another of the series of so-called peace conferences which have been held under Communist auspices and direction, in a number of European capitals during the last three years. I have since made some inquiries into the records of the persons in whose names the invitation was issued, and I am satisfied that this latest conference follows the pattern of similar communism by negotiation, conferences at Stockholm, Prague, Paris, Warsaw and elsewhere during the last two or three years. The principal Chinese sponsor, Kuo Mo-Jo, is a familiar figure at these Communistorganized gatherings. In April, 1949, he headed the Chinese delegation to the ""World Peace Congress"" at Prague and Paris, where he condemned what he called the "" criminal war-mongers headed by the American imperialists plotting for a new war"". He again headed the Chinese delegation to the second session of the ""World Peace Congress"" in Warsaw, where he attacked what he described as "" the aggressive war of the American imperialists in Korea"", the "" seizure "" of Formosa, and the "" Wanton strafing and bombing of Chinese territory"". He concluded with the exhortation, ""Down with the instigators of Following the "" Asian-Ausanother war and the imperialist aggressors "". He was elected vice-chairman of the executive bureau of the World Peace Council. Last year he attended the meeting of the permanent committee of the World Peace Congress in Yienna and returned home with the Stalin Prize for Peace. That 13 the gentleman whose sinister embrace Dr. Burton has so lately and so willingly yielded to. The true nature of the conference at Peking is clear beyond doubt. It is a weapon of war; and I hope that this is well understood by the people of Australia. I shall not add to what I have already said about the folly of the half-dozen Australians who have allowed themselves to be duped into accepting the Communist invitation to go to Peking. Reverting to Korea, on the military side in recent months there has been progressive strengthening of Communist forces facing the United Nations. At the conference table the Communists have rejected all the proposals made by the unified command in an effort to break the deadlock. The Leader of the Opposition asked me lately whether I could elaborate my recent statement on the subject of prisoners of war in United Nations hands in relation to the Korean armistice negotiations. He asked whether that was the only matter outstanding in the cease-fire negotiations. It is substantially true to say that the prisoners of war issue is the only outstanding matter of difference between the Communists and the United Nations negotiators. I think that it can be said that the other outstanding issues, the rehabilitation of airfields and the membership of the commission to supervise the armistice, would be rapidly resolved if agreement on prisoners of war could be reached. This prisoner of war problem is most difficult, since we must, at all times, have in mind the safety and welfare of our own troops who are prisoners of war in Communist hands. I stated on the Sth May that the unified deadlock. command had found 62,000 prisoners of war in United Nations hands to be so fearful of the consequences of a return to asked whether the channel of communicaNorth Korea, or to China, that they tions on those matters was the United would forcibly resist repatriation. It Nations or the American Government. should be clearly understood that the United Nations military operations in prisoners of war in question had not Korea and the present negotiations for a merely expressed a preference for remaincease-fire are being conducted in accoring in South Korea; it had also been dance with the resolution adopted by the established, after careful screening, that these prisoners were likely to resist repatriation by force. Written notices had been posted in the prisoner of war camps, and announcements were made over the public address system tbere, to the effect that all prisoners were to be interrogated by United Nations command personnel to discover which of them would want to be repatriated and which of them had compelling reasons for refusing repatriation. The great importance of the decision and the possibility of retaliation by the Communists against the families of those who did not want to be repatriated was emphasized. Pull stress was given to an official statement issued by the Communist authorities offering an amnesty to all returned prisoners of war, whatever their conduct had been in camp. Prisoners were then interrogated individually and privately by interrogators carefully selected by the United Nations command, and only tliose who' expressed their determination forcibly to resist repatriation were excluded from tbe list of prisoners which the United Nations was prepared to exchange. The nature of the screening processes had been explained to the Communist negotiators and, in addition, the United Nations command had offered, following an armistice, to retain prisoners of war in custody and to permit the International Red Cross, or Joint Red Cross teams from North Korea and the United Nations, together with observers from both sides, to interview the prisoners who had said they would physically resist repatriation. An assurance was given that, if any additional prisoners were found who would not resist repatriation, tbey would be promptly returned to the Communists. That is how the matter stands. We are keeping it under close watch and will continue to look for possible ways of breaking the present The Leader of the Opposition also -Security Council, of the United Nations on the 7th July, 1950. In that resolution the Security Council recommended that all members providing military forces make them available to a unified command under the United States of America, and requested the United States of America to appoint the commander of such forces. The resolution further requested the United States of America to provide the Security Council with periodical reports on the course of action taken under the unified command. The position is therefore that the unified command is the agency of the United Nations designated to conduct, the Korean operation, and it reports regularly through the United States Government to the Security Council. In addition, as I have informed the House, information on the action taken under the unified command is provided daily to the representatives in. Washington of members of the United Nations with forces in Korea. The actual conduct of negotiations for a cease-fir© are essentially between commanders in the field and deal with purely military They are conducted by the unified command. countries with forces in Korea are kept continuously informed and are consulted on all important issues. The Australian Government has, for example, been in continuous consultation with the United States Government on the outstanding issues in the armistice negotiations. We have availed ourselves freely of the opportunities to make proposals on the conduct of the negotiations. made our latest proposal only this morning. If and when an armistice is concluded, the unified command will so report to the Security Council. Discussion of further steps towards a political settlement of the Korean question will then take place in the General Assembly. In order that the situation in Korea may bo reviewed promptly by the General Assembly, if circumstances require, tbe last session of the General Assembly authorized the Secretary-General to convene a special session when an armistice is notified. If there is an armistice, one of the clauses of the agreement wbich the General Assembly will consider is a recommendation that a political conMr Casey. ference of both, sides be called, to consider a political settlement. I turn for a moment from the truce negotiations to the political situation in South Korea itself, where, as honourable members will have seen from the press, events have recently taken a rather serious turn. I remind the House that the fundamental purpose of the United Nations in Korea, apart from resistance to Communist aggression, has been to bring into existence a state founded on genuine democracy. The aim of a United Korea has. not been achieved; but there bas at least been the promise that South Korea-or , as we know it, the Republic of Korea-was firmly set on the democratic path. It had a constitution which provided for parliamentary government ; and it had held elections which the United Nations Commission had observed and pronounced free and democratic. Within the next few weeks, in accordance with the constitution, the Parliament, was due to elect a new president of the negotiations Republic of Korea. About two weeks ago there began in Pusan, the temporary questions. capital of the Republic of Korea, against members of the Korean National However, the governments of Assembly, culminating on the 24th May in the proclamation of martial law, the arrest of a number of members on the orders of the President, Syngman Rhee, and. the resignation of the Prime Minister. The circumstancesi n which the campaign began, and the nature of the charges made against the arrested members, suggest that Syngman Rhee is seeking to ensure his re-election as president. We These developments have caused a good deal of concern to us and to tbe United States of America and other members of the United Nations. The United Nations Commission, of which Australia is a member, has communicated this concern to President Rhee, and has requested him to release the arrested members of Parliament and to rescind, martial law. Similar requests have since been made by General Van Fleet, United Nations field commander in Korea, without result, and efforts are still being made to persuade President Rhee to act in accordance with the constitution. Meanwhile, if the conduct of military operations against the Communists should, be hampered by internal disturbances arising out of the present state of tension, consideration will have to be given to measures that might be taken to safeguard the position of the United Nations -the 'same time, the Australian GovernI have sent a personal message on bebalf of the Government to His Excellency Ma. 1 Syngman Rhee whom I 'had the opportunity of meeting when I was in Pusan -agreed to by the.signatories of its Charter,, expressing the grave concern of the Australian Government at recent political events in South Korea and the hope that democratic processes will shortly be resumed. I propose to table, for tbe information of honourable members, a report on the last .session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. This will describe, among otlier things, the attitude that the Government has taken towards a number of questions of world importance. By way of general comment, I may say that the Government bas demonstrated its 'full support for tbe principles of the United Nations organization. Australia's active participation in the Korean war is sufficient evidence of that. Moreover, w.e have been consistent and generous supporters of the international work of relief and assistance that is conducted by and through the United Nations. The United Nations organization has acquitted itself well in many fields. At the same time, it would be foolish not to recognize and discuss its deficiencies. One aspect in particular of the work of the United Nations causes misgivings to this Government, and to some other Co-.nitnonwealth and Western European members. I refer to the tendency on the part of a large Hoc of countries, more particularly the countries of Latin America, Asia and the Middle East, which constitute the great majority of the United Nations membership, to attempt to use the United Nations organization as a means of bringing collective pressure on other nations in respect of matters that are, in fact, of domestic concern and outside the scope of the United Nations Charter. More particularly this pressure is exerted upon those countries, such as Australia, that have responsibilities for dependent peoples ancl territories. The Governinent is careful to recognize and implement its international responsibilities as expressed in binding instruments .such as the Charter and the Trusteeship Agreement, which governs the administration of New Guinea. At ment will continue to oppose the use of the United Nations when its members seek to extend its functions beyond those -by the invasion of the field of OUT own domestic responsibilities. The Government recognizes that the aim of self-government among dependent peoples arises from sincere and widespread conviction in many countries. The sympathies of the Australian people are in ""line with this aspiration. The Australian Government will, nevertheless, continue to maintain that the authority of the United Nations will be undermined if its members trespass beyond the limits of the collective authority entrusted -to it . This is not necessarily n popular view within the United Nations, but it is one which Australia will continue to hold. While I am dealing with the United Nations, I might say a few words on the Government's position regarding membership of the various United 'Nations commissions and committees. The Government has approached this matter with a full realization of the desirability of supporting the activities of United Nations bodies, and with recognition of the important contribution that Australia can make in relation to many political, economic and social .subjects. We have membership in a substantial number of international bodies. The Government does not consider it desirable to seek representation on them all. Indeed, I am convinced that there are many good reasons for being selective and not too ambitious. In addition, there is much to be said for rotation of membership among some, or all, of the 60 members of the United. Nations. Certainly, the keen competition for election to many international bodies often causes resentment against a government whose candidacy and ambitions are pressed too frequently and too hard, particularly where other Governments have equal, or even better, claims for consideration. At the present time Australia is an elected member of fourteen commissions and executive committees established by the United Nations or its specialized agencies. In addition, Indeed, there is an obligation on us to do of course, it is a permanent member of other organs, sucb as the General Assembly and the Trusteeship Council. In other words, we are playing a full and with which the governments of Asia, are active part in the work of the United Nations organization, bearing in mind the limited number of qualified omcers of the Department of External Affairs here and overseas wbo can represent Australia. We have also to consider the staffing of our normal diplomatic posts abroad, which is sometimes prejudiced by the necessity to attend an almost continuous series of international conferences. I turn now to another matter. I am glad to be able to tell the House that we have now completed a most important phase in the development of our diplomatic representation overseas. I refer to the establishment of Australian diplomatic missions at Saigon and Rangoon, and the raising of the status of our post at Bangkok from a consulategeneral to a legation, which completes the Colombo plan area, in the form of outchain of Australian diplomatic posts in all the countries of South and South-East Asia, an area in which we have a fundamental interest and, owing to post-war developments and circumstances, a new and special responsibility. The facts of geography link the fortunes of Australia with those of the countries of .South and South-East Asia. We may have been slow to realize that fact, hut we have realized it now. The difference between our present knowledge and appreciation of the countries to our north, and that of for use in all regions totalled the equivaonly a very few years ago, is very great indeed. The problems of the countries of South and South-East Asia area are twofoldtheir domestic economic problems and the problem of their military security. The standard of living of the 600,000,000 human beings who live between Pakistan and the Philippines is very low. In addition, the whole area is flanked on the north by Communist imperialism. I do not wish at this moment to discuss the military security problem that this situacies, such as the Ford Foundation, which tion presents for them, and, at one remove, has very large funds at its disposal. This for us. But the problem of helping the countries of South and South-East Asia Mr Casey. ito raise their living standards is one in which the democracies can, and will, help. so, in their interests and in our own. Two developments are thus of special interest to Australia. One is the energy themselves tackling their economic problems and mobilizing their own resources in an effort to improve the living standards of their peoples. The other is the awakening interest of the rest of the world in this vital area, and the substantial progress that is taking place in the provision of tangible aid, which we can rightly claim some credit for having stimulated. The Australian Government will continue to lend its vigorous and sympathetic support to both those developments. In the past two years international aid to South and South-East Asia has been forthcoming at a growing rate. In the two years ending on the 30th June, the United States of America will have given economic and technical aid amounting to more than £A.200,000,000 to countries within the right grants or loans. The amount of American aid to Asia and the Pacific for 1952-53 has yet to be finally decided. Loans to South and South-East Asian countries by tbe International Bank exceed £A.50,000,000, and additional loan proposals of considerable size are in course of examination. The United Nations and its specialized agencies are providing valuable technical assistance. Contributions for the first two and a half years of the programme lent of over £A.20.000,000. of which Australia contributed fA.270.000. From small beginnings, this work is now reaching its full momentum; and probably about one-third of all expenditure under the programme will go to Soutb and South-east Asia. It is Australia's policy to try to ensure that the Asian governments will receive at least a proper share of the United Nations aid available. Supplementing these governmental efforts are a number of non-governmental agenkind of private initiative is one which the Australian Government greatly welcomes. In no other part of the world can such aid be more fruitfully employed. The Colombo plan was conceived only a little over two years ago, and so is still in its early stages. I represented Australia at the meeting of the consultative committee of the Colombo plan in Karachi in February. Ten Asian countries were represented, together with the Tjnited States of America, tbe Tjnited Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand-the five countries responsible for the greater part of the aid to South and South-east Asia from all sources. The committee bas the unique quality of enabling the point of view of giving and receiving countries to be freely stated and discussed in an atmosphere of friendly co-operation. The attitude of the Asian countries concerned in the Colombo plan is reflected in the remark of the Indian Finance Minister, Mr Chintaman Deshmukh, at the Karachi conference lately, when he saidThe significance of such friendly assistance far transcends its material value. Mr Fazlur Rahman, the distinguished Minister for Economic Affairs of Pakistan, made the following statement :When the Colombo plan was first drawn up there might have been apprehensions that the assistance intended to be given under it would uot be compatible with national sovereignty and aspirations. It is becoming increasingly clear that the members of the plan work as members of a family, unified with the idea of helping each other, and in the spirit of give and take there is no feeling of superiority attached to the act of giving, or inferiority tainting the act of receiving. At the Colombo plan conference at Karachi, the countries of the Commonwealth set out to plan tLci? aid side by side with the great aid given by the United States of America. Apart from contributions to technical assistarcc, the United Kingdom will make a contribution of about £stg.300,000,000 over the six-year period of the programme, primarily in the form of releases of sterling balances, but also in the form of assistance to the British territories of South and South East Asia. In the current financial year, Canada made a contribution of 25,000,000 dollars, and will give a further 25,000,000 dollars for 1952-53. I draw particular attention to the welcome and far-sighted generosity of the Canadian contribution, bearing in mind tbe geographical distance of Canada from South and South-East Asia. New Zealand has pledged £NZ.3,000,000 over the three years of the programme. Australia allocated £A.6,200,000 in the current year, as well as about £200,000 in technical assistance. allocation has been spent? I think that approximately £5,000,000 has been spent. I am confident that the Colombo plan represents a means of cooperation witb Asian countries acceptable to honourable members on both sides of the House. It is a programme supplementing the activities of United Nations organization whose resources must be spread almost world wide. Australia is not alone in these efforts to give friendly aid to South and South-East Asia. Indeed, if we were, our Australian contribution towards raising the living standards of so many millions of people would be no more than a small gesture. As it is, the combined efforts of half a dozen countries represent something substantial by way of helping these Asian countries towards greater economic security, and demonstrating to them the fact that other democratic countries are concerned with their welfare. The task of aid to Asia is a formidable one, which the free world cannot avoid by denying its existence. Australia's part in all this, as I see it, is two-fold: first, to try to bring to this area the attention which it deserves from the free world; and, secondly, to show our own bona fides by providing a reasonable share from Australian resources. Other countries, with command of much greater resources than Australia, are liable to become discouraged if we show signs of leaving the whole burden of aid to them. I stress this point, which, I believe, will not be lost on honourable members. However, I realize that what we can do is largely determined by our own economic situation from time to time. We have substantial technical resources which can be organized for the benefit of Asian countries without imposing severe burdens noon ourselves.

When. I reported to the House in February, I spoke about the. security pact between: the United States of America. New Zealand and Australia. The pact came, into force on the 29th April, when instruments of ratification were de-' osited by the three signatories in Canerra.. The House has already had an opportunity to. examine and discuss the security pact, and it is not necessary for me to repeat the arguments. All that I wish to say about the security pact at thi? moment is that the Government looks forward to an early meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the three countries concerned, which will constitute the first meeting of the Pacific Council envisaged in the pact, and which will be the body ihrough which the purposes of the pact will be achieved. The Prime Minister recently discussed with the President and the Secretary of State of the United States of America, in Washington, the question of the most appropriate time and place for this first meeting of the Pacific Council, which, it is hoped and expected, will take place within the next few months. A few words should be said about West New Guinea, a subject which, happily, has been quiescent for the past few niionths. Early in April, when I was returning from the Colombo plan conference, at Karachi, I called, at Djakarta and had the privilege of a talk with President Soekarno.. In the course of the interview, which was a long and a friendly one, we put toone another frankly our 'respective attitudes of mind on the future of West New Guinea, and I , for my part, left him in no doubt about the strength of Australia's feelings on this matter, and nected with the Far East.

The first of these agreements was the treaty establishing a European defence community, or European army, as it is commonly called. Among other things, it provides a means whereby Western Germany may be integrated into Mr Casey. the Western European community,, and may share* the defence of the westernworld without the revival, of a German national army. The second agreement was that which covered the new status of the Republic of West Germany, which is to be given full authority over most of its domestic and ex;ternal affairs. These agreements do. not constitute? a peace treaty. It. has not been possible to draw up or. conclude such a treaty in the face of the obstruction of tlie Soviet Union,, which has frustrated the efforts, of theWestern Powers: Attempts, by a United Nations commission to examine the possibility of holding free elections for a unified Germany have been rebuffed by the Soviet Union.. The whole involved pattern of events associated with post-war Germany presents clear proof, if proof were needed, that the Soviet Union is interested iu doing business only on its own terms;, and those terras, mean, complete political and military advantage to the Soviet Union. The two treaties affecting Germany require ratification according to the constitutional processes of the countries concerned. The chief problems of ratificationappear likely to occur in the cases of France and Germany, and it is not possible at present to forecast the outcome of the complex political issues which are at stake in those countries. Australia is not directly involved in the negotiations on the German problem, but we have been kept constantly informed of all developments. I wish to make brief mention of the ground covered by the recently created Foreign Affairs Committee of this Parliament which, in the ten weeks since its establishment, has already held six working meetings and. completed preliminary surveys of South East Asia, South Asiaand the Middle East. It is now working on matters conof background and current material has been made available to the committee, and been in attendance at its various meetings toassist with information and to advise on our policy, and the -reasons behind it. Members of the committee themselves are in a better position than I to as°ess the value of the committee, but I feel sure that one of its major advantages wall be thc raising of the standard of debates on foreign affairs in both Houses of the Parliament, leading as a natural consequence, to a better-informed and more mature Australian public opinion on questions of paramount interest to the nation. I should like to end this short review of our external relations with a more general observation. Australia is a young country. We evolved from a small settlement about 160 years ago to colonial status and then to self-government, which is, in itself, a comparative term. However, after 50 years of federation, and after active participation in two great wars, we are now, in fact and in the eyes of the world, an independent Australian nation under the British Crown. Our forebears, indeed the immediate forebears of many of us in this Parliament, have taken part in the building of this new nation. We are on our own feet, an autonomous British nation, with internal responsibilities to our own people and with external responsibilities to the British Commonwealth and to the democratic world. Isolationism is a luxury that we cannot alford. Not long ago we rested comfortably under the protection of our Mother Country. To-day we are in the world and of it-in charge of our own affairs and obliged to sink or swim by our own efforts and with the co-operation of our f riends. The business of our external relations is not the least important of our tasks. The task of diplomacy is not only to keep the country out of war, but also to ensure that, if war should unfortunately come, we shall have the aid of powerful friends. The means by which this end will be achieved, if it is to be achieved, will be the machinery of our relationship with other countries. Until the last war started in 1939 onr relationship with the outside world was conducted through the diplomatic macliinery of our Mother Country, Great Britain. We had no independent machinery of our own. In the short period of the last twelve years we have created an external affairs service of our own to enable us to deal direct with the ATOMIC ENERGY (CONTROL OF countries that are of particular importance to us. This process of evolution has been so rapid that there are some' amendment. people who are not yet sufficiently aware of the need for us to conduct our own foreign relations through our own machinery. The reasons, if it is necessary to state them, are clear. First, that we can no longer ask Great Britain to carry the burden of protecting Australian interests in all foreign countries. In any event it would not he consistent with our situation in the world to ask Great Britain to do so. Secondly, we have inevitably evolved a view-o r perhaps rather a difference in emphasis-of our own. on several aspects of foreign policy, arising from our geographical situation and otherwise, which it would not be right or proper to ask United Kingdom posts to express on our behalf. This is not to be interpreted in any way as any important divergence of view between Australia and Great Britain on international affairs. It is a matter of common knowledge that this is not the case. The present position arises simply from the fact that Australia, in common with other self-governing British countries, has reached the stage at which it must have its own representatives overseas in countries that are of importance to it to act as its own mouthpiece and to protect its interests. There is no divergence of view in Australia from the simple fact that the democracies must preserve a solid front against international tyranny. The hard core of this grand alliance must continue to be the intimate and confident relationship between the countries of the Commonwealth and our friends of the United States.

Besides Her Majesty's ships Zeebrugge and Karvik which have already sailed carrying a detachment of the Royal Engineers aud stores, the special squadron will consist of As Chairman, I Her Majesty's ships Campania, flagship, Tracker and Plym.

The executive control of the project rests authorities, and the policy on matters such as those relating to the presence at the test of observers, whether they be officials or representatives of the press, is entirely for the United Kingdom authorities to determine. The role of our forces which w ill take part in the test is mainly in the realm of logistics, and the principal responsibility for security has been assigned to the Australian authorities. For tbe sake of the security of this extremely important undertaking, the bill proposes that an area bounded by the of 45 miles and centred on Flag Island, one of the Monte Bello group, shall be a prohibited area, and that no unauthorized person shall enter or fly over that area.

Habeison) Entirely With The United Kingdom,"lagoon to which I have referred has been used as a haven by Japanese pearling fleets, but it has not been used for this purpose during recent years. Barrow Island, which is much larger than any of the Monte Bello group, lies to the south on the same coral reef. It is about 18 miles long and 6 miles wide. It is lowlying, the highest point upon it being about 270 feet above sea level. It , too, is barren and uninhabited. The circular area of a radius of 45 miles which it is proposed to declare a prohibited area also embraces several tiny islets near the Australian coast, but none of these is of any particular significance. The area extends into territorial waters in one or two places but does not include any portion of the mainland. The reason for prohibiting this area is, that part of ""Western Australia. of course, to protect from observation by any unauthorized person, whether he be on land, on sea or in the air, the activities being conducted in relation to the atomic weapon test. Incidentally, the prohibition will serve the purpose of closing the area to persons who otherwise might stray into it and suffer physical harm as a result of the experiment. The bill makes provision for the Governor General to terminate the prohibition of the area as soon as it is safe to do so. The bill also makes provision for the declaration of restricted areas within which there shall be a control of aviation. It is intended to declare as a restricted area the area bounded on the east by the meridian of longitude 122 degrees east, on the south by the parallel of latitude 25 degrees south, and on the north-west side by the limit of the territorial waters of the mainland where they extend from a little below Carnarvon to just short of Broome. The reason for imposing this control in the present case-and similar considerations may arise in future cases-is that, in order that the prohibition of flying over the prohibited area may be effectively policed, the appropriate authorities will require to be given a measure of control over aircraft in the vicinity of the prohibited area. This control of civil aviation will be removed as soon as the interests of defence permit that to be done. The prohibited area centred on the Monte Bello group cuts across the Mary Anne passage, through which a trading ship normally passes about once a week. However, ships engaged in normal commercial activities in the vicinity will be permitted to pass through this passage, and it is intended that there shall be a simple system whereby ships may operate in these waters under permit. By a similar system it is intended that there shall be no interference with the normal scheduled flights of civil aircraft over the area of the mainland which will become subject to restriction. By the same token, the operations of the Flying Doctor Service will be unhampered, and machinery will be set up to enable the granting of permits for charter and private flights made in the conduct of the ordinary affairs of In addition to the provisions made for the granting of permits to enter prohibited areas, the bill provides in detailfor the search of persons entering, within, or leaving a prohibited area, and gives power to appropriate officers to seize anything in respect of which there is reasonable ground for believing it to be evidence of an offence. The bill further provides a power to arrest persons reasonably suspected of having committed, or of being about to commit, an offence against it. The bill also provides that no action shall lie against the Commonwealth, a State, or any person acting in accordance with the measure, in respect of anything done in pursuance of it ; but, if the Governor General is satisfied that any action taken has been taken without reasonable cause, he may award compensation. The bill renders the provisions of the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act 1947 applicable to special defence undertakings. This is proposed in order to remove any doubt whether, as a matter of construction of the' definition of "" approved defence project"" in that act, its provisions may be invoked for the protection of such undertakings. Cer-"" tain other machinery provisions, to which I need not refer at this stage, are also included in the bill. The penalties provided for offences are severe. I make no apology for that; but I invite the attention of the House to the provision which requires the consent of the Attorney-General to the institution of any 'prosecution. This, I suggest, w ill afford a safeguard against the measure being applied without due consideration. The Governnient has thought it wise in preparing the measure to make provision for any similar undertakings that may require to be carried out. It is designed so as to cater for such undertakings, whether they are for the defence of Australia alone, or whether, as well as being for our own defence, they are for the defence of another country with which we are associated in preparing to resist international aggression. Certain prohibitions and restrictions have already been made under existing legislation in respect of the atomic weapon test. However, it goes Without saying that the existing legislation was not designed with this particular test in mind, and, therefore, it is not surprising that in some respects it is unsuitable for present purposes. It is not only desirable but also necessary that the limits of the authority given to protect an undertaking such as the one at present in contemplation, shall be expressed in specific and appropriate terms. The public interest and curiosity which the present operation is exciting, and will continue to excite in increasiug degree, w ill be > readily understood. Some of this interest may be ascribed to natural inquisitiveness. but some is and w ill be nefarious. The House w ill , therefore, comprehend without difficulty the major importance of maintaining the essential secrecy of the test, and 'the fact that nobody should be in thc vicinity without a legitimate reason. Althoughi t w ill not be possible at any -stage to make a detailed statement regarding tbe test, the Government has gladly made facilities available for it , and I assure the House that in no way w ill the interests bf Australia be overlooked.

The act also protects the interests of minors who emigrate to this oountry on their own initiative. Child and youth emigration to Australia is encouraged in every possible way by the Commonwealth. In addition to contributing towards tbe fares of immigrant children brought out by approved voluntary organizations, it assists these organizations to the extent of sharing certain capital expenditure with them, and making available child endowment payments and equipment allowance. Apart from the desirability of a uniform policy throughout Australia in regard to child immigrants, it is considered that, in granting financial aid, the Commonwealth accepts a responsibility which must continue after their arrival in this country. At present, nearly 3,000 children from the United Kingdom are being cared for by responsible voluntary organizations, including Dr. Barnardo's Homes, the Fairbridge Society, tbe Northcote Farm .Schools, the Big Brother Movement, and a number of religious organizations. The act does not cover only those children who are introduced by approved voluntary societies. It applies also to minors sponsored by friends or prospective emplqyers. Before approval is given for them to oome to Australia, full inquiries are made by my delegates, the ofEcers-incharge of the child welfare departments of the States, all of whom are performing a valuable sendee in ensuring that the children's employment conditions and their accommodation shall be satisfactory. During the last three years, a few weaknesses in the act, chiefly of a technical nature, have become apparent to officers with experience of the practical problems involved. It is proposed now to embody their recommendations in the act. Briefly, the proposed amendments provide, first, that the act shall apply to minors who come to Australia wifh or to join relatives urider 21 years of age; secondly, that a certificate of an appropriate oflicer of the Commonwealth or of a -State, declaring that a person is an immigrant child, shall be prima facie -evidence of that fact; and thirdly, that -the-Minister ahall have power to revoke exemption orders, and to make exemption orders prior to the arrival of an immigrant child, or of a class of immigrant children. The first proposed amendment concerns section 4 of the principal act, which excludes from the guardianship of the Minister minors who enter Australia with, or to join their parents or relatives. Strictly interpreted, the wording of this section means that if two or more juvenile members of a family emigrated to Australia together, they would not legally come within the provisions of the act. The amendment is designed to rectify that position. The second proposed amendment also concerns section 4, and is intended to overcome administrative difficulties which have been encountered -by tbe child welfare departments in the States. As to the third-proposed amendment, both my predecessor and myself have from time to time, exempted from the act certain classes of immigrant children, such as single men between eighteen and 21 years of age, who have come to Australia as ""special project"" workers. In some instances, it has been found that it would be desirable to assume guardianship of an immigrant child covered by the class exemption. As section 11 of the act is worded, however, the Minister has no power to do this. The problem has been overcome by redrafting section 11 to bring it within the scope of section 33 (3.) of the Acts Interpretation Act, which provides that where a power is given in an act to make an order, that power includes a power to revoke, vary or amend, that order. In the case of alien minors over eighteen years of age who come to Australia at their own expense, it has been the practice for suitable inquiries to be made by child welfare authorities before a landing -permit is issued, and, if guardianship by the Minister is not considered necessary, to make an exemption order before the minor arrives, such order to become effective upon his arrival. Since some doubt exists as to the legality of orders made prior to arrival, section 11 has been redrafted to make the orders lawful. Honourable members will observe that -the .amendments are of a machinery nature. The provisions of the act which ensure the adequate care of immigrant children will remain unaltered. The proposed amendments are designed to eliminate weaknesses in the legislation, and to facilitate the activities of those who are directly concerned with the important matter of the welfare of immigrant children. Opposition) [4.24] -The supports the bill. At present, minors who come to Australia to join other minors are not covered by the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act, and the bill is designed to remedy that defect. The provisions in relation to the certificate are evidentiary provisions, which will be useful, and those in relation to alien minors are designed to cover the legality of orders made prior to the arrival Wool Board, in conjunction with similar of such minors, in this country.

Commerce and Agriculture) [4.26] by leave I move That the biU be now read .a second time. This is the first of three measures designed to re-introduce the wool tax, which in its original form has been suspended since 1946, and to increase the rate of tax. It may assist honourable members in their consideration of the proposal if I review briefly the history of the wool tax since it was first imposed in 1936. In that year, following the initiative taken hy the Australian Wool Growers Council for the imposition of a levy on wool for publicity purposes and for the establishment of a board to deal with publicity and research, the Australian Wool Board was established under the Wool Publicity and Eesearch Act 1936. The board, in addition to being charged with the responsibility for the publicity of wool in Australia and abroad, was empowered to take such steps as it considered necessary for the improvement of the production of wool in Australia, and the conduct of research into the production and use of wool. In order to provide funds for the board, a tax of 6d. Opposition a bale was imposed on all wool grown in Australia and shorn after the lst July, 1936. This rate applied until 1945. Out of the funds so provided, the board carried on its work in Australia, and also made its financial contribution to the International Wool Secretariat. [Quorum formed.] The secretariat was established in 1937 by the Australian organizations in South Africa and New Zealand, for the purpose of carrying out wool publicity overseas on their behalf. Wool publicity activities were continued in the war period. In 1944, the government of tbe day decided that the time had arrived when a more intensive publicity campaign should be conducted. That Government also decided that tbe Australian Wool Board, wbicb until that time had been responsible for wool research, should concentrate on publicity activities, and that other financial and administrative arrangements should be made in respect of research work on wool. Legislation was enacted early in 1945 to increase tbe rate of wool tax to 2s. a bale, to limit the Australian Wool Board's activities to wool promotion, and to provide a government contribution for wool research equivalent to the amount raised from the operation of the wool tax. As a result of this and increased contributions from New Zealand and South Africa, the International Wool Secretariat was enabled to expand its promotion campaign. Subsequent agreement between the Secretariat and the American Wool Council to establish and operate jointly Wool Bureau Incorporated in the United States of America permitted the development of increased wool publicity activities in North America. Late in 1945, the Governments of the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa adopted the wool disposals plan as a means of disposing of the",30,Second Reading

78,Mr Mcewen (Murray,"Minister forsurplus wool accumulated during the war. The Australian wool industry's share of the cost of operating this plan was provided from a contributory charge, which was collected from the lst July, 1946, under the ""Wool (Contributory Charge) Assessment Act and related legislation. In order to meet the convenience of all concerned, that act provided that, while the contributory charge should apply, the Wool Tax Act should remain in suspense, and further, that the 2s. a bale which would otherwise have heen collected under the wool tax should be collected as a part of the contributory charge, and be paid to tbe Australian Wool Board. This arrangement has applied until and including the present wool season. However, by the beginning of the current season-1951-52-the wool disposals plan was virtually complete and the rate of the contributory charge was therefore reduced to one-eighth of 1 per cent. The objective was to raise only so much money as would have been raised had the wool tax continued to operatethat is, an amount approximately equivalent to 2s. a bale. principal purpose of the contributory charge now no longer exists, it is appropriate to dispense with the contributory charge altogether and to bring ithe wool tax into operation again to make provision for wool use promotion funds. The primary purpose, therefore, of this bill and of two complementary measures that will be introduced shortly is to repeal the contributory charge legislation and to revive the wool tax. It is proposed to make the changeover at the lst July, 1952, before the commencement of the new wool season. As the wool tax generally becomes payable when wool is received into store and the contributory charge is not payable until the wool is sold, it is inevitable that wool received into store by brokers and dealers before the lst July, but not sold until, or after, that diture of the Board is to be reduced, most of date, sbould escape payment of both the the reduction will have to take place in charge and the tax. If the wool tax of operates from the lst July next, only a of synthetic fibres, and a considerable amount relatively small quantity of wool is likely of money is beiiig spent in advertising those to escape payment of both the contribufibres. We must do all we can to counter tory charge and the wool tax. Some this revenue-abou t £7,000-will , of course, wool promotion programme of the Wool Board. be lost to tbe Australian Wool Board as a result, but the recovery of this amount I strongly support those views, and, in would not be worth the cost and the administrative inconvenience to the Government, the wool-selling brokers and the wool-dealers. The problem, of course, does not apply in the case of wool exported. Provision has been made in the bill for the exemption from wool tax of any wool on which contributory charge has been paid or is payable. When the wool tax was raised to 2s. a hale in 1945, it was expected that it would yield an annual sum of about £350,000. However, actual' realizations have usually been rather less than this. Further, as with other costs, the cost of wool publicity has considerably increased since 1945. Increasing costs in Australia and overseas have materially affected the Australian Wool Board's finances.. This year, for example, it has been necessary to draw on the Wool Industry Fund to the amount of £150,000 to meet the board's deficit. At 1952 currency levels, the income from the wool tax at the rate of 2s. a bale will no longer provide adequately for even what might be regarded as a minimum wool promoAs the tion programme. The Australian Wool Board has proposed that next season tbe rate of wool tax shall be increased to 4s. a bale, with corresponding increases being made in the rate of tax on wool supplied in fadges, butts, and bags, and that in later years it shall be not less than 2s. a bale or more than 5s. a bale. The two wool-growers organizationsthe Australian Wool Growers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation-whic h nominate representatives to the Australian Wool Board, have approved of these proposals. In a joint statement supporting the increase of the rate of wool tax, the chairman of the Australian Wool Growers Council and the president of the Graziers Federal Council of Australia saidI f the levy is not increased, and the expenAmerica, nnd Ihis would not be in the interests tliu industry, because Amerira is the home activity . . . it is felt that now is the time to intensify, rather than reduce, the passing, point out that the rate of 4s. a bale represents about. 0.22 per cent., for the position of the various wool funds of tbe average value a bale of wool between September and April in tbe current wool selling season. Tbe second purpose of tbe bill and its associated measures, therefore, is to increase the rate necessarily include some consideration of of the wool tax to 4s. a bale for the 1952-53 season, and to fix upper and lower limits to the tax in future years. I should mention that in approving thc increased rate, the Australian ""Wool Growers Council suggested that it be struck for one year only, pending their consideration of wool funds generally. They have pointed out that various moneys contributed by the wool industry and now administered by this Government -for example, the Wool Industry Fund and the Wool (Reserve Prices) Fund -shoul d be examined with a view to determining whether, by the use of some of these moneys, the rate of the wool tax could be reduced below 4s. a bale. It is for this reason that it is protribution to the Wool Research Trust posed, in complementary bills that will be introduced shortly, to apply the rate of 4s. a bale only until the SOth June, 1953, in the first instance. Provision is made in those bills for the rate of wool tax on and after the lst July, 1953, to be prescribed in regulations; and, before regulations are promulgated, for consideration to be given to any recommendations on the rate of tax that may be made to the Minister by the Australian Wool Board after consultation between members of the board and the wool-growers' organizations which nominated them for appointment to the board. In this way the board will be in a position from time to time to recommend a rate of wool tax with full knowledge of the views of the wool-growers' organizations on that point. The Government would expect that the board's recommendation on the rate of tax would be made not later than the 31 t May preceding the wool year in e which it is intended that the rate shall apply, thereby giving reasonable time for consideration of the board's recommendation and for oromulgation of the regulations prescribing the rate before the commencement of the new wool year. These arrauTerneuts will permit the rate to he varied from time to time according to ci^curo stances and, in particular, tains certain saving clauses consequent to be. reviewed by the growers' organizations and the Government prior to the commencement of the 1953-54 wool season. The Government's review will the amount which the Government should pay in future to the Wool Research Trust Account. When the wool tax was increased to 2s. a hale in 1945, the government of the day indicated that it was prepared to contribute, for tbe purpose of wool research, an amount equivalent to the amount which the wool industry paid, in wool tax. Provision, was made accordingly in the Wool Use Promotion Act, and annual payments have since been made to the Wool Research Trust Account from Consolidated Revenue. The credit balance in that, account now stands at about £900,000. Whilst the Government does not propose to increase the amount of its conAccount to the same amount as the receipts from the wool tax at 4s. a bale, it by no means intends to withdraw from the field of wool research. It is too important to the future economic welfare of our country. The proposal in the Wool Tax Assessment Bill 1952 to repeal section 15 (2.) of the Wool Use Promotion Act which provided for the existing arrangement is to remove a legislative commitment to continue to find research moneys equal to any receipts from the wool tax. The Commonwealth will continue to make a substantial contribution towards research, and though I am unable to state precisely at present what the Government's contribution will be, it will not be an amount appreciably different from that produced from the present tax of 2s. a bale. By that I mean that it may be decided, as an alternative to a Government contribution determined by the amount of tax a bale, to bave a fixed annual contribution of a specified amount; say, for example, £350,000. 1 expect that the decision will be made before the next session of the Parliament, in which ca?e a new provision will then be introduced in place of the existing section 15 (2.) of the Wool Use Promotion Act.

The quarterly periods in respect of which returns of wool tax must be made are altered, and the time by which payment of tax must be made by woolbrokers and dealers is extended. It also includes a provision empowering the Commissioner of Taxation in special circumstances to grant further extensions of time. These provisions have been inserted to meet tbe position of wool-selling brokers who contend that, on the higher rates of tax now proposed, the provisions of the existing Wool Tax Assessment Acts would operate unfairly against them. I commend the bill to honourable members. I wish to make it clear that the proposed increased tax on each bale of wool is to be imposed at the direct request of the> Australian Wool Board, supported by the request of the Australian Wool Growers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation. At my request, both of those bodies consulted their constituent organizations before making their requests to the Government. Therefore, this is a proposal by the growers that they should be taxed in a. somewhat higher degree for the purpose of obtaining additional sums to spend in. the interests of their industry. the Government's contribution is to be reduced? made clear, not that the Government's contribution will be reduced, but that it will not be appreciably increased. cation of the previous arrangement? arrangement, in consideration of the growers contributing 2s. a bale, amounting to £350,000 a year, the Government contributed an equal'amount. I am sure that my memory is correct when I say that the Australian Wool Board has stated explicitly that it does not expect the Australian Government's contribution to keep pace witb the proposed additional contributions by the growers. That i.= clearly understood. ladjourned. WOOL TAX 1952. In Gommittee of Ways' and Means: Commerce and Agriculture) [4.44] I move1.

85,Mr Mcewen (Murray,"Minister forI n my second-reading speecn on the Wool Tax Assessment Bill 1952, I explained that it is proposed to impose a tax on wool at a rate of 4s. a hale. The purpose of this motion is to initiate the preparation of two bills to impose this tax. The first bill will impose the tax on all wool produced in Australia and, on and after the lst July, 1952, received into store by a wool-broker or dealer. The second bill will impose the tax on all other wool produced in Australia and exported on or after the lst July, 1952. The motion sets out the rates of tax proposed to be applied on wool supplied in bales, butts, fadges and bags and the procedure to be adopted in determining the rates after the 1952-53 season. Progress reported. In committee: Consideration resumed from the 3rd June (vide page 1286). The bill. Opposition) [4-46] -The Opposition has expressed its objection to the main purpose of this measure, which is to set up an elaborate system of appeals from conciliation commissioners for whose appointment provision was made by the Chifley Government in 1947. In my second-reading speech I endeavoured to explain how the new procedure will work. An appeal, or reference, may be made at any stage of the proceedings, in fact at any time right up to the moment before a conciliation commissioner gives his decision. In addition, if a point of law should purpose of this provision ? Who wants arise in the course of the proceedings, it may be challenged to the Full Court of the Arbitration Court, and, ultimately, subject to leave being granted by the Ohief Judge, to the High Court. Sucb a procedure will lead to a multiplicity of appeals. Applications for appeals will be made almost as a matter of routine. However, the Government has decided to apply this policy and even to extend it in respect of special tribunals such as that which deals with matters affecting employees of the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric project, the Public Service in respect of which an experienced arbitrator, with great legal ability, has jurisdiction, and other bodies such as the Stevedoring Industry Board and the Coal Industry Tribunal. At this juncture I shall not refer to those matters in detail, but shall concentrate upon two points. First, I refer to clause 17, which repeals section 55 of the principal act. That section prohibits the court, or a conciliation commissioner, from including certain provisions in an order or an award. The court, or a conciliation commissioner, is still to be prohibited from inserting a certain provision in an order, or an award, but the Government has deliberately left the way open to the court, or a conciliation commissioner, to insert in awards a provision authorizing an employer to forfeit or to refrain from paying wages that may be due to an employee under a contract or an award and to impose a penalty upon an employee. In this respect clause 17 revives provisions which by common consent have been abandoned. It restores to the court, or a conciliation commissioner, in appropriate cases, power to authorize an employer to impose a penalty upon his employees. TJnder the old shearing award, an employer could penalize a shearer for alleged misconduct, or for negligence in shearing sheep whereby he caused damage. The employer was made the judge for the purpose of imposing the penalty in such circumstances. TJnder clause 17 of this bill, the court, or a conciliation commissioner, is to be given legal power to restore that authority to an employer. Why should a conciliation commissioner, or the court, again be given that power which the legislature previously removed? What is the it? The Australian Workers Union, or the Australian Council of Trades Unions, has not been consulted about the matter. Neither of those bodies would approve of such a provision, which is reactionary, and which, in the past, led to litigation which poisoned the relations between employers and employees in many industries. Therefore, clause 17 cannot be justified. Seemingly, this amendment is very simple, because it repeals the present law; but the provision that it repeals prohibits the court, or a conciliation commissioner, from authorizing an employer to forfeit wages that are",35,Second Eeading
86,Dr. Evatt (Barton,"Leade r of thedue to an employee or to impose a penalty upon an employee. Surely, the Parliament cannot be expected to revive such a provision. Tbe second clause to which I refer is clause 22, under which a new section is to be inserted in the principal .act. The effect of this clause is to set out in the statute the rules in respect of admission to membership of an organization. Broadly, it provides that any person who is employed in connection with an industry, unless he is of general bad character, becomes absolutely entitled to become a member of a registered organization. Seemingly, that provision is very plausible; but one must examine it closely. I emphasize that the rules of a registered organization are continuously running the gauntlet, as it were, because at present the member has risen, I shall take my second court ma.y discard any rule that it considers to be harsh or tyrannical. Let us suppose that in the opinion of the court the rules of an organization are unfair, or restrictive to such a degree that the court considers them to be harsh or tyrannical. Admission to membership of the organization may he too stringent. At present, the court can deal witb such a matter; it can mould the rules of an organization in order to remove what it considers to be tyrannical and harsh. In the opinion of the Opposition, it is completely sumcient to give that power to the court. But, under this measure, the Parliament can say whether the rules of an organization are harsh or tyrannical, and to that degree the Parliament can set up its own standards and override the court. Such a provision is wrong. I can visualize dozens of instances in wbich this provision will cause industrial disputes of a most bitter character. In addition, whilst under sub-clause (1.) the right of membership of an organization is given to every person who is engaged in the industry concerned, sub-clause (4.) denies that right to persons in respect of whom reasonable grounds exist for believing that they are members of an unlawful organization or that they advocate things that are prohibited under the Crimes Act. Do honourable members opposite support a provision of that kind? This does not deal with trade union officials. Order! The right honourable gentleman's time has expired. an extension of time in order to conclude my remarks on the point with which I am dealing. I do not wish to be obliged to take my second period at this juncture. That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) from concluding his remarks without interruption. Minister's motion is not in order. If the Leader of the Opposition wishes to continue, he has no option but to take his second period. period. I am dealing with sub-clause (4.) of clause 22. Let us consider this provision in relation to Communists, or alleged Communists, and militants, or alleged militants. The Government has never proceeded under the Crimes Act against the Communist party on the ground that it is an unlawful association. It is open to the Government to approach che High Court and seek a.declaration to that efTect; but it has not done so. And, in respect of the provision in sub-clause (4.), it will not be necessary for the Government to do that, because not the High Court hut the Commonwealth Arbitration Court is to decide an appeal of this nature. This kind of case will arise: If a person wishes to become a member of a registered organization and proves that he is engaged in an industry and is not of general bad character, he will be entitled, under subclause (1.), to become a member, but under sub-clause (4.) be may be debarred from membership if reasonable grounds exist for believing that be belongs to an unlawful association or advocates things that are forbidden under the Crimes Act.

From that class are excluded people in respect of whom there is reasonable ground for believing that they are militants or Communists. Tha't is the object here. I say that it is completely wrong, .and I ask whether, even if a person, individually, is a Communist, the policy of the Government is that he is not to be allowed to work at the calling to which he belongs. We have to trace this matter step by step. The clause goes further than an intention to deal with people who have been proved to be Communists. It seeks to deal with people in respect of whom there is "" reasonable .ground for believing"" that they are Communists, and those persons are not to enjoy the rights that every other citizen is to have under sub-clause (1.). I say that that is completely illiberal and wrong, and should not be accepted by the eommittee. Council of Trades Unions and other trade union bodies have not approved of it, and the Lahour party also opposes it. I shall sum up the two clauses. I cannot analyse many of the clauses in the time at my disposal. Clause 22 seems to me to be completely unjustified, and the Opposition is completely opposed I thought that the right to it. First, we say that the rules of an organization should be accepted as the guide. If they are harsh or tyrannical the court may modify them to a degree sufficient to make them reasonable and just. The clause is objectionable from the point of view thai it will be an interference with the rules of an organization, which already are subject to the jurisdiction of the court. Sub-clause (4.) has the special vice to which I have referred. It will not even make factual proof necessary. It provides for ""reasonable grounds for believing "", in which case we shall have all the paraphernalia of information, reports, innuendoes and suggestions, all to be used as sufficient to prevent a person from obtaining the benefit of even the first class of case. Clause 17 is another bad .clause. I submit that it is completely objectionable to restore to the conciliation commissioners or the court the power to permit employers to impose penalties or to order the forfeiture of wages that have been actually earned owed. It is proposed to restore that power to a tribunal, although for a long time it has not been possible to exercise it. Such a proposal is extremely reactionary. Labour and National Service and Minister for Immigration) [5.3] -The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has raised three matters with which I shall deal in order to clear up any doubts in tbe minds of other honourable members who may wish to speak on them. The first is the charge, repeatedly made during the second-reading debate, that the appeals system will inevitably lead to a multiplicity of appeals which, in turn, will cause serious delays in bringing issues to finality. I admit quite frankly at the outset that the success or the The Australian failure of this reform of the arbitration machinery will depend to a great degree on the Chief Judge himself.

It is because we wish to avoid delays that we have announced our intention to appoint at least two additional judges so that there will be enough judges for two benchesof three judges each to sit at any one? time. In addition to that provision,, we may rely on the good sense and discretion of tbe. Chief Judge himself in relation to the business that will come to the court from the commissioners.. Quite apart from that, we have made it clear, that our intention is not to take away from the commissioners those matters that come more appropriately within their survey, and that relate to particular industries or sections of industry. The court will deal with matters on which eitheran appeal should lie, or which have been referred to it in the first instance, so that finality may be reached immediately in the consideration of it. These would be matters which raise large industrial questions and on which it isdesirable that there shall be a firm authoritative decision at the highest point. Galvin award ? clude the approach to the Galvin award that was so much criticized by honourable gentlemen opposite. I share their view, as I am sure Mr Galvin himself docs, that the question whether the state of the economy should be taken into account before a determination is given on the general question of margins, is one which might appropriately come before the Full Court for decision. Once the Full Court had given its decision on that general approach it would be fitting, and, I consider, convenient, for the individual commissioners to apply that guidance, and the ruling so given by the Full. Court, in cases concerning the particular industries that come under their jurisdiction. I consider that that, would be a comimonsense way 'of going, about, that sort of problem, and. it is tlie kind of thing that we had in mind when, we decided to establish this machinery. We shall learn from its. workings whether the fears that have been expressed by honourable members opposite will be borne out, or whether,, by a judicious selection on the part of the Chief. Judge or o£ any judge deputed by him to consider, thesematters, and by orderly arrangement of the business that will come beforethetwo full benches, we shall be able to> deal expeditiously with cases. possible for two judges, perhaps the Ohief Judge and one other judge deputed by bim, to be considering appeals at the same time ? practicable, but clearly we should not want them both to be considering the same issue. Again, that is a matter on which, the general guidance of the Chief Judge would be required. I wish to point out to the committee that the danger of obstruction or delay is not one that relates solely to this kind of system. At the moment ""we have a serious interrupt tion of work on the waterfront because tbe Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, rightly or wrongly-I think wrongly, but we need not go into the details of that now-claim s that delays have occurred in dealing with its general log of claims. I have received a good deal of written representation in recent times regarding an extension of the time of one of the conciliation commissioners on the ground that a matter before him is part heard and it is desired that it shall be completed before be retires from the jurisdiction. I am told, that that particular matter-and I say this without any intention of being critical of the commissioner or of any of the parties, because I do not know all that is involved in the case-ha s been on the stocks, as it were, fbr about four years. It will be seen, therefore, that delays can occur, either from good causes or from reasons that would justify criticism of one party or the other, the tribunal itself or the system. I have no serious fear, that any of the difficulties which exist Ln that connection will be accentuated by the measure. We hope that time will prove that once we get an authoritative determination on the kind of issue that arises in connection with such an important matter as that dealt with by the Galvin award, we shall be much more likely to achieve a",38,Conciliatio N And Arbitration Bill 1952

104,Mr Holt,"That would bequitespeedy application of the decision by individual commissioners to cases that are before them, than is the case at present, when there may be differences of opinion between conciliation commissioners. At present some commissioners may be either hesitant or doubtful about the course that tbey should adopt on the same kinds of problems as tbose on which other commissioners have made decisions. The second point raised by the Leader of the Opposition was in connection with clause 17. This is not a novel provision. The right honourable gentleman put his argument in such a way as to suggest that it was a remarkable innovation. reaction. not react very far in point ""of time, because I understand that a similar provision was contained in the legislation prior to 1947, but was omitted by the right honourable gentleman when he made his own very far-reaching amendments to the legislation at that time. I remind the committee that action under this clause can be taken only after tbe court, or a conciliation commissioner, has so awarded. The effect of the clause is to enable an employer, in certain prescribed cases, to impose a forfeiture to be taken from the wages of an employee when that employee has, either by wilful act or by serious negligence, caused damage. Such a provision is perhaps best known in its application, undar certain pastoral awards, to cases in which damage has been done to sheep in the process of shearing. It has been included in the class of case to which, in certain circumthat the award had been abused or improstances, this sort of provision should apply I do not claim to know much about the practical working of the provision as it existed previously, but the advice that I have received is that it was a useful provision. An employer isentitled to some reasonable protection against either gross negligence or wilful damage. In some classes of industry an. employer who found an employee conducting himself in that way would simply give to him notice of dismissal, or to a warning that might later lead to dismissal if the offence were repeated. Minister say what would happen in relation to a shearer who left a shearing shed before' he had completed his contract ? If he had already shorn 2,000 sheep for which he had not then been paid, could the employer refuse to pay him for them ? judgment, he could not; but I do not intend to deal with hypothetical cases. Such a case would come before the court or a conciliation commissioner for determination. already happened. may make his own point on that. I am quite certain that if such a thing has happened it did not occur as a result of the operation of the bare facts that tbe honourable gentleman has stated to the committee. BeforeI should be prepared to state an opinion I should need to know, as would a conciliation commissioner or the court, the full facts on which any action of that kind had been taken. This provision has been inserted in the bill as a matter of policy. Honourable members may be as critical as they like to be, but the advice given to me is that it is a reasonable provision which has had some useful effect. be given to the employer. have to be laid before the court by the employer. I am also quite certain that, following a court award along those lines, if the representatives of the employees involved were able to show to the court or to a conciliation commissioner at any time perly applied, the court or the conciliation commisioner would make a variation accordingly. However, I shall not debate that matter at great length. That is the position, as I understand it, and the provision has been inserted in the hill for the reason I have given. Proposed section 83A, which the Leader of the Opposition also discussed, raises a matter of substantial interest to honourable members.

Opposition members, like honourable members on this side of the chamber, do not wish to encourage the growth of monopolies. Opportunities, whether they be for the conduct of private enterprise or for seeking and obtaining employment, should not be restricted by any combined action on the part of a few to exclude the many from their ranks. Therefore, this provision has been inserted in the bill in order to establish that a man who is not of general bad character shall be entitled to engage in the calling that he chooses, provided he can comply with the proper trade requirements, and shall not be excluded from a calling merely because the executive of a union decides to close its books against the admission of additional members. The Leader of the Opposition grew indignant, not only about the matter with which I dealt a few moments ago, but also about this aspect. may disallow certain rules made by a union. Why is the Minister uot satisfied with that position? gentleman is critical of this provision. If his words express the general attitude of the Australian Labour party to this provision, why has it not exercised its influence on the Labour Government of New Soutb Wales on this matter? The provision to which the right honourable gentleman has objected has been taken direct from section 115 of the Industrial Arbitration Act (No. 2) 1940 of New South Wales. Presumably, if sucb a provision commends itself to the Labour Government of that State, because it has been in operation for twelve years, there is no powerful reason why it sbould not be accepted by this Parliament. The Opposition has also taken exception to the fact that, having given entitlement in sub-section (1.) we have proceeded to provide, in sub-section (4.), thatNothing in this section applies to a person as to whom there is reasonable ground for believing that(a) he is a member of an unlawful association within the meaning of subsection (1.) of section thirty A of the Crimes Act 1914-1950; or (6) he advocates or encourages, or has, I have always understood that within one year immediately before seeking to become a member of the industrial organization, advocated or encouraged, any of the matters referred to in tliat sub-section. That is a complicated way of saying that, although a person becomes entitled under sub-section (1.), his entitlement may be rejected by a union if , in point of fact, he is a Communist. Opposition members claim that entitlement is given in subsection (1.), and is taken away, at least from certain persons, in sub-section (4.), and they assert that such provisions will lead to all sorts of unsatisfactory investigations and practices. I make it clear that the purpose of the Government is to ensure that tbose unions which have adopted a firm policy of excluding Communists from their membership shall not have foisted on tbem, as a result of our legislation, Communists whom otherwise they would reject. The proposed new section does not declare that a union must, reject the kind of person described in sub-section (4.). It states that a union, if it wishes to reject him on those grounds -which , incidentally, are challengeable before the court-nee d not necessarily accept him because he happens to comply with the requirements of subsection (1.). Unions already possess power to make rules the effect of which would be to exclude from membership persons who come within the terms of sub-section (4.) It would be absurd for us to give to unions power to make a rule to exclude such persons, and, by another provision, insist that they accept persons who were objectionable to them, in terms of their rules, which had received the sanction not only of the Government but also of the Opposition. If a union has no inhibitions regarding the matter, nothing in this legislation will prevent it from admitting to membership a person who comes within the definition that has been mentioned. am far from satisfied with the explanation given by the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) of the three matters raised by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt).

No explanation has been given to tbe committee of the reason for the incorporation of Frankly, I explanation as most unsatisfactory. Many years ago, employers were in the habit of uiaking laws and regulations governing the conduct of their employees, and providing a penal code for infringement of them. This abuse became so prevalent that nearly every colony in Australia inserted in its factories and shops legislation a provision compelling an employer to keep a record of all fines and other penalties inflicted upon his employees and the reasons why they had been imposed. so strong against the system that the factories and shops legislation was amended so as to prohibit an employer from imposing any penalty on his employees. Yet this Government is attempting to revive, in 1952, a system that was discarded long ago. I know exactly how I , if I were a union omciai, should react to such a provision, which places the employer in the position of prosecutor, the jury that convicts, and the judge who imposes the penalty. The corollary to the present proposition is to permit unions to impose penalties upon unsatisfactory employers. Proposed section 55 may definitely be regarded as a retrograde step in our history of industrial arbitration. The Conciliation and Arbitration Act makes provision for the inclusion of employee is guilty of malingering or of inefficiency, he may be dismissed. Yet. in addition to all the provisions in an industrial award that may be applied to an employee who fails to carry out his duties properly, and in addition to thc fact that the court is empowered impose fines and other penalties, the Government now proposes to authorize the employer to impose penalties on his employees. If the Minister wishes to stir up industrial trouble, he cannot adopt a more effective means of doing so. His proposal is bound to cause trouble in industry. Mr Clarey. path of conciliation and arbitration, yet I say frankly that if I were a union official, and if an employer were given authority to impose penalties upon members of my industrial organization for any acts of which they were supposed to be that provision in the bill. guilty, when the whole machinery of thc regard the Minister's Oommonwealth Arbitration Court was available to deal with the mattei"", I should certainly advise the men not to work under such penal provisions. I cannot understand why tlie Government wishes to alter the status quo. So far as I am -aware, no body of employers bas sought the change. I advise the Government to abandon proposed section 55. by the official representatives of the employers. Eventually, feeling became But even if the employers are seeking the amendment, it is wrong to place in their hands the right to judge whether fines or other penalties shall be imposed on employees. The honourable member for Evans( Mr Osborne), wbo is interjecting, disagrees vvith my assessment of the position. The effect of proposed section 55 is to empower the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and the conciliation commissioners to insert in awards a provision tliat will permit an employer, without .reference to anybody, to impose a. penalty on his employees. If an employee is deemed to have committed an offence, such action as may be necessary should be taken by the court or a conciliation commissioner. The employer should not be .allowed to exercise the power of punishment. I also point out that an employee has no right to appeal to a tribunal against penalties in awards. If an the penalty imposed by the employer. The Minister spoke at some Jength about proposed section 83A, which deals with the entitlement of persons to be members of industrial organizations.

In my opinion, proposed section 83A is not necessary. The Minister also discussed the provision that will allow the right of appeal to tbe Commonwealth Arbitration Court against a decision of a conciliation commissioner. What happened in the court in respect of the Hours case and the Wages case? The hearing of each claim occupied approximately two years.

I regret that the honourable member should be in doubt about this because the position is perfectly clear. TJnder the .Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1947, the courts were precluded, by section 55, from including in an award a provision authorizing an .employer to refrain from paying wages or to order the forfeiture of wages. The only awards in which such a provision, has been inserted have been those in the pastoral industry. In some of those awards an employer was authorized to make deductions from the wages of an employee if sheep are negligently damaged by shearers. The honourable member for Bendigo will be interested to know that those provisions are still in the pastoral said that this will cause a grave interawards to which I have referred, and ference with the freedom of trade unions. that the trade union movement has never All that the proposed section will do will sought to have them repealed. true. member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde member for Bendigo to the situation in Cameron) seems to indicate that the trade the Moulders Union. I cannot speak for union movement has made some such other States of the Commonwealth, but attempt, but it is interesting to note that those provisions still remain in the pastoral awards. They have apparently been considered to be necessary for the successful working of the industry. Thc repeal of the former prohibition in section 55 will merely restore to the court, not to the employer, the power to include in an award a provision for forfeiture of wages if the court considers that to be necessary. The honourable member for Bendigo and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) have tried to establish that the Government is indulging in some spiracy; that it is adopting the methods of the nineteenth century and is making the employees jump at the crack of the whip of blood-sucking employers. Those The honourable members have deliberately tried to implant in the public mind that idea of the Government. I bring it to their attention that if the blood-sucking the unfortunate shearer of his just wage by wrongly claiming that the shearer has cut some sheep, the shearer can sue the squatter at law for the recovery of his money. It is well to remember that in those circumstances the union and the enormous industrial power of the whole trade union movement would lie behind the shearer. It is just ludicrous that the time of this committee should be wasted by the honourable member for Bendigo ventilating the complaint that the Government is taking part in a reactionary conspiracy against employees. With all due respect to that honourable member, he has been talking egregious nonsense about proposed section 55, and I strongly suspect that he knows it. Let us now turn to proposed section 83A.

I refer the honorableI know that certain foundries in Sydney, have been working at about 60 per cent, of their capacity because of the persistent refusal of the Moulders Union to admit certain employees in those foundries who may belong to other unions, so that they may operate mechanical moulding processes. This anti-elevation ban was allegedly imposed as a protest against the Galvin award, but it is really a reactionary attitude on the part of tbe Moulders Union against allowing into the union any men whose work will be limited to the performance of mechanical processes. The most reactionary attitudes in industry to-day are adopted by certain unions, such as the Moulders Union. This ban has caused some Sydney foundries, particularly those engaged in malleable casting work, to work at about only 60 per cent, of their capacity. Malleable castings are of great importance in the building industry. That situation alone demonstrates the necessity for a provision such as that of proposed section 83A. The Leader of the Opposition also said that the provisions about Communists .or those who advocate communism, are dangerous. attention to the irony of his objection to such a provision. In proposed section 83A we have sought to give to persons in a specified category the right to become members of unions, but we have said that no union shall be forced to take a man who is a Communist. The Opposition, according to its leader, is now objecting to a union being given the right to prevent a Communist from joining it. The Galvin award has been mentioned a great deal in connection with proposed section 14A, but that award is not the reason for the introduction of this section. annual wages bill. Mr Galvin decided The Galvin award is a symptom of the failure of the system established by the 1947 legislation. I had the interesting experience of listening yesterday to the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. E. Fraser). He said that I had lauded, praised and generally given approval to the Galvin award. If he will read the speech that I delivered during the second reading debate on this measure, he will see that I did nothing of the sort. Hr. Osborne. ber disapprove of the Galvin award? fact that a conciliation commissioner should be obliged, as Mr Galvin was, to make an award which would have the effect of reducing the due proportion of margins for skill. If the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) will read what I said during the second reading debate, he will see that I claimed that greater margins for skill and greater encouragement for workers to undertake skilled occupations are vitally necessary in industry. The 1947 arbitration system has broken down to such a degree that a conscientious and serious conciliation commissioner, after a year's hearing, has been forced to make an award that has discouraged tradesmen. That is the clearest evidence of the failure of the 1947 system. The system of appeals contemplated by this measure will enable some uniformity to be brought into our arbitration system. It will enable the Full Court to have some control over the whole arbitration system, and not only over the standard wage. It will provide one way out of the dilemma in which I direct Mr Galvin found himself. Mr Galvin had two. alternatives. He could have made an award giving efTect to claims that would have involved the Australian people in the payment of another £150,000,000 annually. we reduce it by £50,000,000 and say that his award could have cost Australia £100,000,000 a year if the claims of the metal trades unions had been granted. Tn any case, an enormous amount would have been added to Australia's that in the existing economic circumstances of this country, he could not impose such a crushing additional burden on the economy. We all know that the increasing wages bill is one of the prime causes of inflation. Inflation destroys tbe value of wages and so the wage-earner himself suffers directly. Mr Galvin decided that, in the interests of the whole community, he could not do what he did.",43,Conciliatio N And Arbitration Bill 1952

I wish to return to a. discussion of proposed section 55 and proposed section 83A. Those sections are the basis of the whole of our complaint against the bill, and prove that it is the work of amateurs. It is quite apparent that the true understanding in industrial matters, such as are dealt with in this bill, lies with the Opposition and not with the Government. On this occasion the Government has again displayed a complete lack of willingness to consult with trade unions, and has arrived at a decision that will cause not an amelioration of industrial troubles, but more frustration and strikes. Let us consider proposed section 55. The honourable member for Evans said that we are not back in the days of Dickens. If the honourable member had a beard and was made up a little, he could well pass for one of the employers of those horrible days of imposition on employees. attitude is that the employees are merely a rabble seeking some satisfaction, but that this is the best of all possible worlds, and the courts are doing everything possible for them. Lawyers are very prone to disputation about what one little word may mean. Therefore, considering how involved this measure is, the Opposition desires that the Government shall clarify its intentions. The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) pointed out that the repeal of section 55 of tbe principal act could allow penalties to be imposed by employers on employees. That position has been made no better by the bland statement of the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) that this section was repealed at the request of employers. to say whether the employers would make such a suggestion out of sheer goodheartedness or out of malice aforethought. The Opposition believes that it was done through malice aforethought. The question that now arises is, if this provision has no significance for unionists, and members of the Opposition are not entirely babes in the wood, then what is the reason for it? The Government should consider the whole matter once again. Agreements that bave been made by the Australian Workers Union have been mentioned, and it has been said that certain provision has been made in pastoral awards for the imposition of penalties upon those wbo cut sheep while shearing them. Those allegations will be replied to later by the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron). Proposed section 55 is dangerous, and the Minister should reconsider it. The same may be said of proposed sections 14A and 14B. The Government is part-time libertarian in regard to appeals because it allows only a little appeal and only in certain circumstances. If a full-blooded appeal were to be allowed, the matter would he different, but this is merely a niggling appeal and is a tinkering with the Commonwealth -Arbitration Oourt. The appeal is to he from tweedle-tum to Tbe honourable member's tweedle-dee, and the whole proposal is quite ridiculous. There is a difference of opinion, but the balance of opinion is that the bill will not work because the essence of arbitration is simplicity. I have noted some of the references to arbitration procedure that have been made during this discussion. Honourable members have mentioned the Harvester award, the Powers 3s., the needs wage, the basic wage, wage averages, all bouses "" A "" series, all items "" C "" series, secondary wages, margins, loadings and incentives. Where is the simplicity of our arbitration system now? The Government in the recent past has added a further theatricality to it by so amending the act that lawyers may appear before the court as advocates. The whole system is losing the elements of conciliation and arbitration and is assuming all the I ask the Minister devious technicalities of the average law court.",44,Conciliatio N And Arbitration Bill 1952

131,Mr Haylen,"Clause 17 is extremely dangerous and sLould not be left untouched or be allowed to pass without comment. The honourable member for Bendigo, who is an expert in industrial matters, has expressed his views with the greatest possible clarity and has adhered closely to facts. The Minister for Labour and National Service must be more of an amateur in industrial affairs than I believed him to be if he refuses to heed the warnings of the honourable member for Bendigo. The Government and its supporters have argued that there is nothing wrong with clause 22, which provides for the insertion of a section to provide that certain persons shall be entitled to membership of trade unions. Apparently the Minister and bis colleagues are only part-time democrats. Tbey make all sorts of protestations about democracy, but they disregard its principles when it suits their convenience to do so. TJnder the terms of this bill, a suspected Communist may be prevented from obtaining a job, but a suspected fascist, apparently, will be allowed to do as he pleases. The Government should face the facts. The wording of the clause is evasive, and it will be difncult to interpret. The courts are already cluttered with disputes that arise from difficulties of interpretation. The Minister has said that be wants to clarify a certain interpretation because the Coal Industry Tribunal, under the existing law, is debarred from taking evidence. This is one more example of words in a legal document not meaning what they say. a Labour government. not rely upon the advice of the experts. He merely seeks to evade responsibility by blaming the Labour Administration for his own faults of omission. He say3, in effect, that anything that was enacted at the instance of the former Labour Government must be superlatively correct. We acknowledge his vociferous admiration of our works, but, unfortunately, the honourable gentleman fails to grasp all the facts. Clause 22 is worse than the former "" red bill "" was. It will help to clog the number of amendments that have been sources of labour. Certain men are to be black-balled, and I do not know how the innocent will be able to obtain redress. Such issues are best left to the judgment of the trade unions, which exercise firm control over their members. What does the Government propose to do with the political cripples who will be debarred from membership of unions and, therefore, from the opportunity to obtain employment? Because of some political belief, distorted or otherwise, certain workers are to be prevented from obtaining jobs. Apparently the Minister proposes to provide them with social services benefits so that they will be supported by the taxpayers. What an absurd and stupid proposition! opportunities of workers instead of restricting them. ber for Bendigo dealt specifically with this issue and I believe that he knows more about these matters than the Minister knows. Unfortunately, the Government will not consider our suggestions. We already know that, in preparing tbe bill, it ignored the workers who will be affected by it. were not fully consulted. periodically on these and kindred problems for months past. to generalities. When they tried to point out the faults in the Government's proposals, they found that the door was not opened to them. The Minister must agree that he has received strong representations on the subject of appeals. He has clouded the issue in the name of democracy.

Our task is to strive continually to make the law effective and satisfactory to all parties. We are pledged to support the arbitration system. One of the greatest weaknesses of the system has been that parties to industrial disputes over the years have been able to declare that, if they disagree with the decisions of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, they will resist them. The unions accept decisions of the court when those decisions meet their wishes. A t other times, they frequently cause disturbances in protest against decisions of the court. That has happened many times. lent to-day. That situation can be remedied in either one of two ways. One method is to provide the means for an recently in a criminal court. unsatisfied party to a dispute to appeal against the decision of an arbitration him? tribunal.

The unions declared, in effect, "" What we have we hold, and we shall keep the other men out"". They refused to open their ranks to new members. TJnder such conditions, it was of no use to train men for various trades because, unless the unions accepted them, they could not obtain employment. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Tom Burke) knows the part that I played in that controversy, and he will agree that I was not influenced by party political considerations. The only regrettable feature of the Government's proposal to open the doors of the trade unions to all qualified men of good character who wish to follow the trades of their choice is that the provision cannot be made to apply throughout Australia to all trade unions. That limiting factor is the only draw-back. The provision will be welcomed by all sections of the community because it will enable workers to follow the trades of their choice and will provide opportunities for the employment of our British kith and kin whom we bring to this country. I have personal knowledge of instances in which immigrants have been denied membership of trade unions although they are fully qualified as tradesmen and came to Australia for the purpose of following their trades. Such men have appealed to me because they have been debarred from employment in suitable jobs. As a result of this closed-shop policy of the trade unions, employers are frequently obliged to engage men hecause they hold union tickets although they may be entirely unsatisfactory as workers. The union ticket is the bread and butter of many Australians. The Parliament has a duty to protect every individual against unfair treatment by the trade unions. These powerful vested interests have no right to deny to any individual the freedom to follow the calling of his choice. The CHAIBMAN"" -Order! honourable member's time has expired. Sitting suspended f rom 6 lo 8 p.m. that, under a system of appeals, delays will be inevitable. The Full Bench of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court took two years to hear the hours case, and two years to hear the basic wage case. Now, the Full Court has before it an application by the employers for an increase of working hours from 40 to 44 hours a week. It is expected that the court will begin to hear that case in July. The Australian Council of Trades Unions has lodged an application with the court for the grant of long service leave to employees in industry. That case will also be heard by the Full Court. Eveni f , as the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) indicated in his second-reading speech, two Full Courts were able to sit at the same time in the future because additional judges of the court had been appointed, for the next twelve months both courts would be fully engaged in hearing the hours case and the long service leave case. If this bill were passed and, consequently, it were possible for the Full Court to re-open the question of margins, a considerable time would elapse before that case could be heard. I remind honourable gentlemen that Mr Galvin took twelve months to hear and determine the margins case that came before him. If that case were to go to the Full Court on appeal, all the evidence that was presented to Mr Galvin would be presented again to the court. Under the provisions of this measure, the court could hear further evidence. It is obvious that, if one court were dealing with the matter of hours and the other with the matter of long service leave when an appeal was lodged against Mr Galvin's decision, a considerable period of time would elapse before one of the courts could hear that appeal. I consider that those matters should be mentioned, because honourable gentlemen opposite seem to be under the impression that thc Opposition, by claiming that under the proposed procedure delays will be inevitable, has raised only a bogy.

158,Mr Claeey (Bendigo) [8.0],"LetI desire to direct the attention of the Minister to a peculiar feature of this bill. Glauses5 and 12 make provision for appeals. If those clauses were agreed to, an extraordinary position would arise. Once some matters had been the subject of an appeal to the Full Court and had been decided by it, there would be no machinery that would permit those matters either to be re-opened by the Full Oourt or to be the subject of further consideration by a conciliation commissioner. Let us assume that the margins case eventually came before the Full Oourt, and that the court upheld Mr with paragraph (b). It woald be entirely Galvin's decision. The ruling of the court in that case would become an instruction to every conciliation commissioner. No conciliation commissioner would depart from the decision of the court, because, if he did so, an appeal would be lodged immediately and his decision would be reversed. When a decision has been made by the Full Court, it remains in operation until such time as the court alters it. But, under the system that would operate if this measure were passed, the Full Oourt would be unable to review the decision that it made when it heard the appeal from Mr Galvin's decision. The functions and powers of tbe Full Court are limited to the matters of hours, the basic wage and long service leave. If the court made a decision on such an appeal, the decision would be adhered to by the conciliation commissioners, but no organization would be empowered to apply to the court for a review of the decision. In such circumstances the decision of the court would be, like the laws of the Medes and Persians, immutable. Once the decision had been given, there would be no means by wbich the issue could again be brought' before a conciliation commissioner, or by which the decision of the court could be either reviewed or rescinded. If this bill were passed, before very long it would be necessary for the Minister to introduce another measure designed to enable a decision of the court on an appeal to be reviewed by the court itself, on an application by the parties to the case, or for the issue to be remitted to a conciliation commissioner. A similar difficulty was experienced in Victoria, and tbe law of that State had to be amended to provide that an appeal tribunal could send a case back to a wages board, or that the parties themselves could approach the tribunal and apply for the case to be sent back to the board. These provisions of the bill, if they become operative, will cause a very serious position to arise. I suggest that the Minister reconsider them. Clause7 seeks to insert in the principal act a new section 16A. I agree with paragraph (a) of sub-section (1.) of the proposed new section, but I do not agree wrong if the Chief Judge, in pursuance of the provisions of section 11 of the act, hacl the right,, arbitrarily, to transfer a conciliation commissioner from one group of industries to another. The OhiefJ udge should be charged with a duty to ensure that a conciliation commissioner shall deal with unfinished cases before he is transferred from one group of industries to another. TJnder the provisions of the proposed new section, the Chief Judge could transfer a conciliation commissioner when he was in the process of hearing a case. If that were done, the determination of the case would be delayed, and the parties would be involved in additional expense. In my opinion, the committee should reject paragraph (a) of sub-section (1.) and also sub-section (2.) of the proposed new section. The fact that the pastoral award contains an illegal provision that enables employers to impose penalties upon employees is not a good reason for saying that the Conciliation and Arbitration Act sbould be amended to bring that power within the ambit of tbe Full Court and the conciliation commissioners. [Extension of time granted.] The provision in the pastoral award to which I have referred is, as I have said, illegal, and neither the Full Court nor a conciliation commissioner has power to insert such a provision in an award. But in any event, the principle is entirely wrong. An employer should not have the right to determine whether an employee has committed an offence, to assess the gravity of the ofTence and to determine the penalty that should be imposed. If honourable gentlemen opposite say that a worker, upon whom a penalty was imposed under that provision, could have the matter reviewed by a court of petty session or by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, let me point out that no provision is -made in this hill for an employee to appeal against a penalty imposed on him by his employer. I think that clause IS should be rejected by the committee. I turn now to clause 22, which seeks to insert in the principal act a new secof the policy of the Labour Government tion 83A. A very dangerous position would arise if our conciliation and arbiarbitration commissioners, tbe most tration legislation contained a provision that would enable a person, who might not be Droperly qualified to do so, to become a member of a particular trade union. It is wrong in principle for any authority to say that certain persons must be accepted as members by a trade union. Such a provision could be tyrannical. The Waterside Workers Federation bas been compelled by economic circumstances to limit its membership. Obviously, it would be undesirable if a branch of that organization in any port had many more members than were needed to meet the requirements of the port. If we forced it to admit more members, when its ranks were already overcrowded, the only result would be that which was established by the findings of less work would be available for each man and there would be general dissatisfaction in the industry. The Federated Storemen and Packers Union has a casual workers' section, but, hecause casual work is limited, it has been compelled to limit the number of members of the section. It dare not admit to membership of the section men for whom work cannot be found. This proposed new section would be very dangerous if it were to be put into operation, hecause it could bc used by persons who desired to become members of the Waterside Workers Federation, the Ship Painters and Dockers Union, or the Federated Storemen and Packers Union, to the detriment of those employed on the waterfront. Men have heen expelled from trade unions on the ground that they have been guilty of conduct not worthy of the organization. Such persons could take advantage of this provision .to get back into the union. -Honorabl e members on the Government side of the House see the obvious need for this amendment. The Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1947 produced under the Labour Government a record number of stoppages, strikes and interferences in industry. Since this Government has taken office, few strikes have occurred. That is because this Government is unfriendly towards communism and because it brought in the recent ballot. The 1949 strike was the culmination of the effects of the day. Under conciliation and savage things had to be done to unionists by the Chifley Government. The whole country was thrown into confusion and hundreds of thousands of workers were put out of work by the terrible coal strike. It was the culmination of the system that was initiated by the Chifley. Government. Certain measures were piloted through the Parliament by tbe present Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt). Honourable members on the Government side believe that appeals are essential. The Labour party itself has shown the need for them. In February, 1952, the Australian Council of Trades Unions and members of the Labour party opposed the Galvin award, Conciliation Commissioner Galvin under the 1947 act. The state of mind in which the Labour movement found itself was illustrated by the Australian Council of Trades Unions when it refused, on the 21st February, to accept the Galvin award and decided on direct action failing a re-hearing which, in effect, would have been tantamount to an appeal. By disagreeing with the findings of the Galvin award, the Opposition and the trade union movement have embarked on something that is similar to an appeal against the findings of the conciliation commissioner. Honourable members on this side of the committee believe that one of the main defects in the 1947 act is its failure to co-ordinate the findings of the conciliation commissioners. Some of the conciliation commissioners have said that they believe that their task is merely to have disputes settled.

The conciliation commissioner's duty is to",48,Cameron Literally Me Point Out To Honourable Members Again
159,Mr Jeff Bate (Macarthur) [8.15].,"settle industrial disputes. It would be a complete contradiction of the requirements of the Arbitration Act to deliberately peg wages (i.e., margins) at the 1947 levels. On the other hand, Conciliation Commissioner Galvin looked at the matter from a national angle and caused confusion. He saidTo grant the unions' claims would have been to aggravate inflation, and inflation appears to me to overshadow every other problem. Conciliation Commissioner Galvin believed that the matter should be considered in the widest sense. Therefore, in effect, he must agree with the view which actuated the Government in introducing this legislation. The Government believes that the conflicting statements of Conciliation Commissioner Findlay and Conciliation Commissioner Galvin are proof of the need for consistency in establishing a common rule of law, and that matters of such major importance should be referred to the court in the public interest. So far I have concentrated on clause 17 of the bill. The other matter to which I wish to refer is clause 22, which seeks to deal with the principle of the closed shop. The closed shop developed in Europe under the guilds. Those guilds were composed of craftsmen who had a high sense of pride in their artisanship and their trades. Probably the closed shop would be a good rule in tbe old countries which are not expanding and which, in fact, are losing people to new lands. Closed shops are also to be found in the United States of America. Clause 22 seeks to open union membership to selves capable of being employed in certain industries. It is designed to enable unions to admit to their ranks men who desire a job. If the Opposition rejects the proposal and continues to support the closed shop system, it will be denying to men the freedom to seek congenial employment wherever they choose. The closed shop system which the clause seeks to abolish, takes away two freedoms of people who are outside the unions. If a union decides to keep out of its ranks people who are trying to gain membership, it is claiming power to legislate for outside people. Real freedom means that strong groups shall not have power to act against othef people. If the motor drivers of Australia had the freedom to travel along city streets at 70 miles an hour, they would be interfering with the comfort, safety and security of others. In this case, if the Government allowed the powerful trade unions the right to say that menshould not enter the unions, it would be denying employment to those people. It would mean that all industries would be bound by the strong unions and compulsory unionism would come into effect, but employers would be forbidden to employ anybody except tbe members of unions. For their part, the unions would deny membership to persons, who, in effect, would not be able to get employment. That principle would destroy the freedom of a man to enter a union and seek a job that he wanted. It would deprive employers of the freedom to engage the men whom they required and were willing to employ. In the finish, some unions dominated by Communists would decide how many democratic Australians would be permitted into the unions and into avenues of employment. To honourable members on this side of the House and to the people of Australia, it is unthinkable that that sort of freedom should be denied to Australians. I give the strongest support to clause 22, which is suited to the needs of this country with its population increasing by more than 200,000 a year, because it seeks to keep open avenues of employment. [8.25] -The speech that honourable memany persons wbo find thembers have just heard is one of tbe most peculiar that has ever been delivered in this chamber. I hope that the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate) will learn a little about trade unionism and arbitration before he wastes the time of honourable members on matters of which he knows nothing. He has shown that he believes that the coal strike in 1949 was caused by the failure of the concilia-' tion commissioners to work efficiently. The honourable member did not even know that the conciliation commissioners who were appointed under the 1947 legislation had nothing to do with the coal strike. It was not a strike against decisions of the conciliation commissioners.",50,Cameron Literally Me Point Out To Honourable Members Again

He has endeavoured to explain to honourable members the meaning of the term "" closed shop"". Apparently he has read a threepenny pamphlet issued by some out-of-date European union authority. The honourable member appears to visualize the closed shop as a kind of ice-cream shop with the doors locked. The term merely means the system under which everybody working in a shop must be a member of a union. In no country where tbe closed shop operates do the unions concerned prevent people from joining the union if they wish to do so. The opposite is the effect. country, the term means that nnionists insist on everybody who works in an -industry joining the union. In any event, the point is unimportant, and need not be considered. The appeals system which the Government seeks to introduce gives to conciliation commissioners the right to provide in awards that employers shall be authorized to impose penalties upon their employees for disciplinary reasons. Under another provision strike-breakers and the like will be enabled to obtain entry to unions, even though the unions may consider that their admission would be detrimental to other members of the union. On the first point, in order to give the right of appeal against conciliation commissioners, the Government decided to give not one appeal but seven appeals. The first is under section 14A (2.), the second under 14A (3.), the third under 14A (5.), 31A (2.), the sixth under 31A (4.) and the seventh under 31A (6.). All may I did not say that be connected with the one matter. If each authority that deals with the seven separate appeals that are to be made possible by the bill takes as long to determine tbe appeal as Conciliation CommisI said that it was sioner Galvin took to determine the case that has caused so much trouble recently, seven years will elapse before a union can get a final decision on an appeal which may have originated before a conciliation commissioner. There would be nothing wrong with the principle of appeals if a system of appeals could be involved which would not impede the quick handling of disputes. What is wrong with the system of appeals proposed in the bill is that they unnecessarily impede the quick settlement of disputes. gentleman concede the principle of appeals from conciliation commissioners? always favour a system of appeals provided that the procedure was expeditious and would enable disputes to be settled quickly. But no such system of that kind has yet been evolved. The system that the Government proposes to set up under this bill will accentuate existing difficulties. My personal view is that a better way of getting from conciliation commissioners decisions that would be more in accordance with what people generally are thinking, would he to enable the conciliation commissioners at their quarterly meetings to review controversial awards made during the preceding three months. At such meetings, the conciliation commissioners, by majority vote, could pass judgment upon a particular decision of an individual conciliation commissioner. Alternatively, the Attorney-General could refer to the conciliation commissioners at such meetings any particular matter that he considered should be reviewed by them in the public interest; or, perhaps, the Chief Judge of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court could require the conciliation commissioners, when assembled at such meetings, to review a particular matter. Having made such a review, the conciliation commissioners",51,Cameron Literally Me Point Out To Honourable Members Again

One of the weaknesses of the Chifley legislation-it is well that we should cleanse that legislation of apparent faults-wa s that it provided opportunities for conciliation commissioners to procure advancement by giving decisions designed to please the government of the day rather than in accordance with their own conscience.

182,Mr Bowden,"It was inserted in the and breadth of Australia, and that undemocratic governmenit could possibly inflict upon any defaulter. Members of tbe present Opposition wept tears of blood because this Government provided in some of its recent measures forfinesof a few pence. Yet, governments which they supported imposed penalties offinesup to £1,000 a day for every day that an organization or an individual continued an offence. That is the kind of legislation that this measure seeks to amend. I trust that the Government will continue to merit the gratitude of the trade unions even though it may not win the approval of honourable members opposite who merely pretend to represent the interests of those organizations. [8.44] -The remarks of the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) were completely irrelevant to the measure before the Chair. He cited the Banking Act and also legislation under which he claimed fines up to £1,000 a day were imposed upon industrial organizations. This bill does not seek to amend the legislation to which he alluded. Its object is to establish a system of appeals quences of this legislation. I do not say from conciliation commissioners which must, inevitably, delay the settlement of disputes and thus impede industry. That honourable member, the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate) and the honourable member for Evans( Mr again in order to launch appeals against Osborne) know very well that employers take advantage of every opportunity precircumstances an appeal would not sented to them to delay the settlement of industrial disputes by having recourse to advanced by the honourable member forlitigation, and that such action disrupts industry and decreases production. I have no doubt that in advancing arguments that have nothing to do with the bill the honourable member for Gippsland believed that he was rigbt. The trouble with honourable members opposite, however, is that they ave suffering from tbe ignorance of which they accuse the Opposition. They do not know anything about this matter, because they have had nothing to do with the arbitration system. I and other honourable members on this side of the committee have had intimate associations with trade unions for a long time, and know the facts. The trade unions have always had available to tbem a system of secret ballots. Such. a system does not have to be forced onthem. That is why we object to legisla-tion that makes it mandatory for trade unions to take steps that they have always been able to take without compulsion The argument advanced by the honourable member for Gippsland was absurd,and I am sorry that he advanced it. It is just as well that the proceedings are : not being broadcast to-night, because people who understand the position, including some people who are closely associated with the honourable gentleman, would be rather disgusted if they heard the sort of statements that he has uttered. I venture to suggest that the fallaciousness of the argument of the honourable member for Macarthur has been exposed by the bonorable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey), who knows something about trade unions. It will surely not be denied that the honourable member for ' Bendigo, the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron), and I know at least something about arbitration procedure as a result of our experience. The honourable member for Bendigo has shown very effectively the possible consethat the legislation will always be deliberately used by interested parties to cause delay, but the fact remains that the opportunity is to be given to unscrupulous people to use it time and time decisions in cases in which, in ordinary lie. I subscribe to the view that was Hindmarsh, which, I understand, was his personal view, that a far better way of conducting a review of unsatisfactory decisions would be to have the conciliation commissioners meet together and discuss them. I understand that the conciliation commissioners now have quarterly meetings, but they probably only have a cup of tea together and make no decisions. Perhaps they are not even entitled to make decisions at such meetings. If any sort of review of decisions was to be provided for, it could have been provided for by meetings of the sixteen conciliation commissioners, at which they could decide on common action. We have the instance of Mr Findlay, the conciliation commissioner who believes quite",54,Cameron Literally Me Point Out To Honourable Members Again
183,,"Mr DRAKEFORD (Maribyrnong)differently from Mr Galvin. There are other similar instances. The honourable member for Macarthur has contended that more strikes have occurred since the Chifley legislation was passed in 1947 than occurred before that time. He merely made an allegation, but did not produce one fact or figure to substantiate it. I deny his allegation, which I consider to be completely untrue. It is ridiculous of him to say simply that the 1947 legislation has Ibeen productive of strikes. The effect of the legislation has been otherwise, as is 6hown by a report made by a commissioner and also by a statement that -appeared in a leading article in a newsipaper that cannot be said to favour the labour party's point of view. The article sappeared in the Melbourne Herald on the 37th April last and read in partIn its first six months, "" streamlined "" conwork for. ciliation dealt with about 500 industrial cases. In only five cf these were the commissioners' rulings flouted. The honourable member for Macarthur entirely ignored that. I do not think that he could ever convince anybody who bad given any thought to the matter that, his contention is right. I am sorry, as one of the people who were responsible for helping to frame the 1947 legislation, that, the Minister, who, I think, endeavours to be fair in his relationships with employers and employees, has been led into bringing down this bill. I am convinced that, ,as a result qf arguments that occurred probably within the Cabinet and his iparty, he has brought the bill down not of his own free will, but because he has behind him honourable members like the honourable member for Macarthur, who make foolish statements without supplying proof of their accuracy. ber agree that there are far too many strikes ? there are always too many strikes. The strike method should be adopted only :as a final resort when other methods have failed. I said in my second-reading :speechyesterday that I believe that a moral obligation rests on us to try to reach .a better understanding between employers and employees. I speak as a person who was an employee for a long time, and was also a representative of employees. I strove to do my best to produce such understanding. I consider that the provision that will make it mandatory for trade unions to admit as members persons whom they might consider to be unqualified and undesirable for membership is ridiculous and tyrannical. TJnder this clause a trade union will have to allow people to become members even though it may already have more members than can find work in the trade concerned. I believe that trade unions should admit suflicient members to meet the extremities of work offering from time to time, but it is ridiculous to suggest that trade unions like the waterfront unions, whose members are engaged in work that 'fluctuates in volume, should have to admit more members than there will be I have no wish to traverse the points that have been emphasized by the honourable member for Hindmarsh. I consider that he has expressed a point of view to which attention should be given. We have arrived at a state of affairs at which we could profitably discuss, with Government members who understand the needs of arbitration and the way in which it should function, the important problems that relate to it. We could get down to earth with them and try to reach the correct solutions. Clause 17 appears to be tyrannical in effect. To allow an employer to enforce a penalty, as is provided for in the clause, is to allow one party in a case before the court to fine a man-becaus e that is what it amounts to-withou t some arbitral tribunal having decided whether or not he is to blame. That is an entirely wrong principle, and I am quite sure, having heard the argument of the honourable member for Bendigo, and the arguments of other honourable members whom tbe Minister knows to be qualified to express an opinion, that the Minister must be very sorry that the legislation was brought down in this form. I am sorry to have to say that I believe that the legislation has been brought down at the dictation of the employers, who support the Government. In other words, the",55,Cameron Literally Me Point Out To Honourable Members Again

185,Mr Drakeford,"I think thatGovernment brought the legislation down in order to satisfy the interests that were responsible, by misrepresentations, for putting it in office in the first place. The Government has introduced the legislation and it now knows, if it did not know before, but should have known, that the measure is completely distasteful to the trade unions, which have always been willing that arbitration legislation should be amended if thereby it could be improved. The Labour Government's legislation in 1947 was introduced as a result of discussions with both the trade unions and the employers. In consequence, it functioned very well indeed. I do not wish to quote again and again statements that have been made, but the final paragraph orable gentleman's time has expired -industrial affairs that resides in the opponeeds of truth, justice, and common sense compel me to contribute to this debate. The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford) has been complaining of the statements of the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate), who had the temerity to suggest that the 1947 legislation has led to greater structive suggestion about the kind of and more frequent strikes than occurred before it was enacted. I believe that to be a plain fact. This is not the first or the second, but is tbe third time in the course of debates in this chamber that I have said that the 1947 legislation has failed. The strikes that have followed the Galvin award, and the dilemma in which the whole arbitration system finds itself as a result, provide tbe final proof of that failure. The honourable member for Maribyrnong has quoted from some newspaper in order to suggest that the system has worked beautifully. He also said that the report of one of the conciliation commissioners supports the newspaper's view. Perhaps the honourable gentleman would like to hear the uncomfortable words of the Chief Judge. I shall quote the actual words that the Chief Judge used in his fourth annual report. Perhaps the honourable member for Maribyrnong will concede greater authority to the Chief Judge of the Full Court of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court than to any one of the sixteen conciliation commissioners. The Chief Judge said in his fourth annual reportGoodwill in industry and the continued and' amicable operation of awards and orders made' in settlement of industrial disputes cannot' be said to have resulted from the present legislation. -If the honourable member for Maribyrnong were to make due allowance for the temperate nature of judicial statements he would be able to read a great deal into that simple sentence. ""What does the learned judge mean? He means that there has been a series of insoluble disputes as a ' result of the legislation. That is convincing evidence in support of my contention, which I repeat for the fourth time, that the 1947 legislation has failed. ""We might have hoped that, with all the wealth of experience in site side of the committee-and I pay due weight particularly to that of the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey)-the Opposition would have adopted a more constructive approach to this bill. So far, however, we have had no recognition from it that the 1947 system has failed. In addition, honourable members opposite have not made any conalteration that ought to be made to the system. Honourable members opposite, in general, seem to believe that the present system is all that can be desired. I propose to produce evidence to prove that it is not. The honourable member for Hindanarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) was the only honourable member opposite to admit that there might be anything wrong with the 1947 system. He even had his own suggestion for an improvement of it. The Government has found a moderate and temperate means for overcoming the worse faults of the existing legislation. The Government has been restrained in its approach to this matter. It has, in fact, leant over backwards in order to ensure that the creation of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), when he was Attorney-General in the Chifley Government, should not be dismembered any more than could possibly be helped.

Although the bill represents a decent, respectable attempt at reform, the Opposition does nothing but condemn it . The fact is that arbitration must not only be quick; it must also be sure. There is no point in an arbitration system which produces quick results if those results are not good. The whole basis of the argument advanced by honourable memhers opposite is that there is nothing wrong with the conciliation commissioner system. Anybody who has studied its operation over the last five years knows that their belief in its perfection is complete nonsense. The conciliation commissioners have been charged with a duty that they cannot perform, because they liave not the machinery to ensure that their orders and awards sball be carried out. About six months ago, in the course of a metal trades dispute, the Conciliation Commissioner, Mr Morrison, called both parties before h i m, and asked them to explain their attitude to current wage claims. The president of the Metal Trades Employers Association stated the attitude of his association, and, in doing so, made an important observation on the operations of conciliation commissioners. I propose to read the latter part of his statement first, so that it cannot be suggested that his expression of opinion is an attack on conciliation commissioners as such. He said thisThis is not said in criticism of Conciliation Commissioners, who are, after all, instruments of the Act which created them and clothed them with the powers they now have.

Each has reiterated the plea, 'Well, what do you expect me to do ?' Each has adopted the formula of requesting the parties to confer. In many cases the hearing has concluded with a statement by the Commissioner saying, ' I make no order, the case is adjourned sine die'"". In the many cases where the foregoing has not settled the dispute the Association's officers have had great difficulty in persuading a Conciliation Commissioner to relist a dispute and in some cases we have had blank refusals. The reason is that tbe conciliation commissioners have been charged with a duty which they cannot perform, because they have no power to do so. that position. degree: A conciliation commissioner may make an award, which, if it is ineffective, may be referred by either party to tbe P u l l Court.

I am a quiet and peaceful man by nature, but I answer, in kind, any interjection that is directed at inc when I am addressing the. Chair. I have represented the Australian Workers Union for many years before the arbitration tribunals. Arbitration is definitely the point of contact between employer and employee, and has brought about a conI n making siderable degree of industrial peace. Direct action was necessary before the establishment of arbitration tribunals, yet it was not so satisfactory to either employer or employee as the arbitration system has been. Almostf r o m time immemorial, the worker has been trying to get a reasonable share of the product of his labour. Tbere is the land, and the labour applied to the The arbitration land, which is the source of all our wealth. One honourable member has referred to a willin g worker willingl y taking a job with a willin g employer. The worker who was starving during tbe financial depression had to take a job w i th any kind of employer, not because he was willing, but because he had to live. Many employers in tliose times took great care to get the maximum work from the employee for the minimum payment. Let there be no mistake about the attitude of the employer. He has always tried to get as much as possible for as little as possible. Arbitration has formed the point of contact between employer and employee. The price of a worker's labour, which is the only commodity that he has to sell, is fixed, yet employers protest loudly at any suggestion that the prices of the goods and commodities required by the worker should be fixed. If the price of the worker's labour is fixed, the price of every commodity that he uses and consumes should be fixed. Until such a basis is reached, the state of industrial peace that we all desire will not be attained. Every concession The bonorable that has been gained by the workers bas been wrung from the employers. I remember the days before the introduction of workmen's compensation and unO r d e r j . I ask the employment insurance. A man, if he was injured in the mining industry, in which I was employed, died in the I was discussing the bush. No assistance was available to him. When an accident occurred, the employer was more concerned about whether his horses were injured than whether an employee had been hurt. However, conditions have improved since those days as a result of the efforts of the Labour party and the industrial unions. The principle of arbitration has been accepted. I was definitely in favour of direct action until members of the Australian Workers Union, by a two to one majority, decided",58,Cameron Literally Me Point Out To Honourable Members Again

195,Mr Bruce,"to adopt the arbitration method for tbe settlement of disputes. orable gentleman has had enough Mi. Chairman experience of parliamentary practice to know that, in the committee stage, he must relate his remarks to the clauses of the bill. He may not now make a second reading speech on the subject of arbitration. Mr Chairman, I have had sumcient experience of parliamentary procedure, but other speakers have wandered all over the country honourable mem her obey the ruling of the Beale, Chair? following the example of previous Brimblecombe, W. J. Leslie, H . A. speakers. I was astonished to find that, Cameron, Dr. Donald Lucock, P. E. in committee, such digressions were Casey, permitted by the Chair and I assumed Cramer, .T. O. that a similar privilege would be Dean, It . L . accorded to me. However, I shall direct Downer, A. R. my remarks to arbitration. Tbe first Drury, award of an industrial tribunal in QueensFailes, L . J. land was made under the Industrial Peace Fairhall, A . Act. That act, like this bill, was Freeth, introduced by a tory government, Grayden, W. L . and its principal provisions were Harrison, penal provisions. Tbe workers were Hasluck, P. M . to be punished if they did not obey the employer implicitly. Tbis bill is nearly as bad as was the old Industrial Peace Andrews, Act. For that reason, the Labour party is opposed to it . Opposition members Bourke, W.

I do not suggest for a moment that the intenMenzies, It. G. tions of the Government and the Minister Drummond, D. H . for Labour and National Service( Mr Howse. J. B.

NEW GUINEA TIMBE R Debate resumed from the 29th May '(vide page 1093), on motion by Mr and the only matter remaining to be deterHA8LCCK T h a t the b ill be now read a second t i m e . -The Minister for Territories ( Mr was holding out to obtain that control, Hasluck), in his second-reading speech, -said that the germ of the idea for * composite company originated with the Ohifley Government. It is quite true that that Government had considered for some time arranging a composite company for the development of the timber resources of the Bulolo Valley, but the proposals contained in this bill differ fundamentally from those that were -considered by the Labour Government of which I was a member. Therefore, I shall trace briefly the history of the -origin and development of this proposal. When I was Minister for External Territories in the Chifley Government, I recommended that a purely government company should be formed to develop these timber resources. That government adopted the recommendation; but subsequently, because it was anxious to -develop those resources quickly in order to meet the needs of the Australian Griffiths, C. H . Huylcn, L . C. . market, it appointed a departmental subJames, K. committee which recommended that cerKeon, S. M . tain changes be made in my original McLeod, D. proposal. That committee advised that there would be difficulty in obtaining the Mulcahy, D. necessary machinery and staff and also in providing facilities for timber workers Peters. E. W. in the territory. However, Bulolo Gold Pollard. R. T. Dredging Limited, which was operating Thompson. A .

E. .Tames .Tohnson. H . V. in order to obtain quick results, that Government compromised and adopted Riordan. W. .T. P. the recommendation of its departmental Kosevear, .T. S. sub-committee. When the Chifley Government was defeated at the general election towards the end of 1949, its negotiations with Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited had advanced to a stage at which sample logs had been sent to Canada to be tested mined was the control of the directorate of the proposed composite company. Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited whereas the Chifley Government considered that the Commonwealth should retain it. It had proposed that any matter over which a dispute arose and which could not be resolved by negotiation was to he decided in favour of the Government. Provision along those lines is made in this bill, but the general conditions that are now offered to the company are considerably more generous than were any that the Chifley Government ever considered. That Government proposed that after a period of years the Commonwealth should have the option of acquiring the interests of Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited under this agreement. No provision of that kind is contained in this bill. On the contrary, the rights that are to be accorded to the company are to be granted to it in perpetuity. It is true that provision is made for the issue of permits to",66,Pairs
234,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [10.16].,"the company in respect of each ten-year period. Nevertheless, the Government may continue to issue such permits even after the lapse of 50 years, by which time new timber will have matured. Consequently, unless the agreement is eventually cancelled, the Government will not be able to secure complete control of the industry. Such a step would no doubt involve the Commonwealth in payment of heavy compensation. That is a very great concession to give to the company, which, I admit, would have been placed in a privileged position to a lesser degree even if the Chifley Government had been able to complete its agreement. The only qualification that is now provided for in this respect is that if either party decides to sell its interest under the agreement the other party shall be advised of that intention and shall have the option of purchasing that interest. But I believe that the venture will prove to be so profitable that it will be most unlikely that the company will ever desire to give up its right under the agreement. The Opposition approves of certain provisions of the agreement. For instance, we believe that wherever timber-getting work is undertaken, either in Australia or in the Territories, provision should be made for reafforestation. The regeneration of forests in Papua and New Guinea, as is provided for under this bill, would have been assured in the negotiations that took place between the Chifley Government and the company. Full credit for that provision must be accorded to Mr of that road are expensive items. I McAdams, who is in charge of the forestry section of the Papua and New Guinea Administration. He is a competent oflicer and has always been concerned primarily with the preservation and exploitation of the resources of the territory for the benefit of the territory itself. ""When the Chifley Government was negotiating with Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited, the Australian market wa3 urgently in need of timber and timber products. However, the position has changed. The existence of the Australian industry will be threatened by the establishment of this company unless certain protective provisions are included in the agreement. Ur. Ward. The industry in this country has been developed to a high state of efficiency and now employs approximately 40,000 workers, whilst approximately £3,000,000 has been invested in it. Australian timber mills have been developed and improved. The Chifley Government set out to develop the industries in the territory-in which respect that Government was vastly different from this Government-o n the hasis that such industries should be non-competitivewith similar industries on the mainland, in which rates of pay and standards of employment are much higher than are those that operate in the territory. The Chifley Government, after consultation with the'trade unions concerned, which co-operated with it, decided that the Australian market was not to be threatened with extinction by the influx into Australia of cheaply produced timber from the industry in thc territory. I shall mention other concessions that are to he given to Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited under this measure in order to show that this agreement is not identical with that which the Chifley Government sought to negotiate. With the exception of the provision for the formation of a composite company, no semblance of similarity exists between the two proposals. When the Chifley Government went out of office, it had actually discussed with the company a proposal to place a toll on users of the road from Bulolo to Lae. The construction and maintenance should say that its construction, which was undertaken for military purposes during the recent war and its maintenance have already involved this country in an expenditure of over £1,000,000. Although the road is only 97 miles long, it is estimated that its maintenance will cost £70,000 annually. TJnder the agreement contained in this 'bill, the Government will meet that cost. Consequently, under that agreement, the company will benefit in this respect not only from its timber operations but also from its mining operations, for which purpose it will have free use of this road for the handling of supplies. Thus, under the agreement, Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited will not be required to make a sumcient contribution to tbe development of tbe territory. Up to date, it has taken enormous wealth out -of the territory. This agreement is far "".too generous to it. The Government is -to construct two bridges on the road from Bulolo to Lae which now ends on the -southern side of the Markham Eiver, from nvhich point transport to Lae is by water. I shall be interested to hear from the Minister what is the estimated cost of the construction of those bridges. It is clear rthat the company will receive valuable benefits out of all proportion to the contribution it will make to the development -of the timber industry. The Australian timber industry will be threatened with extinction as a Tesult of the provisions that are made in the agreement with respect to customs -duties. The Parliament should take steps to obviate that possibility. The Labour party believes in the establishment in the territories of industries that are necessary for their development and progress but, at the same time, it has always insisted that the products of industries that are based on the employment of cheap labour should not be allowed to compete with Australian industries. Therefore, honourable members will be astonished to note that under the bill the Government proposes, in effect, to refund to the company in the form of a subsidy all collections of customs duty in respect of timber exported from the territory to Australia. timber industry will not be greatly protected by that provision. The industry in the territory is much more favourably situated than is the industry in Australia. In the territory, mills are situated nearer to sources of supply, and even though the company will be confronted with transport difficulties it will enjoy so great an advantage through the employment of native labour that it will be enabled to flood the Australian market with cheap labour products. The Australian trade unions concerned proposed to the Chifley Government that, wherever possible, timber should be brought to the Australian market in tbe log whenever Australian mills were not working to capacity. Many employees are at present unemployed, and the union says it is quite prepared to support any proposal to develop the timber industry in the territory if the timber is to be brought to Australia in the log. They recognized that, in respect of the Bulolo Valley, the industry for the manufacture of plywood should be established in the territory itself because of transport difficulties. At the same time, however, it contended that the complete manufacture of plywood in the territory should be limited to meet local requirements only and that veneers should be exported to Australia to give employment to Australian workmen engaged in the plywood industry. The conditions and provisions that were discussed by the Chifley Government are completely different from those now being discussed by the present Government, because no provision for the protection of the Australian industry is contained in this agreement. The question of taxation also arises. As honourable gentlemen are aware, no income tax is paid in the territories. Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited is paying tax on its gold production, but the contribution that it is making to the development of tbe territories is far out of proportion to the profits that it is earning as a result of its activities in the area. I consider that the Government has not given to the Australian industry the protection that it ought to be given. We have a very active timber workers' union in Australia. The workers in tbe timber industry in Queensland are Clearly, the Australian covered by the Australian Workers Union. Timber workers in Western Australia are covered by two State unions, and in the remainder of the States by the Australian Workers Union. As a result of the activities of those unions, conditions for workers in the industry in Australia have been greatly improved. The unions have thus helped to maintain what are known as Australian industrial standards. That situation does not exist in the territory, where native labour is available for payment of 15s. a month a head, with rations provided. That labour is much cheaoer than the labour that can be obtained in Australia, where working conditions are much higher than they are in New Guinea. Some day in the future, no doubt as industries are developed in the territory, the Australian trade union movement will take a greater interest in the territory and will he able to protect the interests not only of the European workers, hut also of native labour. That protection, however, does not exist at present, and so Australian workers require to watch very closely the operation of this agreement. Not only members of the Labour party and of trade unions ean see the danger to the Australian industry that the agreement holds. Australian plywood manufacturers are also unanimously opposed to it, because they realize that it will mean the destruction of the Australian industry. It is true that the plywood manufacturers did not display as much interest as they might have displayed during the war period in helping the Chifley Government to develop the timber industry in the territory. A t that time their mills were working full time, and they were able to dispose of all their production. In consequence, tbey were not interested to any great degree in extending their operations into the territories. They wanted conditions from the Labour government of the day which it was not prepared to concede to them. But now the Australian plywood manufacturers can see the dangers implicit in the agreement, to the Australian industry and the continued employment of Australian workmen in it. Therefore, I say that, whilst the Labour party recognizes the need for the development of the industry in the territory, it is not satisfied with the provisions in the bill and the arguments advanced by the Government for acceptance of it by the Parliament. It is not correct to say that this is the same sort of agreement as the Chifley Labour Government would have entered into with this company. I have already shown how it differs in vital respects from any agreement that the Chifley Government would have entered into. To sum up, it can be said that the Chifley Government decided not to give the company the timber rights in perpetuity, and not to bear the full cost of maintenance of the road to Bulolo from Lae, or the cost of constructing bridges over two rivers. This agreement provides for more generous terms and conditions than were ever proposed by .the Labour Jfr. Ward. Government. Therefore, the Labour party will propose an amendment to the hill so that this matter may be further considered, and in order that employees and employers in the Australian industry will have an opportunity to have their views taken into consideration before the matter is finalized. I move, thereforeThat all words after ""That"" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:"" the proposals contained in the bill be referred to an all-party committee of mcmbers of thia House for inquiry and report"". If the Government agrees to the establishment of such a committee it will not mean the abandonment of this proposal to establish a composite authority. It will merely mean a delay in the implementation of the agreement, so Uiat other aspects of the matter can be considered. In otber words, not only the employees, but also the employers, will be able to ask the Government to include in the agreement provisions that will ensurethat the Australian, timber industry sball be protected against unfair competition as a result of the development of a timber industry in a territory in which an abundance of cheap labouris available. I hope that the amendment will be carried. I support the agreement which the bill is designed to make effective. For the benefit of those honourable members who are really interested! in the matter, I propose to outline, briefly, some of the major terms of the agreement, and I hope to be able to answer, limited though my knowledge may be, some of the objections that the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr. Ward) has raised. I wish to make it clear from the beginning that I do not agree with his amendment. An agreement has been made, between the Commonwealth and Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited, for the purpose of harvesting the wonderful stands of timber in the Bulolo Valley that lie in close proximity to, and, in fact, that surround the site of the company's operations. I stress the fact that tbe stands are located in New Guinea. As I have explained to the House on previous occasions, the Territory of New Guinea and Papua is",67,Agreement Bill 1952 Second Reading
235,Mr Timson (Higinbotham) [10.37]..,"-divided into two parts. Papua is Australian territory but tbe mainland of New Guinea, New Britain, Bougainville and the islands of various archipelagos are held by Australia under trust to the United Nations. I ask the House to bear that fact in mind, because it is very important. these timber stands is, according to the Minister's statement, about 40,000 acres. I have seen these stands and have examined them as closely as was possible on two brief visits to the dredging company's place of operation. They are in some of the wildest country that I have seen in New Guinea, and I am not without experience of New Guinea country. The timber is growing, strange to say, on the most precipitous slopes imaginable, in rough, bouldery country. In this connection I refer to the statement of the honourable member for I consider that replanting is almost impossible in the area in which the timber is growing. One of the first things that I did after reading the terms of the agreement was to approach the Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck) and ask him about the plans for re-afforestation, because I consider that it would be most difiicult to undertake re-afforestation Nations. in the places where the timber is at present standing. I am pleased to say that I received an assurance from him that the plans provide for replanting, where necessary, in areas other than tbe actual places from which the timber is to be taken. The estimated yield of the stands will be about 500,000,000 super, feet of timber. That is a tremendous amount of timber in Australian terms, although it is not considered to be a great amount in Canada and other parts of the world, such as Scandinavia. It is a high-quality timber, and is to be harvested at the rate of 10,000,000 super, feet a year over a period of 50 years. The activities of the company will embrace logging, milling, manufacture, but the Government will retain ultimate control over the general policy of the company, although the detailed management will remain under the control of the company, as would be the case if it were entirely a private enterprise. The board of directors of the joint company will comprise two representatives of the Commonwealth and two representatives of the dredging company. The honourable member for East Sydney explained that the Government, The area covered by under the present terms, cannot take over full control of this timber venture. I a3k him now why it should do so. If 1 were a director of this hard-boiled and most emcient company, Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited, and found that one of the terms of the company's contract with the Government was that the company's interests in the venture would lapse after ten or twenty years, I would tell the Government to go and jump in the lake. Some people have asked why the Goverument should participate in this venture. That is a valid question, East Sydney on afforestation. because the Government, and we who support it, do not generally support governmental participation in ventures in which private enterprise can do the job itself. The circumstances in New Guinea, however, are entirely different from those in Australia. AgainI re-iterate that this territory is held by us under trust to the United been placed in trust. I consider that the fact that the Government is participating in this venture will protect us from criticism that may be made against Australia, opportunities for which are definitely being sought by those who have no love for this country. That is an important point. Another reason why the Government should participate in this venture is that it will thereby encourage the development of New Guinea, and promote confidence among people who have definite ideas about starting new ventures in the territory, but who consider that the future security of New Guinea is not peeling, veneer and plywood altogether assured. I am interested in the future of New Guinea, as other honourable members should be, and I know of large firms in Melbourne that have become interested in certain developments there, but tbey consider that risking great amounts of capital in ventures in",70,Agreement Bill 1952 Second Reading
236,Mr Gullett,It never should have,71,Agreement Bill 1952 Second Reading
237,Mr Timson,"That may be so, butNew Guinea would be an unwise, or at least, uncertain action at the moment. I am sure that government participation of this kind will encourage such people to invest capital in New Guinea. For instance, I know of firms which are very interested in the growing of kenaf fibre in New Guinea. It has been proved that it can be grown most successfully tbere. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture will agree with me that we were fortunate to obtain enough jute bags and wool packs from India for our primary products last season. The kenaf can ultimately take the place of jute, and, therefore, the development of that industry is most important. Prominent firms are becoming increasingly interested in growing on a large scale, coffee, cocoa and other products, but they also feel that the future of such a venture is uncertain. Government participation in this case is the most d:'rect and simple way by which to ensure that the interests of both the territory and Australia will be served, and the needs of the Australian consumer met. Eeferenee has been made to the necessity to protect the Australian market against a flood of imports from the territory. I am confident that the Government's share in formulating the policy of the company will ensure that Australia's interests will be protected in every respect. member for East Sydney was good enough It is not intended that the products of this venture shall flood the Australian market to the detriment of our local industries. The fact that the Government has a controlling interest in the policy of the company is a suflicient guarantee that the local market will' be safeguarded. ""Would any government, through its own activities in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea be so unwise as to act to the great detriment of a firmly established industry in Australia? I am sure that it would not so act. Clause5 of the agreement reads as follows:The assurance of the supply to the Australian market of plywood and other products similar to those of the Timber Company is fundamental to this Agreement. Some persons may claim that it is a one-way arrangement. with the chairman of the Plywood Industry Board of Australia about the matter. It seems that tbe Australian Ur. Timson. plywood industry would be most satisfied if it could receive supplies of veneer madefrom the hoop and klinkii pine. If I were a manufacturer, I should be> fully content to be assured of definite and regular supplies of fineveneer at a most reasonable price for themanufacture of my plywood. New Guinea could probably provide considerable quantities of veneer. It is quite right that the company should! manufacture plywood in the territory.. We must look after the requirements of."" the territory in that respect, and I can see no harm in permitting the company to ship to Australia such limited quantities of plywood as would not be suflicient to upset the local market, and, where necessary, quantities of this very desirableveneer. From my own experience of thetimber trade, I can assure the House that there is a ready market for the veneers overseas, particularly in Canada and the Tjnited States of America. Therefore-, the Australian market need not be swamped with veneers from the territory,, to the detriment of Australian manufacturers, because a market will always exist for them elsewhere. It is hardly necessary for me to discuss the qualifications of Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited to do the job in New Guinea under this agreement. The honourable to concede its capabilities in that respect. Any other firm which proposed to enter into the timber business in the territory would be confronted witb tremendous difliculties. I shall mention quickly some of the facilities available to the company that are already established as a part of its going concern at Bulolo. The company has hydro-electric power. I have looked over this installation, and have seen where the water is drawn from the streams and runs, in races, or channels, round the mountain sides. Some of those races are many miles long. The water is carried down through shutes to the generating plants and turbines. All the available suitable water that can be used for the generation of power has been harnessed. It is a wonderful organization. I have spoken The races round tbe mountain sides take six or seven years to set and become permanent in that country. There are turbines and generators, and power is distributed over a wide area. Bulolo is a splendid township which, strangely, is always referred to ias a camp. Apparently, the mining term is applied to the settlement, but it is a township in every sense of the word. Bulolo is the show town of the territory. It is the first town to be completely rehabilitated since tbe end of ""World ""War II . I do not think that any otber town in tbe territory has yet been completely rehabilitated. The houses at Bulolo are well built; indeed, they are quite the best-consfcruated dwellings in New Guinea. Gardens have been established, and many amenities, including a theatre, a hospital and recreaanother 24 miles of road would need to be tion facilities, are provided. The most important consideration of all is that the company has great workshops which are capable of dealing with big engineering problems. One matter that I sbould not overlook is that the company has already established a small timber mill. I sball not make further reference to Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited other than to say that it is recognized as a most efficient company. The honourable member for East Sydney referred to the proposal for the construction of a bridge over the Markham Eiver. He said that tbe Labour Government, in which be was Minister for External Territories, decided that the construction and the maintenance of the road which gives access from Bulolo to the port of Lae was the responsibility of the company. I cannot see any sense in that idea, because the road, which serves the company, also runs to Wau, and serves a number of other interests, including those of the Administration. I direct the attention of the House to the fact that the responsibilities of the Government, under the terms of the agreement, include the construction and maintenance of the road from the timber site to the port of Lae, and the construction of the bridge over the Markham Eiver. The recommendation of the Administration is that the bridge should be placed at Markham Point, from which the road to Lae runs up to the Bulolo Valley round foothills of a most jagged nature. A long distance of the road is referred to locally as tbe Bends. Many of those bends will have to be straightened if heavy timber vehicles are to use the road. The suggestion was made to me on two occasions when I was in New Guinea recently, and it has been made to me also in Canberra, that Markham Point, where the Administration's experts consider the bridge should be constructed, is the wrong place for it. Local opinion is strongly in favour of a site at Kirkland's Crossing, which is situated approximately 20 miles further up the Markham Eiver. If the bridge were built there, the road would lead up the valley through splendid flat or gently undulating fertile land at Zenag, which has a wonderful future from the developmental stand-point. Only constructed, and I firmly believe that it would open up some most desirable land. I commend that suggestion to the Minister, and hope that he will ask the Administration's experts to reconsider their views. The whole valley could be supplied with power from Bulolo. Such a development, in itself, would be novel in New Guinea. All the authorities, and persons who think deeply on tbese matters, are agreed that the territory must be developed as expeditiously as possible. I have always considered that, in the past, Australia has regarded the Territory of Papua and New Guinea from a strategic rather than an economic standpoint. We should realize now, and I am sure that we do so in view of recent developments to the north of Australia, that those two interests must go hand in hand. I regalrd this agreement as a definite step in the development of the territory, which is so urgently required, and I give my full support to the measure. I see no merit whatever in the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for East Sydney. Mr W. M. BOURKE (Eawkner) [10.55] -The honourable member for Higinbotham ( Mr Timson) said that he was interested in the development of New Guinea, and expressed the hope that all honourable members were also interested in the matter. I fully agree with his statement. We all should be interested in the development of New Guinea, and I think that we are all interested in it. New Guinea, which is like a big umbrella over the north of Australia, is of vital significance to us from the defence standpoint. It has vast potentialities and resources. 1,500,000 natives in the territory, and we have a great responsibility to them to improve their standard of living, and to bring to them the benefits of civilization, such as education and medical faciligreat deal, but to the taxpayers it is a lot ties. It is unfortunate that the administration in New Guinea has been compelled, because of lack of finance in recent money for expenditure in connexionyears, to reduce the medical services that have been available to the natives. The native population should be innoculated honourable gentleman must discuss the bill, which is to ratify an agreement between the iCommonwealth and Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited, with respect to the formation of a company to be known as Commonwealth-New Guinea Tim'bers Limited. Mr W. M . BOURKE I submit that we ean consider this bill in its true perspective only if we examine the general background of the development of New Guinea. I desire to make some point3 briefly ahout the operations of Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited in the territory, and in order to do so, I must examine the expenses that are being incurred by the administration, and make some comments on the revenue which should be obtained under the proposed agreement. In order to make those points, I must examine the expenditure that the administration incurs in New Guinea. accept the honorahle gentleman's submission. The purpose of this hill is to approve the agreement between the Commonwealth and the company. Mr W. M . BOURKE I bow to your ruling, Mr Speaker, but I assume that I shall be permitted to discuss the economic potentialities of New Guinea. In doing so, I shall make a passing reference to the necessity to provide medical and educational facilities for the native population. That subject involves the general policy of the administration in preserving the agricultural plots of the natives, and. that involves the policy in respect of land settlement and land alienation. Much money is being expended upon the administration of those matters. I notice, from the relevant reports, that There are approximately the Commonwealth made a grant of £4,549,167 to the Territory of Papua and! New Guinea in the last financial yearAccording to the way we speak about money in this Parliament that is not a-, of money. They are contributing it to the development of New Guinea. If it iswith the welfare of the natives, it is a very worthy and proper expenditure. However, we must consider whether we should get a return from the money that The we invest in New Guinea, and if so, what it should be. New Guinea has vast natural resources and potentialities.. As the honourable member for Higinbotham rightly pointed out, many eropswhich cannot be grown satisfactorily in Australia are being developed in New Guinea. The production possibilities of Newr Guinea should be very carefully considered by honourable members because a big economic problem to-day is to. balance payments and to organize industry so that we shall export enough goods to pay for the imports of materials that are necessary to maintain our standard' of living. It is most important that we should increase our production of the goods that can be exported, particularly primary products, and also endeavour toreplace with Australian-produced goods some of the goods that we are at present importing. Therefore, New Guinea can make a very important contribution to thesolution of our economic problems. Aswell as timber, New Guinea can produce kunai fibre, which is a substitute for jute r cocoa, rice and coffee. If those crops can be produced in sufficient quantities to* satisfy the needs of Australia, we shall not have to import such items from foreign countries. New Guinea could therefore make a direct contribution to the development and welfare of Australia. I understand that there are difficulties about the type of labour needed toharvest tea, and that it may not be possible to produce in New Guinea all the tea that Australia requires. However, to offset that, we may cherish a hope that in the not-far-distant future, we shall be obtaining that all-important product of modern times, oil.",71,Agreement Bill 1952 Second Reading
238,Mr Speaker,Order!,74,Agreement Bill 1952 Second Reading
239,Mr Speaker,"Order! I cannotgiven the honourable member a lot of latitude. The leave granted by the House for the introduction of this bill was for the purpose of debating an agreement made between the Australian Government and Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited. The honourable member is straying outside the scope of the leave granted. Mr W. M. BOURKE I bow to your ruling, Mr Speaker. If the natural resources of New Guinea are to be developed, commercial enterprises must undertake the task. Then we must consider the contribution those commercial enterprises should make to the revenues of the territory so that the Australian people will not have to subscribe more money than is necessary. We must also consider the return the people will get for the valuable privileges given to companies to develop' New Guinea's natural resources. Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited is a company incorporated in British Columbia, and its capital has been primarily subscribed by overseas investors. I agree witb tbe sentiments expressed by the honourable member for Higinbotham that this concern has a very good reputation, operates in a very efficient manner, treats its employees particularly well and has a good all-round reputation. I have not seen the area in which the company operates, as has the honourable member for Higinbotham, and I suggest to the Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck) that it is most important that all honourable members of this House should have an opportunity of witnessing the operations of companies such as this one, which are carrying out work of great significance in our territories. The Minister has arranged for a small delegation of members of both sides of the House to visit New Guinea, and another small delegation to visit the Northern Territory. .1 consider that such visits should not be regarded by any means as pleasure jaunts, but as an integral part of the duty of honourable members to obtain an intimate and first-hand knowledge of our own territories. I hope that the Minister will give opportunities to all honourable members who desire to visit the territories to do so, in order that they may get to know the problems, possibilities and potentialities of the areas. Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited is a very large company, with a capital of 6,000,000 dollars, which is divided into 1,200,000 shares of 5 dollars each, of which 1,000,000 shares have been issued. I draw the attention of tbe House to some of the financial affairs of this company to prove that it is not making anything like an adequatecontribution to the revenues of New Guinea. Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited has built up enormous resources, and the assets side of its balance-sheet shows that in current assets-that is, cash in hand and stores and supplies-it has 2,914,2S6 dollars. It also has an amortization fund of 3,420,522 dollars. In that fund is 819,730 dollars worth of Commonwealth bonds. On that investment the company pays Australian income tax of 18,546 dollars. The significant thing about thesefiguresis that, with all its vast ramifications, it pays a miserable 18,546 dollars in Australian income tax. It draws the enormous income of more than 1,000,000 dollars a year in income from New Guinea, but makes an insignificant contribution to our revenues. The contribution that it does make comes only from taxation on its large investment in Commonwealth bonds. I suggest that that is a quite improper state of affairs. This large company, which has built up tremendous assets through its operations in the territories of the Commonwealth, which is controlled from overseas, and the capital of which is all foreign, is putting very little into this country. If the company is to be allowed to exploit our natural resources it should put something back into our territories, and into the Australian revenues, because our taxpayers are called upon to make a substantial contribution towards the development of New Guinea. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) pointed out that roads and bridges are to be built in the vicinity of the forest timber stands. Presumably the money for those works will come from Commonwealth revenue grants to the territory, or from the revenues of the territory itself. Australian taxpayers will be astounded when they learn that",74,Agreement Bill 1952 Second Reading
240,Mr Speaker,"Order! I liavethe Government intends to spend money in New Guinea to enable this large private company to exploit the resources of New Guinea and to take vast sums of money out of the territory. When I read the report of the General Assembly of the Tjnited Nations on the Administration of the Territory of New Guinea, I was interested to learn what revenues are derived from New Guinea by gold-mining concerns. Although the amount of gold won in New Guinea last year was 87,593 fine ounces valued at £1,356,962, the revenue derived by the Commonwealth from royalties amounted to only £67,844. Now Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited is to be invited to engage in another big commercial enterprise from which it will derive further enormous profits, but it will continue to contribute very little to our revenues. Before this measure is allowed to pass, the Government should consider the general taxation policy regarding the territories of the Commonwealth. If the Government intends to encourage big commercial enterprises to take over in this way our natural resources, which are very valuable and which belong to the people of and the territory, it must reconsider its general taxation policy in the territory and decide that such big concerns should no longer enjoy the amazing privilege of not having to pay income tax. This taxation anomaly has been allowed to exist for too long and it is time that it was remedied. Great commercial enterprises, no matter where their capital -comes from, should be taxed. failure to tax these concerns is .intolerable and unjustifiable, and before the -Government proceeds any further with this matter it should re-examine taxation in the territories and introduce legislation to impose taxes on these commercial wealth committee on taxation was set up last year by the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) considered the matter of exemptions which certain companies, including Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited, enjoyed, and stated that concessions of this nature are not justified because the Income Tax Assessment Act is an unsuitable place in which to make Ur. W. M. Bourke. them. The committee then referred to the concession that taxpayers resident in Papua, New Guinea and Norfolk Island enjoy, and suggested that it be abolished. I believe that the people desire that the Government shall review its taxation policy and formulate a sane and sensible new policy before it proceeds with this scheme. I suggest to the Minister for Territories that an allowance be made to individual taxpayers in the territories in recognition of the disadvantages of uncongenial climatic conditions, isolation and high costs of living to which they are subject. A zone allowance of £2,000 per annum for individual taxpayers would be reasonable. However, great corporations, sucb as Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited, and Placer Development Limited, an international organization witb tremendous capital assets which has a large shareholding in Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited, should be placed on' the same footing as companies that operate in Australia. The fact that these organizations make no contribution to tbe revenue constitutes a grave anomaly. It is one reason why the Opposition urges that the Government's proAustralia posal in this bill should be further investigated. We should be prepared to reconsider the plan in a more favorable light if the Government removed the anomaly. We do not believe that a powerful corporation should have the right to take advantage of vast natural resources in New Guinea without making suitable contributions to its revenue that could be used for its development and the advanceTbe ment of native welfare. purpose of the amendment that the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) has proposed to the motion for the second reading of this bill to approve the agreement between the Australian enterprises. The CommonGovernment and Bulolo Gold Dredging that Limited for the formation of a company to be known as Commonwealth-New Guinea Timbers Limited, is merely to delay tbe project by referring it to a select committee of this House, which would be tantamount to relegating it to the limbo of forgotten things. I cannot imagine that any company of the status of Bulolo Gold",75,Agreement Bill 1952 Second Reading
241,Mr Failes (Lawson) [11.18],"Th eDredging Limited, having concluded an agreement with a responsible government, would be content to allow that agreement to be deferred pending the making of inquiries by a .select committee which, after devoting months to its investigations, might produce a negative recommendation. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr W. M . Bourke) supports tbe amendment, I assume, though for some time. I thought that he might support the bill straight out. I am pleased to know that he agrees that tbe development of New Guinea is a matter of vital importance, both for the purposes of defence and the general welfare of the territory. The exploitation of the timber resources of the Bulolo area will require operations on a scale that we, with our knowledge of local timbers, cannot readily appreciate. The timber that was originally cut in the hinterland of New South Wales was chopped down with the axe, snigged with horses, dragged over a pit, and then sawed by two men, one operating above and one operating below the logs. That timber was used to construct many houses that are still standing. The evolution of the circular saw improved timber-milling methods considerably, and further development occurred gradually in tbe coastal regions where the timber is larger than the timber inland, so"" that to-day many large saw-mills are in operation. However, these undertakings will be dwarfed into insignificance by the magnitude of the project that will be undertaken in the forests of New Guinea, which are well known to many honourable members. Some of us have seen timber felled there. I saw one tree 150 feet high with a girth of about 25 feet. What a tremendous task it will be to fell such timber, clean the tops, snig it, load it, drag it. to the mill and finally put it over the saw bench! The job will be beyond comparison with anything of the nature that is being done on the mainland. We must realize that this unusual operation cannot be gauged by ordinary standards. Although the Opposition has refused to give its whole-hearted support to the bill, we know that the project will be accorded an enthusiastic reception in New Guinea. The people of the territory realize that the undertaking will be one' of the most important developmental works so far launched in New Guinea. I know, from personal conversations that I have had with men who have lived most of their lives in the territory, that they heartily approve of the proposal to form a timber milling company. They know that Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited is a sound organization with vast resources that it can bring to bear on tbe project. I suggest that the honourable member for East Sydney has moved his amendment deliberately for the purpose of deferring action. During tbe last few years, since the debacle of Manus Island, millions of pounds bave been poured into New Guinea without producing any worthwhile results. That waste must be stopped, and the establishment of the proposed company to undertake milling operations in the Bulolo district will stop it. The development of this work will enrich the territory and help to reinforce it as a bastion of defence on which we shall be able to depend in the event of war im the future. It is a commercial venture that will pay for itself. The honourable member for East Sydney obviously intends to obstruct the plan,, because most of the propositions that hehas submitted could be settled here and now. Many honourable members are well acquainted with conditions in New Guinea, and they are competent to deal with the honourable member's proposalswithout further delay. He. said that, when the original plan to develop and exploit New Guinea's timber resources was prepared, the Australian timberindustry needed assistance, but that circumstances had changed. In fact, hedeclared that the development of this New Guinea undertaking would threaten the Australian industry. The Tariff Board's report on timber,, which is dated the 29th November, 1951,. contains interesting information on this subject which flatly contradicts the statements of the honourable member for East Sydney. The board stated tbe followingconclusions in its report:The volume of imports has increased to a level exceeding that of the average of the threepre-war years, but the increase has not been at the expense of local production, which has also increased. Total available supplies still do not meet the demand, and the indications aretliat imports could reach a much greater total without constituting a real threat to the Australian sawmilling industry. The full effect of the widespread fires which have occurred and are still occurring iu New South Wales and Queensland cannot yet be judged, but they must have an influence in diminishing Australian production. On account of high overseas prices and high ocean freight rates the selling prices in Australia of imported timber, even when admitted at concessional rates under By-law, are substantially higher than the selling prices of local timber. Those conclusions are supported by statistics that it published in an appendix to the report. The ngures show that, in 1946-47, the first year in which active timber-milling was f u l l y resumed after ""World War II . , Australia produced 1,049,000,000 super, feet of timber. Tbe apparent consumption in that year was 1,159,000,000 super, feet. increased to 1,253,000,000 super, feet in 1950-51, but, over the same period, consumption increased to super, feet. Apparent consumption per capita increased over the same period from 153 to 194 super, feet. There is no indication that the demand for timber is slackening. In fact, the complaints that we hear in this Housef r o m time to time about the shortage of houses indicate that the demand is increasing rapidly. A reliable authority on timber has warned us that the supply of timber available in Australia for plywood manufacture is diminishing rapidly. Already we are importing logs from Borneo, and, in tbese circumstances, a new source of supply w ill be generally welcomed. On the facts that I have stated, I cannot agree w i th the honourable member for East Sydney that the New Guinea venture w i i l threaten the Australian industry. The evidence indicates, on the contrary, that the Australian industry w ill welcome the availability of New Guinea timber. The honourable gentleman referred to the proposed new road and assumed that it would serve only Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited. acquainted with the territory knows that the road will serve Wau. I support the suggestion of the honourable member for Higinbotham posed bridge be constructed at Perkins Crossing, because residents of the territory hold the same view. The construcMr Failes. tion of a bridge at that site w ill open up an area of rich country extending for 30 or 40 miles up the Markham Valley and into the Nadzab area and an area extending into the Ramu Valley and across the dividing range on the other side of it . The road is necessary for the proper development of the territory generally and not only for the area in which Bulolo Gold DredgingL i m i ted is interested. The honourable member for East Sydney has told us that the previous proposition was that the company should build the road and, I believe, that a toll should be imposed which would have the efTect of off-setting the cost of construction. I understand that the toll was to be 2s. 6d. a ton. Each year 10,000,000 super, feet of timber w ill be milled in this forest. It is improbable Production that all of that timber w ill be despatched by this road, but let us assume that it w ill be. If tbe toll were charged at the 1,613,000,000 rate of 2s. 6d. a ton, the yearly revenue derived from the timber would be £2,500. That sum would be hardly suflicient to repair a small section of the road, and certainly it would not be suflicient to maintain the whole of the road in good order. Clause9 of the ageement states(1.) The Commonwealth will continue to improve the road between Bulolo and Lae until it is brought to a reasonably trafficable condition, and thereafter will continue to maintain the road in that condition. (2.) The Commonwealth will use its best endeavours to complete the building of the Markham and Mumeng bridges before the Timber Company commences the production of plywood. I suggest that, as the road is necessary for the development of considerably more than the part of the country in which Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited is in terested, it should be constructed in any event. We cannot take for granted that cheap native labour w ill be used in this venture. I have been informed by residents of New Guinea that native labour is not But anybody who is well cheap. It is true that such labour does not cost very much in terms of cash expended upon wages, but it is, in fact, an expensive for m of labour, because ( Mr Timson) that the proit is necessary to bring the natives from different villages, to feed, house and look after them generally, to provide them with medical care during their period of employment, and to return them to their homes on the completion of that period. When the efficiency of native labour is taken into consideration, it cannot be classified as cheap labour. The protection of the Australian market was dealt with adequately by the honourable member for Higinbotham ( Mr Timson), who pointed out that clause 5 of the agreement statesThe assurance of the supply tb the Australian market of plywood and other products similar to those of the Timber Company is fundamental to this agreement. That article does not require amplification. The honourable member for East Sydney has suggested that this venture will affect adversely the interests of workers on the Australian mainland. If we accepted that point of view, we should have to say that we should not have anything to do with the development of the timber resources of New Guinea under any circumstances, because, whether they were developed by another company or by any other body, that development would adversely effect Australian workers. New Guinea is not our country. We are administering it as a trustee for the United Nations. We have accepted the responsibility of developing it. We are expending money upon it, and it is up to us to ensure that the Australian people will receive ful l value for that money. develop the country in the interests of the natives. a responsibility to the natives. I point out to the honourable member for East Sydney that if there be any proposition that is likely to lead to the development of the country in the interests of the natives, it is this one. Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited is established on the site. It has housing facilities, and is employing natives who are healthy, well fed and well looked after. It is, in every respect, all that a company with which the Government of this country engages in partnership should be. If anything will assist the natives of New Guinea, it will be the opening up and development of their country, the provision of amenities and a general improvement of their [46] living standards. Without question, those objectives will be achieved by this proposition. We have to decide whether we shall cast this agreement into limbo, or accept it and begin to implement it immediately. My firm conviction is that, taking every factor into consideration, this agreement represents an excellent opportunity for the Commonwealth to achieve something really worthwhile in New Guinea. I do not believe that any honourable member will dispute that Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited, which is established on the site and has the necessary water rights and equipment, could go into operation immediately and produce results to-morrow. In those circumstances, would it be wise to put this agreement aside and say that it must be considered by a select committee, with the possible result that it would be rejected and another proposition advanced ? It has been suggested that the company is getting a very good deal from the Commonwealth. Unquestionably, this is a business deal. If the proposition that was advanced some years ago was not quite as advantageous to tbe company as this one, possibly the reason is that the company is now in a position to strike a harder bargain than it was then. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr W. M . Bourke) has suggested that the company should be subjected to taxation and compelled to put some of its profits back into New Guinea. When one puts a proposition to another man, one says, '' Let us get together and see if we can thrash out something"". That is what has occurred in this case. Bepresentatives of the company and of the Commonwealth have got together and have thrashed out this agreement, which is acceptable to both parties. Now, all that remains to be done is for the agreement to be confirmed by this Parliament. This enormous project is too big to be undertaken by any other company of which we know that is operating in New Guinea at the present time. Probably it could be undertaken successfully only by Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited which, as I have said previously, is established on the site and has all the equipment that is required as well as the ability to operate",76,Agreement Bill 1952 Second Reading
242,Mr Wabd,Our undertaking is to,79,Agreement Bill 1952 Second Reading
243,Mr Failes,"I agree that we haveit. I suggest that the agreement is reasonable and fair. It provides for the payment of royalties at the rates prescribed in the forestry regulations of the Territory of New Guinea, plus additional royalties upon timber of various types at the rate of 3s. 6d. and 4s. for each 100 super, feet. The company has undertaken to mill 100,000,000 super, feet of timber over a period of ten years. As I have already pointed out, clause 5 states that the assurance of supply to the Australian market of plywood and other products similar to those that will be marketed by the proposed company is fundamental to the agreement. The project involves the intense development of a particular area, which will spread to other parts of the territory. If the company is allowed to commence work, I believe that all that the honourable member for Fawkner desires will be achieved. I strongly support the bill. [11.40] I am very disappointed that an agreement of this kind should have been entered into by the Government. I do not know of any reason why the Commonwealth should not exploit the forests of New Guinea itself, on behalf of the Australian people and, more importantly, of the natives of that territory. is not a socialist government. nately, this is not a socialist government. Because it is not a socialist government the natives of New Guinea will not receive the advantages that would accrue to them if the project were undertaken by the Commonwealth. Under this agreement, at least 50 per cent, of the profits of the undertaking will go to Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited, which is already a wealthy organization. It is not an ordinary company. It does not represent ordinary shareholders, and it cannot be said to be a public company in the ordinary sense of the term. It has a capital'of 6,000,000 dollars, in 1,200,000 shares of 5 dollars each. It has paid dividends as high as 3 dollars a share a year. I have ascertained that a company called Placer Development Limited owns 125,000 five-dollar shares in Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited. Placer Development Limited is no ordinary company. It owns 1,150,000 fully-paid one-dollar shares in Pato Consolidated Gold Dredging Limited, 615,000 fully-paid one-dollar shares in Asnazn Gold Dredging Limited, 2,000,000 fully-paid onedollar shares of Nechi Consolidated Dredging Limited, 64 per cent, of the issued shares of Rutherglen Gold Dumps Limited, 60,000 £A.l shares in Gold Dumps Proprietary Limited, 633,995 shares of one dollar each, being the entire issued capital, except five shares, of American Placers Incorporated, formed in April, 1937, in the State of Washington, United States of America, to deal with oil and mining properties in that country, and 19,995 shares of one dollar each in Placer Management Limited. Placer Development Limited owns, through a subsidiary company, all but five of the issued shares of Canadian Exploration Limited. The subsidiary company, American Placers Incorporated, has large shareholdings in the Coronet Oil Company and a host of other very wealthy companies in the United States of America. As an Australian and a person who is charged with the responsibility of safeguarding the rights of the natives of New Guinea, I believe that this Parliament, if it approved this agreement, would do a great disservice to those natives and would betray the trust that has been placed in it to legislate on their behalf. If we approved this agreement, we would hand over the natural timber resources of New Guinea to the huge, wealthy companies that own and control Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited. The agreement that the Government proposes to make with Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited contains some interesting provisions. Clause8 statesIn carrying out its operations, the Timber Company may employ such labour as may be conveniently and practicably employed having regard to local conditions and the availability of the different types of labour. That simply means that the company will be given the right to exploit native labour of New Guinea, to pay whatever remuneration it likes subject to the observance of the territory ordinance. tects the natives.",79,Agreement Bill 1952 Second Reading

Clause 10 statesSubject to the legislation in force in and relating to the Territory of New Guinea, the Commonwealth will take a ll necessary steps and do all in its power to ensure the grant to the tiinber company of a permit tinder the Forestry Ordinance 1936-1951 and the Forestry Regulations oi the Territory of New Quinea(ra) Conferring upon the timber company the exclusive right to cut and remove over a period of ten (10) years ' one (100,000,000) super, feet of Hoop aud K l in k i i pine and a smaller quantity, to be determined by the Administrator of the Territory (in this Agreement called "" The Adminis t r a to r "" ) , of cedar and secondary species of timbers from within an area or areas totalling fifteen thousand (15,000) acres of land owned by tlie Administration of the Territory and Bituatedi n the Bulolo Valley in the district of Morobe in the Territory of New Guinea. The Government should not hand over to any private company, or to any company that is owned partly by the Government and partly by private interests, the exclusive rigbts to cut and remove such an enormous quantity of timber as 100,000,000 super, feet of hoop and klinkii pine. The Government acted quite wrongly and against tbe interests of the native people and {be Australian people as well in undertaking to hand over to this wealthy concern such an enormous amount of timber. A subclause of clause 10 of tbe agreement statesThe Timber Company must not cut more than the following maximum quantities of logs of Hoop and K l in k i i pines, namely: (ff) twelve million (12,000,000) super. feet in any one year; (S) one hundred million (100,000,000) super, feet during the currency of tbe permit. If there must be such an agreement, at least the provisions that I have mentioned are one good feature of"" it. If an agreement must be framed, I am pleased that the Minister has restricted the amount of timber that may be-cut in any one year and during the currency of the arrangement. Again with that qualification, I believe also that it is a good provision which Mr Clyde Cameron. prescribes that the minimum ahd maximum quantities of cedar and secondary timbers to be cut by the timber company shall be determined by the Administrator. That feature of the bill must commend itself to honourable members wbo are forced to accept the measure in its present form. The agreement addsThe Tiinber Company shall pay the Administration of the Territory royalties at the rate prescribed in the Forestry Regulations of the Territory of New Guinea together with such additional royalties as, subject to sub-clauses hundred million (vi.) and (vii.) of this paragraph may be determined by the Administrator in accordance with the regulations after consultation with the Timber Company. It is rather a good thing that the Government has insisted upon the company paying royalties. I should have been much happier if the agreement provided that the royalties to be paid would be used for the benefit of the native population and for native welfare. There is no such guarantee. For all honourable members know, the royalties that are paid will go into Consolidated Revenue or will be used to benefit the people of the mainland and not the native population at all. Be that as it may, it is at least refreshing to know that the Government has not gone to the extent of allowing the company to cut the timber without paying a royalty. After five years, the company will be subject to a review of the additional royalties which are set. out in the bill to cover the. first five years of operation. I hope that whenever a government is fixing additional royalties, it will pay some regard to the real value of the timber. I hope that it will fix a commensurate royalty, and will makesure that the royalties so collected will be used for the. welfare of the native population and for the people generally in that area. Again with the qualification , that if honourable members must accept the bill, I express the opinion that there are several other bright features in the agreement. One is the part of it which statesThe conditions as to replanting shall beas determined by the Administrator, subject to the Forestry Ordinance 1936-1951 and the Forestry Regulations of the Territory of New Guinea, after consultation with the Timber Company^ Clause 11 of the agreement statesTim ownership of the replanted forests will not be transferred to the Timber Company, but the Commonwealth will look favourably upon any proposals to enable the Timber Company to get greater assurance of continuity of operation and of the use of the yield of the replanted forest. i should like to know from the Minister its holding or any part of it. . . . whether the term "" look favourably upon "" carries with it any binding obligation to That provision may prove to be good or continue the replanted area is ready for cutting, and this agreement indicates that the Governif so for how long. The Minister is ment contemplates the possibility that it strangely silent upon that point. second-reading speech. the Minister say in that speech? I did suspect that as soon as this venture begins not hear it . Apparently the Minister to show a profit, the Government w ill cannot remember so I shall have to read, be just as likely to sell its interest in it later. It may elucidate some points exactly the same way as it disposed of which are much in doubt. Clause 14 is, its interest in Amalgamated Wireless in my opinion, one of the gems of the (Australasia) Limited and as it proposes whole agreement. If Customs Duty is paid upon the importahave disposed of its interest in Transtion into Australia of the plywood, veneers, Australia Airlines but for the public, prologs and other products of the timber comtest that such a proposal evoked. It is pany, and is not remitted, the Commonwealth time that the Government had its will pay to the timber company a subsidy upon the exportation of those products from wings clipped when it makes special the Territory for entry into Australia of an provision in advance for the handing over amount or at a rate determined by the to private interest of public property in a Commonwealth from time to time, but tlie profitable undertaking. I sincerely trust amount of subsidy paid shall not exceed the that the rumour that has been current in amount of customs duty paid and not remitted. That is an amazing proposal. TJnderi t the Senate w ill reject this bill Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited, the greater part of whose shares are owned by American and Canadian vested in terests, w ill be given the right to have refunded to it all collections of customs duty in respect to goods that it exports to Australia. Wliat is to prevent the company from importing veneers and plywoods from itself in New Guinea? In that way it could return refunds of customs duty to the parent company and deduct che duty payable from the price at which it sold the goods in Australia. If that putwere done, no Australian competitor would be able to survive. The company's mills w ill bo much closer to sources of supply than is the case with most mills in Australia. The company w ill also he able to employ native labour at wages which would be frowned upon in any Australian industry. Clause 15 of the agreement also gives, rise to serious doubts. That clause reads(1.) Subject to this clause, neither party to this Agreement will sell or transfer its holding of shares in the Timber Company or any part of it without the previous consent in writing of the otlier, or, without prior notice to uie other, mortgage, pledge or charge agreement when the bad; but in any event, its insertion in w ill sell its interest under the agreement to Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited.

271,"Keon, S. M . Mr James (Hunter) [12.28 A.m.]","I visited Glen Davis on several occasions, when the Chifley Government was in oflice, in an endeavour to increase the quantity of shale that was being mined for retorting. I got the men to increase production. Some Communists wanted to crucify Rowley James because I persuaded the men at Glen Davis to adopt the principle of extracting pillars by mechanization. Therefore I am in the gun. Do Government supporters know what happened to me recently? Eor the first time in 24 years, I have been opposed in the pre-selection ballot in my electorate to choose the Labour candidate to contest Hunter at the next general election. Honourable members opposite talk about fighting the Communists. You do not fight tbem as hard as I do. I put them on the knuckle. I should like to ask tbe Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) some questions about tbe intention of the Government to dismantle the plant at Glen Davis. I attended a conference at which a proposal was submitted that the men should work the mine on a co-operative basis. However, the Government fixed the rental at £10,000 per annum, which the men could not afford to pay. I am convinced that the Government intends to close Glen Davis because it is not operated by private' enterprise, but is a nationalized industry. .During the last war, Glen Davis made a valuable contribution of fuel for our defence requirements. Did tbe Government believe that the miners could pay a rental of £10,000 a year out of their miserable wages? Yet you complain about the activities of the Communists! honourable member address the Chair? porters do complain about the activities of the Communists. I am the only one who puts them on the knuckle when it comes to a show-down. The Government, as the result of its decision to close Glen Davis, will strengthen the influence of the Communists with decent trade unionists. A number of miners have already been down the shaft at Glen Davis for 48 hours, and they propose to remain there until the Government reverses its decision. Would men stay down a mine unless they had a genuine grievance? Tbe miners have attractive and comfortable homes at Glen Davis. ' Many of the men own their homes, and others are purchasing them with assistance from banks and other financial institutions. How could those dwellings be moved a distance of at least 100 miles to a place where the Glen Davis men could find other employment? The harsh decision of the Government confronts the men with a serious economic loss. The Minister for Labour and National Service has said that the Government is prepared to ensure that the Glen Davis miners will be placed in the coal-mining industry. Is he aware that 70 men have been dismissed from the Coalcliff colliery ? The Government has already sacked some of the Glen Davis miners, but their mates have announced their intention not to dismantle the machinery, which the Government desires to transfer to the aluminium industry at Bell Bay, in Tasmania. The stand of the miners is supported by the Australian Council for Trades Unions. Does the Government consider that that body has any association witb the Communists? The Glen Davis miners are fighting for the right to remain in their homes. Many of them, like you and me, Mr Speaker, have attained an age at which they cannot bring themselves to make new homes. I urge the Governmentfco. reconsider its decision. able member has exhausted his time. -Statement s appeared in the press recently about the fall in the price of Australian-grown tobacco leaf and the Minister for -Commerce and Agriculture that was asked subsequently on that subject, saidI have beeu informed that drought, lack of knowledge of growers and pest infestation are responsible.

276,"( Mr Mcewen), In A Reply To A Question","the quality of the commodity. Some persons have arranged what is known as a buyers' market for Australian tobacco leaf, and year after year attacks have been made on the local industry. I believe that the big tobacco monopolies want to prevent tobacco from being grown in Australia. Tobacco has been successfully grown at Mareeba on the Atherton Tableland, and in many other parts of Australia. It has been said that the quality of the leaf has deteriorated. I suggest that drought would not deteriorate the quality of the leaf although it would decrease the quantity of the crop. It has been said that the quality has deteriorated because of the lack of knowledge by the growers. Growers certainly do not lack knowledge of the tobaccof rowing business because the Government as appointed four technicians who have had over 40 years experience in the industry to advise tobacco-growers. Moreover, seven senior agricultural omcers devote a great deal of their spare time to advising farmers about tobacco-growing, and there are two tobacco experimental stations in Queensland for the benefit of growers. Tobacco manufacturers also maintain technical advisers in Queensland to help the growers. With all those aids available, it is ridiculous to suggest that the growers lack knowledge. The growers themselves have gained personal knowledge over many years of tobacco-growing. At one time an Australian Governof our tobacco has also been made by a ment decreased the duty on imported Sydney manufacturer. The Minister's leaf and increased the excise on local leaf. statement was made without any investiThe result of that action was that the gation such as he would have made if tobacco industry was destroyed, and the product under consideration had been hundreds of people became insolvent. wool, butter, wheat or any other primary Therefore, I am perturbed by the critiproduct. cism of tobacco-growing in Australia because tbe same thing may happen again. The secretary of the Queensland Tobacco Marketing Board, Mr B. Oahill, has referred to the flooding of Australia with imported cigarettes that contain the rankest and cheapest type of of Australian tobacco leaf be incorporated tobacco that is grown in the British with imported tobacco. That would be Empire. He said that Australia pura further step against the interests of chases great supplies of cigarettes that monopolies who do not want to see this are made in India, Africa and various industry established on a sound hasis. parts of Europe, which can hardly be said to contain tobacco. Any honourable member's time has expired. member who has had to smoke cigarettes such as those which have been flooding the mai'ket in recent years will agree that the tobacco is unpalatable and tasteless. People bought them only because there were no others available. Most of the tobacco manufactured in north Queensland is bought by local consumers and the demand exceeds the supply. I have been informed by the manager of a manufacturing concern that the quality of the leaf this year is equal if not superior to the quality of last year's leaf. I am satisfied that the British-Australasian Tohacco Company Proprietary Limited and other great tobacco monopolies of the world are again endeavouring to destroy this industry as they destroyed it previously. Tobacco-growers are producing a commodity that eventually may earn dollars for this country, and also save us spending dollars. Many fine farms and towns have sprung up because of the industry, and those interested have been looking forward to the day when local growers will supply the whole of the Australian market and establish an export market. Cartels have established buyers' markets in wool and other products, and cartels to-day are forcing the price of tobacco leaf down beyond all reason. In the tobacco market a fall in the price of the leaf can occur in 24 hours. A statement similar to that made by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ""that drought, lack of knowledge of growers and. pest infestation., have been responsible for the lower price Manufacturers will naturally underrate the value of the article they have to buy.

If Australians can smoke some to keep all matters together as far as possible. However, I cannot guarantee to see to-day everybody who was not called yesterday. The honourable member will get a chance to speak later, because I shall be happy to stay here until daylight if necessary. a.m.] -It is unfortunate that the revious honourable member for LeichI ardt is not present to-night to present a case for the tobacco-growers, because he understood that matter very well. The decrease of recent tobacco leaf prices mentioned by tbe honourable member for Leichhardt .( Mr Bruce) refers to leaf grown around the Bundaberg district of Queensland. It is unfortunate that a suggestion should have been made against the tobacco manufacturing industry, because the whole of Australia is vitally interested in the growth of our tobacco industry. It is an industry worthy of the greatest support, mainly because of its emphasis on closer settlement. For instance, a dairy-farmer in Queensland requires about SOO acres in order to gain a living, but a tobacco-farmer can earn a comfortable living from 30 to 40 acres. I come now to the reasons for the fall in the price of tobacco leaf. No grower has suggested that the leaf offered was the best available from the Queensland crop. It was not. We must also bear in mind the fact that, during the early part of this year, Australia was flooded by English cigarettes. In January alone, I cigarettes were imported from England. The tobacco leaf that is being grown in Queensland is of very high quality. I have with me some samples of the first machine-made cigarettes, which contain 50 per cent, of Mareeba leaf. Unfortunately I have not enough cigarettes to pass around amongst all honourable members, but those who have smoked them agree that they are good. I believe that by using 50 per cent. Australian leaf grown at Mareeba, Miriam Vale necessary machines, capture the market in this country at present held by English be fostered, the Australian people will have to cultivate a taste for Australian of the atrocious cigarettes that tome to us from overseas, they should have no difficulty in cultivating a taste for the good leaf that is grown in north Queensland. I have no doubt that the fall in price at the recent sales was a passing phase. I believe that if the Government were to insist that a larger proportion of Australian leaf be used in the manufacture of machine-made cigarettes, and if licences were issued for the importation of more machinery so that we could make cigarettes of the quality of the samples that I have before me, we should be doing the industry a great deal of good and be establishing many more people on the land. I do not know of any primary industry in Queensland that offers a greater measure of support to the community because, as I said earlier, tobacco-growers can earn a good living from a small area of land. An expansion of tobacco-growing would mean that a greater number of people could be established on a given area of country. I believe that the honourable member for Leichhardt was a little bit astray, as people of his political beliefs often are, when he said that the large companies had formed a cartel with the object of putting tbe tobacco industry in this country out of existence. I believe that the industry will progress, and that this Government will give it all the support that it merits. believe approximately 600.000,000 I wish again to bring to the notice of the Government the acute lack of telephone facilities in the electorate of Banks.

The ngures shown were as at the 6th May and I shall cite some of them later. The Banks electorate includes the municipalities of Bankstown, Canterbury and Hurstville. Last year, 3,000 homes were built in those municipalities, and a similar number will be built this year. In addition, the industrialization which started during the war is still proceeding apace. That applies particularly to Bankstown, where at present some of Australia's most modern industries and factories are being established. During the last ten years, the population of Bankstown has jumped from 40,000 to 80,000. Most of the industries that have been established in that locality are engaged on the production of defence equipment or of essential goods that are in short supply. There are tool-making establishments, and plants engaged on the production of building materials. Dunlop Eubber Australia Limited has a large tyre plant there and in addition, there is the De Haviland aircraft production factory and many subsidiary undertakings. Unfortunately, the industrial development is being seriously hampered by the lack of telephones, which, of course, are the lifelines of business. Some applications have been outstanding for ten years. It is interesting to compare the number of outstanding applications in the electorate of Banks with tbe figures for some blue ribbon Liberal seats in the metropolitan areas of Sydney. In the electorate of Banks, there are 1,093 applitbe detriment of the division of Banks. I cations outstanding at Bankstown, 3,237 at Hurstville, and 1,441 at Lakemba, making a total of 5,821. In the electorate of Mackellar, a blue ribbon Liberal seat, Manly has 201 outstanding applications, Dee Why 280, and Balgowlah 660, a total of 1,141. In Wentworth electorate there are 235 outstanding applications at Edgecliff, 500 at Vaucluse and 305 at Double Bay, making a total of 1,040. In Bennelong electorate there are 325 outstanding applications at Chatswood. Other figures are Lane Cove 104, and Ryde 998. The total for the electorate is 1,427. The figures for the electorate Mosman 25. In Bradfield electorate Lindfield bas 28 outstanding applications and Pymble 34, a total of 72. The Postmaster General announced recently that a new telephone exchange would be built at -St. Leonards on the north shore. He said that the new exchange would enable more applications for telephones to be granted and that the exchange would be able to handle 10,000 lines. The honourable gentleman said in the House to-day that the new exchange would be ready by the beginning of next year. There are only five outstanding applications for the St. Leonard's exchange. torate of Eeid? situation there compares unfavorably with the situation in the Liberal blue ribbon districts.

A time will come when this Government will be judged. realize that anything that I may say now will have no bearing upon the situation because the Government, pledged to the cause of Mammon, has taken up the cudgels on behalf of the major oil companies, whose profiteering under thc scheme of single-brand petrol stations it supports. Anybody who is acquainted with the history of oil and its exploitation throughout the world knows that oil and blood are intermingled. vides the life-blood of a nation. Government has disregarded the importance of the Glen Davis industry and has short-sightedly refused to mobilize our economic strength for the purpose of developing it so that it would be a bulwark for the nation in time of crisis. The 55 men who are in the mine at Glen Davis are good Australians. are not Communists. They are not extremists of any sort. They may be misguided, but their action has helped to concentrate attention upon the shortcomings of the Government. The men are fighting for a national undertaking, and, at the same time, they are fighting for their homes and their possessions in the Capertee Valley. I realize that the die is cast and that the Government will not deviate from the course of action, upon which it has embarked. Nevertheless; I ask it, in the interests of humanity, to do something for the people of Glen Davis. It sbould at least send representatives to the township in order to tell the people where they stand and give them definite undertakings in relation to compensation and future employment. I have heard it said that the people of Glen Davis will be employed in industries elsewhere. But the honourable meinber for Hunter has stated to-night and the honourable member for Cunningham ( Mr Davies) has referred previously to the fact that miners have heen dismissed from their employment in other fields. I have directed Mr lAichetti. attention to the fact that the Joint Coal new mines shall be opened in the western district. The inference to be drawn from these facts is inescapable. With 500,000 tons of coal at grass, miners will not be I needed, and the men who have been dismissed will not be engaged elsewhere, even though we are still importing coal from India and are thereby reducing our overseas balances. The Government has a responsibility to the people of Glen Davis and to the people of Australia as a whole. The men who pioneered the industry at Glen Davis must not be deserted and left lamenting, but should be given a guarantee of security for themOil proselves and their families in the future. This The miners, the technicians, the chemists and all the others who are concerned in the abandonment of the Glen Davis industry should be taken into the confidence of the Government. I ask it not to allow this intolerable situation to continue. It should send representatives to the district. Perhaps a Minister will be prepared to They go there in the name of humanity to meet the miners and the townspeople and determine what the Government should do for them. a.m.] I bring to the attention of the House the case of an elector of the division of Mackellar, Mr Keith Bath.

I point out that the matter of Keith Bath is before the High Court of Australia and, therefore, is sub judice. In these circumstances, I think that tbe matter should not be discussed in this House.

I propose to show that the inefficiency of tbe New South Wales transport system, compared with tbe systems of other States, is a factor that is causing where freight charges are lower than in a reduction of food production there. It is well known that New South Wales is already importing from other States quantities of butter, cheese, potatoes, fruit, milk, cream, beef, maize and other commodities. It is importing even wheat, although at one time it was a great flour-exporting State. Transport can play a tremendous part in stimulating agricultural production, but an inefficient transport system can do great damage. Let me compare transport costs in New South Wales with those in other States. In Viotoria, the freight charges upon a ton of superphosphate, carried over a distance of 50 miles, are 6s. l i d . , in New South Wales they are ISs., and in South Australia they are 8s. 3d. The charges in New South Wales are nearly three times greater than those in Victoria and South Australia, in which States primary production is increasing, whereas in New South Walesi t is decreasing. For a long haul, freight charges upon a ton of superphosphate are 22s. 9d. in Victoria, and 39s. in New South Wales. We must not forget that freight charges in New South Wales are subsidized to tbe degree of 25 per cent, by the State Government, and that that subsidy is paid, in fact, by the taxpayers. For a distance of 200 miles, freight charges upon groceries and drapery are £9 9s. a ton in Victoria, and £12 19s. a .ton in New South Wales. For machinery, the charges are £7 10s. 5d. a ton in Victoria, and £10 14s. a ton in New South Wales. Freight charges upon grains such as maize and oats, for a distance of 200 miles, are 25s. Id. a ton in Victoria, and 79s. a ton in New South Wales. The charges in New South Wales are more than three times greater than those in Victoria. For that distance, freight charges upon wheat are 25s. Id. a ton in Victoria, and 63s. in New South Wales. In one part of my electorate, poultry-farmers are now paying nearly £60 freight upon a truck of wheat, although two months previously they were paying £15 a truck. eggs cost now? dozen now, owing to the tremendous cost of transporting wheat. In Victoria, New South Wales, I believe that the price of eggs is also lower. In that State, a bullock can be transported for 400 miles for less than £2, but in New South Wales the cost is £3 14s. 4d. In tbe case of a light beast, the higher freight charges in New South Wales have the effect of increasing the price of the meat by Id. per lb. In Victoria, the cost of moving a sheep over 400 miles is 43d., but in New Soutb Wales it is 88d. The cost of transporting fencing material, machinery, seed, fertilizers, and other requirements of farmers, is twice as much, and sometimes three times as much, in New South Wales as in other States. How on earth can the people of New South Wales obtain cheap food when the inefficient transport system of the State is forcing prices up? Tbe Minister for Agriculture in New South Wales is a very fine man personally, but, none the less, he is presiding over the disintegration of agriculture in that State. The fact that he is able to speak to the farmers in language they can understand, does not alter the fact that the Government of which he is a member is doing a grave disservice to agricultural production in New South Wales. While the primary producers of that State are burdened with heavy taxation and an inefficient transport system, the prices of the foodstuffs which they produce cannot he reduced. It is evident that the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate), realizing that his party has been smitten hip and thigh throughout Australia, and is now on the defensive, is trying to create a diversion by attacking the Labour Government of New South Wales, and par ticularly the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Transport in that State, whom he blames for the decline in",92,Adjournment

310,Mr Pollard (Lalor) [1.30 A.m.],"primary production. He should realize, if he has any sense, that primary production, should be considered, in relation to the continent as a whole, and not in relation to any one State. The decline of primary production is due to a number of factors, not the least of which is the destruction of confidence among the primary producers by this Government which the honourable member supports. In 1949, the parties which support this Governnient promised many things to the wheat-growers, the dairy-farmers and other primary producers. They promised to reduce taxation, and they said nothing about imposing a special tax on income from wool. The honourable member mentioned railway freight rates in New South Wales on superphosphate, but he did not say that this Government had withdrawn the bounty of £3 15s. a ton which the Labour Government bad been paying on superphosphate. That bounty was one of the best methods that could be devised for stimulating production. The honourable member did not mention that the decline of wheat production in New South Wales was largely due to drought over which the Minister for Agriculture in New South Wales has no control. For the 1947-48 season New South Wales produced a record wheat, crop, and provided most of the wheat that was exported from Australia. The honourable member did not point out that railway transport in New South Wales is very much more difficult than it is in a small, compact and rich State like Victoria. Whilst it is true that freight rates production. are considerably lower in Victoria than in New South Wales, the Victorian Government has had to plead with the Australian Government for a sufficient allocation of revenue to enable those freights to be kept down. The honourable member for Macarthur did not suggest that the Oommonwealth Treasurer should provide more revenue for the Government of New South Wales to enable it to reduce the rates payable by primary producers. Does he imagine that the New South Wales Treasurer can pull out of the clouds the money that would be needed to keep down freight rates? He knows that every penny piece that is expended by the Government of New South Wales comes from revenue raised by the Commonwealth. If the Government of Mr Pollard. New South Wales is short of money it is because this Government is starving it of revenue and of loan money. The honourable member for Macarthur mentioned the cattle industry. For a great many years past, store cattle have been sent from Queensland to be fattened in New South Wales, and sometimes even in Victoria. Queensland has been a great reservoir for beef cattle. The honourable member is trying to deceive the people and lead them into believing that the responsibility for decling primary production rests on the Government of New South Wales instead of on this Government. The primary producers have enjoyed great prosperity for a. number of years. That prosperity has in some measure been destroyed by the taxation policy of this Government. The Government led the people to believe that it would reduce taxes, but that has not been done. Every paper that if published for primary producers is full of complaints about the uncertainty of the Government's taxation policy. The wheat-growers are saying openly that they will not sow more land to wheat until the situation is clarified. The Government has deprived primary producers of the incentive to produce. Admittedly, because the primary producers have been prosperous, they have tended to slacken off, hut they have improved the amenities on their farms, built new sheds, sunk dams and improved their fencing. While they have been doing that they have not been able to concentrate on increasing Dairy production was highest in Australia during the season 1934-35. Times were then very hard, and farmers' sons could not get outside employment, with the result that they stayed on the farms and milked as many cows as the farms could carry. I am not advocating a return to those conditions, which, as a matter of fact, were largely the responsibility of the parties that support the present Government. 1 regret having, at this hour in the morning, to raise a matter touching upon security, but as the Government is hastening to close the current sittings I may not have another opportunity to do eo.

If they The security service has been put to some peculiar uses recently. Only a few weeks ago a deputation from tbe Federated Clerks Union of Australia came to Canberra to interview the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt). The members of the deputation stayed at Hotel Ainslie-Eex. I am informed that while they were interviewing the Minister at Parliament House, members of the security service were going through their rooms and belongings at their hotel. The Government should give some explanation of the exact work on which the security service is being engaged. Isi t the purpose of the security serviee to assist the Government by spying upon trade union officials and, no doubt, upon members of this Parliament? I noticed two members of the security service in the precincts of Parliament House to-night. I do not know the work they are engaged upon in Canberra. One is named Tuck. I do not know the name of the otber man, but he had a very mysterious look. moustache and a beard? very easy to detect that they are security officers. Perhaps they are tapping the telephone lines or doing something with it. The explanation that was given by thc Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony) to the complaint of the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Edmonds) about the tapping of telephone lines to Parliament House could not be accepted by any sensible person as reasonable. Honourable members will recollect that when the honourable member for Herbert raised the matter, the Pbstmaster-General said that he knew nothing about it, but that he would have inquiries made.' Subsequently he admitted in the Parliament that the lines had been tapped. The reason that he gave was that officers were ascertaining Avhether the telephone lines into Parliament House and out of it were adequate to carry the load. That is a ridiculous explanation. Technical officers of the Postmaster-General's Department have informed me, as they would have informed the Postmaster-Generali f he had inquired, that there is no need to tap the lines to ascertain whether they want to check trunk-line calls, there is a manual switchboard wbich is operated by girls who can tell them what calls have been made on the trunk-line system and the duration of the calls. That is the simple way to test the trunk-line traffic. Technical officers of the Postmaster-General's Department have informed me also that it is silly to suggest that they have to tap a line to test the loading through the automatic telephone exchange. If the Minister admits that the lines have been tapped, he should think of some other excuse tban the one that he has given to honourable members. There has been no denial by the Government that during the period when the Communist Party Dissolution Bill was before the House and during the subsequent referendum campaign, the telephone system was being tapped so that the conversations of 'trade' union officials and Labour members of Parliament could be heard; nor has there been any denial that tape recordings were made of the conversations. Statements to that efTect have been made to me from many quarters. The Government has not denied that such a practice was engaged in during that time.

They are not fully aware of happenings going on around them, or happening in this country. One of the things that we have to guard against in Australia while we are talking about freedom and democracy is the danger that we are failing to guard and protect ourselves against the growth of totalitarian methods which were used by the fascist powers and by the Communist powers. I do not expect the Minister for Supply( Mr Beale), who is sitting at the table, to give me immediately the information that I seek on the matters that I have mentioned, but I hope that he will convey the text of my remarks to his colleagues so that before the Parliament rises to-morrow, the House will be given a satisfactory explanation of the exact state of affairs in regard to the security service.

If so, will lie state why income tax is imposed under tbe existing law on pensions received by United Kingdom war widows? the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Yes. 2. Pensions paid by the Tjnited Kingdom Government to war widows are derived from sources in the United Kingdom. These pensions are subject to United Kingdom incoine tax if the recipients are resident in the United Kingdom. Under the terms of the agreement between Australia and the United Kingdom for the avoidance of double taxation, however, the pensions are exempt from United Kingdom income tax if the recipients are resident in Australia and Australian income tax is imposed on the pensions. Accordingly, liability to Australian tax relieves the war widow from her liability to United King(EXCLUDING IMPORTATIONS BY THB COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT, SIX MONTHS ENDED THE 31ST Description.

Before advising this House as to the action contemplated by me, I should nt once reiterate that there is a world shortage of cortisone, there being only one manufacturer in the world, in north America. The quota available to Australia was increased by one-third as from last October on niy representations to this firm. The Govtrnment grants import licences for the maximum amount available, and admits the drug duty free. Another drug used for many of the diseases treated by cortisone, namely ACTH is prepared in a number of countries throughout the world, and is in fact, now prepared at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories at my direction.",97,Decembeb 1951

332,Mr Erio J. Harrison,"The MinisterBoth of these drugs hare undesirable side effects, and for this reason it is desirable that full investigations be mads as to the results of treatment. With regard to cortisone, it is quite clear that there is insufficient in Australia to treat all who desire it. It is therefore necessary that it be issued according to medical priority, whether the patient be wealthy or poor, or whether a hospital or private patient. From the lst March, 1951, to the 31st January, 1952, its control on medical priority was exercised, by arrangement with my colleague the Mmister for Trade and Customs, by the Koyal Australasian College of Physicians, and I repent my sincere appreciation of the work of the college. From the 1st February, 1952, the distribution of cortisone has been controlled by officers of my department, there being in each State capital an advisory sub-committee of the college to advise my officers in border-line cases. The importers of cortisone are required by the Department of Trade and Customs to supply only to retailers or hospitals who furnish the drug only to approved patients, whether private patients or hospital patients. The same medical priority in allocation still obtains, and I believe the distribution ig made fairly. The Government dees nut intend to endeavour to become the sole importer of cortisone, nor, at this stage, to provide it free. Works, upon notice1. What is the cost of imported homes such as those erected by his department at Dapto? 2. What is the cost of erection.? the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The landed cost of prefabricated houses being erected at Dapto is £1,070 (Australian). 2. The total estimated erection cost is £1,906, which includes £350 for the supply of local materials. In addition, there would be tlie usual overall charges associated with any subdivision scheme, for example, water main extensions, roads, sewerage and electrical reticulation in the area. These prefabricated homes form portion of those .purchased from the Victorian Government and were imported by that Government under its "" Operation Snail"". ter for the Interior, upon notice-1. Is the daily cost of catering for members of Parliament at the Hotel Kurrajoni any more for a member who stays there for ten consecutive days than for or.e who stays there for only seven consecutive days; if so, by haw much? 2. If not, why is it that the daily charge in the first case is £1 4a. 9d. and only £1 la. 4d. in the second. the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Yes, because of laundry and other obvious reasons. The exact increase is not known. 2. The tariff for members of Parliament residing at Hotel Kurrajong is £1 13s. a daj or £7 9s. a week. Jf the period of residence JS five, six or seven days the full weekly rate is charged. Al) odd days arc charged for at the daily rate. If a member is in residence for tea days he would be charged at the weekly rate of £7 9s. and at the daily rate of £1 13s. for three days. This is standard hotel practice and is adopted by hotels privately conducted in Canberra. 1 would draw attention to the fact that the tariff at the Kurrajong is much less than the current rate of allowance paid to members while in Canberra.",98,Clearances Of Newsprint
