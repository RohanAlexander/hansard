The first is that the ministerial statement which gives the government's response to the Simons report has now been tabled. On 18 November last, on page 10578 of Hansard, the Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr Downer) responded to the Simons report; consequently the seminar, which was part of the process to determine the direction of Australian aid, is now at another phase. I want to echo the views expressed at the seminar, and earlier on by the minister, by extending to the members of the Simons committee our congratulations on their efforts. The report itself, One clear objective: poverty reduction through sustainable development, is an excellent analysis. It is an analysis that was badly needed because there had not been one since the report prepared by Gordon Jackson 13 years before. It is interesting that there were many areas of contrast between the Gordon Jackson report and the Simons report. We were very fortunate at the seminar, which is actually the focus of this debate today, because we had present each of the members of the committee. It is also worth saying that the members of the aid community were excellent in the way they were prepared to participate in public analysis of the proposals that really embrace not only NGOs and development assistance aid, but also economic aid and the whole range of areas where Australia is involved in helping other countries. It was interesting that at the seminar, as in the minister's statement, there was no questioning of the view that Australia has an ongoing commitment to providing development assistance aid to other countries. The area where there is a problem, and it is one which we cannot ignore, the more so because of the currency-volatility in our area, is in the area of economic aid. At a time when there is reason to look at Australia's economic relationships and when the Development Import Finance Facility, the DIFF, has been suspended, we should look at economic aid and see where we go with that. I hope that in the government's response to the Mortimer report there might be consideration given to an alternative to DIFF. There are various levels of aid. These are issues that emerged at the seminar and emerged in other dialogue about the Simons committee report. One of those aid issues, and it is a difficult one, was put by Mr Wolfensohn, one of the speakers. He was perhaps the most vocal on the issue. He put the point, and it is a point that I accept although I know it is questioned by others, that if you can advance the economic level in a country, if you can advance the number of people who are in the middle class, and if you can provide more job opportunities",136,Delegation Reports Transition Having Only Had Non Racial General

282,Mr Sinclair (New England) (10.00 A.m.),"There are three things that need to be saidThursday, 4 December 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 12155 for a community, you are not only going to make that community better off economically but going to advance the cause of human rights. Also, if you can advance the economic level in a country you are going to advance the cause of those people examining where they are and what their position is in society, and you are going to help even the issue of freedom of the press. I say that because today, if people are able to afford TV sets and earth stations and so on, that means that they have greater access to information It is important that we do not just dismiss the area of economic' aid. It is a field. I call it economic aid but, in a way, it is assistance to Australian industry. As .one who has been involved for many years in the trade field, I think there is an advantage in our being able to help Australian business people into other countries, not peculiarly because of the profits they make, but because of the job creation that it gives, both in those countries and back in Australia. Carefully tailored, there is purpose in providing financial incentive to Australian business to provide aid abroad. That is the one area where we have not concluded our consideration of the Simons committee report. The Simons committee report essentially gave the emphasis to poverty reduction. The minister in his response has confirmed that that is the government's prime objective. In our report we pointed out that poverty reduction really needs to be interpreted in a very broad way. I do have concerns about the way in which we look at poverty reduction because there are obviously advantages in helping people to help themselves. In its way, that relates to the point I was making a moment ago about economic aid. What we have to do is to encourage people to help themselves. In other words, if you can help people to fish, they are going to be a hell of a lot better off than if you are just going to give them fish. So what we want to do is create a climate where people can not only look after themselves at a subsistence level of agriculture, but where they can transfer from a subsistence level to producing food and fibre at a more sophisticated level so that they have a surplus to sell to generate the cash flows that enable them to improve their own living standards. The same applies to some of the basics. I remain most concerned that in the definition of poverty we do not deny the capacity, for example, to help people put down wells, to improve water supply, to improve sanitation, to provide sewerage. There is a group called the RedR Society, who are a group of engineers who do tremendous work. Having been involved in and looked at their work, I am convinced that, in many ways, the work they do is helping the health of people in developing countries more than many of those who are working directly in the health area. If you can provide access to clear clean water, if you can provide an opportunity that prevents women in many instances walking many kilometres just carrying buckets of water on their heads or their shoulders, it helps those villagers to lift their standard of living. To my mind, poverty alleviation is not just a matter of looking at the monetary terms, at cash flows; it is a matter of looking at lifestyle and providing conditions of life and living which are going to give opportunities to people to live in a better way. So when we are looking at this one clear objective, the title given the Simons report; on poverty reduction we do need to have a very broad definition of poverty reduction. That is one of the recommendations we have produced in our Sharpening the focus report. 12156 MAIN .COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 December 1997 We believe it is essential that you look not just at poverty in the monetary sense, but at ways by which you can improve people's lifestyle. From that, of course, you have to look at the relationship of women in particular in many developing communities. One of the tragedies of so many societies is that women are just not given the educational opportunity. I was reading a paper the other day which had figures from India which showed that while over 70 per cent of the male work force are literate, less than 20 per cent of women in the work force are literate, which is appalling. What we have to do is recognise that in many societies women have been given a less than equal opportunity. I think it is important that we look at the facets of how, in our aid program, we can help towards providing a better opportunity for women and children-of either sex-so that they too can have a better living standard in the future. The minister did produce a very good answer to the Simons report. Obviously the big area of doubt is whether enough money is being provided. It has been an ongoing debate for years. It is not peculiar to overseas aid. I know that in all communities there is a feeling that they want more money for whatever the particular local project might be. I have just been doing some correspondence in my office and most of those letters relate to people who want money for schools, for research, for health, and they want other doctors. There are all sorts of programs we want money for. All of us, as members, are aware with every moment of our working lives that we always have this conflict of where money should be provided. But I do not think people need to underestimate, as I believe some of the rhetoric of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) has, the contribution that foreign aid makes to Australia's well-being. We are not just citizens introspectively looking at ourselves and our own neighbours. We have to playa positive role in the wider world community. As far as I am concerned, it is very important that we maintain adequate funding for Australia's development assistance program. I am pleased to see that the minister has given his commitment to this objective, although the quantum of funds available is not necessarily the amount that he would like. I do not want to go into the details of the aid program other than with respect to PNG. I am particularly concerned at where we are going in PNG, quite apart from present problems associated with Prime Minister Skate. I think we need to understand that PNG does have a unique relationship with Australia. She has been the major recipient of our aid. I believe that the transfer from budget to project aid is the way to go, but there are a lot of ifs and buts still in the manner of admin-stration of the country of PNG. I am worried about law and order and not just in the cures at the police level. I am also worried about the job creation necessary. Young people are returning to the villages. It is no use letting the Rascals of today and tomorrow in Lae and Port Moresby and all these other towns take over the sinews of government. Our aid program needs to be directed sympathetically to providing those people with a chance for the future. I know the minister has identified some of these issues in his statement. He has talked about the relief aid to overcome the famine, which has been appalling. He has also talked about the ongoing assistance that we are providing to PNG. I believe PNG is the appropriate country which should continue to see the major level of Australian assistance. There are many other countries that are deserving too, but we do have that unique relationship with PNG that we cannot walk away from. Thursday, 4 December 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 12157 Sharpening the focus is a very good report. It is the result of an excellent seminar and I commend those who participated. I believe, as the ministerial statement says, it is a vehicle which does give us a better chance to sell to the wider Australian community the purposes and advantages of maintaining an adequate level of funding for Australian aid. It has worked well under AusAID; it worked well before under AIDAB. I believe it will continue to work well in the future. I would hope that the observations which have emerged from the aid report, particularly in terms of assessing the value of Australian aid, refocusing aid management, giving an Australian identity to our aid program, and assessing one program against anotherparticularly in terms of sectoral priorities-are factors which are important. We do need to recognise, however, that assessment of the value of aid is something which perhaps has not been done sufficiently in the past. I believe that it is worthwhile, as the minister has said, to set up a permanent advisory committee to advise the minister on aid and development issues. That committee will enable him to hear directly from the broader community about Australia's aid efforts. We need to make sure we get the best value out of it and, certainly, from those wonderful people and the non-government organisations. I would like to commend the NGOs. So many of them give an enormous amount. I think we are very fortunate in Australia that we have not only those who commit official government funds to aid but those in the Australian Volunteers Abroad scheme and so many other volunteers. These people do an enormous amount without thought of adequate return. That dimension of Australian aid enhances the quality and character of who we are as Australians. I commend them and certainly would like to thank them for their participation in our seminar. It was a very effective and successful seminar. I commend the minister for having picked up so many of the ideas that we discussed on that occasion. was one of a number held by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. It also had a specific objective at the direction from the Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr Downer) who wanted discussion on the Simons report. There has been wide-ranging discussion. This seminar was only one of a number of seminars held on it. Other seminars have been held in other places. I think that that was good and I congratulate the minister for the initiative there. I also would like to endorse the comments that the honourable member for New England( Mr Sinclair) just made about those working in the aid field. Whether it is through the official aid agency Au sAID or the NGOs, they do a tremendous job. The Minister for Foreign Affairs rightly identified the existence of mass poverty as the single most important economic and social issue on our planet today. Eliminating the disparities between the world's rich and poor is one of the crucial international challenges of our time. There is no doubt that the overall success of development in recent decades has been very significant: many more people live longer, fewer mothers die in childbirth and fewer infants die from preventable diseases. But the numbers living in poverty have continued to grow. Too many people-indeed, 1.3 billion too many, as the minister has noted-live in extreme poverty and are denied their basic rights to health, decent shelter, clean water supply, sanitation and education. We as a' nation can make a contribution to the elimination of many of these things. Eliminating poverty is affordable and achievable. The major UN conferences of recent years have drawn together a broad framework for cooperation that should deliver sustained progress, but to succeed we clearly need to mobilise greater political will across the international",138,Representatives Main Committee
283,Mr Hollis (Throsby) (10.14 A.m.),"I am pleased to participate in this debate. The seminar12158 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 4 December 1997 community. It is far too easy to put the questions of the elimination of poverty into the toohard basket. I am afraid that that is what many countries do: they recognise that there is a problem there, they see that they have other domestic problems, and they put this international problem in the far too-hard basket. The provision of development assistance by countries such as Australia does reflect a basic and fundamental obligation, an obligation deeply embedded in our core national values. It is our duty to care about other people, in particular those less well-off than ourselves. We have a moral duty to reach out to the poor and the needy. When the foreign minister announced the establishment of the review headed by Mr Paul Simons, he rightly said that Australia has an overseas aid program of which all Australians can be proud. In his press release on 28 May last year, he put the following on the record: Australia has an aid program it can be proud of. Millions of people around the world are now better off thanks to the help they've received from Australia. Our aid program administered by AusAID and delivered by Australian companies, individuals, non-government organisations and academic institutions is highly effective. There is a very large degree of continuity in approach, both in the Simons committee report and in the government's broad acceptance of its recommendations. The introduction to the report states: We do not advocate revolutionary change. That is typical of Australia, of course. The report continues: The basic arrangement of the aid program is sound. The design and management of the program should continue to be the responsibility of a single, independent agency. The countries of East Asia and the Pacific should continue to be the primary focus. Similarly, the response is not a statement signalling dramatic change. It is essentially a further step in the ongoing evolution of our overseas aid program, a program which enjoys strong bipartisan support. The opposition welcomed the establishment of the Simons review. In ever-changing international circumstances, the continued review of Australia's overseas aid program is critically important for maximising its effectiveness and for making sure that we maintain its primary focus of contributing to lasting poverty reduction, while advancing Australia's national interests. Australia's overseas aid program should, in cooperative partnership with developing countries and people, assist in building foundations for broadly based, equitably distributed and sustainable economic growth. We should encourage responsible national economic policies, including support for' the development of efficient, accountable and fair government administration. Our aid program should give priority to breaking down barriers to the participation by the poor in economic and social development, and especially support activities which enable women to contribute and to benefit from development. We should also seek to increase the productivity of the poor by facilitating access by them to productive assets and credit, and access to supporting activities including health care, education and training, and appropriate agricultural technology. In broad terms, these are the goals which find expression in the Simons report. In a number of respects, however, the report and the government's response to it fall short of what we Thursday, 4 December 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 12159 might have hoped for. ,One of these is the issue of human rights. Aid to reduce poverty must be based on fundamental human rights principles, including the right to development. The Simons report is unquestionably weak in the human rights area. It speaks loosely of support for good government. One is always interested in what the term 'good government' means. I recently had an interesting conversation with the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Barry Jones). He was questioning what is actually meant by 'good government'. It sometimes seems as though it is one of these weaselly phrases that people throw in which covers all things. We support good government but we are not quite sure exactly what people mean when they use the term. often explains to me things which I have some doubt about. I do not always necessarily go along with his explanation but I am always grateful when I receive it. tion on human rights, and the government's response is little better. For our part, Labor is determined to give a high priority to support for, and enhancement of, the full range of human rights for people in developing countries. To do so is a central and integrating element of our approach to overseas aid. Although there is no mention in the report, or in the minister's response to the report, of human rights, I must say in all fairness that I do strongly support recent directions outlined by the minister to strengthen human rights assistance in our aid programs. Like all members of parliament, I am often challenged on the aid question. One group in the community argues that Australia does not give enough overseas aid and claims that what it does give is poorly channelled. Another group points out the real or imagined economic problems we have in this country and suggests that, really, charity begins at home. Well, as I heard someone say the, other day, 'Charity does begin at home but it need not necessarily stay there though.' Some would say that there should be no government aid at all and that all aid should be raised through the private sector. I suppose that, as in all things, government action is a matter of competing interests, but I believe that this government has made a significant contribution to poverty alleviation through the Australian aid program. Of course, those who argue that Australia should give no overseas aid overlook the fact that much of this money is spent in Australia, or by employing Australians on overseas aid projects. I know the linking of aid to trade is a contentious issue. Nevertheless, it is an issue of considerable economic significance to many Australians. I have a point of disagreement with many of my friends in the aid field because I see nothing wrong with tied aid if we can not only give some assistance to the elimination of poverty--or whatever the aid is going for-but also give some assistance in Australia. I recently heard the Leader of the National Party( Mr Tim Fischer) talking about aid-it might have been at one of the seminars or in this chamber-and he made the very valid point, I thought, that one of the ways he could sell aid to his rural constituency was to tie it in with a trade thing. Some of the academic arguments on aid do not always agree with that. They say that it should be given to an international organisation or it should just be given. Well, I went to PNG a couple of years ago and I saw the result of untied aid there. And, ever since, I have been a firm advocate for the provision of tied aid.",141,Representatives Main Committee

Commissioning reports and reviews is no substitute for real political commitment to deliver the goods and to be held accountable for one's performance. As I said earlier in my remarks, we clearly need to mobilise greater political will across the international community if the world is to successfully meet the challenge of global poverty. Mr Deputy Speaker, like other members of parliament, I visited many Australian overseas projects and I have always found them to be well run and of great benefit wherever they are. I guess that when the question of aid is raised with you by constituents, as it is with me, the Mekong Friendship Bridge is always mentioned. I actually doubt that any other issue has generated as much misinformation as the Mekong Friendship Bridge. I visited this bridge in 1994. As you know, it is the first road link between Laos and Thailand and will yield significant economic benefits to both countries. If anyone needs any proof of this, they have only to look at the entrepreneurial activities that are already taking place on the Thai side of the bridge. One of the other things that people often overlook about that bridge is that it is one of the highest profile aid projects undertaken by Australia in recent years. It was completed under time and under budget and the bridge is a showcase for what Australians can deliver in technology, design and infrastructure transfer. As such, it is very important in our expanding trade relationship with Asia. Mr Deputy Speaker, population issues have continued to be an important aspect of Australia's overseas aid program. As one who is convinced that overpopulation and economic underdevelopment are closely linked, I welcome the emphasis in our aid program on population issues. The priority which the aid program affords population issues was reflected in the major role that All,,tralia played at the International Conference on Population and Development held in Calro in December 1994. Australia was active in encouraging the international conference to adopt the groundbreaking program of action for the empowerment of women and called for major increases in global resources for family planning and health services. Australia has, unfortunately, cut, in the first budget of the Howard government, our assistance to some of the UN programs and the International Planned Parenthood Federation and although in the last budget they were not cut again that funding was not restored. I know that there are serious budgetary considerations that everyone has got to look at but I do hope that in the foreseeable future that funding can be restored to the UN Fund for Population and Development and especially the International Planned Parenthood Federation. In the budgetary context it is not a huge amount of money but to those organisations it is and it has a significant impact on programs that the IPPF were undertaking in our region in the Pacific Islands. Quite frankly, we have a special responsibility to this area. The Americans have withdrawn recently from aid programs in the Pacific Islands. I do not think the New Zealanders are in a position to contribute much more than they do. Unless we pick up the challenge no-one else will. I hope that the government will look at that very carefully and maybe restore some of the funding that was cut a couple of years ago. I sometimes think that Australia wants to do less with less money but Australia can do more and if we do not do more we are failing in our responsibility. We are also passing up an opportunity, especially in our part of the world, to playa significant leadership role and I think that that is a responsibility that we should take up. Thursday, 4 December 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 12161 I congratulate all those associated with the seminar. It was a worthwhile seminar and is part of the excellent series of programs that the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee has been carrying out over these last couple of years. week immediately after the gentleman from Throsby( Mr Hollis). said but he did not stay. This time. I am not going to pick him up on very much. He concluded on a point that I think often strikes at the very heart of the whole aid debate. That is that we would like to spend more but obviously times are tight and it is not always possible. Some very hard decisions have to be made on where you are going to spend the money because there are so many competing causes on which one would like to spend money. I think one of the most difficult things is-and Mr Hollis drew attention to the fact-that some particular funding that he was interested in would have been a relatively small contribution for the government to make. I was in India and Pakistan last year and I remember in Pakistan going to a particular village on the outskirts of Islamabad where poverty was quite appalling. I think the honourable gentleman from Maribyrnong ( Mr Sercombe) was with me. It was incredible irony that we had had a meeting with the president of Pakistan which was scheduled for half an hour but ran for about an hour and a half. That was the president, I might add, who I think today was removed from office in Pakistan. most incredible poverty. They had actually survived for some years with a donation of about $100,000 from Australia. We had just announced to these kids and families who were living in the most appalling conditions that we were withdrawing our support. One was tempted to say: how could we possibly do that? Of course, the irony was further stretched in that, because we got there late, we did not stay there for very long, and we were then pressured to go to the Prime Minister's residence for lunch. We went to the Prime Minister's residence for lunch, cutting our visit to this village short because of the time pressures. We then sat around waiting for ages and found we were not having lunch with the Prime Minister, but with the Prime Minister's husband, who was then minister for development or something like that. arrive. We then proceeded to dine off gold plates in the most incredible opulence, a matter of a handful of kilometres from where we had seen this poverty. One, of course, was saying, 'Well, why isn't some of that money being spent in their own country on the poor people?' I am not making a particular judgment in this case. I am merely trying to identify that there are incredibly difficult choices to be made in this whole area. I did promise the member for Throsby by way of interjection during his contribution that I would try to enlighten him on the subject of governance. He referred to a conversation he had had with the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Barry Jones) about the subject of governance and what it meant.

He has discussed this subject with me, and I think, frankly, that he gets hung up a bit on the use of language. It seems to me that governance in this area has a fairly straightforward definition. Governance really comprises any measures that we can take to assist a country that is in difficulties-Third World countries, obviously-to run the show better. That might take a number of forms. It may involve lending them some experts in the form of public servants to help plan the economy and the budget. It may be lending them parliamentary draftsmen to assist with the drafting of theit legislation-although sometimes, seeing some of our drafting, I am not so sure about that. We have, on occasions, seconded or sent for visits for training clerks from our own parliament to the parliaments of other countries to assist them in their procedures and the way they run the place. It seems to me that governance is all about trying to develop, train and bring on a lot of those Third World countries so that the countries are run more effectively and efficiently. It seems to me that that is a very important thing for us to do in the long term. Prior to the contribution by the member for Throsby, we heard from the right honourable member for New England( Mr Sinclair). I would support three of his comments. I commend members of the Simons committee. I also commend Australian NGOs who do such an incredible job overseas, usually in quite difficult circumstances. I am particularly impressed with, for example, the volunteers from organisations such as AESOP. I also agree with the key thrust of the contribution by the right honourable member for New England when he talked about the importance of making people better off in order to secure stability in their country and in the region and because that is the best way to advance human rights. I think those are important key points. Mr Deputy Speaker, we are here this morning to talk about the Simons committee report and the seminar that was held by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign affairs, Defence and Trade into that report. As we have already heard, to some extent that seminar has now been overtaken by the reality of the government's response which was made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr Downer) on 18 November this year in a ministerial statement entitled 'Better aid for a better future'. I would like to remind the House that the government now has established six principles in terms of the way that it will administer aid in the future. These include: adopting a partnership approach; responding to urgent needs in emergency situations; providing practical assistance; applying greater targeting-not a scatter gun approach, but really being more focused in the way we do things; ensuring that programs remain identifiably Australian; and ensuring that programs are outward looking-in other words, not just doing what we have done before but looking around the world for best practice and new, innovative and more effective ways of delivering our aid. The government has also identified five key sectors in which aid will be distributed: health, education, infrastructure, rural development, and governance-that word that the gentleman from Throsby had some difficulty with, and which I have already addressed. In the time left to me, I would like to paint a few word pictures from my own experience, because we all travel and look at aid projects when we go overseas whenever we can. I would like to give a few examples of some of the things that Australian aid is doing, because I think it is important that the public understand the sorts of uses that our aid is put to. Thursday, 4 December 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 12163 Let me give an example in that first key area of health. I was recently in the South Pacific and one of the countries I went to was Vanuatu. As a result of television as, everybody in Australia thinks of Vanuatu as a holiday destination. We got in at Port Vila at about 1 0' clock in the morning and at six o'clock the next morning-we did not have long in bed-we were on a rickety old plane going out to one of the southern islands called Tanna. Tanna is hardly a nice holiday destination. At that stage, we visited the hospital. The hospital was about to close down its generator for lack of fuel due to shipping strikes. The conditions in the hospital were really quite appalling. In this country our animals are sent to better buildings and conditions when they go to the vet than the people who were being looked after in this place. Tanna is staffed by a single doctor, who was a volunteer from Canada. The doctors in the city of Victoria on Vanc01.-ver Island in Canada have got together and sent one of their number for six months at a time to be the doctor on Tanna. The doctors do it voluntarily and it is unpaid. All the costs and so on are funded by the doctor community in Victoria. A number of Australian organisations have been there to help put in generators, other equipment and so on. Quite clearly, the basic health problems in Tanna are quite serious. Unless the standard of health is improved, then the kids are not going to be able to go to school and get their education. If they cannot get their education, then they are not going to get jobs. It is a very similar scenario in many ways to a lot of the indigenous communities in this country. But in Tanna we were providing assistance to that hospital and it was very vitally needed assistance. It is a basic building block to get the people in that location back on their feet. An example in the education area is Kiribati, which I visited on the same trip to the South Pacific. Kiribati is a country of about 77,000 people. Its area of land on many little islands is quite small, but it is spread over more than 3,500 kilometres of ocean. In other words, there is a huge area of sea and very little land. It is bigger than Australia from east to west, but the area of land is less than the size of Canberra. Clearly, education is a problem because they cannot afford to have schools on every island in every community. So particularly at the secondary level, they bring the children from all over the country to a single location on a particular island where they run their secondary school-and sometimes it takes three weeks to· get to school. Obviously, the children board there. So apart from needing the basics of education, they need to have living facilities as well. The straw huts on mud earth that the kids used to have to live in for 11 months of the year-they only go to their home island for a month during the long school holiday-were really quite appalling. Australia has built an accommodation block, which has improved the conditions incredibly. And you would think that was great. But I walked into that accommodation block with other members of the delegation. Of course, it has a concrete floor and the kids are sleeping on the concrete floor. They have no private lockers to keep their things in, they each have a suitcase or a bag of some sort. So it is very primitive accommodation, although it is a heck of a lot better than it was before. Clearly, what we have done there will help those children in terms of their standard of living. It will help them to be in better shape to learn and to be educated and therefore better fitted to take on a role later in life. Infrastructure is obviously a key area. I was in Laos recently and we visited a village in the south of the country. We travelled in a rather rickety 30-year-old Russian helicopter. In this village of 400 or 500 people, they have had to tramp several miles-usually the women12164 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 December 1997 carrying a bucket on their head to try to draw water from a very muddy, polluted river and then bring it all the way back to the village. That, of course, had the inevitable impact of disease and so on. What Australian aid managed to do, for $100, was to sink a bore and a well in the middle of the village and provide them for the first time ever with fresh, clean, drinking water. So not only did it stop all that labour of having to walk for miles, but it provided better quality water on hand which clearly is going to improve the health standards of that particular village-and for $100. It is absolutely incredible. The other thing that Australia did was to build a dam on the local river-which flows mightily during the wet season and stops during the dry season-for a few thousand dollars, which will supply them with water to grow their crops throughout the year. Those sorts of basic infrastructure projects are most important. The previous speaker mentioned the Mekong bridge which links Laos with Thailand. Australia is also building a number of other bridges in the southern part of Laos because you cannot get by road from the north to the south of the country, so how do you get communications going; how do you develop the country economically; how does it get back on its feet if you have not got a road? Because of the number of rivers, one of the key things is that you need to provide bridges as well. I could go on at some length, Madam Deputy Speaker, but I see that my time is about to expire. In the few seconds remaining to me, I would like to say that nearest to home we have PNG, which is of major concern to us and I think it could be the subject of a whole new debate. I would like to commend the report to the chamber. morning to contribute to this debate on the government's response to the Simons report on Australia's aid program. In his introduction to this response, the Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr Downer) said: Mass poverty is the single most important economic and social issue on our planet today. I have spoken in the House before about the desperate need of those who are trapped in mass poverty, particularly in the developing nations. Nineteen ninety-six was the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty but, unfortunately, poverty was not eradicated. It is true that more focus was drawn to the needs of the poverty stricken in that year and we as a government will continue to work in partnership with the people in those countries to alleviate some of their suffering. There are many ordinary Australian families who playa financially supportive role in the alleviation of poverty through World Vision and other child sponsorship programs. Australians as a people are generous with their gifts to those in need. But one of the best ways we can help alleviate poverty in the world is to help those in poverty to help themselves. It was pleasing to note the government's agreed objective that our Australian overseas aid program will be-and I quote: ... 'to advance Australia's national interests by assisting developing countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development'. The aid program will be focused and targeted to maximise the outcomes for investment made.

295,Mr Charles (La Trobe) (10.43 A.m.),"I am delighted to have the opportunity thisThursday, 4 December 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 12165 end hunger and poverty throughout the world. I would like to read a note I received from two of their members earlier this week: At last we see the Government response to the Simons report. It's great to hear that the Government has endorsed poverty reduction as the main goal of foreign aid and retained the target of .7% of GNP and that aid projects will now get greater supervision and scrutiny. Wow. What happens now? This government will provide an effective and well-targeted aid program, focussing on the alleviation of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development. Our focus will also be on meeting the priority needs of the partner countries. Aid is a partnership between the giver and the receiver. We, in this government, are very much aware of the partnership aspects of our aid programs. The best partnerships are those where all partners enjoy a mutual benefit, and that is the aim of our aid program. One of the most successful methods of obtaining that mutual benefit is through micro-credit. The Grameen Bank has a proud record of providing small loans to people in developing countries. Many of the borrowers are women who may use the money to buy a few chickens that they can breed for eating or to produce eggs that they will sell. The money might be used to buy a sewing machine to set up a small sewing business. Other loans have been used to buy two or three cows for milking. Many of these enterprises have achieved incredible success for the borrowers, have lifted them out of the depths of poverty, and even allowed families to send their children to school. Micro-credit gives people the opportunity to escape the poverty trap through their own efforts and own achievement with dignity-a hand-up, not a handout. Basic education is another focus of our aid program. The annual report states: Education is development's most basic building block and is vital for alleviating poverty. Our education efforts will concentrate on building a broad range of education assistance, with a particular focus on basic and technical education. We all know from our own experience in Australia that, without the most basic literacy and numeracy skills, people's futures are limited. This is even more so in the developing world, particularly for women and girls. For sustainable development to occur, countries need essential infrastructure and, in particular, a clean and safe water supply-a basic necessity which we often take for granted. If more of us were to travel in Third World countries, where the water supply is almost non-existent and what is available is undrinkable, we might better appreciate the value of the water that we have in this country. In India, for example, it often is not even safe to swim in rivers because of the pollution, contamination and waterborne diseases. Our aid resources will carefully target vital infrastructure services to ensure that private funding is not displaced, while reaching those people most in need. Micro-hydro is one way of helping remote and small communities without damage to the environment and at minimal cost. The annual report states: Preventing environmental degradation is essential to alleviation of poverty and ensuring development is sustainable. Very poor people concentrate on day to day survival ... poor health prohibits them from earning income and overcoming poverty. Australia's aid program will make that investment in sustainable agriculture, improved sanitation, clean water and better management of national resources. We know that these issues 12166 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 December 1997 are critical to the alleviation of poverty. Australia is committed to working in partnership with the receiving countries to address these environmental issues. All of the above broad based programs for economic growth, sustainable development and individual empowerment will contribute to the reduction of poverty that the Simons report has recommended. Despite the Simons report recommendation that the aid volume target of 0.7 per cent be reduced, the government will continue to recognise the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP as an indicative target. All foreign aid, like all other government programs, will be considered in the annual budget context. I am pleased to note the government has accepted the recommendations to focus our Australian aid program on the Asia-Pacific region. This is our geographical home and the focus of our region are our neighbours. Although in economic and technological terms the world is shrinking, Australia is not about to float away to somewhere else. It is right that our aid programs should be focused on Papua New Guinea and the Pacific and East Asia, and selectively in South Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Priorities will be on a development needs basis in conjunction with Australia's broader interests. The minister has noted that the Simons report made 79 recommendations, of which the government has accepted 64 fully, in part or in principle; nine have been rejected, of which reducing the UN target of 0.7 per cent was one; and six have been noted for further consideration. The government's response to the Simons report is responsible and fair. The recommendations rejected have been judged against the overall aid program. This government and, indeed, Australia as a nation have a proud record of aid to the developing world. We will continue to focus that aid on the alleviation of poverty through individual empowerment, sustainable development, primary health and basic education that is of benefit to all parties involved. I recommend the government's response to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Sercombe) adjourned. Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Report Debate resumed from 20 October 1997, on motion by Mr Sinclair: That the House take note of the paper. wealth is something that most of us do not really think about daily as we go about our lives. It is an organisation which, for some, is still associated more with the days of empire than it is with today. It was for that reason and because of the imminence of CHOGM-the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting-in Edinburgh that we decided it would be worthwhile conducting, on 20 August last, the seminar on the Commonwealth of Nations. This report, From Empire to partnership, lists those who participated. It sets out the actual text of the quite significant contributions made. It also comes forward with a report from our committee making some comment on the dialogue at the seminar and making some recommendations, and it is on those that I want to say a few things this morning. On the Commonwealth itself, I think its relevance to our daily lives is perhaps more through sport, and perhaps in some of the other visits that we receive, than in any other form. It is, of course, the countries predominantly of the British Commonwealth. We now have, however, one country in the African region that was a colony of another power, and there is an increasing feeling amongst a lot of countries that the nature of the Commonwealth changing",148,Representatives Main Committee
296,Mr Sinclair (New England) (10.51 A.m.),"The nature and character of the CommonThursday, 4 December 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 12167 brings with it the prospect of our forgetting some aspects of that original association and bringing us into a new grouping which does give perhaps new life for the future. The first thing I should say is that the role of the Commonwealth emerged, for most of us, as being far more significant and having far more meaning for Australia than many of us had expected. Certainly, from my point of view, I came away from the Commonwealth seminar feeling that, in spite of my own reservations over the years, there was an ongoing role for Australia as a member of the Commonwealth and that the Commonwealth was a worthwhile international organisation. I say that as one who was a little amazed at the extent to which successive prime ministers have taken unto themselves the role of being statesman in CHOGM and seen that as a way to enhance their international egos. That probably is a bit harsh on some, but unfortunately it is true of them all. It has been quite remarkable that all of them-and I say 'all of them', from my experience from Menzies to Howard-have found that the dialogue at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting has given them a stature that I think they do not feel they receive at home. That is a good thing. Apart from anything else it gives them an opportunity to talk with a lot of other heads of state. Sometimes we are a bit critical of outcomes. If the Commonwealth is to achieve anything then it will be more to do with preserving what we all respect in our British heritage. When you look at Nigeria, you cannot say that it has done so. There are three matters I would like to mention here. Firstly, I would like to see the principle of the rule of law accepted so that there is an independent judiciary, there are rights for people to act on behalf of accused persons, and there is a set structure of law which is not based on providing benefits to the few but rather allowing equal rights to all within society. Secondly, our British heritage brings with it the tradition of a free press. While most of us, certainly all politicians, are fairly critical of the press and the press does need to be more responsible, that does not in any way deny the need for us to preserve the concept of an independent, free media. These days when the electronic media has provided such an enormous opportunity for people, whatever their background, to see what is going on immediately it happens, that freedom of the media becomes even more important. So, the rule of law and a free media are two very important matters. The third issue, which almost flows from those two but, tragically, does not apply in many countries, concerns democratic institutions. I am referring to the opportunity for people to determine who is going to be their government in a fair, free and open electoral system. Unfortunately, some of the members of the Commonwealth do not follow that principle either. To my mind, those three issues are the most important benefits of Commonwealth membership. I regret that some Commonwealth countries have set aside those basic principles. Yet, without those principles, coming to fair and equitable resolution of difficult domestic problems is extraordinarily difficult. At the moment Nigeria is suspended from membership. Fiji was suspended but has now returned. I hope that there can be ongoing efforts to try to lift the profile of those issues because they are the most important part of being members of the Commonwealth. Let me return briefly to the conclusions and recommendations in the report. We looked at what we saw as the benefits to the Commonwealth, and there are several benefits from Australia's perspective. The sporting association is undoubted. We all look forward to the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur next year. They will provide yet again a wonderful 12168 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 December 1997 opportunity for Australian athletes to compete internationally and to gain experience in another environment. That is very good and we should endorse those Commonwealth contacts. Of course, there are problems in any international sporting competition to do with what sports should be included and with ensuring that drugs are not seen as permissible and hence distorting what are normal competitive opportunities. In terms of determining what sports should be included, I have always thought that international games like the Commonwealth Games are better if confined to individual sports and that team sports are better played in other environments. Be that as it may, it is very good that there are these Commonwealth Games. Amongst the recommendations we looked at other fields, including the educational field. Our first recommendation suggests: ... the establishment of a Commonwealth resources centre. We had in mind looking at how we can provide opportunities for improving education levels and contact between Commonwealth countries. Another recommendations which I very strongly support, and I hope the government might support, is: That, the Australian Government, as part of its aid program, set aside a defined number of scholarships for students from Commonwealth countries to assist with tertiary and post-graduate education in Australia. I wanted to mention that because in our aid program in Africa, for example, we have tended to forget there are a lot of smaller countries that receive very little aid. Yet those few scholarships we have provided in the past were a very good vehicle to help numbers of residents of those countries to lift their standard of living, their understanding and their education and so go back home and lift the general quality of government and quality of life in their own countries. In education I think there is a role that the Commonwealth can play. Australia should take a lead in promoting those educational scholarships, but of course not only Australia. I would. like to see all the countries of the Commonwealth offer similar educational opportunities for people of other countries. I know that in the past many have gone to Britain. Today the same opportunities exist, certainly in all of the countries of what is called the old Commonwealth. But in the new Commonwealth countries too some of the education institutions are very good and reciprocity in that field is worthwhile. The first area was sport and the second was education. The third that I want to tum to is the suggestion that perhaps we might reinstitute a regional Commonwealth heads of government meeting. We seem to have a great plethora of international groups. We have got APEC and the ARF, the ASEAN Regional Forum. We even have the finance ministers plus six group. We have various defence arrangements and people might well say, 'Well, you've got a Commonwealth heads of government meeting. What on earth do you want a regional heads of government meeting for?' One of the reasons I think it is important at the moment is that Britain has withdrawn from east of Suez totally now-it has got its residual interest in Pitcairn about which I spoke yesterday. Apart from that, what we want to do is to try to look at our region. The countries of our region include some very fragile ecosystems in the Pacific islands. Many of them are members of the British Commonwealth and if we had a regional heads of government meeting-I know we have got a South Pacific Forum and a South Pacific Commission but this would be a bit different-it would provide in areas I think are important that I have mentioned before-democratic institutions, the rule of law and a free press-an opportunity for people to talk about the systems of government. For example, PNG is a member of the Thursday, 4 December 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 12169 Commonwealth. How beneficial it would be if the people of PNG were constantly being reminded of the principles that, in a democracy such as theirs, seem to be stretched by patronage and corruption which, if the present media reports are to be believed, again threaten its. very viability. I think a regional Commonwealth heads of government meeting would be worthwhile from time to time so we could have a look at some of the ways in which we could help each other. It would provide an opportunity to get Britain perhaps and the old Commonwealth-I would include countries like India and Pakistan-to look at problems in our region and see whether or not we might be able to help each other to a greater degree. That was another recommendation we included in our report. We have mentioned also the promotion of democratic values. I think that is worthwhile. Recommendation 6, in fact, picks up those general points that I have been making. We talk about the Commonwealth Games Association. We talk also about non-government organisations. Because we all start from the same principles, there is a great advantage in looking at Commonwealth NGOs. CARE, for example, is one of those which does a great job. I think that it is important that we find ways to promote NGOs to assist the government funded aid by working through Red Cross, CARE and other bodies which have an international association. Quite often, our Australian-based NGOs can get additional finance and additional resources and can better address the problems that are still so regrettably abundant around the world. We believe that it is worthwhile to support the work of Commonwealth NGOs and we can do this in a number of ways. Again, this was an aspect that was discussed fairly extensively at the seminar. We also thought it might be worthwhile having a regional Commonwealth trade ministers meeting. The Commonwealth is, of course, not a trade association, but I confess that it has never really pleased me greatly having members of our royal family going about promoting British trade interests. I felt that it would be far better if they recognised that they are really there, if they are promoting trade, to promote the trade of the Commonwealth rather than of any individual member of it. We felt, having looked at some of the aspects of trade, that Commonwealth trade and finance ministers might be able to meet from time to time with some benefit to all of the participants. The final area mentioned was human rights. We did look at problems. I have mentioned Nigeria. Many members of the Commonwealth are, regrettably, virtually one-party states. These countries have human rights practices which are at a level which is less than what Australians would regard as acceptable. It is important that we find ways in which we can strengthen consideration of human rights issues. We felt that it was worthwhile strengthening the role and resources of the Commonwealth's human rights unit so that we might be able to promote and protect human rights in the member countries. I thought the seminar was well worthwhile. We had an excellent day's discussion. As one who has long been cynical about aspects of the Commonwealth, I felt that it displayed that Australia not only has an ongoing role within the Commonwealth, but has a contribution to make. In that respect, I would hope that, with the constitutional convention coming up, one of the issues on which there will not be a great deal of debate is that Australia should continue-whatever the outcome of our own sovereignty question-to be a member of the Commonwealth and that the Queen should remain at its head. 12170 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 December 1997 I commend this report to members and to the wider community. It emphasises the extent to which we have transferred from the old empire to a modern partnership. It is no longer the British Commonwealth; it is very much a Commonwealth of partners and of equals, and I think Australia has a very important role to play in it. I recommend that the government should accept each of the recommendations included within our paper attached to the seminar proceedings. on 20 August 1997 was one of a number that the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade has conducted over the last year. As I said in speaking to reports of the other seminars, they have been excellent seminars which have been very well attended-not necessarily so well attended by members of parliament, which I think is a pity, but very well attended by some members of parliament, the academic community, the defence and diplomatic communities. I doubt whether we see the relevance of the Commonwealth today. For too many people, there were elements of a colonial relationship there, and they did not regard it as a meeting of equals. A point referred to by the right honourable member for New England( Mr Sinclair) is that one of the reasons---or a symbol, if you like, rather than a reason-is that Her Majesty the Queen, although head of the Commonwealth, is very much seen as the Queen of England. Something that has always niggled me a little bit is when Her Majesty the Queen visits somewhere as Queen of England and promotes British industry and trade. If we are to take that role seriously, Her Majesty the Queen, as head of the Commonwealth, in a way should not play a role in promoting one country over another, or she should promote all countries. The Commonwealth does play an important role. Currently, there are 53 members. Again, one of the points made by the right honourable member for New England-I do not want to have to agree with everything he said-was something I had thought about myself. I debated whether I wanted to attend this seminar because I was always quite sceptical about the Commonwealth. I was quite sceptical about its worth. I thought it was part of the past of Australia and I, like many people, saw our future in Asia and places like that. I thought: what relevance has the Commonwealth got for us today? Very rarely is a member of parliament persuaded by a one-day seminar held in Parliament House, but I came away from that seminar with a completely changed view on the role of the Commonwealth. NowI am a very strong advocate for the role that the Commonwealth can play in so many fields-not only the sporting links that we all talk about, but the trade links and the political links. After that one-day seminar, I was very much convinced of the worth ofMr Sinclair interjectingmore members of parliament did not attend, for the range of speakers and the quality of the debate was excellent. I would strongly recommend to people that they should read the report on the proceedings because there were some excellent contributions that day. Membership of the Commonwealth is entirely voluntary and a number of former British dependencies, mandates or protectorates, such as Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Burma and the Sudan,",150,Representatives Main Commitiee

300,Mr Hollis,"That was because of the excellence of that seminar. It is a great pity thatThursday, 4 December 1997 MAIN COMMITIEE 12171 and several of the Gulf states, decided against membership when achieving independence. It might have been a very different Commonwealth if they had come in. Some countries have also left and, in some cases, later have rejoined the Commonwealth. Ireland withdrew its membership in 1949, and South Africa did not reapply for admission after becoming a republic in 1961, finally being readmitted on 1 June 1994. Pakistan left in 1972 and rejoined on 1 October 1989. Fiji's membership lapsed when it did not reapply after adopting a republican constitution following the military coup in 1987. At the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in November 1995, Nigeria's membership was suspended due to concerns about persistent human rights violations. There are many countries which have applied to join the Commonwealth. For example, the most recent member of the Commonwealth is Mozambique, a country with no historic links with the British Empire. It was admitted to the Commonwealth in 1995 as 'a unique and special case'. It is the first Commonwealth member to be neither formerly under British rule, nor that of another Commonwealth country. Nor does it use the English language substantially for top-level political and administrative purposes. During the seminar it was felt that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was not devoting sufficient attention and emphasis to the Commonwealth. This is particularly important with regard to trade. The importance of the economic dimension of the Commonwealth was recognised in the setting of the theme-trade, investment and development matters--of the 1997 CHOGM. The significance of the Commonwealth in economic issues was clearly acknowledged in 1996 by the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee report. While it is still the case that some members of the Commonwealth are amongst the poorest in the world and rightly deserve the help and support of the richer developed world, the organisation now also contains some of the world's fastest growing economies--or it did when I wrote this speech; some things change quite dramatically these days-and even some of the richest. The Commonwealth today embraces what may well tum out to be one of the world's fastest growing markets. Could it be that the very features which were seen by some as Commonwealth weaknesses in previous areas, such as a transregional character and its diversity, could now prove to be its strength? At the August seminar, the academic and author, Katherine West, spoke of the importance of the Commonwealth as economies become more globalised and competitive, providing as it does opportunities for regional and transregional networking. Even some of the most sceptical members are now expressing far more positive perceptions of the Commonwealth as a low-cost, ready-made transregional network, or a series of networks-according to Ms West-through which members in one region can improve their capacity to benefit from economic and diplomatic opportunities as well as other regions of the world. While the Commonwealth contains some of the richest countries, as I have said, and countries with extremely high economic growth rates, it also includes some of the poorest countries in the world; There are great variations in per capita income, economic strength, and ability to participate in international trade and investment across the Commonwealth countries. Of the 53 Commonwealth members, some 29 are defined as small-that is, having populations of less than one million-and 14 have fewer than 200,000 people. Small states are a continuing focus of the Commonwealth work and now receive about 65 per cent of the Commonwealth's technical assistance. The Commonwealth does not have a legal regime in place to address human rights issues, but such concerns were central to the 12172 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 December 1997 Singapore declaration in 1971, the Harare declaration in 1991 and, most recently, in the Millbrook action plan arising from the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Auckland in 1995. The Singapore declaration sought to strengthen the influence of the United Nations for international peace and security, to strive to promote institutions and guarantees for personal freedom under law, to combat racial prejudice in colonialism, to overcome poverty, ignorance and disease and to achieve a more equitable international society. These principles were affirmed in the Harare declaration, described by the then Commonwealth Secretary-General as 'a landmark to guide our association'. In that declaration, the heads of government reaffirmed their commitment to equal rights and opportunities for all citizens regardless of race, colour, creed or political belief; to equality for women; and to the provision of universal access to education for all their populations. They pledged the Commonwealth to work with renewed vigour in the protection and promotion of the fundamental political values of the Commonwealth-democracy, the rule of law, just and honest government and fundamental human rights. They decided on continuing action to help end apartheid and bring democracy to South Africa, in which they were successful. The human rights record of many Commonwealth countries is poor. Although it is unwise to generalise, there are difficulties in many states ranging from comparative minor abuses-,...if such a thing really does exist in regard to human rights-to appalling violations of the most basic of human rights. As the seminar was told, the contemporary commonplace disregard of human rights means that a post-apartheid, post-colonial Commonwealth offers cold comfort to common people. Ms Gilmore, the National Director of Amnesty International, documented a number of specific human rights abuses across a range of Commonwealth countries. She also noted the wide variations amongst Commonwealth countries in regard to the international agreements on human rights. I think this is one area where the Commonwealth can play a much more positive role in regard to human rights. We make much in this country-and, indeed, in much of the Commonwealth-about the Westminster parliamentary system of democracy. We make much of the basis of our law, which is the common law which has evolved through the ages in the United Kingdom. It is also the case-and I know this is a point that the right honourable member for New England touched on-with the education system. So often we talk about the education system. The education system, and especially the higher education system, in this country has evolved very much from the British education system. Despite what people might or might not believe about what happens in Northern Ireland, I think that the British have a good record on human rights. It seems to me that, as a member of the Commonwealth, we can set a higher penalty for violations of human rights because there are tremendous violations of human rights in many of the Commonwealth countries. I think that diminishes the work of the Commonwealth. The role of the Commonwealth is changing and evolving. It is a modem partnership today. It has its weaknesses, especially with regard to human rights. I think that some times some members of the Commonwealth are a little reticent to comment on the internal affairs of another country. As far as I am concerned, human rights overcomes that. I am not one who necessarily subscribes to the United Nations charter article 2 paragraph 7. Some internal affairs of countries should override that part of the United Nations convention. Thursday, 4 December 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 12173 As I said earlier, it was an excellent seminar. I congratulate all involved in it. I would recommend to my parliamentary colleagues-I know the amount of reading they have to dothat they have a look through this report because they will be, as I was, quite surprised with the quality of the debate at that conference that day. I commend this report to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Tuckey) adjourned. Electoral Matters Committee Report Debate resumed from 20 October, on motion by Mr Nairn: That the House take note of the paper. into the role of the Australian Electoral Commission in conducting industrial elections. I should say that it is not commonly appreciated that not only trade unions but also employer organisations are industrial organisations. The report is as equally relevant to those employer organisations as it is to trade unions. The report is a very balanced and constructive document. It is really quite astounding that it is a unanimous report in circumstances where there could be thought to have been some controversy. Indeed, there were some questions and answers in the federal parliament indicating that the inquiry may have been in the nature of a witch hunt or a scapegoating exercise. That certainly was not the case. I think it is to the credit of the chairman and members of the committee generally that they were able to come up with very sensible terms of reference and produce such a constructive document. I also indicate appreciation for the role of Mr David Dick, who was seconded to assist the committee. He really was very talented in his knowledge of the area. As a matter of interest, he prepared one of the best historical analyses I have seen of legislation dealing with elections in industrial organisations. That in itself is very worthwhile reading for anyone who has an interest in the area. Overall, the report found that the Australian Electoral Commission conducts industrial elections in a very professional and even-handed manner. That was the evidence from not only trade unions but also employer organisations . .I think it could be regarded as quite an endorsement of the work of the Australian Electoral Commission. There were over 3,500 elections in industrial organisations between 1991 and 1996. Of that number, only 1.5 per cent has resulted in inquiries, and only a fraction of that 1.5 per cent has involved allegations of fraudulent conduct. The sensationalism that we can sometimes read in the media regarding trade union or industrial organisation elections occurs in a very small percentage of organisations. It has been noted that you can have all the penalties and regimes in the world in legislation, but that does not prevent fraudulent conduct. Fraud occurs anyway. By its nature, it is unlawful conduct. It is very difficult for a legislature to legislate to stamp out fraud. What the legislature can do, of course, is to prescribe penalties for fraudulent conduct and an enforcement regime. In the context of the report, we have recommended some strengthening of penalties and some procedures which we believe will minimise fraud, particularly as it could occur in the electoral process, by cross-verifying the information on the outside of an envelope, for instance, with the voter roll.",154,Representatives Main Committee
301,Mr Mcclelland (Barton) (11.19 A.m.),"I rise to take note of the report of the inquiry12174 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 December 1997 I think it is fair to say that some elements of the media would have liked to have seen a much more controversial, a much more sensational document. They have been sadly let down because it is not that. As I have said, it is an overall endorsement of the role of the Australian Electoral Commission in conducting industrial elections. Several witnesses place great emphasis on the findings of the Cooke inquiry in Queensland, which was conducted by Marshal Cooke, at the behest of the Queensland government, to inquire into the activities of five Queensland trade unions. People who compare our report to the report of the Cooke inquiry should bear in mind that the Cooke inquiry was established under Queensland legislation to look at five Queensland-registered trade unions, not federallyregistered organisations. Those five unions were referred to the Cooke inquiry because of some pre-existing controversy regarding their behaviour. So the more dramatic findings of the Cooke inquiry very much have to be seen in that context. We have the opportunity of reviewing the totality of the operations under the federal act, which is an entirely separate piece of legislation, the Industrial Relations Act 1988 and now the Workplace Relations Act. We were quite satisfied with the generality of how these elections are being conducted. Without exception, every organisation that attended to give evidence-and the peak body, the Australian Council of Trade Unions-was at pains to indicate their preparedness to assist in ensuring and developing a regime that gave the greatest credibility possible to the electoral processes within their organisations. They saw that it was important that the public had faith in their electoral processes. All gave balanced and sensible evidence in terms of taking the issue forward. In making recommendations which we believe will go some way to strengthening the procedures, we constantly have borne in mind the fundamental principles of freedom of association and the right of industrial organisations to regulate their own affairs. However, in our pluralist system of government, and our system generally, industrial organisations, be they employee organisations or employer organisations, have quite significant power and influence in the political process, the industrial process and these days the social and political 'debate. In that context, the public has a very substantial interest in ensuring that their affairs are regulated legitimately and transparently. So not only an organisation's individual members but also the public can have faith in the authority of their leadership. I mentioned earlier that one of the recommendations to come out of the report was standardisation of envelopes to avoid the situation we saw recently where a judge in one Federal Court case had some anxiety that voting papers may have gone astray or may have been filled in on a multiple basis by certain candidates on both sides in the election. We think that regime will substantially remove the possibility of irregularities occurring. We have also recommended that voting be conducted on the basis of membership cut-off roles. That is, there should be a cut-off between 30 and 60 days before the opening of the ballot to ensure that the membership rolls are in order and that all members who are legitimately entitled to participate in the ballot can and those who are not entitled to participate are excluded from the election. Also, we have recommended the establishment of a menu of model rules for industrial organisations-not in the sense of making those rules mandatory but in the sense of the standard articles of association which are a schedule in the Corporations Law. We believe that having such a menu of model rules will assist both industrial officials and lawyers, for instance, in advising organisations as to establishing a system for elections which as close as Thursday, 4 December 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 12175 possible accords with the law and accords with principles and practices to minimise the occurrence of irregularities. We have also recommended that, after every election that is conducted, the returning officer provide a report concerning the conduct of the ballot. That report will refer to a number of things including whether there were any rules which gave the returning officer some concern, and a recommendation that they be looked at with a view to amending or clarifying them. The report will also contain advice from the returning officer as to the number of voting papers sent out, the number of voting papers that went astray, and any other difficulties that he may have seen. We have recommended that there be an obligation imposed on industrial organisations to publish that report and, if they see fit, their response to that report so that their members are aware of just what occurred in the electoral process. We recommend that the filing of that report be the trigger for a three-month period within which a member must commence an application for an inquiry. We think the current period of 12 months is too long. It can cause administrative uncertainty and dislocation for a member to commence an inquiry right on the death knell of the 12-month period. We have also recommended that the returning officer undertake a sample check on membership rolls. We have not prescribed a percentage but have essentially left that to the discretion of the returning officer. We think that is a means by which the returning officer will be able to get a feel as to whether the union's membership roll is in order, bearing in mind that it is common for organisations to have 80,000 or 90,000 members-indeed for there to be substantial organisations with up to 170,000 members. So getting the membership roll in order is a substantial task in itself. We have recommended that there be consultation between the Australian Electoral Commission and peak industrial organisations, both employee and employer organisations, with a view to developing legislation prohibiting the use of union resources in the conduct of elections. I should say that that is not a phenomenon which we have found to be widespread. Indeed, numerous legal authorities say that trade union officials, or officials of employer organisations, have a fiduciary obligation to their organisations such that they offend those principles if they spend the resources of the organisation On an election campaign. There have been numerous cases establishing that fact. However, there seems to be a problem in that while a member can under section 209 of the act obtain a remedy against the officers that they perform and observe the rules of the organisation, the section does not seem to go so far as to enable a member to seek recovery of any funds spent inappropriately by an officer. There are also other sections in the act which enable the court to make orders rectifying an invalidity, but there is a substantial question as to whether those sections enable the court to order the refund of moneys misspent for improper purposes. It would be good to work out these issues on the basis of cooperation and come up with a mutually acceptable code. In conclusion, can I say that the work of the secretariat was very professional and first-class. I think the approach of all members was balanced and constructive, and the outcome of the report is a great endorsement for the committee system of the parliament. Debate (on motion by Mr Charles) adjourned. 12176 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 December 1997 Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee Report Debate resumed from 23 October, on motion by Mr Reith: That the House take note of the paper. in assisting me to participate in this discussion on the government response to the report by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on Australia's relations with southern Africa. At the outset, can I say that looking at the speakers list today you would think that there was some sort of a double act going on between the right honourable member for New England( Mr Sinclair) and me. Let me assure you that there is not. Most of the reports or items listed for discussion today and for the speakers list come from work that the committee has been involved in over the last couple of years, be it seminars or reports that we brought down. This particular paper is a government response to an inquiry into Australia's relations with southern Africa which was started under the previous Labor government. Indeed, I was chair of that inquiry until the election. And, of course, both the right honourable member for New England and I have a great interest in foreign affairs-hence the number of times we are speaking today. I was a little disappointed in the government response to the report in that, although they were not outright critical, most of the recommendations were fairly wishy-washy and they agreed in part or agreed in principle. There were hardly any strong aspects of agreement; in fact, there were actually four items where the government agreed totally with what the committee recommended. One was the recommendation that Australia, as part of its assistance to southern Africa, include training for small and medium business. Well, yes, the government agreed to that. That is good that they agreed to that. They agreed also that Australia continue to work for a total ban on landmines. Well, yes, of course they agreed with that. We all welcome that. I think it is today in Ottawa that the Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr Downer) is signing that. Just diverting for a moment, I must say that I really support the role of the government in the work that they have done, especially the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on banning landmines. On the recommendation that Austrade research the potential for niche markets for Australia in SADAC countries, yes, they agreed to that. You could hardly disagree with that And there was the recommendation that the Commonwealth government be prepared to consider any feasibility study submitted by the Western Australian government and the University of Western Australia and Curtin University on establishing a Centre for African Studies in Western Australia. Of course that was agreed to as well. One is grateful for what the government agreed to, but they were not terribly profound items. The government said that they did not agree with the recommendation that Austrade participate in the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair in 1997-98. The government argues that, rather than the broad-brush approach, they should identify certain areas. They quote a trade mission led by the Minister for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer. Yes, that is important. But I also think participation is important, as was shown recently with participation in the Hamburg fair. The government has changed its mind on that one, and one would like to think it might be able to change its mind on participation at Zimbabwe because there is",157,Representatives Main Committee
302,Mr Hollis (Throsby) (11.34 A.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for your cooperationThursday, 4 December 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 12177 potential for trade in that part of the world, especially in the mining area. People do not see the potential for trade there but, especially in southern Africa, there is great potential for trade. Australia is not widely represented in southern Africa. In fact, the only places that we have posts at the moment are South Africa and Zimbabwe-there is a post in Nairobi as well. One of the recommendations we made is that Australia increase its representation in Africa, not necessarily, as I have said in this committee before, by opening full diplomatic missions. There are many more innovative ways that we can go about this, such as sharing posts and not having so much of the paraphernalia that goes with a diplomatic post. We were strongly of the view that the post in Harare should have extra staff. The government has rejected that. I really cannot see why it has rejected that. Current and past High Commissioners there have had a wide representation role in that area. Thecurrent High Commissioner represents Australia to something like seven other African states. Some of those states are quite important and have the potential to be quite important for Australia. One that we constantly overlook is Namibia. The potential for our relationship with Namibia is great. We are not represented there. Then there is Mozambique. Mozambique has got problems. As I mentioned in my preceding contribution, it is now a member of the Commonwealth. It has always surprised me that we do not have diplomatic representatives in at least those two countries. We also made a recommendation concerning the Organisation of African Unity. Recommendation 4 reads: that. .. Australia offer encouragement and further practical help to the OAU, if requested, to assist in the development of good governance in Africa, particularly Southern Africa, through exploring alternative conflict resolution strategies. I have made the point before in this House-and it is not covered by this report because we dealt with only the SADC countries of Southern Africa-that, when we got the reference, there was some debate and pressure on us to have a look at Southern Africa. We felt that Africa was such a wide, diverse continent that it would be impossible to bring down a meaningful report, so we thought we should just look at the Southern African region and that string of countries comprising SADC. Even as many of us suspected, the election took over. But the Organisation of African Unity has its headquarters in Addis Ababa. We briefly opened a mission in Addis Ababa some years ago and then quickly closed it. I think it was open for about 12 months. A parliamentary delegation went through that country, led by the current High Commissioner to Zimbabwe. The recommendation of that delegation was that we open a mission in Addis Ababa. I led one of the great delegations of the parliament through Africa a couple of years later-well not so much a delegation but some of the reports of the delegation. By the time we got there, the post had been closed and all the furniture and everything had been flogged off to the Canadians. I thought it was a great tragedy that we did not have a post there, not least because the headquarters of the Organisation of African Unity is a listening post. I have said this somewha.t ad nauseam, but let me repeat it. Perhaps this will be the last time. I use this argument. There was much hand wringing when we failed to gain a position on the UN Security Council. There were all sorts of looking at entrails and going to who voted how. This is a topic of particular interest to me because I will be looking at a few votes myself after sitting down and analysing them. But, nevertheless, there was much analysing of the votes cast-who voted for us and who did not vote for us in that. 12178 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 December 1997 I do not believe we got a very good vote in Africa at all, not least because we have not had adequate representation in the posts in Africa. We do not have any representation in francophone Africa and we expect those people to tum up with the vote. Had we maintained a mission in Addis Ababa, it would have at least been a point of contact for many of those francophone countries. I think it would have been to Australia's benefit, but I am not quite sure if it would have changed the result. Looking at the government response really just reinforces my view that the government does not take Africa terribly seriously. People think that I am just critical of the current government. I do not think that the previous government took it terribly seriously either. For one reason or other, we see our future very much in the Asian region. I agree with that. But what we always tend to do in Australia is to look for one area where we can have influence, or where we see our economic and political future and too often we pass by either our former friendswhether they be the European countries-or the potential for new areas where we can have an influence. Australia, of course, is not a super power. We are a small to middling power, but we can have influence in various regions. In comparing Australia with Sweden, it always surprises me that Sweden, which has a smaller population than Australia, has much more influence in the international community than Australia has. People take the Swedish view quite seriously. That is for many reasons. But we are too closely aligned with the Americans. We are perceived as always going along with them, and we do not develop what we can in various parts of the world. SoI think that the government has missed an opportunity to respond more positively. They have not actually disagreed with much, but they have not agreed with much either. They have agreed in part, or in principle. I think that our relations with Southern Africa are important. From the comments I have received from some of my friends on the African continent, the report that was brought down was a well received report. But as usual, as governments have done in the past, we will go along not working terribly hard to improve the relationship, not doing anything that may offend the relationship, very much taking it for granted. In the long term, I think Australia is the poorer for that, and in many respects, such as was shown ,in the vote for the Security Council of the UN, we will pay a price either diplomatically or, indeed, economically, There are great economic possibilities in Africa. Some of the mining companies are there doing quite well. BHP is there working on the platinum mine-it will be one of the largest in the world. But because we fail to be adequately represented in so many parts of Africa, we have missed the boat in many respects in that area, I commend the report to the chamber. is a pleasure to see you there. Let me say that I still worry about the functioning of this Main Committee, and I think today's debate illustrates that. There are about two men and a dog here, and none of the ministers, and none of the departmental officials. We have a series of reports dealing with what I regard as fairly significant public policy issues. While I enjoy the opportunity of being able to talk, which is often denied us in the other chamber, in the function of this committee when we have reports such as the ones we are dealing with today, it is a pity that we cannot make a more meaningful use of the relationship of parliament which is designed to provide ministers in government and members an ongoing contact. I worry that we get ourselves too much involved in the thought that just because we produce reports, they are actually going to have any consequence.",160,Representatives Main Committee
303,"Mr Sinclair (New England) (11.48 A,M.)","Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick. ItThursday, 4 December 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 12179 May I say to you now that you are in the chair, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, that when you were in your other role talking to the motion, many of your comments echoed my own concerns. It began, of course, with the observation that you made that the Sir Humphrey-like response of the government to the recommendations of the committee rather suggested that they patted us on the head and said, 'Yes. It is very good to consider those issues. We are glad to know that somebody is considering them. But the Treasurer has not given us the money for one reason or another, and we have not been able to proceed to adopt them.' I know there is only one of these recommendations to which they have specifically said no, but instead of saying yes to the others they have added some sort of qualification to most. As one who is worried about where we go in our relationship with the African continent, I think it is important we are more than half-hearted by saying there are things we can do. The one recommendation that the government has rejected is recommendation 18, that we participate in the Zimbabwe international trade fair this year and next year. I am not sure where we go with expos and international trade fairs but I must admit I have been involved with a few. We took some pretty brave decisions in the past to become involved in expos, and with some of them we wondered whether we were going to get a particular benefit. Those of us who visited the Brisbane Expo will know what an extraordinary event it was. In this instance, Zimbabwe is a country which is trying hard to establish its presence and its trade contacts. It seems to me that there are ways by which you can participate without its costing a fortune and yet it can bring reasonable benefits. Having read the government's reasons, it seems to me that the 'no' men of the government are saying, 'I'm sorry, we haven't got the dough so let's forget it.' Instead of trying to find ways to do things, they are finding reasons why they cannot be done. Frankly, that is not good enough. The reason the government gives in its October response is a bit trite. It says: The Australian business community values the participation of Austrade in trade displays in South Africa. That is what Austrade is for. Austrade has the capacity to muster a number of parties in order that they can collectively make a presentation. Further on the comment is made: ... it is noted that the Zimbex Trade Fair in Harare is competing with the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair to become the premium trade display in Zimbabwe. I do not mind which one we go to but I do think we have to be very precise in working with our business community in trying to promote who we are and where we are. Keep in mind that the report to which this is a response, Australia's relations with Southern Africa, is a report that is directed to a group of countries where there is the most significant growth in trade in the world. People say, 'We have so much trade with South Africa because we have the same economies. Even though politics kept us apart, now that apartheid has ended we are able to trade more freely and liberally and therefore we are in a position to go ahead.' Frankly, there is a lot more to it than that. That is why this report tried to pick up what we see as both a political and a commercial attempt to improve our relationship. In addressing the report I should again pay credit to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, because it was due to your initiative that the report began under your chairmanship. As one who looked at Africa when the recommendation was made, I too shared some of the cynicism that comes from of the government's response. When you look at the nations of Africa, for years the Europeans dominated them. What happened in Africa was a classic illustration of the aftermath of European colonialism. The Europeans did not have the interests of those countries at heart 12180 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 December 1997 but rather what could be done to advance the economic interests of the Europeans. It has taken considerable time for these African countries to get to the stage of being able to look more positively to the future. There were so many countries to look at that we cut it down to the SADC countries. By putting the SADC countries together we were able to focus on the fact that there is, if anything, a remarkable transformation occurring in those countries. We are now proceeding towards an era when we have a better chance of seeing an advancement in those political qualities to which I referred a while ago-democratic institutions, the advance of human rights, the maintenance of the rule of law and a freedom of press; We also have a reasonable opportunity of advancing our political and economic interests together. Another recommendation that I feel quite strongly about, and again I share the views of the honourable member for Throsby( Mr Hollis), concerns our diplomatic representation in Africa. We really are not doing well enough. Kerry Sibraa, the former President of the Senate, is our present ambassador. For all that he comes from the other side of politics from me, I believe he has done an excellent job in representing us at seven posts. It is an extraordinary charge. He represents us to seven countries, all of which are different, most of which are underdeveloped, all of which have political institutions that are fairly fragile and really do need a bit of TLC. He has done a very good job. But having one person in one post---certainly with some professional assistance-means that we are not sufficiently addressing the problems of southern Africa. Perhaps that goes to the core of my concern about this response. I know that this report does not deal with the structure and management of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade but it seems to me that, if anything, the report reflects that the department does need to be concerned about itself. Perhaps we ought to have an inquiry irito the department and see whether or not there are ways by which we could improve its management. I regard Australia's foreign policy as a very important part of looking at the standards of living of Australians. Our foreign policy is not there to promote Australia in the direct sensebecause our foreign relationships involve many other issues-it is there to protect our interests, to advance our interests and to advance our understanding. It is there to help other countries develop to the point where they are not likely to be a security threat, where their economic advancement enables them to be self-sufficient, where they are not going to be continually dependent on overseas aid and where they can make their own contribution towards the stability of the world system. Those are all very grandiose ideas. The foreign office has progressively changed its priorities-we all accept our priority is for Asia-but, as it has done so, we have reduced significantly our presence in a number of regions of the world, and one of them is southern Africa. I am sorry that, in this response, while the government has given this agreement in principle, it all seems to be predicated on the fact that the money is not there. Therefore, it is not going to be possible to provide the financial resources needed to maintain the level of diplomatic and trade representation in southern Africa that I believe is necessary. There are ways by which you can get an extension of resources. The department at the moment is looking at one-person posts. I do not like that idea. I think it would be far better to provide at least two people to represent Australian interests-that is, two Australian-based staff in any post. Secondly, we can have a look at ways by which we can share overseas posts, Thursday, 4 December 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 12181 which I know we are now doing with Canada. I have seen the current post in Vietnam which seems to work quite well: there, the Canadians share our post; in other places, I gather we share the Canadian posts. I am not too sure whether that might be a way that we can work in southern Africa. That does not mean that we subordinate our national interest to Canada or to any other country. But it does mean that, in the one facility, you can provide your own Australian national identity and you can promote your Australian views. I think that is fairly important because there are enormous economic opportunities in southern Africa, and we have very real political interests in southern Africa. I think that we need to have in mind that, just as we look today at the Pacific as the area of growth for all those economic tigers-albeit going through some economic difficulty-the growth in the Indian Ocean region offers the same potential for the future as I believe we have been able to gain from the Pacific over the past two decades. I am sorry that, in this response, the government has perhaps not seen those opportunities that are there. In this response, while the government accepted a number of recommendations that we have made, they have said they are the subject of the Simons review. We have talked about the Simons review earlier in this chamber today. I hope that, having now pronounced where we are going on the Simons review, they will revisit the recommendations we have made and pick them up and provide the resources necessary. For example, recommendation No.8 states: AusAID, in conjunction with Southern African authorities, consider including provision of some legal education and training, and assistance to establish legal resource centres, as part of the official development assistance program. To that the government said that they agreed with the recommendation in principle, subject to the government's consideration of the Simons review recommendations and funding availability. The point of that is to try and help those countries to govern themselves, to put in place better democratic institutions and, as I keep on saying, to promote the rule of law and to get over the problems which saw Australian soldiers serving in Somalia. While Somalia is out of the region, the point is that if you can promote these countries to look after themselves, you are going to avoid what, to my mind, is a regrettable alternative to establishing those principles by sending military force--even though in Somalia it was a United Nations peacekeeping force. Essentially, it is far better providing legal resources and aid to help these countries to help themselves than it is to have to send in the Australian Defence Force to do so as part of a peacekeeping mission. There are a number of these other recommendations. I have mentioned the extent to which I believe we need more diplomatic representation, I have mentioned the degree to which I think there are trade opportunities there that need to be promoted, and I do not think the government has accepted those to a sufficient degree. In all, the problem that I see in this response is that the priority given to southern Africa at this stage is really predicated more on a financial dictate than it is on a foreign policy priority. I think that is regrettable. I think we do have reason to try to find ways by which we can do a lot more than we are to promote our interests with these countries. The only other recommendation I want to refer to is recommendation No. 24. We recommended that we try to develop, with the South African and Zimbabwe governments, a memorandum of understanding on tourism cooperation. We developed the argument in the 12182 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 December 1997 report; I will not go back to it now. We have been told that the government agrees to it, but it is not going to be pursued under current circumstances. I think that tourism cooperation is essential if we are going to take advantage of new tourist opportunities in the future. We are, each of us, at one end of the tourist track-southern Africa in the African sense, and Australia in the Pacific sense-and by cooperating in this way, we could advance our own trade and our tourism opportunities. In all, I found the government's response less than adequate. I am disappointed they have not taken more seriously the recommendations we made in our report on Australia's relations with southern Africa. And where they have responded, they have done so with qualifications. I hope they will revisit our recommendations because I believe they are in Australia's best long-term interests. Debate (on motion by Mr Sawford) adjourned. Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform Committee Report Debate resumed from 24 November, on motion by Mr Neville: That the House take note of the paper. Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform, I would like to put on the record my appreciation and thanks to the now Minister for Transport and Regional Development-but formerly the chairman of our committee-the honourable member for Lyne( Mr Vaile) and also, after the member for Lyne was promoted, the honourable member for Hinkler( Mr Neville), for the very even-handed manner in which they have chaired that committee. I would also like to recognise the very learned contribution made by the member for Shortland ( Mr Peter Morris) to the committee's deliberations and to the compiling of this report. Over the last seven years that I have been in this place at a federal level, I have come to realise that what the member for Shortland does not know about transport in this country does not exist. There are two areas in particular that I would like to comment on today before I finish by remarking on some of the issues also raised by the member for Parramatta ( Mr Ross Cameron) in his dissenting report. I notice that he is listed to speak after me here today. Determining the Commonwealth's proper role in overseeing and funding the national road system was of course the primary goal of our committee. The message that came through in the majority of the submissions to the committee on this subject was, I believe, a resounding endorsement not only for the Commonwealth playing a role over and above providing road funding to the different levels of government but also that it should be active in pursuing that role. Time and again, the committee received submissions which made it clear to the majority of members that, as far as the future of the national road system is concerned, it is essentialessential, I stress-that the Commonwealth avoid simply giving money to the states and territories and relinquishing any managerial role. On the contrary, it is necessary for the Commonwealth to involve itself wherever and whenever practical in the planning and the support of our national road system. As the report",162,Representatives Main Committee
304,Mrs Crosio (Prospect) (12.03 P.m.),"In speaking on this report by the StandingThursday, 4 December 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 12183 makes very clear, the Commonwealth is uniquely placed in Australia's federation to take a national approach to road projects. The roads of national importance in this country deserve to be considered as such at the level of government which concerns itself with all other issues of national significance. That, of course, is our Commonwealth. We cannot rely, and we have too many examples in the past of why we should not rely, simply on the states and territories to rise to the occasion and together maintain and coordinate the roads of national importance in this country. Nor do the states and territories want to assume that role from the Commonwealth. Let us look at some of the submissions that were put to the inquiry by the state and territory governments. The New South Wales government argued strongly that the Commonwealth should play a major part in implementing a national strategy for the road system. The Queensland government stated that the Commonwealth should set and monitor a number of national road priorities. The Northern Territory government argued that the Commonwealth brought a national perspective to roads and that the state and territory governments, from their positions, could not be expected to consider which roads were of national priority and which were not. The Western Australian government argued that a Commonwealth role in the national road system allowed national benefits to be maximised. The South Australian government stated that the Commonwealth, via its involvement in roads, was able to transcend state and sectional interests in order to achieve national objectives. Both the ACT and the Tasmanian governments argued that the Commonwealth had to continue articulating a national focus for the national highway system. It was only the Victorian government which questioned, in any depth, the role of the Commonwealth outside of providing funding for the national road system. With almost a complete majority of states and territories making their opinions clear on this matter, and with almost unanimous agreement of the members of the committee-and I am glad the member for Parramatta is here because he was the one who put in the dissenting report-I think this report has quite correctly found that the Commonwealth has a considerable role to play in a number of key areas. They are the strategic planning of roads, the setting of national road standards, project approval for roads of national importance and taking responsibility for the overall network of the national road system. There is a case to be made for a more precise delineation of responsibilities between the different levels of government where roads are concerned. There is a case for getting rid of the duplication and the overlapping of services that do occur between the different levels of government. However, delineation of responsibilities between the different levels does not, and should not, mean devolution of the Commonwealth's responsibilities either to the states and territories or to local government. This is a point I will return to in a moment. The other aspect of this report that I would like to comment on more closely relates to Commonwealth funding and, in particular, the issue of tied grants. I was glad to see the committee give its approval for tied Commonwealth grants to the states as the best and most effective way of providing a fair and coordinated national approach to funding our road system. I join the honourable member for Shortland in stating for the record that I too viewed with reluctance the abolition of tied grants by the former Labor government in 1991. I considered it a mistake at the time and, six years later, I still think it was a mistake. It is fairly obvious to most of us that it has been exactly that. 12184 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 December 1997 Again, the submission from the Victorian government was the only one out of all of those received from the states and territories which expressed dissatisfaction with the idea of tied grants. I think this mainly reflects the isolationist approach to government adopted by the Kennett administration, which considers any guidance coming from the Commonwealth as interference. Yet, as we have seen, without tied grants the Commonwealth-and, remember, this is at a time when the states and the territories are complaining about the lack of certainty they face with the current funding arrangements-finds itself burdened with uncertainty of its own. With untied grants the Commonwealth finds itself giving large chunks of money to state, territory and local governments, without complete confidence that the money is being used for the specific purpose of maintaining and building roads. If we were to untie all funding, the Commonwealth would need to be assured in some way that the money it was allocating to the states and the territories was being used for the express purpose for which it was intended. In its submission to the committee, the New South Wales government stated: If Commonwealth funding was to be untied, an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States and the Territories would be essential to demonstrate what it is trying to achieve, with an agreed target nationally through strategic plans. Considerable debate would be required to work out equitable, acceptable criteria for allocating payments to the States and Territories. Coming to such an arrangement would be fraught with difficulties. It would require a great deal of trust and goodwill on both sides. If we are being completely honest, that may be the most difficult thing of all. Ultimately, it does not match the benefits associated with a well articulated system of tied grants. The committee has also taken on board the criticism contained in a number of submissions regarding the level of uncertainty which currently exists for the states, the territories and local government in respect of the Commonwealth's funding arrangements. There was an undeniable concern among the submissions over the unpredictability of Commonwealth funding and the problems that such instability brings. I warmly support the committee's recommendations that the Commonwealth attach greater certainty to its funding of roads by implementing a guaranteed funding approach for a rolling three-year period. It was not a surprise to any of us to see the Treasury mandarins cautioning us against recommending such a move and advising us that it would inhibit the Commonwealth's need for budgetary flexibility. While we took such advice on board, I was happy to see the argument for increased certainty and efficiency inroad funding won the day. Finally, I would like to tum to the dissenting report of the member for Parramatta. In reading the member for Parramatta's report-and having listened with interest to his short speech in the House on the report in November-I believe his difficulty with the committee majority report seems to be one of ideology, of philosophy and of his understanding of what constitutes the proper relationship between the Commonwealth and the states. I fear, however, that the member for Parramatta has let ideology and philosophy blind him to the realities of what makes good sense for the road system in this country. I personally find it difficult to comprehend that the member for Parramatta could sit through all of those public hearings, read all of the submissions, which were handed into the committee, and yet come to the conclusion, as he did in the House the other day, that the Commonwealth has 'no business in roads'. Thursday, 4 December 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 12185 The member for Parramatta wants to devolve the Commonwealth's powers back to the states, beginning with the national road system. Yet, apart from the submission from the Victorian government, that is the last thing on the minds of the other seven states and territories. As the committee was guided by these submissions, as much as anyone else, perhaps the member for Parramatta would do better to lobby the governments in those other states and territories to get them to, change their minds. He would then have a better chance of convincing the committee of his argument. I know the member for Parramatta likes to use a famous quote or two or three to illustrate his point. After reading his dissenting report, I had begun to think he had swallowed a book of familiar quotations before putting pen to paper. He was certainly still digesting them when he spoke on the report in the House. With this in mind, I am sure he would appreciate this bastardisation of a quote from Shakespeare: 'There are more things in heaven and earth, member for Parramatta, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.' That includes, mundanely enough, the maintenance of planning of the national road system in this country. By all means let us clarify the role of the Commonwealth in funding, planning and maintaining roads in this country. But do not let us make the enormous error of getting rid of its guiding influence and the perspective it can offer outside of the simple allocation of funds. Let us not let ideology and philosophy blind us into going down that path. In conclusion, along with my fellow members, I would like to again thank the chair of the committee and the member for Shortland for their work and to thank the standing committee staff for their ceaseless devotion to duty. I would like to put on record that the secretary was Meg Crooks, the inquiry officer was Geoff Johnston and the research officers were Jason Allford and Maria Grainger. The administrative officers, Annette Fischer, Natalie Milner and Lena Ridley, certainly did more than what was called for them to do. What is showing very clearly with some of the committees we seem to be sitting on now in the House is that when we amalgamate a number of portfolios into one committee, if we are going to carry that type of load, and we as members are expected to, well and good, but, more appropriately, we should be looking at a greater staffing level. I do not think in future we can expect staff, no matter how good they are-and the staff on this particular committee were secondto none-to carry the loads that they had to over the recent reports that we have completed. Again, I commend them, and I also thank fellow members. We certainly took evidence that was varied. We certainly took opinions on board that were varied. I believe this report in its totality is a very good report. It is a report that is worthy of an answer-a very quick answer-from the government. I commend the report to the House and I will be looking forward to the minister's reply, bearing in mind that for possibly 90 per cent of the evidence that we took and the submissions to this inquiry he was chairing the inquiry. It certainly will make some interesting reading when the government finally tables the response to this report in the House. I commend the report. contribution of the member for Prospect( Mrs Crosio). She highlights the gravity with which one ought to approach the issue of a dissent, particularly as a government member of a committee with a government majority. The member for Prospect speaks as arguably one of the most experienced public figures in Australia, having served as mayor of her local community, as a member of the state parliament, as a minister of the Crown in the New South",166,Representatives Main Committee
305,Mr Ross Cameron (Parramatta) (12.16 P.m.),"I listened with interest to the12186 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 December 1997 Wales government and now as a senior figure in the Labor opposition. SoI take her views with considerable regard and respect. I nonetheless find myself in dissent. I note that the member for Prospect is not alone but that, in fact, I am alone on this issue. Of the 14 members of the committee, 13 found themselves in clear agreement on the basic principles and findings of the report. I stand as something of a shag on a rock, a voice in the wilderness; nonetheless, I stand firmly in dissent on two key issues of the report. The first is the question, as the member for Prospect said, of what is the appropriate constitutional relationship between the Commonwealth and the states. The second is the question of the role of private investment in the road network. They were the two principal issues on which I found myself in disagreement. Were one to accept that the status quo in terms of Commonwealth-state financial relations is acceptable, then there is much in the report about which I could agree and with which I could concur. But starting as I do from that fundamental philosophical or, if you like, ideological point of difference, I find myself in dissent. I want to address firstly that question of Commonwealth-state financial relations and to tum later on to the question of private investment in the road network. My feelings and instincts on the subject come in part from my experience serving as a staffer to two ministers in the New South Wales government---one a minister for minerals and energy and the other a minister for roads and transport-in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Over that period, I formed a view about the role of the Commonwealth in what I regarded as more naturally or appropriately state government affairs. It did seem to me that the Commonwealth was remote from those who actually deliver services, remote from the coalface of service provision and decision making. It seemed to me that the Commonwealth frequently acted as a kind of constitutional bully, using its financial power and the lopsidedness of the Commonwealth-state financial relationship to force policy outcomes on the states which it seemed to me were well beyond the constitutional warrant of the Commonwealth. I refer back to what I see as the seminal point in this debate, and a key point in understanding public policy in this country, which actually relates to the Federal Aid Roads Act 1926. With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I quote for the first time, in either this chamber or the other, James Scullin, the then leader of the ALP opposition in the government of Bruce. This is his response to the then transport minister's second reading speech on the introduction of the Federal Aid Roads Act. Scullin rose and said: I have not the slightest objection to this Parliament making a grant or a gift to assist the State Governments in any direction it considers necessary; but there is a marked distinction between a gift to the States ... from an overflowing Treasury, to assist them in developmental work, whether it be for road-making or railway construction, and introducing a permanent and continuous policy over a period of ten years. Honourable members can draw a distinction between the gift of a sum of money for constructing a few main roads-which is a state function-and introducing a policy under which new taxation is to be imposed in order to enter the field of road construction in state territories. We are exceeding our constitutional rights when we invade, in this way, territory under the control of state authorities, and that, in my judgment, is the fundamental objection to the bill. My argument is that nothing fundamental has changed in those 71 years, that exactly the same arguments that were being had in the chamber on the day that the Federal Aid Roads Act was introduced are relevant today, and I will seek to substantiate that in my remarks in Thursday, 4 December 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 12187 a few moments. Before doing so, I quote another paragraph from Scullin's response to the Federal Aid Roads Act. This has got to do with the nature of federalism and the federal compact which governs the relationship between the Commonwealth and the states. Scullin says: The supporters of the Government are continually chiding the Oppositionthat is, the Labor oppositionfor being unificationists. It is true that we favour one sovereign government for Australia, but we are, at least, honest enough to say that, whilst we have a Federal system, it should be respected, and that we should not try to undermine it. It is the duty of the Government and those who stand for federation ... not to undermine it, and those. who believe in changing it in a constitutional way should also respect the union until they can openly bring about a unified system such as they believe in. The practical consequence of this lopsided relationship, of the abuse of power by the Commonwealth, the breach of the spirit of the constitution, is that Australia now practises, in the words of Denis James from the Parliamentary Research Service, 'the highest level of vertical fiscal imbalance of any federation in the world.' I just want to repeat that: 'Australia practises', in the words of Denis James, 'the highest level of vertical fiscal imbalance of any federation in the world.' In my dissenting report, I cite the fact that, in 1996-97, the Commonwealth raised $130.7 billion in revenue. On the other hand, Commonwealth outlays for its own purposes were only 58 per cent of total generated government outlays. As a result, in the same year the Commonwealth provided the states with grants amounting to $34.6 billion. Overall, in 1995-96, Commonwealth assistance comprised 45.8 per cent of state and territory revenues. What we have done is not only usurped more and more state functions, as Scullin so clearly elucidated, but also deprived the states of the capacity to raise their own revenues. We then get into this terrible situation where, every time you have a premiers conference or a council of Australian governments, you get this name calling and you get this refusal of anyone to accept responsibility. The buck stops nowhere because the states blame the Commonwealth for a lack of funds and the Commonwealth blames the states for failing to discharge their constitutional dutiesMrs Crosio-And local government blames everyone. fundamental re-engineering of Commonwealth-state financial relations to avoid the bureaucratic duplication, the cost shifting and the lie which is really at the heart of public life in Australia as a result of this fundamental breach of Commonwealth-state power and financial relations. The Federal Aid Roads Act subsequently became the subject of curial consideration in the State of Victoria v. the Commonwealth 1926 roads case in which the High Court rejected Scullin's argument and upheld the act introduced by the government of Stanley Melbourne Bruce, and you saw this massive increase in the scope of Commonwealth power because of its capacity to manipulate section 96 grants to go into any area of state policy that any particular Commonwealth minister, on any whim of the day, decided he wanted to enter into. That has been very destructive for our relations. I believe we have to have one thing or the other. As Scullin says, if we want to have a unification, a unitary system of government where there is just the Commonwealth and local government, let us put it to the people and ask them. But let us not do it by stealth, because the abuses of public administration which flow from that stealth are many and varied.",169,Representatives Main Committee
306,Mr Ross Cameron,"And local government blames everyone. I am arguing for a12188 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 December 1997 I want to turn now to the issue of private investment in the road network. In particular, my dissent flows from a conclusion of the majority report which says: BOOT schemesor build, own, operate, transfer schemesare unlikely to be the best method of delivering Commonwealth road projects ... The Committee also considers that BOOT schemes are unlikely to be the best method of delivering Statefferritory and local road projects. That second recommendation from our committee deliberations is a breach of the basic convention that the Commonwealth does not venture into the field of state exclusive responsibility and lecture on or dictate 'to the states what is good for them. We restrict ourselves in our inquiries to recommendations over which the Commonwealth has direct responsibility, but in this instance we have decided to draw a very long bow, to enter-in an excessive way, in my view-into the field of the states and to start directing policy. Furthermore, in my opinion we have done it on the basis of evidence before the committee which was either incomplete or inaccurate. Mrs Crosio-That's when you should have questioned it. the hearings of the committee. The basic view of the committee was that there is not a real transfer of risk to the private sector. We are talking about these urban motorways or tollways. The view of the committee was that there was not a bona fide transfer of risk from the government to the private sector, that the private sector was deriving a benefit from these roads which was not matched by the commercial risk of delivering the project. That is not a view that I adhere to or uphold, and so I was at pains in the minority report to demonstrate the evolution of risk transfer over these projects, particularly in New South Wales, beginning with the Sydney Harbour Tunnel and moving through the M5 motorway, the M4 motorway, the M5 extension and, most recently, the M2 motorway. We have seen the evolution in sophistication of both government and the·private sector in managing the risks associated with these major projects. If you take, for example, the M2 motorway, which borders the northern boundary of my electorate, that motorway is giving back to 45,000 people every day 40 minutes of their time in going to and from the city-20 minutes in the morning and 20 minutes in the evening for a toll of $2.50 each way. Effectively, that means 20,000 fathers who did not get to do so before the building of the motorway get to have breakfast with their kids before they leave home. In terms of productivity in the economy, this means that you have made a major contribution to the quality of life if you can give people an additional 40 minutes a day disposable time. I reckon you would have to go far and wide to point to any government policy which could match that in terms of the impact on the quality of life of a family. What you saw there was a group of people gathered together around a $660 million project. You had the bankers providing debt, you had the equity providers investing, you had the insurers, you had the construction joint venturer and you had all of their lawyers gathered together around one table wrestling this beast to the ground. The critical thing about the bankability of one of these projects is that it is subject to market disciplines. As I mentioned, I worked for the New South Wales Minister for Minerals and Energy. In New South Wales, we created $10 billion worth of excess power generation capacity under",171,Representatives Main Committee
307,Mr Ross Cameron,"That is right-and I have questioned it at various points throughThursday, 4 December 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 12189 the former Electricity Commission because the decisions of that government agency were not subject to the test of whether the community actually needed the infrastructure. On the M2 motorway the deal would not get done until those bankers are prepared to sign on the bottom line and say, 'We believe that over 40 years we will get our money back.' That commercial interest serves a critical public policy interest, which is that we build only the infrastructure that the community actually needs. It helps to ensure that the investment of funds is not subject to political whims and political opportunism. The problem with the Commonwealth involvement in the national highway is that it has an intrinsic bias against urban roads. All of the studies before the committee showed that the critical need was for investment in urban arterial roads. The member for Prospect and I have both been strong advocates in respect of, for example, the need for the upgrade of the Cumberland Highway in western Sydney and likewise the need for the upgrade of the Sydney orbital route. Yet money is being spent-because of the political pressure, essentially---on a national highway system which is overwhelmingly a rural system, skewing resources away from the real need in urban areas into rural areas. That is because of the Commonwealth involvement in roads policy and roads funding. If we just got out of it and vacated itMrs Crosio-We could call them RONPls and not RONls-roads of National Party importance. concerning the politicisation of these resources. I am in serious dissent, and I urge the House to consider the arguments of the dissent. (Time expired) was apart from the member for Parramatta ( Mr Ross Cameron)-I support the majority recommendations in the report of the Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform on its review of federal road funding. If time allows I will talk a little about some of those recommendations. In view of the spirited speech of the member for Parramatta, however, I would like to deal with the minority report and to put a counter view of the issues that he has raised. He argues that the Commonwealth should get out of direct funding for roads and hand the money over to the states for them to expend, firstly because of vertical fiscal imbalance and also because he thinks funds are being wasted on the national highway which would be better spent on urban roads. The term 'vertical fiscal imbalance' means that the Commonwealth raises a lot more money than it spends for its own purposes-and the states correspondingly, through their revenue raising activities, raise a lot less money than they need for their own expenditures. The Commonwealth makes payments to the states to enable them to make up the deficiency, but this leads to a very substantial imbalance between revenues raised and expenditures by the states and the Commonwealth. This situation is called vertical fiscal imbalance. Whatever one thinks of that-and it seems to me that there are certainly strong arguments for some correction of it-it seems to me strange that the member for Parramatta, in his minority report, is arguing to make it worse. What he is arguing is that the Commonwealth should get out of direct road funding, making own expenditures on roads, and make more payments to the states. This would mean that the states would have more expenditures of their own, and even greater imbalance between the revenues they raise and their own expenditures.",172,Representatives Main Committee
308,Mr Ross Cameron,Exactly. I accept the interjection of the member for Prospect,173,Representatives Main Committee
309,Mr Willis (Gellibrand) (12.31 P.m.),"As a member of the majority-as everyone else12190 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 December 1997 The Commonwealth likewise would have an even greater imbalance between the revenues it raises and its own expenditure. Vertical fiscal imbalance would be made worse by the proposal of the member for Parramatta, who uses vertical fiscal imbalance as an argument that we should not be funding roads directly at the Commonwealth level. It is just a total non sequitur. Also, if the Commonwealth is to get out of direct road funding and hand the money to the states, why stop at roads? This is an argument to end Commonwealth funding for education, for health, for housing, for community services, for a whole host of expenditures that the Commonwealth is involved in, and an end, therefore, to a national approach to expenditures in all those areas. It means that we would not have a capacity for a national education system; we would not have standards being set for national health; and, likewise, we would not have a national road system. The reason that we fund a national highway is that, if we left it to the states, we would probably have extremely inadequate links both between our capital cities and for the nation as a whole in terms of its national road system. That, it seems to me, would be a great deficiency in terms of our unity as a nation. It would reduce the economic efficiency of interstate transfers which take place through roads; and, of course, it is very important to us that those transfers are as efficient as possible. We would not have a highly efficient system to anything like the degree which we have at the present time, if we were to rely on the states to build it, because the concentration of the states would be more likely to be on areas which they saw as being to their own maximum advantage, without looking at the national overall benefit. I reject absolutely the view of the member for Parramatta in his approach, which is one of absolute states rights extremism. The argument that funds are being wasted on the national highway and would be better spent on urban roads misses the point that we have in fact, in recent years, moved to have included in the national highway system the urban ring roads which link the national highway into and out of capital cities. This has already been funded in Melbourne with the western ring road; $600 million of federal government money has been put into the western ring road, thus linking the national highway and bringing about a tremendous economic boost to the western region of Melbourne as well as a greatly facilitated flow for interstate transport around the city of Melbourne-and for intrastate transport, for that matter, as well. Thus, we already have that example of a great urban benefit coming from federal government funding of the ring roads. The New South Wales Road Traffic Authority says the number one road of importance in New South Wales is the' similar ring road in Sydney, linking the national highway coming in at Liverpool and coming in at Hornsby. That orbital road, which the member for Parramatta referred to, is a most important road, and that will presumably be funded under the national highway program, following upon the completion of the western ring road; and the same thing can also be done to enhance the ring road system in Brisbane. Thus, we do have an added concentration of national highway programs on the urban road system in recent times, and I think the point being raised by the member for Parramatta is quite wrong. In relation to the minority report, of course, there is the important area regarding BOOT projects, which the member for Parramatta contends that the majority was wrong on, because it said that they were unlikely to be the best method of delivering roads at the Commonwealth, state or local government level in the future. And his report cites 10 criticisms, in the majority Thursday, 4 December 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 12191 report, of BOOT schemes. The principal one of these is the inadequacy of the risk burden carried by the private sector operator, and the corresponding and inappropriate level of risk borne by the government-and, therefore, the taxpayer-for roads that they are supposed not to own. In this matter, the minority report relies heavily on a response by the New South Wales Road Traffic Authority to very strong criticisms by the New South Wales Auditor-General of the Sydney Harbour tunnel project and the Sydney M4 and M5 toll roads. The minority report accuses the majority report of ignoring the RTA response to the Auditor-General, and proceeds to rely very heavily on the RTA response by quoting slabs of it in criticism of the Auditor General in his report. Indeed, the minority report reads very much like a whole lot of special pleading by the RTA. However, the minority report entirely ignores the Auditor-General's rejection of the RTA response. The fact is, despite the RTA's strenuous objection, the Auditor-General strongly maintained his original position. For example, in relation to the Sydney Harbour tunnel, the Auditor-General commented on the RTA response to his report. I refer to the publication Private participation in the provision of public infrastructure: the Roads and Traffic Authority and the foreword to that by the Auditor-General, in which he said: The Authority asserts that only the Auditor-General believes that the risks of ownership reside with the Authority ... This statement ignores that its accounting adviser can also see reasons why it would be acceptable for the Authority to recognise its ownership of the Tunnel. It ignores Westpac's view that the Government and the Authority have the financial risks. It ignores that the Sydney Harbour Tunnel Company has no continuing benefit or risks from its legal ownership. And it ignores the Public Accounts Committee of the Parliament of New South Wales' view that the Authority is the carrier of Tunnel risks. Perhaps the Authority is the only entity that cannot or will not see that it is the risk taker. That was the Auditor-General's comment on the proposition by the RTA that it was not the risk taker in regard to that project. Also, he went on to say in relation to the RTA: Indeed, if I could be mildly critical of the authority, now up to its eighth legal action concerning the report, I could not agree that it cooperated with this audit. In fact, its approach could hardly have been more uncooperative. If the Roads and Traffic Authority has in the community a poor reputation for objectivity and responsiveness, its approach to this report reflects that. I do not think there was much acceptance by the Auditor-General of any of the RTA's comments. He regarded it as a pretty maverick outfit. Nor has there been a marked change in the Auditor-General's approach in subsequent reports of this kind. The minority report endeavoured to argue that there had been an improvement in the allocation of risk in the later road projects. It quotes the New South Wales Auditor-General on page 134 of the report as saying: The report on the M2 motorway published at the beginning of 1995 noted the improvement (building on experience from previous schemes) in the balance of risks to be borne by the developer and the RTA, in particular, contractual arrangements ... Then there is a break and it goes on: The arrangements proposed for the contract for the Eastern Distributor continue the improvement in the balance of risks observed in the report on the M2. In other words, it is arguing that the Auditor-General was saying there was this improvement. What it left out, however, was significant because what it left out were the comments by the Auditor-General to this effect, and this was in the break in those quotes: 12192 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 December 1997 However, it also highlighted the uncertainty that remained over the underlying costs and benefits of such schemes for the state and for the transport network as a whole. While recognising some of the benefits from private sector financing and operation of some schemes in terms of efficiency, timing and risk sharing, it suggested that public ownership of such schemes might offer the potential for better management of traffic risk over the road network as a whole, more efficient pricing mechanisms and a more optimum public transport network. It concluded: This audit cannot definitively answer whether, from a financial viewpoint, private ownership of the M2 is the state's interest. It suggests that it need not be in the state's interest and it recommends that the government, with respect to future projects, carefully examine the relative economic benefits of private vs public ownership of urban tollways (and the effects of different revenue raising mechanisms). All of that absolutely crucial reference to the fact that what he was really saying was that there was no evidence to show that private sector was better than public sector, and listing a stream of benefits for public sector over private sector was left out of that quote to try to suggest that the whole thing was moving in a way which was much more acceptable to the Auditor General. That is just a misquoting of what the Auditor-General waon about. Also, this misuse of quotes is also displayed in regard to the EPAC report on private infrastructure which is mentioned on page 139 of the minority report. In that respect, there is a reference to the EPAC report talking about BOOT-type schemes and some advantages from those. What it leaves out are comments by the New South Wales Auditor-General in his review of the eastern distributor road and this is not mentioned at all in the minority report. In respect of that EPAC task force, it concluded: In the broad, BOOT-type structures are likely to be least advantageous for urban roads. In reaching this conclusion, it considered that the incremental efficiencies from private ownership are likely to be smaller in roads than in other sectorr 'md the private financing cost penalty more pronounced owing to greater network risk and higher tral1Jaction costs. It is quite clear that the reference to EPAC that is supportive for the minority report position is quite wrong. The EPAC position was quite against the use of BOOT-type projects for urban roads. In regard to the eastern distributor, the Auditor-General showed in the eastern distributor performance audit that he is still very unconvinced about private sector BOOT financing for urban roads, as that EPAC quote shows. In regard to private financing, it may lead to a lower level of traffic than could be achieved with road tolling, if the providers had access to public borrowing. This was a view put in the Eastern Distributor report by the Auditor-General. The overall benefits of the scheme are reduced because of less traffic using new roads than if they were directly provided by the government. This point was made by Professor Quiggin to the committee also. Overall, the Auditor-General calls for a major examination in regard to financing urban motorways. On page 2 on the eastern distributor report, the Auditor-General of New South Wales in mid-1997 says: The evidence that urban toll roads are not as effective as other options is very strong. He goes on with some other stuff that I do not have time to quote, talking about some advantages of government over private sector roads. It is clear from all of that that the committee was on the right track in pursuing its approach to BOOT-type schemes. It did not rule them out. It said that they should be looked at on a case-by-case basis and that there should be a clear benefit over costs associated with such projects before one pursued that kind of financing. Thursday, 4 December 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 12193 That is what the Auditor-General keeps saying in New South Wales. That is what he keeps saying has not been happening. That is why he keeps saying that the New South Wales government approach to this has not been correct under either government, and that we need to be terribly careful about going down the path of BOOT-type schemes unless we are absolutely sure of getting a good return on our money. (Time expired) discussion of a report. I am equally very pleased to be associated with Planning not patching: an inquiry into Federal road funding. It was an extensive inquiry, with 800 or more exhibits and submissions put to the committee, quite a number of public inquiries and a lot of research work. I would like to record my appreciation of the professionalism, good conduct and good grace of the committee secretariat involved with the standing committee behind this report. I direct this especially to Meg Crooks, the committee secretary; Geoff Johnston, the inquiry officer; the research officers, Jason Allford and Maria Grainger; and the administrative officers, Annette Fischer, Natalie Milner and Lena Ridley. They managed to sort a way through the various bits and pieces of chaff which came before the committee and helped us to understand better some of the technical aspects we need to understand in the compilation of reports such as this. Having said that, let me say I think the best part about this report is that it reasserts the importance of the role of a federal government in the question of proper planning for road infrastructure in this country. Many times since coming to this place, I have said that ever since 1788 government has had an absolute role in ensuring that the proper infrastructure all citizens need is available. In a country where the popUlation is sparse and the distances are great, it is a valid and legitimate role of government to provide infrastructure, so that citizens can go about their pleasure and their business, and good results are there for the community as a whole. There are obviously great defence implications in ensuring transport infrastructure, such as roads, are well thought out. The best part of this report is that it really does reassert the importance of the role of the federal government in ensuring national outcomes from road infrastructure. It points out clearly that states can become very inward looking and parochial. This is fair enough from a state's perspective. But we find mismatching of the quality of infrastructure on either side of state borders. because a road in is not as important as a road out. The honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) is sitting in the chamber here as one of the government whips. I know for certain that he is very frustrated in trying to convince the New South Wales state government Road Transport Authority to do the right thing as far as getting the national outcome that people in my electorate certainly want is concerned-that is, making sure that the Pacific Highway through his electorate is upgraded completely in keeping with this government's plans. It is frustrating to think that a state government may flick certain financial considerations away from achieving the good national outcome. I certainly know that because my electorate is only about 100 kilometres away from the electorate of the honourable member for Richmond. In suburban Brisbane we look with a great deal of interest to the progress along the Pacific Highway as it traverses New South Wales. So Queenslanders have a great deal of concern if the New South Wales government is not doing the right thing as far as the Pacific Highway is concerned. I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker",173,Representatives Main Committee
310,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton) (12.46 P.m.),"I am very pleased to be associated with this12194 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 4 December 1997 Nehl, as the Pacific Highway travels through your electorate, you will be keeping a close eye on the progress of the upgrade. As an aside, I think that one of the most interesting comments to come from New South Wales witnesses when they came to the hearing was a suggestion that perhaps all of Victoria's road funding allocation should be sent to New South Wales for a year so that they could finish off the Hume Highway. It would be the best thing for Victoria if the New South Wales government were able to complete the duplication of the Hume Highway. South of the Victorian border you have a magnificent road, but after crossing the Victorian-New South Wales border, and in and around Canberra, Goulburn and Yass, the roads are not as good as they should and could be. So here we have state authorities not looking at the national imperative from a New South Wales perspective. Perhaps it is a Sydney-centric look, or, from a Victorian perspective, a Melbourne-centric view. I know that in Queensland it is not quite the case because it is a very decentralised state by nature. What a lot of these different state road planning authorities are missing is the fact that there is a national interest in completing the Hume Highway in duplication, and in completing the Pacific Highway duplication between Sydney and Brisbane. Likewise, there is a national interest in continuing to upgrade the northern reaches of the Bruce Highway from Port Douglas and Cairns through to Mackay where much of that road leaves a lot to be desired. It is important that the federal government places national considerations in the execution of road construction in this country. It has never been a constitutional right of the federal government to control the construction of roads. It is something we inherited because, after allMr Ross Cameron-We stole it. generated from a taxation revenue point of view than we actually spend. The vertical fiscal imbalance gives us a great deal of control over the expenditure of moneys in a number of different areas. The member for Parramatta ( Mr Ross Cameron) might suggest that we have stolen that right from the states but, in fact, it is quite right and quite proper, and in general conversation there is no argument about the importance of the federal government looking at things in a national perspective when it allocates funds to the various states. So this inherited role is endorsed by the majority report of the standing committee. It is important, I think-and I totally agree with the findings of the committee-to tie the grants for road purposes very specifically to the states because it was mentioned to us in a number of asides that some darned good swimming pools were built instead of roads. In other words, money went off into different areas but it ended up being used for other purposes. I do not believe this is in the national interest at all. Because of the importance of road infrastructure, it is vital that, if we are going to allocate funds for roads, roads are built-and not only that: that they are built with the proper consideration. Another important aspect of the report was contained in recommendations 13 and 21 which talk about national highway links and arterial roads. In the case of my electorate of Moreton, there certainly is some direct interest in that. I saw first-hand, before becoming the member for Moreton, just how poor the planning of the previous Labor government in Queensland had been with regard to an urban national highway link in the form of Kessels Road.",177,Representatives Main Committee
311,Mr Hardgrave,"As the member for Gellibrand ( Mr Willis) said, we have more moneyThursday, 4 December 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 12195 Kessels Road was a fairly quiet suburban road with a couple of lanes-a lane each way. But over the last 15 years it has slowly but surely developed into this national highway link. In fact, the previous Labor government .made it part of the national highway system linking Ipswich Road, the Cunningham Highway, the New England Highway connection right through to the Bruce Highway via the Gateway arterial in my electorate. As a result we are now finding interstate transporters thundering down this road, creating a lot of undue hurt, confusion and, perhaps, health problems amongst constituents in my electorate. A lot of this came about because it was a quick and convenient thing for the state government at the time in Queensland to do. The federal government kicked in the funds to make sure it was possible but, at the end of the day, the previous federal government did not take account of the parochial view of the state government of the day and threw the money at it without any connection. We are inviting the federal government of today to connect itself with the outcome, and not just simply make the money available without question but call to account the state governments for the conduct of the funds. that are put forward. That is what tied funding is all about and I think, for so many reasons, good national outcomes will come as a result of the recommendations that have been put forward by this inquiry. In closing, can I say that the minority report of the member for Parramatta perhaps was a few years ahead of its time. I am in a very generous mood because it is close to Christmas. But I suspect that one of the important recommendations within the inquiry is where we have said that the whole conduct of road funding, and the conduct of national outcomes, should be reviewed every five years to ensure we are getting the right results. Perhaps in five years time the member for Parramatta will make a submission that is something along the lines of his minority report. I applaud his determination to put his point of view, as he has done so well here today and as he has done in his minority report. I do not have to agree with all the tenets but I absolutely recommend the result of this long inquiry to the House. a few remarks on the report Planning not patching. Firstly, could I commend the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform and its members and secretariat for a very carefully thought through report. Of all the parliamentary reports that I have been associated with in my time in the parliament, I think this one saw the participation of most members of the committee in the detail, in the final recommendations and in the script of the report. In my view, it is a reference document for the views of people associated with roads and the views in relation to the very difficult problem of allocating resources-federal, state and local. Certainly, the committee took into account all those views around Australia and I think the final report is a monument to those submissions. The distillation of those views comes through in the report in trying to solve what is almost an impossible problem. I also put on the public record my thanks to the former chairman, now the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the member for Lyne( Mr Vaile), for his contribution as chairman, for the way in which he conducted the inquiry and the fair manner in which he conducted all deliberations. I also thank the members of the opposition, the member for interests-and the deputy chairman, the member for Shortland ( Mr Peter Morris), for their",178,Representatives Main Commitiee

313,Gellibrand ( Mr Willis),"both as federal Treasurer and as a member representing Victorian12196 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 December 1997 contributions and their long experience in this parliament and their long experience in the matter of road funding. Broadly, the fundamental problem facing the funding of roads in Australia is that about $11 billion is collected and about $6 billion is spent on roads on an annual basis. So there is a legitimate argument by all Australians who drive vehicles that some of that money that has been collected for the purposes of road funding has not been allocated. Inevitably, there will never be enough money for road construction and maintenance. That will be an ongoing argument no matter who is in government; no matter whether they are state, federal or local governments. Once again, the argument about a national highway system, and the definition of the system, came to prominence in the debate in the committee. At a parochial level, and the member for Gellibrand would understand this, there is an argument that the Geelong to Melbourne road should be part of the national highway system in view of the fact it connects two such important cities. That argument, of course, continues in other parts of the Commonwealth. The definition of a national highway system is something that the committee looked at but had some difficulty in giving it a final recommendation. Of course, the roads of national importance add another dimension to the possibility of the Commonwealth assisting with other secondary roads that do help in terms of commerce and manufacturing. I think it is clear that the state authorities are the instrumentalities that build, construct and maintain roads. There is always the difficulty of the funding, of the supervision between the Commonwealth and the state authorities, and certainly that came through in the submissions. I think the committee has made a bold decision in saying that we do not agree with hypothecation. The figures show that in fact it is not being followed. We agreed that hypothecation was not a reality when one looks at the way in which funding is now allocated in Australia. I make mention of the bridges situation. An interesting aspect of our inquiry related to the allocation of funds needed for the construction of bridges between Victoria and New South Wales. It is something that I think governments have tended to overlook. Both state governments have passed the buck. The federal government has been reluctant to take up that fairly considerable amount of capital expenditure and it is something that I draw to the attention of the chamber. In terms of private sector involvement, there has been an ongoing debate by those on both sides of the chamber. I have been convinced by the arguments that were put to the committee, although they might not accord with my normal instinct to support the private sector. But from the arguments that were put forward and the very lengthy discussions that took place, having regard to the build, own, operate and transfer type of road construction, there is some merit in the argument put forward in the report that motorists and the people who use these highways should pay for this construction through their taxes and charges in some form or other. Having regard to the toll system, the availability of capital and the element of risk involved in private construction, I think the analysis by the committee is a correct one. On balance, it is hard to develop a case for encouraging the private sector to build, own, operate and transfer some of these bigger operations; in the longer term, they are for the benefit of the community. Thursday, 4 December 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 12197 I know my good friend the member for Parramatta does not agree with that. But having listened to the evidence, I understand that the private sector was able to mitigate the risk by having an extension of time, thus ensuring that they enjoyed the benefit of a genuine return. Finally, I refer to some of the country roads in parts of my electorate-and this also relates to roads in the electorates of other members in the chamber. In my electorate of Corangamite, which produces dairy and timber products, they cannot be compared with the western ring road, on any cost-benefit analysis. In an intellectual and policy sense, it is very difficult to demonstrate that, but obviously in the longer run we must have soundly constructed roads to support our primary, rural and mining industries, which provide the export earnings of Australia. Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend the report to the parliament. I say again that I think it is a benchmark document which all state governments will read with considerable interest. Let them be assured that it is a document which represents the collective view of the parliament. It is the view of many experienced members of the parliament who have had a long association with road funding, and the dilemmas and problems associated with those allocations. Debate (on motion by Mr Anthony) adjourned. Main Committee adjourned at 1.04 p.m. to a date to be fixed.",179,Representatives Main Committee
