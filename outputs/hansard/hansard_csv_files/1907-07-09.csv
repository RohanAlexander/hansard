Do the Department intend to take any action against these officers for neglecting their duties ? 3. (a) Has any inquiry been made by the Department into the conduct of Mrs. Rawson at the Barwon Polling Booth (Corio Division), who, it is said, also interfered with and instructed voters how to vote, inside the polling booth, and the electoral officers declined to interfere, although their attention was drawn to it several times? Address-in-Reply. Holiday Arrangements, (J) W ill the Department take any action in this Letter Cardscase? 4. Will the Department take action against Exany of the other officials who, it is alleged, by their actions on polling day, offended against Post Cards, Statutory Rules 1907, many of the sections of the Act and the regulaTelegraph Regulations-Cod e Adtions? honourable member's questions are as follow :1. No, I am not aware that any officer in the to refused to interfere. On the contrary, the officer in charge concurred in the action of the police officer, who witnessed the occurrence, reported it as an offence and required the offender to leave the booth. 2. See reply to 1. 3. (a) and (*). The officer in charge of the Barwon polling booth, who was present throughout the polling hours, has no knowledge of any contravention of the law on the part of Mrs. Rawson, and no report has been received. 4. Where irregularities on the part of officers have been alleged, f u l l inquiry has in every case been made as to the truth or otherwise of the allegations. In cases where the Department is advised that a prosecution for neglect of official duty could not be justified, and the circumstances point to marked inefficiency or neglect of instructions, it has been decided that the officers concerned will not again be employed in the conduct* of Commonwealth elections. Debate resumed from5th July (vide That the Address-in-Reply to His Excellency's Speech, as read by the Clerk, be agreed to by the House. very glad to have an assurance in the Governor General's speech that the Government propose to amend the Electoral Act. There are two or three provisions which I trust will be incorporated in the new Bill when it is brought before this House. I hope that the Act will be so amended as to permit of more than one polling booth being established in any polling district. The fact that under the existing law only one polling place can be appointed in a polling district, constitutes a very serious inconvenience to residents in the back blocks and in scattered rural townships. As far as my own constituency is concerned, I may mention that the township of Broken Hill, being a mining centre, is of an extremely scattered character,, and the fact that only one polling place is permitted there prevents a large number of people from exercising the franchise. Under the present Act, we are allowed only four",14,Papers Ministers Laid Upon The Table The

Sir equal number under the Federal Electoral Act. statement shows that the Treasurer does not understand the Act. Only one polling booth is permitted in each polling district. Sir as many districts as we choose to appoint. position very much. I hope that we shall have the existing state of affairs altered because it constitutes a still more serious handicap to the working classes. The places usually set apart as polling booths in large towns are the local town halls, or some other building which is deemed a suitable one by the Returning Officer. Of course the wealthy classes are able to be driven there in their motor cars or in cabs. labouring section of the community. I trust that under the new Bill candidates will be permitted to spend a portion of the ,£100 to which their electioneering expenses are limited in the employment of cabs. I think it is only right that they should be free to incur expenditure in that direction if they choose to do so. did not trouble the honourable member personally at the last election. number of my constituents would have voted for me had I been permitted to employ cabs to convey them to the polling booths. Of course I would not have had to pay for the vehicles. Again, I do not think it is sufficient for a candidate merely to be called upon to give an account of the expenditure which he has incurred in fighting his election. I think that every penny of his expenditure-includin g even personal expensesshould be clearly set out in his schedule, as also the source from which it comes. Every shilling spent in an election should be accounted for. If an organization supplies money for him, that fact should be stated. I entertain no objection to people being allowed to spend money at election times. They have a perfect right to do so-jus t as much right as they have to expend it in horse racing, or in endowing hospitals and universities. I urge no complaint against funds being spent for political purposes, but I da think we ought to know how such funds are being spent, and where they come from. That is to say, if the Tobacco Trust, or the Shipping Combine, or the Sugar Trust, or the McKay Harvester Co., or Beale's piano factory,spend' money in JOHN FORREST -We can have an furthering the interests of a candidate, or if , on the other hand, funds are expended in the interests of the importers, the fact should be made public. If a labour union contributes anything to the expenses of acandidate, it is publicly known, because an account of the expenditure has to JOHN FORREST -But we can have be given to the particular union concerned. The same rule should apply all round, and a f u l l account should be rendered of all expenditure upon behalf ,bf candidates. This is a matter of very great importance at the present moment. Rightly or wrongly, we are about to adopt a protective policy throughout Australia. The result of the recent election was to secure the return to this House of a majority who are pledged to such a policy. Consequently we are about to engage in an attempt to build up industries by Act of Parliament. That may be a But not so the good thing in many ways, but in one direction at least it is open to very serious objection. Some little time since I read an interesting article by MrT . P. O'Connor, well known to honourable members, both as an English journalist and as a member of the House of Commons, entitled ""America Re-visited."" In this article he made the statement:And finally add to these conditions the inevitable condition of Protection as applied to these American conditions-namely , that every industry, It did, because a larger every pursuit almost, is the child, the slave, mainly the product of legislation-and you arrive at that dread and that intimate association between money-making and law-breaking which leads to that corruption in public life which to Americans is the greatest blot of their country and the greatest peril to their institutions. ' In view of the fact that in future many of our industries will depend largely upon Acts of Parliament-upo n duties of Customs and Excise imposed by this Legislature-w e may naturally assume that money will be spent in an effort to secure either the retention of the present Tariff or the passing of -a higher one. In these circumstances, therefore, it is necessary that we should know exactly how money has been spent on behalf of a candidate seeking election to this Parliament. I am also anxious that analyses of informal votes shall be made, and a statement given by the Returning Officer for each electorate showing, not merely the number of informal",15,Addre Ss In Re Ply

If this were done mistakes might in future be averted, and the number of informal votes considerably reduced. long that the Returning Officer would practically be unable to read it. need fear anything in that direction. It would merely be necessary for the Returning Officer to group together the various classes of informal votes, and show that a certain number were bad for such a reason, and another batch informal because of other reasons. I feel confident that the adoption of this course would be found beneficial. I heard with a good deal of satisfaction the announcement that the mail contract had been cancelled. prepared to admit that it gave me more than passing pleasure, since I have never wavered in the beliefa belief that I have often expressed in this House-that the true solution of our difficulties in regard to the carriage of our oversea mails is to be found in the establishment of a Government fleet of steamships, controlled by the Commonwealth, and manned by our own people. Hansard report of the debate on the resolution submitted to the House for the ratification of the mail contract entered into with Sir James Laing and Sons, may not be uninteresting to honourable members. In submitting the resolution the Postmaster General saidWe did not desire to be again placed in a eorner. finding ourselves at the last moment practically in the hands of companies which, being the only ones in the trade, could dictate their own terms. same position again, if the ships required under this contract are not built. show that all reasonable and business-like precautions have been taken to provide against a contingency of that kind. I like the words "" business-like precautions. "" The honourable member went on to sayWe are dealing with responsible men, whose reputation in the ship-building world is second to none. Whilst the honourable gentleman was speaking Mr Lonsdale, who was then the honourable member for New England, interjectedI t is a contract with ship-builders. To this the Postmaster-General repliedThey are the sort of people with whom we desire to make contracts. The honourable member for Laanecoorie in the course of the debate expressed the opinion thatThe Postmaster-General and the honourable member for Richmond are to be congratulated on the excellent terms they have secured for the Commonwealth. I express that opinion the more heartily because I realize that had it not been for the special efforts put forth by those honourable members, and by the Government generally, we should possibly have been placed in a very awkward position as regards our oversea communication with the old country. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, Mr Higgins, whose withdrawal I am sure most of us regret, although we are glad that he occupies a seat on the High Court Bench, also spoke, I am and amongst other things saidThe more I see of this proposed agreement the more I like it, and the more I think that the Government are to be congratulated. The Prime Minister closed the debate, and in the course of a magnificent speech saidThe combination which is behind our proposed contract is strong enough to undertake all the tasks which confront them, and strong enough to enter into that other development of steamA few quotations from the ship communication to which I have alluded. It will thus be seen that when the proposed contract was submitted to the House it was greeted with a chorus of approval by Government supporters, who expressed their gratification that such an excellent agreement had been arrived at. I think it will be admitted by the Government that after the amendment which I moved had been dealt with I did not harass them in any way. I recognised that my proposal had been fairly and squarely discussed, and after it had been rejected I did nothing to hamper the Government in dealing with the contract. I felt and said that the whole responsibility for the carrying out of the contract must rest with them; that if it failed they would deserve to lose possession of the Treasury benches. But for the hopeless impossibility of the Opposition, I should say that the Government ought to be dismissed. We can well imagine how the leading newspapers of Australia, would have thundered forth their denunciations of the Watson Ministryi f they had been responsible for the bungle which has occurred.

21,Mr Aust In Chapman,"I think I cansaid by the Treasurer? I can well imagine how he would have risen in his place on the Opposition benches andgesticulated and bellowed. Would he not have said, "" DidI not tell-the House that' the Ministry <loes not comprise men of business capacity ? They are men who have been taken from the printer's shop, from the mines, the .shearing sheds, and so for t h ; what do they know of business?"" That is what, I venture to say, the honourable member would have contended, and we should then, perhaps, have heard a little more about the Labour Party being in office unconstitutioriailly, because they were not in a majority. I cannot but again express my pleasure and gratification at the bungle and muddle the Government have made over this a/fair. I have taken the trouble since last we met to gather daily what has been said in the newspapers about the mail contract, and I confess that I agree with that Scotch divine when he pointed out that David, who said in his anger ""that all men were liars,"" could have said the same in his calm and deliberate moments. of a newspaper editor who told Carlyle that he kept two professional liars on his newspaper staff-on e to denounce the living, and the other to eulogise the dead. It would seem from what we read in the newspapers that those connected with the snail contract, if they have not kept two professional liars employed, have been able to employ some people who do not know very much about the truth. Last February, when the House met, we were told that Mr Clarke had arrived in Australia, and that he had come, not to make fresh arrangements with the Government, or to try to get better terms, but to open offices. We were told that he had come to Australia in order to see what business could be done, and, not only to employ clerks, but to build wharfs and docks. was going to build a navy. everything was in "" apple-pie"" order and going right. In this connection I should like to refer to a gentleman whom we have sent to London-Captain Collins. This representative of the Commonwealth was wired to at the time, and asked if it was a fact that Mr Clarke had left England, and it appeared that, although Mr Clarke had left six weeks before, Captain Collins had heard nothing about it. In the Australian newspapers of 14th Marchi t was announced that Vickers, Son and Maxim had severed their connection with the tender; but it was not until four days later that Captain Collins cabled that information to the Treasurer. A t another time Captain Collins stated that the contract was going on all right, because the companies had bought some old scrap iron with which to commence building the ships. I cannot help thinking that Captain Collins is "" wasting his sweetness on the desert air "" in his present office as representative of the Commonwealth in London; a man so alert, up-to-date, who can get hold of information so quickly and readily, ought to be presented to the Intelligence Department of some enemy or foreign country. It would be of no use to offer this gentleman's services to the British Government-that would be a "" g if t from the .Greeks,"" worse, perhaps, than the offer of preferential trade. We have a Commonwealth Minisrry who are prepared, without a moment's hesitation, to alter the fiscal policy of an Empire. They are prepared at a moment's notice to ' h u rl into I once read somewhere chaos all the trade and commerce of this great Commonwealth. Yet this great Ministry cannot tell the difference between a concession which is being hawked in the streets of London, and a legitimate tender. "" These are your gods, 0 ye people!"" We have been told that it is the machinations of a wicked combine in London which have defeated this new and philanthropic company who desired to render such magnificent service to Australia. If that be so let us fight the combination. If it is a combination that is doing all the mischief let us ourselves, manf u l l y, fight them straight out, and not go behind James Laing, or anybody else. When Parliament last met I urged that we should fight this combination, and I happened to use some words which I admit were prosy and prosaic. I said that if we desired to enter into this scheme, and we were to be met by fair opposition, we could deal fairly with that opposition, but that if we were to be met with unfair opposition, we had resources of civilization at our back. These, as I say, were prosy and prosaic words; but since then the same idea has been translated into beautiful, eloquent, poetic language by the Prime Minister. That honourable gentleman statedSo long as the game is played legitimately it is not a matter with which we can interfere, but if private enterprise stands across the path of public interest for its own selfish gain, the people of this country will be very speedily",17,Addre Ss In Re Ply
22,Mr Johnson,We were told that he,18,Addre Ss In Re Ply
23,Mr Thomas,"We were told thatasked whether they do not feel called upon to take a hand in their own protection. These were valiant words, but what have the Government done? They are going to "" take a hand "" in something, but, I repeat, what have they done? Orient Steam Navigation Company. tiser, which is a strong Deakinite newspaper, stated that while in England the Prime Minister was really annoyed because the British Government, or the Imperial Conference, were not prepared to take some action-that what he wanted was action, not words. Here was a man who all his life long had allowed the splendour of words to do duty for realities; and when he declared that he desired action and not words, I felt rather staggered that he should desire to do something besides talk. The Treasurer, in an announcement published in the press on the 20th April, stated that he had received a communication from the Prime Minister, but that there was nothing in it of a definite character. Here we have the Prime Minister's own Treasurer stating that in a communication received from the former, "" there was nothing of a definite character."" We have been told by the Prime Minister that if this combination in London hurls itself against us the time will come when we must "" take a hand."" How are we going to "" take a hand "" ? First, it seems to me, the Government desired to know what somebody else was going to do-wha t the State Premiers or the State of Victoria was going to do-and then ultimately they called for fresh tenders. I venture to say that anybody could call for fresh tenders a child could. That reminds me that Mr B. R. Wise once said in the State Parliament of New South Wales, "" A child can say 'yes' or 'no,' but it requires a Reid to say ' yes' and ' no' at the same time."" Therefore, I say, that it does not require a great deal of effort on the part of anybody merely to call for fresh tenders. The members of the present Ministry, we know, have very lofty ideas. ber the Prime Minister,, at a time when the present leader of the Opposition was at the head of the Government, speaking on preferential trade, and saying that it was sometimes necessary to throw away the humble compass and the ordinary chart and to steer by the stars. I think, sir, that it would not be amiss if the present Government were to cease star-gazing for a little while, and to begin to pay some little attention to every-day life. The Minister of Trade and Customs went with the Prime Minister to England a little while ago. I am very pleased that he should have had a trip to the Old Country. But from what we can learn from the newspapers, I think it can be said of him with even greater truth than it was said by the old Roman, general: "" I came, I saw, I conquered."" For we understand that the honourable gentleman was able to say, even before he took off his overcoat amidst the luxurious surroundings of the Hotel Cecil, that he had arrived, had seen England, and had conquered it. When an Englishman tours in Australia, and we do not happen to like a man who has been out here about six weeks expressing opinions which do not coincide with our own, we speak of him as being only a globe-trotter who does not understand the position. But I understand that the Minister of Trade and Customs found things out in England very quickly. After he had been a day or two at Home, he expressed the opinion that the last general election in Great Britain was only a flash in the pan. He alsostated that England was a country that was living from hand to mouth. Many men might have been dazed to discover such a state of things, but the Minister of Trade and Customs had a solution. It is ar» easy matter to point out a fault, but of course if you have a solution ready it is much more to your credit. And the Minister had a solution.. He said that if England were to buy wheat from the Colonies-fro m Riverina, I presume-everythin g would be all right and England would besaved. It is strange how easily some people are able to solve great and mighty problems. They can see a nation in penury and point out the way to l i ft it to plenty in a very little while; and yet in their own country these people cannot fix up a mail contract f It reminds one of the verseThese lofty souls have telescopic eyes That see the faintest speck of distant pain \ While at their feet, a world of agonies, I rememUnseen, unheard, unheeded, writhes in vain. Again we have been told that it was the shipping combination in England that prevented the successful issue of the debentures of the mail syndicate. But I should like to ask those who are of that opinion whether or not the criticism of the newspapers in Australia did not prevent the company-if it ever had a chance; I do not",18,Addre Ss In Re Ply
24,Mr Reid,They .have interviewed the,19,Addre Ss In Re Ply
25,Mr Thomas,"The Adelaide Adverthink it had-fro m succeeding? iike to ask whether the criticisms launched against it in Australia had not a good deal to do with preventing it from being carried to a successful issue ? The Shipping Commission presented a report to the last Parliament in which it was recommended that the Government of the Commonwealth should undertake the carrying of the mails. The report containedfiguresproving-as we believed very satisfactorily that the enterprise would pay and show a credit balance. But what-was the result? The newspapers were not satisfied merely with stating that in their opinion it was an unwise thing for the Government to rush into such an enterprise, but they criticised our figures, and showed to their own satisfaction very conclusively indeed that our statistics w,ere unreliable, and that, indeed, there would be a large loss, instead of a credit. One had only to read the Age, the Argus, the Daily Telegraph of Sydney, and the Sydney Morning Herald, together with the West Australian and other newspapers, to see how these journals laid themselves out to show that our figures were all astray, that our estimated income was inflated, that our estimated expenditure was not sufficiently high. Can we blame the London newspapers, in those circumstances, for publishing such articles as they did? The Age prates a good deal about the policy of Australia for the Australians, and refers to the great future of this country. In our report we calculated that Australia was going ahead, and that in the future there would be a greater volume of trade and commerce than there -is to-day. We thought that we were justified in anticipating that the country would make advances. But the Age, in order to kill what it considered to be our socialistic scheme, was then prepared to argue that we were far too optimistic, and had too great a faith in the future. I was not at all displeased that those articles were published. I knew very well when I submitted my motion ini this House that it would be defeated. leader, as well as one or two other eminent members of my party, decided to vote against it. I was well aware, therefore, that it could not be carried. Consequently I concluded that the articles could have no effect so far as Parliament was concerned. But I thought that the newspaper articles would in all probability be republished in London, and would help to kill the syndicate. Let me quote a sample of an article which I should appeared in the London Daily Mail. It was written by MrH . P. Lyne, an Australian, who wroteThe finance editor of Daily Telegraph, of Sydney, considers that the freight earnings should be placed at ^'312,000, instead of ^46S,ooo, and that in addition to the subsidy of ^'150,000 there would be an annual deficiency of ^'309,000 on the service. Other independent critics foretell a considerably larger loss. The financial aspect of the scheme, in a word, is demonstrably unsound. Well, I do not think that an article of that kind was very helpful to persons who were endeavouring to float a new company in London. So that I take this opportunity of thanking those people who wrote the articles in the Australian newspapers on this question. They and the Government supporters in the discussion which took place upon my motion helped in the same direction, by pointing out that the figures of the Royal Commission over which I presided were all astray, and that it would be impossible for such an enterprise as we advocated to pay. Besides, they went as far.as to say that the Orient Company had not paid, and that the Peninsular and Oriental Company was not paying so far as its Australian business was concerned. I venture to say that those speeches and those articles had something to do with preventing the flotation of the company, because I do not think for a moment that England is so poor-althoug h she has been described as living from hand to mouth-that , if we could. guarantee to capitalists in London dividends of 4* or 5 per cent, on four or five millions of money, they would not be able to subscribe such a sum in spite of all the Sir Thomas Sutherlands in the world. Again, it was pointed out here that the Government could not raise the money if we went into this socialistic scheme, because the people in England would not subscribe the capital. Yet all that the syndicate required was simply the guarantee of one State for its debentures. If the guarantee of one State was sufficient to enable the money to be My honoured and respected raised, surely if the whole Commonwealth was behind such a scheme, there would be no difficulty in carrying it out. forthcoming when the State of Victoria was agreeing to guarantee the debentures. finitely decided to guarantee the debentures.

27,Mr Thomas,"The State had not dethe guarantee unless the second deposit of ^25,000 The fact remains that these articles and speeches protested rather too much, and I think had the effect I have suggested. Fresh tenders are to be invited. Where? In England; this poor country that is living from hand to mouth. We are going to save England by preferential trade, and we are unable to run a. mail service unless we go to English capitalists and ask them to build or supply boats for the purpose. Some people who talk a great deal aboutpreferential trade, and what we are going to do for the Empire with that policy, make the claim that we are indeed a great people. It is not a bad thing to talk, but it is a good thing also to do something. As we have been continually saying that we are a great people and a great nation, is it not about time that we proved it by doing something on our own? opinion it has been proved that what [ suggest can be done. I am one of those who believe that private enterprise* can make a mail service pay. If the carriage of letters from here to England under subsidized conditions never paid in the past, is not paying now, and is not likely to pay, then those engaged in the business would long ago have abandoned it, because private enterprise never renders any service to a community merely for the sake of doing so. It never renders a service which is not carried out at a profit. If there had been no profit in the shipping business engaged in the carriage of mails it would not have been the labour member for Broken Hill who brought the matter of a State service before Parliament, but it would have been the honourable member for Kooyong, who, in the last Parliament, with such stately dignity arrogated to himself the right to speak on behalf of the commercial classes of Australia. If there had been no profit for private enterprise in the business not only would the Chambers of Commerce have been found supporting the proposal, but behind them there would have been the support of the great dailies of Australia, whose proprietors think more of the advertisements of quack medicine than they do of the welfare of the people. The honourable member for Kooyong would have been supported by the managers of our great' dailies, who, so long as they bask in the smiles of the rich, are prepared, if necessary, to enthral a nation. I say that private enterprise does make the business Mr Thomas. pay, because those engaged in private enwas put down. terprises do not undertake work for the benefit of the general public. A little time ago, to give an instance of this, the Suevic, a great White Star boat, was wrecked on But what is to be done now? the Cornish coast. Unfortunately, a large quantity of frozen meat cargo was washed out of the ship, and was floating about ir> the sea. It became diseased and corrupted, but it got into some of the little fishing hamlets of Cornwall. It was not private enterprise that sent out boats to collect that meat. That must be 3 socialistic scheme, which ought to be undertaken by the Government; and 1 so we found the private enterprise people of Great Britain asking that the Imperial Government should do the work. I repeat that a mail service can be made to pay as a private enterprise, or we should have had the Chambers of Commerce making the proposal which I have In my made. I go further, and say that, while it will pay private enterprise to carry on a mail service, it will pay the State better. The Government of the Commonwealth could secure a bigger revenue from State owned boats than could be secured from boats run in the interests of private enterprise, because behind the Government boats there would be a national sentiment. We have heard a great deal in Australia of late about national sentiment. I believe in a national sentiment. No country can be great unless its people are patriotic, and cultivate a national sentiment. Not long ago Sir John Madden, the Chief Justice of Victoria, at the opening of an exhibition held under the auspices of the Australian Natives' Association, drew himself up to his full height, and expanding his ample and noble chest told the admiring multitude who were listening with bated breath, that the shirt he had on had been made in Australia. I presume that the resources of the Commonwealth were strained, but, however that may be, the shirt had been made. Sir John Madden told the people to whom he was speaking that the shirt he was wearing was an Australian shirt, and that anybody who was dissatisfied with an Australian shirt-well , he ought not to be. I noticed that very shortly afterwards, Sir John Madden went to England in a German boat. I have no doubt that the shirt referred to was starched with Australian starch. If it was not, it ought to have been, because of the national sentiment. I have no doubt that the immaculate shirt-front which Sir John Madden exihibited to the people had been starched party was a pledged protectionist, the honwith Australian starch, and an appeal was orable gentleman told the people of Ballamade on the occasion to all in Australia to rat that that was not sufficient. use Australian products because they were he thought that they would be contaiminated made in Australia.

In addition to the fact that there would be this Australian senman failed in passing one also. timent behind State-owned boats, it must be remembered that they could not be boycotted as the boats of a private company can be by the London shipping ring. With deal of that in the honourable member. the Commonwealth behind them. I venture to say that they would be found too powerf u l for the shipping ring, for, as Mr Deakin elegantly and ably said, "" We could take a hand in the game."" The muddle which has been made is a very serious thing for the producers of the Commonwealth. When speaking some time ago, I pointed out that it was a very serious matter for the producers of the Commonwealth not to be able to send their perishable products Home with regularity and despatch. shall not belabour that point now, because I intend to-morrow or the day afterwards to give notice of a motion that instead of accepting any tender for a mail contract, we should establish tmail boats of our own, and I can deal with that phase of the question when that is being discussed. On the question of preferential trade, I may say that I am one of those who do not agree with all that was done at the Imperial Conference by the Prime Minister and the Minister of Trade and Customs. Of all people in the world, it seems to me, who could talk preferential trade, if it ever meant anything, to the people of England, we says it again. When the Minister of Trade should not find the Prime Minister and the and Customs was speaking in reply to the Minister of Trade and Customs. went to the Federal electors a little time terjected, '.'

73,Mr Thomas,"The Clarion put thatgoing to England to take part in party politics. But I do object to the ceaseless flow of words of the Prime Minister and the ponderous jokes of the Minister of Trade and Customs being used on behalf of the landed proprietors of England. The Minister of Trade and Customs spoke of the Prime Minister having been loyal to Australia. I think it is right that he should be loyal to Australia; but surely the people of England have an equal right to be loyal to England? I hold that if the people of England think it is not wise to go in for preferential trade with the Colonies, they are quite as justified in being loyal to England as are the people of Australia in being loyal to their country. Passing away from that, I am very glad to know that the question of old-age pensions is mentioned Speech, though I regret very much indeed the position whioh it occupies there. I believe that the time has come when we ought to have a system of old-age pensions. am in favour of the enactment of the principle, but not as a charity.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE tralian in England than perhaps I am here. direct taxation So far so good. I hope that something will be done on those lines. I know that there are some honourable and distinguished members of the House who are against direct taxation. The honourable member for Wilmot, I think, said that he is against direct taxation. I could understand a number of persons being opposed to direct taxation, because it means removing the taxation from the shoulders of the poor and placing it on those of the rich. Some time ago, when I was in Tasmania, I heard the president of the National League, Mr because whatever duties are imposed will Fitzgerald, address a meeting. He was proving something else, and he did not want to prove anything in favour of direct taxation. But what he said came in very usefully. He was quoting figures from the statistician of Tasmania, showing that three working families pay as much in Customs duties as does the richest man in the community. I know why the rich object to direct taxation. It is because under a policy of indirect taxation most of the revenue is provided by the poor. It is the poor who have to pay the Customs duties. tion in every State? finest political speech I ever had the treasure of listening to in Australia was delivered by the leader of the Opposition in the Sydney TownH a l l . On that occain the Governor General's sion he saidI warn the Treasurers of Australia that if I go into Federation I will do for the Commonwealth what I have done for New South Wales. I will take the taxation off the shoulders of the I poor, and put it upon the rich. That was a noble sentiment, and I should be glad if the right honourable gentleman would act a. little on those lines. in that direction. the subject of old-age pensions. I stated during last Parliament that no Ministry, whether it be a Watson, a Deakin, a Reid, or a Knox Ministry, should be allowed to live unless it dealt legitimately, fairly, and squarely with the subject of old-age pensions. I hold that opinion to-day. I am very glad to find Tariff reform on our I was more Ausbill of fare, and I hope that Ministers will bring it forward, though apparently they I am in favour of do not consider the matter so urgent now as they did a little while back, when the honourable member for Maribyrnong used to tell us about the children starving in the streets for want of high duties. Since the honourable gentleman has been sitting at ease in Zion he has not shown much anxiety about the matter. No doubt the fiscal cry is a good one with which to appeal to the electors, whether on the free-trade or on the protectionist side; but now that the elections are over Ministers do not seem very ready to carry out their promises. I do not think that the measures for Tariff reform which they will introduce will do a great deal of good to Australia as a whole, help some industries only by putting others at a disadvantage.

I hope that the time is not far distant when the Labour Party in this House will be sufficiently strong and courageous to set its face against the creation of further wealth by the establishment of new industries, the opening up of new mines, or in any other way, until the wealth already bestowed upon us by the munificent hands of Providence, and as the outcome of the toil, sweat, and agony of the workers of Australia, is fairly and justly distributed. ber for Wilmot hopes that the time will soon come when there will be but two parties in this House. I hope so, too, because then the Labour Party will be distinct from whatever other party there may be, divided by an obvious line of cleavage. Then those who are working with us will be in our ranks, fighting under our banner and behind our chief, whilst those who are against us will have to stand up and fieht us like men. I should like to see two distinct parties in this House, one standing for monopolies, for class privileges, for vested interests, for the rich and well-fed, and for the sweaters and the starchers, and the other standing for the people, for the community as a whole. Then we shall cease to have millionaires on the one hand and paupers on the other, and it will be impossible for the greed! and selfishness of a few to deny the many the right to work. The day will have come, too, when we shall see no more the tragic contrast between the position of the woman on one' side of the street, enjoying all the luxuries and bounties of view it is pleasant for us to hear honprovided by our civilization, while on the other her sister, whose life is as precious to the Government which they support. But her Divine Maker, has to sell her virtue to obtain bread. Then will have commenced the first act in the drama which will inauguwhich we can all do, and that is to speak rate a civilization based on the eternal and everlasting principles of Christianity. Mr Thomas. should like to again express my regret at the unhappy cause of the absence of the Prime Minister from this debate. It is to some In an admirextent an embarrassment to me. In view of the statement that he will have an opportunity after the debate is over to reply to criticisms, I am somewhat relieved; but If it one must always feel, if he be a man, svmpathy with the illness and suffering of The even his bitterest political opponents. I am sure that feeling is general in this House in regard to honourable members whenever misfortune overtakes them. Before this debate began I had it in my mind to make a remark which I cannot any longer make. I was going to say that the position of parties in this House was very much the same as that which existed in the closing days of the last Parliament. I cannot say that now, in view of the speeches which have been delivered by several members of the party sitting in the Ministerial corner. During the last Parliament it was an open question whether there was not some subterranean method of sympathetic communication between the GoThe honourable memvernment and the Labour Party. It was a question which was hotly debated. But if such a subterranean tunnel existed then, it i.s quite clear now that it has been closed, because honourable members sitting below the gangway have expressed themselves with a degree of frankness which may not be pleasant to the Ministry, but which I think is more in accordance with a healthy political activity. In the wretched state of things which exists in this Housea wretched state of things which every one must admit-it is, I think, one duty which every honourable member owes to the country that he should not allow ties which are not honest, ties which are not genuine, ties which are not cemented by any feeling of political sympathy or principle, to interfere with the freest and most fearless expression of opinion in the course of public debate. The members of the Labour Party who have spoken, have done so in a spirit of candour which I think every one can appreciate. Of course, from an Opposition point orable members below the gangway abusing I wish to put that party aspect entirely out of sight.

88,Mr Reid,"I am not speaking personmembers returned here pledged to increasethose in older countries-the fact that we have a higher standard of wages, which, high as it is, is one of the glories of the country. One does not need to be a member of the Labour Party to know-indee d one has learned little in political economy who does not 4cnow-that the higher the wages of a country the greater is the prosperity of its people, and the greater the openings for the enterprise of the capitalist. There is a far greater sympathy between capital and labour than some people recognise. The terms seem to divide them in the bitterest possible way, but nature has indissolubly connected the two. The money, the brain, and the hands must work together. In developing the natural opportunities of a country, there must be no disunion of those mighty forces. One of my strongest indictments against my honourable friends of the Labour Party is that, in point of fact, whether designedly or not,, there is a constant tendency on their part to endeavour to separate different classes of .the community by feelings of personal hostility. What was the appeal delivered just now by the honourable member for Barrier, who, by the way, if I may be permitted to say so, made one of the ablest speeches that I have heard from him ? I admired the ability of the speech, and discovered in him a gleam of humour which had not seemed previously to exist. honourable member's example. Barrier drew a lurid picturea picture portrayed in much of the literature presented to the people-of idle wealth and luxury ""on one side of the street and of some unfortunate on the other. I should -like to say that humanity is not quite so bad as it is painted. The chasm between wealth and poverty, great as it is, is not quite so wicked as some people imagine. with my honourable friends that the chasm is one that ought to be bridged. It is generally recognised that wealth has its duties. They are perhaps not duties that. can be placed on the pages of a statute-book, but the man or woman who possesses wealth and does not recognise the duty of endeavouring to help those who are poor and distressed, is one for whom every man, even if he is not a member of the Labour Party, must have a perfect contempt.' There is no more contemptible object than the man who is wealthy and has not a feeling of kinship and kindliness towards the poor. That sort of individual is a bad man, and, may I say that, when we come to the question of badness, we find it running through even the ranks of labour. the right honourable member has referred are not embodied in the statute-book they are usually ""more honor'd in the breach than the observance."" pathy with many views that are expressed in regard to this matter; but the real reform which will remove these horrible inequalities in human life will come, not from our legislation, but from an increased sense of the human duty which each man and woman owes to the other. To the extent which my honourable friends of the Labour Party increase that feeling they are doing a public service. but for justice. to adopt. Although we may differ on many points,, might I suggest to my honourable friends of the Labour Party that they do the Opposition a great injustice when they speak of us as being here to consider only the interests of the privileged classes, and the wealthy classes. I have been before the public of Australia for twenty-seven years, and I do not think any man can say that in the whole course of my public life I have ever been found battling for the rich or the privileged. Whatever we may say about the different political partiesthe Labour Party, the Protectionist Party, or the Opposition I give all credit for an honest desire to do their best to promote the welfare and happiness of the people. That is a proper position to take up. To endeavour to depict us as being insensible to the feelings of humanity-as glorving I thoroughly agree, however, in fighting for those who can 'fight for themselves, as glorying in trampling on those who have no power to protect themselvesis to endeavour to present a picture that is unjust and appeals not to instincts of truth' and humanity, but to the lowest feelings of class. I wish now to say a word or two with reference to the fiscal question. The point I desire to make may be briefly put. Honourable members have the power now to raise the Tariff, and the one principle upon which that power has been given them by the electors is that by the Tariff Australian labour may be surrounded with that",28,William Lyne I Said A Lot In Where My Dear Fellow Have You Got Your Ideas

Customs says, "" Hear, hear."" nately when he expresses his approval of any statement made by me, I am almost sure to be in the wrong. Such an interruption is the most unhappy that the Minister could make. When I hear it, I begin to suspect the soundness of my argument. But in spite of the honourable gentleman's approval, I repeat that I hope that the great primary industries of this country will be remembered. I trust that once honourable members have provided for the difference between labour in other countries and that in Australia-onc e they have given the legitimate margin to which the capital put into these manufacturing industries is entitled-the y will not so run up the duties as to inflate the profits of the men engaged in these industries over the profits of those engaged in the great primary industries of Australia. The less this gambling, elementthis hankering after law-made profit-dis figures our industrial development, the better for the country. I hope that when the Tariff is submitted, my honourable friends opposite will show the true balance of their humanity by tempering the burdens they place upon the great masses of the people. I trust that they will then remember these distressed people, these homes oppressed by misery, of which we have heard. I hope that when they begin to pile up the duties on articles which are the necessaries of life, they will remember the people who are smuggling in poverty. Sir WILLIAM shall protect labour. which has been adopted. I shall honestly fight, as I have always done, for my own views, but I admit that the question was put before the people of Australia, and that the electors have affirmed the necessity, the wisdom or unwisdom, of increasing the present Tariff. But when my honourable friends couple affirmatives and negatives in connection with my political career, I should like them to consider what my opponents would say of me if I clamoured in Australia for increased duties on the manufactures of the mother country, and then, going to England', announced my intention to lower such duties. The most gigantic "" Yes-no "" of Australian politics is that of the present Government, who went round this continent clamouring for the policy of shutting the door against the manufactures of the mother country by means of higher duties on British manufactures, and then sent there representatives who, Unfortuin the presence of millions of people, having upon them all the burdens of empire, clamoured for fresh taxation upon them. They clamoured to have new taxation imposed on the millions of England, although at the moment they spoke, they knew that they had no honest preference to offer. They knew also that the British Government had been commissioned by the people of England to shut this door of preference. Just think for a moment. Here was this door of preference shut by an enormous vote of the people of England. When the British Parliament met, the principle of free-trade and the freedom of raw materials and food from taxation was affirmed by the House of Commons by 478 to 98-the most enormous majority ever known on any great question of national policy. What did the representatives of Australia expect? They did not go Home to meet British Ministers who were clinging to office with a wretched minority of supporters. They did not go Home to meet a set of political ' adventurers who were kept in office only because, much as they were disliked, some one else was disliked more. They met Ministers in England who had the greatest of all Parliaments standing massed behind them. Talk about the exuberance of political vanity! To think that the most marvellous eloquence any Australian is capable of, or the most marvellous eloquence in the world-and no one is more capable in that LYNE I hope that we line than the distinguished man who represented Australia on this occasionI shall bow to the policy could open the door which the people of Great Britain had bolted and barred, was to indulge in a flight of absurdity. When a door is bolted we can hit it hard; when we know we cannot get in, it is astonishing how desperate we can be in our attempts to get in. The two gentlemen who represented us knew that they would not be called upon to prove their sincerity by stating what they were Iprepared to do; and when they found this triple-bolted door of British oak they kicked and screamed and knocked, praying all the time, "" For God's sake, do not open it .

96,Mr Reid,The Minister of Trade and,30,William Lyne I Said A Lot In Where My Dear Fellow Have You Got Your Ideas
97,. Mr Reid,"instead of this closed door, the people of England with equal emphasis had affirmed the principle of protection. Let us consider what the position would have been if the British Ministers had responded to that eloquence, and had said, '' We wish to make this family arrangement with you -the people of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales are prepared to come to a friendly understanding, and are anxious for Australian wheat, without regard to their own starving farmers, and we have a mandate from the people, Mr Deakin, to do whab you ask-what will you do?"" The moment that question was asked, this gigantic Australian balloon would be pricked, and would fall lifeless to the earth. If Mr Joseph Chamberlain had been sitting at the head of that Imperial Conference, and had said to the Australian Prime Minister, "" What will you do"" ? the Australian Prime Minister would have had to cable to the Melbourne Age for instructions as to how far he could go. And here, in passing, may I express my profound regret at the prolonged illness of Mr Chamberlain. We may have differences about his policy, but I regard Mr Joseph Chamberlain as one of the greatest of the men who have appeared in the politics of Britain during the past fifty years. The honourable member for Barrier does not see any great harm in Ministers, on a mission of this sort, taking part in party politics. But I say that it is the greatest abuse of the commonest rules which ought to guide men who meet to confer in any representative capacity, to discuss matters of local political concern. I make nothing of the fact that the Australian Ministers were the guests of the British Government; indeed, they were not the guests of the British Government, but the guests of the British nation. But whether guests of the Government or guests of the nation, they went there as ambassadors to a Conference to settle vexed and difficult questions. We desired that Conference to be a real living power, influencing for good the destinies of this mighty Empire. those statesmen, brought from all quarters of the British Empire, go outside the doors of the Council chamber in order to help the political interests of a great political party? the Imperial Conference must discuss questions with frankness and fearlessness. I am not one who wishes to see Australian representatives forgetting the spirit of the Mr Reid. people from whom they come; and, as I say, there must be at the Council table the utmost frankness and fearlessness;. although there must also be some courtesy. The moment the ambassadors, of a country go out of the Council chamber to help the political interests of a party, or to add to the political difficulties of a party, and take part in the discussion of burning questions of local political concern, they do more harm to the tie which binds us together than they could do in any other way. If the Prime Minister of England and the English Treasurer, Mr Asquith, after a great election in which the people of Australia had with enthusiasm vindicated the policy of protection, had come to an Imperial Conference in Melbourne, and had gone from the Council chamber to the factories of South Melbourne to talk of the beauties of free-trade and the absurdities of protection learned member did. tion ; I did not come as an ambassador, but as a representative of the people. The honourable member will see the distinction. The Prime Minister and the Minister of Trade and Customs went Home as representing the people of Australia, and not the people of a political party. If , I say, the British IPrime Minister and the BritishTreasurer had taken any such action in this great city we should have had the staff of the Age tearing the Union Jack to tatters,, trampling it in the mud, and demanding animmediate repeal of the Union. Cannot Australians be commonly fair to others?' Cannot men, who use"" the fullest and frankest candour towards others, respect the rights of others? Cannot those who would flame in fury if those things were done in Australia by English statesmen feel' at least a sentiment of regret that Australian statesmen did them in England?

132,,"I do not think that newsMr REID I am sure the honorablea fair way. My honourable friend the leader of the Labour Party has taken a good deal of trouble in connection with this question, and I am glad to say is prepared to help in every way to bring about a settlement of the question congenial to the feelings of all parties. Let us try, at any rate, to make a selection which will be generally acceptable to this Parliament and to the people of New South Wales. question ? when I speak of a settlement which will be satisfactory to the Commonwealth as well as to the people of New South Wales. Australian question, and the Australian people decided that the Capital should be in New South Wales. tion, with a limitation, which was of the very essence of the bond. We draw a distinction between things which are of the essence of a contract and trivial things. Honourable members are aware that this Federation was brought about by that concession, and that it was of the essence of the contract of union. minute to which the right honourable gentleman has referred was not made public sooner. how it happened. It was an unfortunate thinga bit of miserable economy, I am afraid. The Conference was held in Melbourne. A number of copies of the agreement were struck off at the printing office in the locality. They were distributed from the Melbourne Government Printing Office, and therefore, unfortunately, did not find their way into the records"" of some of the States. In that way they faded from the public mind. It was a sheer accident. If we other Premiers going back to our States had had the paper printed in our own States, it would have been public property and well known. the fact that the New South Wales people by a majority agreed to the Constitution without that provision being in it at all. ceptance, and it was open to the other Premiers, when I came down to Melbourne, to say, "" Mr Reid, we won't grant what you ask;"" but, having granted it, you cannot go back on it. South Wales consent to grant the 900 square miles if we went somewhere else? had a couple of houses, would he consent to some one taking one of them ? I want to say a word or two about the Bill relating to the High Court and the Privy Council. On matters affecting the rights of the States and the Commonwealth, there is no not an Australian doubt that the Constitution was intended to make the High Court the final arbiter, with liberty to the High Court, if it pleased, to allow of an appeal. I shall support the Government in any Bill they introduce to make that more clear. I hope the Government will bring in the Bill relating to income tax on Federal salaries as soon"" as possible. I feel that the present state of things is a hardship on the States, and that we should ourselves clear the path without waiting for the prospective ruinous litigation. If the Government will do as they say, and bring a Bill in speedily in order to enable this Parliament to do whafc is right by the States in this matter, I think they will meet with general support. One of the other matters I want to refer to is the electoral system. I cannot help saying, particularly looking at certain returns, that the system under which the electors now exercise their franchise cannot be a good one, because of the enormous number of mistakes that are made on the ballot papers. I thinik thac one fact condemns it. We want a different system. As to the vacancy in the representation of South Australia in the Senate, I regret to have to differ from my honourable and learned friend the Attorney-General very strongly. The effect of the decision of His Honour Mr Justice Barton was to put that vacancy in the Senate back into the position of a vacancy caused by the act of dissolution of Parliament. The effect of a decision of that sort is to put things back to the time from which they started. There is a writ in existence for that election, issued by the Governor General, to which, in respect of this election, there has been no real return made, because the High Court have decided that the election was null and void. The effect of that is to wipe it all out, and restore the original document. Crosby have got the seat if he had lived? the Judge alone could settle.

144,Mr Reid,"That is a matter whichtorney-General is good law, it is possible to upset the balance of (power in the Senate by some informality, and to transfer the consequent election from the people of Australia to the State Parliament. If it can be done in this instance, it can be done in a hundred different ways, and in a hundred other cases. I strongly dissent, with great respect, from the opinion which has been expressed by the Attorney-General. I want to say a word in reference to the transcontinental railway. I strongly appeal to honourable members to agree, at any rate, to the proposed survey -to sanction the exploration of that line of country. The State of Western Australia, practically for all military purposes, does not belong to us. We could not defend it if we had not some facilities of this kind. It deserves so much from our hands/ Every Government that I know of has, I think, been in favour of it. I admit there was no contract, and that we shall not break a contract if we do not agree to the railway, but I think in all the chcumstances we might do that muchfor the people of that great State. I want to say a few words if honourable members will allow me on the question of Australian defence. We have reams of minutes about it, we have had barrow-loads of schemes, but while there are two or three things we want, the first thing we want in that Military Department is a staff of officers in touch with the recent developments of military knowledge and science, and men who have gone through the ordeal of battle in large commands. Honourable members know that to have done that does not unfit a man to be an administrator. What is the use of all our talk about a system ? The system' is a mere piece of parchment. We shall never get a good system of defence until we get really good men to administer the Department as officers. I do not want to say a single word against the able gentleman who is at present at the head of these Forces, but it was a thousand pities that when that office was vacant the Government did not get the best officer in the British Empire of the kind I have described to fill the position. As to equipment, what is the use of all our talk if our guns are obsolete? Too many of them are. What is the good of our land Forcesi f they are not efficient? We cannot make them efficient by passing Bills. I come now to the question of the Australian Navy. money, let us talk about the Australian Navy. There are gentlemen who will grudge a fifty-pound note to one scheme of defence, and spend £2,000,000 upon another. I will tell honourable members my view in a few words on the question of the Australian Navy. It is as absolutely a proper thing to aim at as the development of a mercantile marine. I am not one of those who deride this desire for an Australian Navy. It is one of the inevitable instincts of a people who are growing. I hope to see Australian ships navigating the oceans of the world on the pathways of commerce. It is one of the certainties of our development that we shall have a Navy of our own, but what gigantic meanness there is in the suggestion that because we want a navy of our own we should not pay anything towards the British fleets that do defend us! Our navy might turn out badly. It could not do much for us, but we have over the whole of the oceans of the globe an absolute protection in that little bit of bunting-the UnionJack. The Minister of'Trade and Customs talks of the millions of England living from hand to mouth, but just think that we pay one 160th pare of the money the starving millions of England pay towards the support of the Navy1 Of course, I admit it is a wealthy country, but they are contributors to that extent. They pay about ,£32,000,000 for the Navy alone in the year. We pay £200,000. Australia never reached a lower depth of absolute gigantic meanness-the statesmanship of the coster-monger-tha n when we couple the question of an Australian Navy with getting out of a solemn Act of Parliament, out of giving our little childhood's mite towards the enormous responsibilities _ which rest on the people in those British islands who have to support the whole weight of the Empire and defend us. a donation at all. be coupled? Why should the Prime Minister have interviews with the Admiralty in order to explain what could be done with this £200,000 ? I say to those of us who talk as loyal men-and many outside went out to risk their lives in standing by the oJd country-surel y a nation that has shed its blood for England can pay this little mite towards the cost of the British",35,William Lyne I Said A Lot In Where My Dear Fellow Have You Got Your Ideas

Surely we can leave this Act on the statute-took of Australia, not because of the payment provided for, but as an acknowledgment that we are not dead to a sense of obligation. error-the payment of a subsidy at all. also about the Imperial Conference. The Prime Minister has had a number of views as to what was actually done at the Conference. When he was in England, he was profoundly disappointed; when he got somewhere on the voyage he said that the Conference required looking at from a distance, in order to see what really had been done; and when he got to Australia he said that it was one of the grandest epochs' in the history of the Empire, and that a vast amount of good had been done. The honourable member for Hume, when he was in London, said that all it did was to ventilate a few questions. There is, however, one grand triumph; we are to be called a Dominion. thing of the kind. myself. There is one grand thing that we have achieved; we can call ourselves a Dominion. What a marvellous triumph for the people of Australia 1 Do not let us forget that. Then there is something else which has been constructed., and for which they cannot find an English namea Secretariat. I do not want to decry that, because it may be a means of doing a great deal of good. In spite of the mysterious name, -1 think that there may be a great deal of good in the Secretariat. It will do a lot more good if it will only put its heads together in order to encourage the development of the commercial relations between the parts of the Empire ini a sound, feasible way. I ask honourable members to listen to the only figures I am going to use, in order to give them an idea of the English point of view in connection withpreference. Some Australians have an idea that our commerce is a great factor in the industrial position of England. Taking an average of the years from 1901 to 1905, I find that the trade of Great Britain with foreign countries was ,£678,000,000; with India and the Crown Colonies, which have a perfect system of free-trade with the mother country, £103,000,000; making a total of £781,000,000 a year; while her trade with the self-governing Colonies was £125,000,006 out of £900,000,000. That is a big trade; it is not a thing to be despised. This little spot on earth, on which the gigantic burden of Empire is superimposed, is swarming with people; in fact, so dense is the population that if the United States had to feed the same number of human beings to-day, according to area, they would have to feed 1,500,000,000 persons every day. Those millions of fellow countrymen, with this enormous responsibility upon them, have to consider these hundreds of millions of foreign trade. But let me get away from that, because my honourable friends may say, "" O h , they are nearly all imports."" The United Kingdom has a trade ,£80,000,000 greater than that of Germany, and £183,000,000 more than that of the United States. In Great Britain, the increase in the export of manufactures, during a period of three years, has been as follows :-In 1904, £243,000,000; in 1905, £269,000,000; and in 1906, £ 3 ° 5 i > ° ) showing an increase of 000 00 £62,000,000 in the British export of I did not say anymanufactured goods in three years. What a decaying country Great Britain is 1 and how anxious we ought to be about her fiscal policy! and Customs says that she is perishing. honourable friend should draw my attention to the Minister of Trade and Customs. I think that in England the honourable gentleman showed one sound feeling-h e may have others, but I never discovered them-whe n he expressed his love for the rural scenery of England. I had a greater desire-and it is the one thing which the honourable member and I share in common-to see the rural counties of England than to behold all the majesty of London itself. But I had this advantage over the Minister of Trade and Customs, that when I got into the rural scenery of England and saw a strawberry bed it did not remind me of the "" tired feeling "" I had when I got amongst the dukes and duchesses who are supposed to have strawberry leaves on their coronets. The honourable member has told us his opinion of the dukes and duchesses, and it would be interesting to know what they thought of him.",36,William Lyne I Said A Lot In Where My Dear Fellow Have You Got Your Ideas

If we show that we are animated by feelings similar to those which animate the people of Canada, our proposals may make headway with the British people; but if we try to expose their fiscal policy to ridicule, and endeavour to show that young Australia can teach them a great deal that they do not know, the reverse may happen.

Relations like those between the Ministry and the party with which I am associated have only recently appeared to the right honourable member to be unhealthy to the body politic, because for some years he held office in New South Wales with our support, and a short time since in the Commonwealth Parliament he was for a little while at the head of a Ministry whose direct following did not give it a majority. tion very long. I went out of office as soon as I got the opportunity.. member behaved in a strictly honourable way, which was to be expected of him!; but he showed no uneasiness at what he now professes to regard as an unconstitutional state of affairs. With regard to what he has said about the criticism of the policy of Ministers emanating from members on the Labour benches, I do not know that any of them have gone nearly as far in the use of contemptuous expressions towards this Administration as a member from whom the right honourable member for East Sydney accepted support went in regard to the last Administration. ber refer to Mr Cameron? Statute of Limitations apply to remarks concerning Mr Cameron's speech? member for East Sydney has spoken of the present condition of parties as unhealthy, and, by implication, as unconstitutional. Therefore, it is well to go back to these instances, so that we may know exactly how we stand. member has already done this half-a-dozen times. ber for Parramatta is, as usual, inaccurate. I have no recollection of ever having referred in a speech made in this Chamber to the remarks of the ex-member for Wilmot. Passing from this matter to the main issue, I come to the statement of the right honourable member for East Sydney that there was a mandate from the people expressed at the election that the present condition of parties should be brought to an end. I understood him to mean that there was a mandate from the people in favour of the substitution of another Government for that now in office. that. I blame the people a great deal for the present state of affairs. rected ; I stated the impression made upon my mind by the right honourable member's remarks. I thought from what he said that the mandate of the people was against the existence of a Government dependent for support and continuance in office upon another section of the House. Protectionist Tariff, which quite neutralized that expression of feeling. No one can put out this Government while the Tariff question is open. in the result of the elections, a mandate for the displacement of the present Administration. The result does not support the statement that the people were with those who said the position was unhealthy. The right honourable member for East Sydney spent a vast amount of time-hi s efforts entitling him to the thanks of those on his side of the House-in going from one end of Australia to the other to try to persuade the people that they should take advantage of the opportunity which was presenting itself to throw off the thraldom under which he endeavoured to convince them they were suffering, and accept a Government which would be above reproach of any kind. But the electors did not see things in his light, and therefore we find him to-day at the head of a party which is in a considerable minority in this House. We have heard it said frequently that there is in the Chamber a majority who are in accord so far as opposition to the proposals and general methods of the Labour Party are concerned. If that is so, the sooner the issue is made clear and definite, the sooner the people COOK -The honourable of Australia know where they are, and recognise the Tory and reactionary band which is behind the right honourable gentleman the better it will be, and the sooner will they disappear as an active force from the politics of this country.

I admit that if the -people had an opportunity of deciding without being colour-blind, without having their eyes dusted with a. thousand petty issues, which are sought to be introduced on such occasions, the Conservatives would find but a very small following in Australia, because this community is at heart democratic and progressive. It is not content to stand still. member says "" hear, hear."" That makes me the more surprised that the right honourable member, with all his great ability-admit ting as he does, that Australians are a progressive people-shoul d have put before them a policy of wait-a-whilea policy of marking time, as he did on the occasion of the last election. That fact shows how often the ablest amongst us are occasionally misled through accepting bad advice. I join with the right honourable member in expressing the hope that the question of the Tariff will be disposed of as early as possible. It seems to be regarded by some of our friends upon the other side of, the House as the one thing which it is necessary to get out of the way to enable all their ideals to attain fruition. With the greatest possible desire to assist them to reach the summit of their ambition, I join in the hope that the Tariff will be got out of the way at the earliest possible moment. Anything that I can do-snor t of sitting up every night, although I do not mind an occasional late night-to assist in that connection I shall .occasions. Therefore, I do not propose be most happy to do. Concerning the remark of the leader of the Opposition that everybody recognises the value to a country of high wages as an indication of prosperity, and that it is, therefore, necessary to cultivate a greater community of interests between capital and labour-that is not quite the phrase which he employed, but it expresses his ideaI have this criticism to offer. He seems to think that a mere statement of the beatitudes is all that is necessary, and that if we attempt to embody the high principles which he enunciates in a statute, we shall proceed beyond proper limits. My impression is that if we trust to the conscience of the individual to see that justice is done as between different sections of the community, there is but very small chance indeed of justice being done in our time. When the right honourable member says that the rule of justice should be observed, and fair treatment should be meted out, we all agree with him. We all think that. The great mass of the people think it, but the trouble is that in the great majority of cases they are at the mercy of a few unscrupulous individuals. Consequently, it is not sufficient that we should think-it requires that we should take some action to penalize those who would inflict unjust conditions upon a section of the people. SoI trust that in framing the new Tariff, we shall take steps, not merely to insure the possibility of Australian workmen being employed in a particular line of industry, but that we shall follow out the initiative of the last Parliament by making some effort to insure fair conditions being extended to the employ^, while at the same time protecting the interests of the consumer. That policy was adopted by the last ParliamentI admit, in but an experimental way. Nevertheless, the experiment seems to have proved successful, and I think that an extension of that system will rob pro^ tection of a great number of the objections which can be urged against it at the present time. Differing in my methods as I do from those followed by the leader of the Opposition, I trust that in connection with Tariff alterations we shall see a considerable extension of the principle so properly insisted ujpon by the last Parliament. I do not intend to speak at any great length, because it seems to me that if the present session is to be concluded within a reasonable time-seein g the vast amount of work that is before us -it will be necessary for honourable members to condense their remarks upon most to do more than refer to one or two matters which appear to me of glreat importance. Amongst these is included the question of the Naval Agreement. The view has been put forward by the leader of the Opposition, and also by the deputy leader, that it is a mean thing on the part of Australia to seek to withdraw the present subsidy of £200,000 per annum. I think that the contribution itself-if it be meant in a serious spirit-is but a mean one at the best.",39,William Lyne I Said A Lot In Where My Dear Fellow Have You Got Your Ideas

That was the reception which my proposal met at the hands of the right honourable member, and there does not seem to me much more on his part than a pious hope for the establishment of an Australian Navy. I think, however, that by means of a local expenditure of the present subsidy of £200.000, plus an equal amount from revenue upon the creation of the nucleus of a sea defence, we could render to the Empire as a whole a service more efficient than can be secured by a contribution of £ 2 0 0 , 0 00 per annum to the British Navy. I venture to assure the leader of the Opposition that a proposed allocation of revenue for the creation of an Australian Navy, or for Australian coastal deI t is but a mean confence, if he prefers to so describe it , would meet with a much heartier response from the taxpayers of Australia than would a contribution by the Commonwealth Government for the up-keep of the British Naval Squadron in these waters.

196,Mr Watson,"I could name severalwhich require treatment at the hands of the Federal Parliament, and each one of which involves a rather serious addition to our expenditure. In the first place, the Northern Territory-leavin g out any question as to the details of the agreement empty as it is to-day, constitutes an absolute menace to the security of the other portions of Australia. To take over the Territory means a fairly large additional annual expenditure-that is inevitable. Then all parties are practically pledged to old-age pensions, and that again means a large additional expenditure. To-day, the leader of the Opposition said that he agrees with the Government-and I can say the Labour Party emphatically agrees with the Governmentin its desire to establish, at any rate, the nucleus of an Australian Navy; and that cannot be done without money. There are other proposals for railways, which, if carried through, mean money; and, bearing all these things in mind, perhaps the most serious matter to which we can address ourselves at the moment, as a representative body, is the question of ways and means. I must say that this Government is exhibiting an indifference to the question to by the States Premiers in Conference. of ways and means, which, to my mind, is almost reckless. sing ; that is the reason. disposition on the part of the Treasurer to1910, a fixed sum equal to the average anday, as there is on the part of a great many Treasurers, to trust to the chapter of accinet revenue from Customs and Excise dents to provide the revenue necessary for all those grand schemes, which every one agrees with, but which cannot be carried out without making financial provision. First, we have the Treasurer putting forward proposals dealing with the difficulty which is created by what is known as the Braddon section of the Constitution, and the probable or possible cessation of the operation of that section at the end of 1910. for the raising and the expenditure of The Treasurer put before the Chamber a series of proposals, which, to my mind, were not sufficiently debated, or' sufficiently understood, by honourable members; because, otherwise, those proposals would have provoked much more serious objection than was raised by myself and one or two others. The proposals have since been adopted by the States Premiers at their Conference in Brisbane; and the Commonwealth Treasurer returned from that Conference expressing a surprised joyfulness that the Premiers had adopted that portion of his scheme. I think that the surprise should have been exhibited if the States Premiers had been insane enough, from their local stand-point, to refuse the proposal. Certainly, it is the most prodigal proposal, from the stand-point of Federal finance, that could possibly have been put forward. I remember hearing the leader of the Opposition express his abhorrence of the Braddon section, though that right honourable gentleman has since found reason to think that the section is not quite so bad as he then deemed it. will allow me to correct him. I have always been opposed to the inflexibility of the Braddon section, which creates an absurd state of things; and I am, and always have been, in favour of making the section more flexible. gentleman's election manifesto did not express that idea quite as clearly as one might have wished. However, I do not desire to deal with that point now, but to direct the serious attention of honourable members to what is involved in the proposal of the Treasurer, which, I understand, was agreed First, the Treasurer proposes that in lieu of the three-fourths of net revenue from Customs and Excise, be the amount large or small, the Commonwealth shall pay annually to each State for ten years after nual amount .of three-fourths of the which the State has contributed during, say, the five years preceding. So far as I am concerned, I have always objected to the principle, rump and stump, of the Braddon section. The whole design on which the finance system of the States and the Federation was built up was rotten. The Commonwealth should have been left dependent on its own resources, both money. _ But we have to take things as they are until, of course, they can be altered; and I am quite prepared, as I said at Hobart two or three years ago, to agree to a fixed payment, preferably a payment on a per capita basis. Whatever fixed sum is eventually agreed upon is of comparatively minor moment, so long as the Commonwealth is freed from the extraordinary provisions of the Braddon section. But the Treasurer is not content with granting a fixed sum equal to that which the States have been receiving on the aver*",42,William Lyne I Said A Lot In Where My Dear Fellow Have You Got Your Ideas

247,Mr Watson,"an Executive act. Without desiring in any degree to violate their privileges or to enter into a general discussion of the form of these tenders, I might be allowed to make a suggestion which I think would be of some little service. I should say that there should be embodied in the conditions of tender one to the effect that no State Government should acquire any financial control or interest in or over the contract. We propose to enter into a contract which is not merely a postal or mail contract. It must be remembered that on the former occasion, as at present, one of the stipulations included in the conditions of contract was that a certain speed should be maintained. quiring that the boats should have a certain carrying capacity. I am not sure whether that is included in the new conditions of contract. speed would be applicable to a mail service. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Not exactly. The limitation of the time of transit is essential to enable the Department to protect itself. But were we dealing only with the carriage of mails between certain places, why should we attempt to interfere with the speed at which the ships might be run between those places ? We must remember that in a matter of this sort every additional restriction or condition adds to the difficulty of the Commonwealth in securing a service on satisfactory terms. WhatI venture to suggest is that the Commonwealth is not merely contracting for the carriage of mails, but also for the establishment of a regular service which, in addition to the carriage of .mails, will, it is hoped, be of the greatest use and benefit to the Governments and peoples of the various States in the carriage of products. That is an additional responsibility which the Federal Government undertakes in stipulating for a service which will effect these purposes. When we contract for a mail service which in addition to carrying our mails, will be capable of carrying at certain rates of speed large quantities of perishable cargoof various kinds, it is necessary to depart to some extent from the principle of leaving the contractors to make all their arrangements themselves. They must make all their business arrangements. They must have the most absolute liberty to deal in the ordinary business way with their customers, whether they be States Governments or individual merchants, but the Federal Government might well 'impose a restriction upon any State in the Federation acquiring any financial control over the contract. have the effect of preventing an extension of the service in the way achieved by the arrangements at present existing between Queensland and the Orient Steam Navigation Company. Mr W. H . IRVINE I think that what I suggest need not prevent any State from subsidizing the company, after the mail service has been established, for a special or additional service. WhatI object to is, that in doing that any State And there was another reshould, either by way of mortgage, or in any other way known to the law, obtain an effective control over the conduct of the service. Another subject upon which I desire to say a very few words is that as to of the Federal Capita], which has already been so much debated. On this question I feel myself at a considerable loss, since I have but an imperfect knowledge of the facts, and did not hear the discussion of the matter in this House on previous occasions. But I do say that if , as the leader of the Opposition urged to-night, the fact is that, looking at the contract as a matter of good faith and not merely of literal or legal language, the real essence of the bond between the Premiers, on which New South Wales was induced to enter the Federation is to be found in some other terms or some modification of the terms embodied in the Constitution, no matter what the inconvenience may be, I for one feel bound to adhere to that condition. That is, I would carry out the contract not merely in the letter as expressed in the Constitution, but also in the essence, if the essence requires some modification, or someaddition to these terms. I think the suggestion put forward by my honourable friend' the honourable member for FawknerI understand it was very frequently made in this House before by other honourable members-that this Parliament should take up its position in Sydney for ten years after the expiration of the first ten vears of the Federation, leaving the matter open for settlement at the end of that period, offersa means by which we might get over a great many difficulties. I also agree, however, with the honourable member, that all we have to look to is the actual bargain, and that if any arrangement of the kind suggested is to come, it can only, if it be any modification of the bargain,'be effected at",46,William Lyne I Said A Lot In Where My Dear Fellow Have You Got Your Ideas

249,Mr Austin Chapman,"That mightthe instance and by the desire of the honourable members who represent New South Wales, which was brought into the Federation by that agreement. I desire to add my tribute to what has already been said about the very great services, in one sense, which were rendered to the Commonwealth by the Prime Minister and his colleague, the Minister of Trade and Customs, when in England. I join with those who sincerely and earnestly deplore the unfortunate illness which has befallen the Prime Minister. it becomes our absolute duty to speak about the matters with which the Prime Minister was dealing in London just as if he was present, and it is quite in accord with his chivalrous character that he should have requested the House to do so. suppose that any of us can think that very much actual solid benefit was achieved by that embassy. one respect, namely, in regard to the question of preferential trade-and here I may say that I am heartily in support of what I understand as preferential tradethe cause of preferential trade, to my mind, was not advanced one step. It was rather, possibly, to some extent thrown back by the result of the Conference, but it would be most ungenerous in us not to admit that the magnificent power of speech which the Prime Minister possesses has made an impression upon our fellow citizens in Great Britain, has brought us somewhat nearer to them, and has, to some extent, opened their eyes to the fact that there is a growing, an active, and an ambitious dependency of Great Britain in these southern seas. That, to my mind, is a very important step gained. of the Opposition spoke slightingly of the expression. "" Dominion"" being adopted instead of the word "" Colony"" to describe the self-governing dependencies of the Empire. at any time in a mere change of name, but this particular change of name is an indication of a coming, if not an actual, change in the attitude of the people and the Government of England towards us. has been what is to my mind a rather unfortunate tradition in existence with regard to the Colonies ever since the war of American Independence. American Colonies then through bullying them, and the tradition ever since then has been ""Whatever you do you must not bully the Colonies."" In fact, statesmen have gone so far as to say, "" If it is disagree[ 8 ] -2 able, you must be very careful how you tell even the truth to the Colonies."" That is where the trouble comes in. Mr W. H . IRVINE -There is a good deal of trouble in it.

Mr W. H . IRVINE I shall not quarrel about words. I think it is only In after all a nominal recognition, and if we are ever to have a real recognition, of our position as a Dominion, as something distinct from a Colony, it can only come by our showing that we are prepared to undertake our share of the burdens and the responsibilities, as well as to claim our share of the rights, of the Empire. So long as the whole burden of maintaining the defence of this, great Empire rests upon that congested and much poorer population in the British Isles, to which the right honourable the leader of the Opposition referred to-night, so long will the people of Great Britain, as well as their rulers, continue to regard us as being in a state of political tutelage and political dependence. I am not going into the figures to-night, because I do not intend to weary honourable members The right honourable the leader if I can possibly help it on this the first occasion on which I have had the honour to address this House., but figures have often been put before honourable members to show the absolute inequality between our I do not think there is very much poorer fellow-citizens in Great Britain and ourselves in our share of the burden of common defence. I do not, for my own part, think that those figures are absolutely proportionately accurate.

254,Mr Kingo ' Malley,"The y had onlytime. and world-wide Empires before now, there never has been an Emipire composed of absolutely self-governing, free, and independent communities in different parts of the world. That is precisely what creates in connection with the defence of the Empire one of the most difficult problems with which any nation or Parliament can be confronted. I am quite in accord with those who believe that if we with our 4,000,000 people, or even with double the population, were to attempt to defend by military force this enormous continent and immense coast line, or even to defend ourselves with what has been called a mosquito fleet, or a fleet of small cruisers which would keep round our own coastwe should find that such protection would by; no protection at all, as it never could be. It is quite true that with our 4,000,000 people, if we were ail in arms, if we were all trained to war, if we had very heavy taxation, and had as large a navy as we could create or buy, manned by properlyequipped and well-drilled seamen, we might, probably would, be able to defend the main lines of our commerce issuing from the principal ports. probably be able to defend those parts of Australia which are most thickly populated. But I hold that if we had every male person from sixteen to sixty years of age in arms we could not possibly hope to maintain for ourselves the control and sovereignty of this enormous country. nation in the world if it came here. Mr W. H . IRVINE prepared if the necessity should arise to into the cannon's mouth if he likes, but facts. A country three-fourths the size of Europe, garrisoned by a population not larger than that of the County of Lancashire, never has been, and never will be able to maintain control in the presence of a hostile nation. Our sole and only substantial defence-and the sooner we come to recognise the plain, obvious facts the better -is not merely the maintenance, but the continued predominance of the naval power of the Empire to which we belong. Our forefathers, of whom we are proud, have won for us that sea power which means not merely the possession of a few more ships than are possessed by other countries, but means also that the number of people skilled to take part in these things, the courage, But though there have been great the discipline, the naval spirit of the whole nation, have to be maintained. Now what is the position? We find, sir, that the whole of that great burden is practically borne, as has often been said before, by the citizens of Great Britain and Ireland-41,000,00 0 people. I leave entirely out of sight all those unemancipated peoples who are British subjects and with whom we practically have little or nothing in common so far as political institutions are concerned. Taking the real citizens of the free, self-governing communities, you have some T2,000,000 people who, as yet, have not taken upon their shoulders any share of the burden of that great responsibility. I do not count what we have done here as anything. Canada has done nothing. That cannot continue. The people who already bear that great burden cannot always permit us to remain absolutely free from bearing our share of it. We, in our own self-respect, do not desire to remain free from the responsibility which has always attached to every country of freemen from the beginning of the world, namely, the responsibility of defending themselves. I venture lo think that when this question comes to be We should threshed out, some way may be discovered whereby we may be able to maintain-wha t you may call an Australian Navy, if you likea certain number of Imperial ships which shall be manned by our own men, officered by men who have been trained here, and who shall be under our control except in so far as it may be necessary to We could lick any have a general control in time of action, and yet which, in both war and peace, I shall be quite will co-operate at all points with all other sections of the Imperial Navy. follow the honourable gentleman Some such scheme as I have outlined may possibly be arrived at; but I shall not now still we can only look at the enter into the discussion of so complicated and technical a matter. In any case I shall refrain from doing so until I have heard the opinions of honourable members who t have already debated the subject at considerable length. ;->But whatever method be adopted, our expenditure during the next ten or fifteen years must increase to an amount which it would be imprudent, perhaps, to name, but which will be considerably over £.1,000,000 a yeara fact to which it would be absurd to shut our eyes. The question of how we should share the burden of defence is one upon which opinions may vary; but the fact that we must be prepared to gradually but steadily take it upon our shoulders should not be longer overlooked. We are sometimes told",49,William Lyne I Said A Lot In Where My Dear Fellow Have You Got Your Ideas
255,Mr Kingo ' Malley,"that Canada is doing nothing. The Dominion is in a very peculiar position. If we were at liberty to speak as freely here about the position of Canada compared with that of Australia as we might in talking to our friends, the conclusion would be arrived at that we should not hang back waiting for what Canada may do. We must thresh the matter out-ascertain what our duty is, and then manfully take up our burden. That is the only way in which to acquire recognition of our position as a self-governing and free British Dominion. we shoulder our burden, we shall acquire with it rights and interests of a substantial character such as we have not hitherto enjoyed. worse enemies have never spoken of me as a visionary, and, therefore, it will not be termed the dream of a visionary when I say that, in view of the probable increase of our population, I may live to see the time, and I hope that every honourable member will do so too, when Australia will be able to relieve the suffering millions of the British nation of the cost of policing the South-eastern Seas, and the Islands which are in them. There will come with the performance of that duty rights which will be given to us gradually. We shall have more weight in the Councils of the Empire. Agreements with foreign powers relative to islands in the South Pacific will not be made before a substantial opportunity has been given to us to voice our opinions with regard to them. That has been done. Imperial Ministers are charged with tiie whole weight of responsibility for Imperial affairs. have to provide for the defence of the Empire. Therefore, while they have at times consulted Colonial authorities, these consultations have often taken place after the matters to which they related have been arranged, and when the views of the Colonial authorities have not coincided with those of the Home authorities, naturally the hitter have prevailed.« As the great British Dominion in the Southern Seas, separated from the other parts of the Empire by great oceans, and, as the Prime Minister recently pointed out, by lands inhabited by nations differing from us. in colour and in race, we can, I think, look forward to the time when, if we take our share of the burden of the Empire, we shall be able to claim our share of rights of control. burden involves great additional expense. Mr W. Ti. Irvine. Northern Territory from South Australia to the Commonwealth is proposed. That, if made, will involve large expenditure. So, too, will the active policy of immigration which the Government propose. I agree with the leader of the Labour Party, that the Government have not stated, or even indicated, how they propose to finance these great undertakings, and if honourable members will have patience with me for a few minutes I shall say a word or two upon the financial As question. When Federation was entered upon it was provided by the framers of the Constitution that the revenue from Customs and Excise duties should go to My the Commonwealth Government, their object being, in my view, that with that revenue should be taken over, as an equipoise, the burden of the debts which had been contracted by the various States. Finance is one of the most difficult problems with which Governments have to deal, and the only reason why financial operations are conducted in at all a business-like way by representative assemblies is, that Parliaments before voting Sup'ply must provide Ways and Means. If we allow the ten years during which the Braddon section has force to expire, without making the provision contemplated for the management of the debts of the States, the financial relations between the Government of the Commonwealth and the Governments of the States will be very dangerous from the taxpayers' point of view. The Commonwealth Government will have arevenue enormously in excess of its 'needs, They no matter how deeply it may feel inclined to dip its hands into the Treasury. Its Treasurer will be under no obligation to find ways and means for meeting any proposal he may bring before the Commonwealth Parliament; but the Treasurers of the States will have to wait months, and it may be for a whole year, before making up their accounts, and providing Ways and Means fqr their yawning deficits, in order to ascertain how much of the Commonwealth surplus will be returned to them.

263,Mr Fisher,"We want to know whatglad as I should be to see a definite agreement arrived at, if this Parliament either unduly delays the settlement of this vital question or accepts any settlement which does not accord entirely with its own view of what is the best thing to do, it will be abdicating the most important function which the people have intrusted to it. I am pleased to observe in the Governor General's Speech a definite statement that we shall be afforded an opportunity of dealing with this matter during the present session. Let me urge upon the Government the absolute necessity of dealing with it at the earliest possible moment. I have already pointed to the vast additional expenditure which must necessarily fall upon the Commonwealth Government in the approaching year. I have said that I believe that expenditure can, with prudence, be met-grea t though it undoubtedly will be -ou t of the surplus Customs and Excise duties, without resort to the imposition of direct taxation. We cannot take over the States debts at once. But just let us look for sibility that we may meet the rapidly in a moment at the figures. At the present time we have a large surplus. With the exception of Western Australia, all the States are possessed of surpluses in their State accounts. The two largest States of the Union have very large surpluses indeed. the States aggregate £3,000,000. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Of course, adjustments may have to be made, so that the weakest States may have their finances arranged in a way that will not bear too hardly upon them during the transition stage. But our revenue is increasing, and we have every reason to hope and believe that it will continue to increase. Upon the other hand, if we take over the States debts-thos e debts which the Constitution requires us to take over-and convert them, we may reasonably hope-and you, sir, expressed a similar hope in the Convention -that ultimately we shall be able to save something like \ per cent, upon our indebtedness. Possibly we may not be able to save so much at first, but ultimately we may be able to save that amount. It needs but a very simple arithmetical calculation to show that if we can effect a saving of \ per cent, upon £200,000,000, it will be equivalent to £1,000,000 per annum, while a saving of £ per cent, upon that sum would represent £500,000 per annum. Next to the settlement of the TariffI quite recognise that until that unfortunate question has been got out of the arena of politics we cannot do anything Mr W. H . IRVINE -It is highly unfortunate that we should again be called upon to settle what was supposed to have been settled some time ago. Mr W. H . IRVINE I mean settled temporarily in order that we may be afforded breathing space in which to deal with some of those great duties which the people of Australia have intrusted to us. It would be very foolish for a man, when dealing with conjectural matters of this sort, to go into figures; but having regard to the increase which we may reasonably expect in the Customs and Excise revenue, and the savings which, if we take over the debts that we are entitled under the Constitution to take over, we may reasonably expect-and gradually, within the next ten, twenty, or thirty years, large savings will be effected -it is not at all beyond the region of poscreasing expenditure of the Commonwealth without imposing direct taxation upon the people. In such circumstances we may be able to leave the imposition of direct taxation to the States Parliaments. country ? Mr W. H. IRVINE I would remind the honourable member that the more we populate the country, the greater our Customs and Excise revenue will be. direct taxation, provide something for the people to do, or give them land upon which to live? Mr W. H . IRVINE I am not desirous at this juncture of entering upon a consideration of the various schemes of assisting immigration. There may be differences and agreements between us, but it must be admitted that the more the population of the Commonwealth increases the larger will be our revenue and the easier it will be to meet our increasing burdens, notwithstanding that those burdens may to some extent grow with the community. WhatI desire to press upon honourable members, however, is the absolute urgency, if we are really going to do what the people of Australia, under the Constitution, have declared to be one of our first duties, of taking over the debts of the States.

And so I ask honourable members what good purpose can be served by telling the workers of Australia that during the last few years a great wave of prosperity has passed over the land, and that all the States have had magnificent surpluses, unless we can at the same time show that the workers have participated in those surmembers have administered to our reprepluses? The fact that our shops may be filled with choice meats and enticing confections is nothing to the worker and his family if he has not the wherewithal to purchase them.

Honourable members istry to give the country not merely a revenue producing Tariff, but one con: ferring industrial protection upon the people, will be carried into effect. During the debate I have heard several references to the manufacture of starch. I am rather sorry that the representative of in His Excellency's Speech. starch is not at present in the House. It has been hurled at protectionists time after time that many of the protected industries pay very small wages, and that, therefore, protection is useless to the workers. agree with that statement, and I may inform protectionists in the House -especially in view of the conditions existing in the starch trade, that unless a living wage is given to those employed in that or any other protected industry, I shall vote free-trade every time. It is useleader of the Labour Party pointed out to less for anybody to tell me that an industry, I care not what industry, will not pay a Jiving wage. worthy of protection, it should properly remunerate the workers engaged in it; and unless a living wage is paid I shall take the risk of losing my seat by voting free trade whenever an opportunity occurs. We have heard hard words used in reference to the two Ministers who represented Australia at the Imperial Conference. Those Ministers, perhaps meaning well, went Home with the idea of bringing about certain relations between Australia and the old country. tions in this respect were not reciprocated ; and I suppose they are now satisfied that if the people of England do not desire preferential trade, it is not our place to foist it on them. As a protectionist. I object to the further importation of manufactured articles which Mr Mathews. has the result of keeping our artisans out of work, and that being so, it is only human that I should not wish to see our food products exported in large quantities to the old world, if the effect there would be to cause the British working man to pay higher prices for his eatables. I think the British people are themselves the best judges as to whether preferential trade would or would not be beneficial to them. While I listened to the castigation which certain honourable sentatives at the Imperial Conference, in consequence of their political utterances while in England, it struck me as peculiar that the only bond between themselves and the political party with which their names seem to lose sight of the fact that those politicians, who were in harmony with our representatives on the question of preferential trade, were really the Tories of the old world. I am very sorry to see the question of old-age pensions so lightly touched on been touched on in every Governor General's Speech. I now look to the Government for a consummation of our desires in some 'comprehensive system of old-age pensions applying to the whole of Australia. Of course, it is essential that the wherewithal should be obtained for the purpose, and. in this connection, I could not help smiling when the the Government that the revenue would -hardly be. sufficient to cover the expense of If an industry is taking over the Northern Territory and carrying out the railway and other large schemes which have been mentioned. If the revenue is not sufficient to enable us to carry out our enlarged Federal functions, what chance can there be of earmarking a portion in order to carry out the essential reform of a Federal scheme of old-age pensionsa scheme under which pensions will not be doled out as they are in one State, as a sort of charity, and in another State in a not much more satisfactory Their good intenmanner, while in four States there are no old-age pensions at all ? Old-age pensions should not be left at the will of any future Government, in view of what occurred in Victoria, when a Government, which had no sympathy with the policy, deprived a portion of the aged poor of that assistance to which they",54,William Lyne I Said A Lot In Where My Dear Fellow Have You Got Your Ideas
273,Mr Mcdonald,That question has,55,William Lyne I Said A Lot In Where My Dear Fellow Have You Got Your Ideas
274,Mr Mathews,"That is so; and wewere entitled. I hope that Commonwealth old-age pensions when established will be made a charge on the revenue for ever, so that the pensioners may not be exposed to such a risk as that to which I have alluded. We have been told that defence is a question which we must consider. do not know whether the fact that the Military Barracks are in my constituency makes me a military man, but, in common with others, I am of opinion that we ought to regard the matter of defence much more seriously in the future than in the past. that the Australian will not take his part in the defence of the Empire. But my belief is that the Australian, if he be given something to fight for, will fight just as strenuously as the citizen of any other nation. Australia to have a compulsory form of service. It is very apparent to me that if the Governments of the past had given any inducement to the youths of Australia to join the Defence Forces they would have been joining in larger numbers to-day. In Victoria for some .years past there has been a system of training cadets in schools. The Government paid the cost of the training, and the parents found the uniforms; but after leaving school, in order to earn their own living, all the training was lost because of an' absence of any method by which a youth might become a senior cadet, and then find his way into an adult force of some real value in the defence of the Empire. toria, instead of inducing youths to join, there seems to have been more of an endeavour to deter them as much as possible, each cadet being called upon to pay for his own uniform. induce the young men of Australia to take part in the defence of the country. As to naval defence, we have been told during the course of the debate that it would be impossible for us, a handful of people, to create a fleet or a land force sufficient to defend Australia from any enemy who desired to land here. ton said it would be impossible for an enemv to land here. ton learn his soldiering in Australia, and I know that many are of opinion that the Australian soldier is unfit to take his stand the world. Major-General Hutton came here with a great flourish of trumpets, and he assured us that we were so far from the base of supplies of any foreign country, that it would be impossible for an enemy to effectively occupy Australia for any considerable time. WeI know that a handful of (people, no more numerous than is the population of Tasmania, held the whole of the British Forces at a disadvantage for a long while, and it took the whole of the mercantile marine of Great Britain to supply soldiers, forage, food and war material during the Boer We are told in many quarters war. Yet, in spite of what Major-General Hutton said, we are told that some nation could so attack us that we could in no conceivable way defend ourselves. I believe, in common with manv others, that it is quite possible for the defence of AusI t will never be necessary in tralia to be effectively maintained by the Fleet which is at. present in Australian waters being employed in the Indian Ocean or the Atlantic Ocean. As a general matter of warfare, it matters little if one portion of the Empire suffers considerably as long as the outcome of the war is that we are successful. . We know that there is little lamentation on account of loss of lif e in any battle so long as the result is satisfactory. But while we in Australia are not more selfish than are the people of any other portion of the Empire, still, we do not wish to be put into such a position that we shall suffer considerably by having our ports bombarded and out cities perhaps held up to ransom. Therefore we should As to the senior cadets in Vicbe prepared for the defence of our shores by having a mosquito fleet of our own. I agree that it would be impossible for us at present to bring into operation a large Australian fleet. Our purse would not be long That is not the way to enough for that. But by starting on small lines and building by instalments, we might have a fleet quite sufficient for Australia's present needs. I suppose we shall be told by those who do not believe in encouraging Australian manufactures that it is quite an Utopian idea to think that we shall be able to build our own submarines and torpedo boats. But for my own part, I believe that in time we shall have dock-yards sufficient to build for ourselves cruisers large enough to meet Australia's requirements. In my opinion, it is useless to think of solving our is a gentleman who did not defence problem unless we determine that the whole of the munitions of war and armaments for our ships, as well as for our land Forces, shall be produced in Ausamongst the soldiers of tralia.

The question of the Eederal Capital has been mentioned. It was a surprise to me, as a new member of this Parliament, that the question should be raised again. I am aware that it suits the purposes of certain Sydney politicians to raise it , but it is not a matter with which New South Wales as a whole is much concerned, because that State cannot be injured in any way by the Capital being situated in one portion of New South Wales ii agree that the prestige of Sydney may be affected, or perhaps there may be commercial advantages 'from having the Capital situated in a place that may suit the Sydney people. But certain members of the State Parliament in Sydney think they can derive political advantage by raising Capital. liament, I have unfortunately taken part in a few political fights, and know perfectly well the force of a cry that appeals to the people of a particular electorate during a campaign, even though it may not be of much interest to the .State at large. I am of opinion that the people of New South Wales as a whole are not so much concerned about the Federal Capital as many Sydney representatives would have us believe. It is not my intention to occupy the time of the House any longer. be desirable that, as a new member, I should make an attempt to get my "" sealegs,"" so to speak, so that I might address the House more comfortably on any future occasion when I may have to discuss any question. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [ 9 ] was not my intention to address the House on this motion, and I should not have done so except that I desire to put matters right in regard to a couple of questions, one of which affects me personally, whilst the other affects the State from which I come. Before touching upon those questions, however, I should like to add my tribute of congratulation to the Prime Minister upon the remarkable effect which his orations have had in the old country. As was remarked by the honourable member for Flinders, the position he attained there by his oratory must have forwardedthe great scheme of pieferential trade which he has :,o much at heart. 01 able gentleman was, being called upon to undergo such strenuous labour by the demands of his official duties at the Conference, and at the same time having to attend to the obligations imposed upon him in connection with social affairs, it was marvellous to me that he was able to get through so much work as he did. I think it must be admitted, also, that he created for us a very excellent feeling among the British people. I desire to express my extreme regret-and I am sure that it is shared by every member of the Housethat the honourable gentleman should not be able to be present, and that the debate preference to another. I quite should therefore have been shorn of one of its principal points of interest; because I feel confident that honourable members in all parts of the House were extremely desirous of hearing what the Prime Minister, had to say in regard to what he did in the old country. The first point' to which I wish to refer is in relation to an interjection a cry about the Federal which I made while the honourable member AlthoughI am new to this Parfor Kalgoorlie was speaking. He expressed himself as being of opinion that the immigrants now being brought into Australia for the purpose of relieving the stress in the sugar industry were in future likely to come into competition with workers in other branches of industry when their agreements in that connection had expired, or possibly during the off-season, when their services are not required in the sugar industry. I interjected that that could not be said of Kanakas. The honourable member apI felt it to peared to be of the opinion that because I interjected to that effect I therefore desired, in common with other honourable members who have been returned to this Parliament, and sit on this side of the House, to induce the Federal Parliament, if possible, to retrace its policy in regard It to the exclusion of Kanakas. That was not my idea at all. No matter what their views may have been in regard to the particular legislation to which I have alluded, Queenslanders as a whole have loyally accepted the decision that the Kanakas have to go, and those of them who are interested in the sugar industry, in which the Kanakas were employed, are doing their very best to overcome the undoubted difficulties with which they are faced, as a result of their deportation. will admit that I accepted his assurance, and that of the honourable member for Placed as the honOxley on that point.",56,William Lyne I Said A Lot In Where My Dear Fellow Have You Got Your Ideas

280,Mr Frazer,"No.a State to contract for special services such as those which have been rendered to Queensland by the Orient Steam Navigation Company. But, as was explained by the honourable member, that was not at all the idea which we had in mind. While on this subject, I shouldlike to appeal to the sense of fairness and justice of honourable members, and ask whether it does not seem that the position in which Queensland has found herself under the present contract is an unenviable one, and one which this Parliament should remedy as soon as possible in any new contract which is made. In order to induce the Orient Steam Navigation Company to send their steamers to Pinkenba wharf, on the Brisbane River, just below Brisbane, Queensland has had to pay the company a sum of £26,000 a year, less £5,000 found by the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Flinders pointed out most justly that it is in part only a contract for the carriage of mails, and is in part-and I think I shall be able to show the greater parta contract for the supply of cold storage for the carriage of a particular kind of produce. thing in the conditions regarding that. Colonel FOXTON -No, but I am going to refer to a speech made in the last session of the last Parliament by the Prime Minister. £125,000 which was to have been paid to Messrs. Laing and Sons under the contract which has just been annulled, that of that amount £""45,000 might be regarded as the subsidy for the carriage of mails, and that the odd £80,000 might be regarded as for a mercantile service. If I remember rightly, the honourable gentleman added:-""In the same way as France and Germany give subsidies to their mercantile the boats. marine."" that the £80,000 would be 2 per cent, on rind his interest end there.

Colonel FOXTON I understand that it is not so essential to Tasmania that the steamers should call there, at least not all the year round. As a matter of fact, I understand that Tasmania is excellently served by certain of the mail steamers or subsidiary steamers which call there in the apple season, and that the service is perfectly satisfactory. manians have to pav for. Colonel FOXTON -Al l they have to pay for is freight, whereas not only have the Queenslanders to pay for freight, but their State has to pay £21,000 a year in addition. That is what I complain of, and if the service is to be a mercantile service to the extent, as is admitted, of two-thirds of its value, as distinguished from a mail service, then each State, according to its needs, should have some recognition in regard to the ports at which the steamers should be compelled to call.

Colonel FOXTON I am glad to testify here that I am satisfied in my ownmind that the Postmaster-General is distinctly sympathetic towards us. He told us so, and I believe he meant what he said.

288,Mr Reid,"The Government's trouble istory. I notice that, instead of this matter being put first in the paragraph which deals with it, the fact is first mentioned that the Members of Parliament who went to the Territory must have enjoyed themselves very much, and that, no doubt, the information they gained would be of great value when Parliament considered the proposed transfer. The paragraph in the Governor General's Speech is as follows:As my visit to the Northern Territory was of the deepest interest to me, I feel confident that the deficit of £82,000 a year on the Port the tour of inspection made by Members of the Parliament must prove of great value in your deliberations upon its proposed transfer. I have no doubt it will. great value myself. I was contemplating going there, knowing what was depending, and I was exceedingly glad to make the trip. I learnt a great deal; but on going into them. I found the figures somewhat startling. I discovered that the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta railway, which it isproposed by the agreement that the Commonwealth should take over and pay for at first cost, cost £2,318,242. cannot gather it from the reports of the South Australian Railways Commissioner, which seem to be constructed in such a way that it shall not be possible for any one to find out the deficit on any particular lineand in that respect they differ from those of some of the other StatesI have it from writers from the South Australian point of view that the annual deficit on the working of the line is £82,000. We start with that. the debt of the Northern Territory to be taken over. That is still more startling, for I find that with a population, so far as I can gather from statistics, of about 3,300 persons throughout the whole Territory, about two-thirds of whom are Asiatics, leaving about 1,100 Europeans-men , women, and children-the debt due by the Northern Territory is not less than £3,217,500. have them from the official records, but in the correspondence which preceded the provisional agreement, I saw it stated by Mr datta to Pine Creek. The distance by the Price, the Premier of South Australia, that the debt was not less than £3,400,000. I do not know how he makes that out. At all events that community occupies the uniaue position of having a public debt of over £r,ooo per head, which is unprecedented, I should imagine, in the history of the world, more especially when we consider that two-thirds of the population are Asiatics. is all right; there is nothing extraordinary about it. The land is worth so much. Put it at an absolutely nominal sum, and it is sufficient to cover the debt."" I have always understood that the security of a public creditor was not the desert, unoccupied land, but the capacity of the population upon that land to pay the interest uoon the debt. I find that there is a deficit of not less than £140,000 a year in the finances of the Territory, so that, adding Augusta to Oodnadatta railway, we get a deficit of something like £225,000 a year for the Commonwealth! to take over on I found it of the transfer of the Territory. A great deal has been said about defence in connection with the alleged necessity for taking over the Territory. I , for one, think that is a bogy. I venture to say that if an enemy were to land at Port Darwin he might be able to do some damage at Port Darwin, and to the railway and the railway works there, but it would be an absolute trap for him so long as there were any BriAlthoughI tish vessels afloat which could intercept his supplies from his base of operations. The same thing can be said of a number of harbors on the northern and north-western coasts of Australia, where an enemy might land with equal facility. Why not defend all those places? Why spend all this money for the purpose of defending an isolated spot on the northern coast, where there happens to be congregated together a mere handful of people, because 3,300 perThen there is sons constitute the population of the whole Territory, with an area of 531,400 square miles, being about four-fifths of the area of Queensland. Why not, for instance, take steps to defend Cape York Peninsula in Queensland? An enemy could land there just as easily as, possibly more easily than, at the other place. I think that the proposal to take over the Northern Territory for the purpose of defending it is not Those are the figures as I sound. In addition to that we have the Commonwealth bound down under the agree"" ment to construct a railway from Oodnatelegraph line is about 1,100 miles. Possibly the railway would have to be deviated, because the telegraph line goes over ranges where tbe railway could not be taken. The greater portion of the line would run through what is practically a desert. I notice that although provision is made by which the railway can be taken north from Hergott Springs through Queensland, by. We are told, however, "" That way of Birds vii le, and then away to the Northern Territory, that would involve a considerable detour, and increase the length of line, thus increasing the cost of construction to, say, £ 5 , 0 0 0 a mile, which I fancyis a fair estimate, and making a total cost °f £S)5 > 0 0 0 0 0 The Commonwealth, therefore, would have to ""face an expenditure of no less than £11,000,000, if it f u l filled its obligations. way they would have to go over 100 miles of flooded country. Colonel When the Treasurer was in Queensland the other day, he was interviewed on this subject. He said that the possibility of connecting Pine Creek with the Queensland system had not been brought under his notice by the Queensland members. He also stated that he was in favour of the direct line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, but advocated the construction of a line from Hergott Springs to Birdsville and Clona l rry, when the matter of facilities afforded by Queensland for rapid communication had been suggested to him. made the first part of that statement. I said it was not in the proposal. Colonel FOXTON the interview here. joining on to the Queensland system.

The press put that in themselves. Colonel FOXTON I am not complaining of the right honourable member, but leading up to an argument which I intend to use. Hergott Springs to Cloncurry would link up the Queensland system. If they went by that Colonel FOXTON -That is right. He did not consider such a line would be national in character, lo the same extent as the proposed line through the Northern Territory wealth line or under the control of the Commonwealth. He believed that if a line were constructed from Pine Creek, thence along the shores of the Gulf, connecting with Cloncurry and southwards vid Cooper's Creek and Hergott Springs, it would open up valuable mineral country and grazing lands. It could be connected with all the existing trunk lines of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, and would constitute a great national central line. It would cost a few millions, certainly, but Sir John Forrest indicated that he did not consider the amount anything to be alarmed at. He thought it would pay; railways always paid. That is not our experience. Queensland what it is. I have a report of Colonel FOXTON -Yes j but the lines do not all pay. He had carried out a good deal of railway construction in Western Australia, and it had always paid. He was opposed to the proposal I know that I am to build a line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek. That is the point I wished to make, and I s it part of the transfer the right honourable member proposed then to connect with Cloncurry. Colonel FOXTON -That seems to me If that is so, good-bye to the to give the whole show away. If he and his colleagues are in favour of that line there is no need for them to go to Cloncurry. They would only have to bring their railway to Camooweal. Queensland does not ask the Commonwealth to construct a railway into its territory. It would be necessary to build 120 miles of railway to get to Cloncurry. mean Cloncurry.

Colonel FOXTON -Frankly I do not see any connection between the two, and therefore I wonder why reference was made to Western Australia.

If , as the honourable member for Coolgardie says, it is no uncommon thing in this Chamber for a Government to be attacked by its supporters, we shall obtain a good deal of diversion as well as instruction from the speeches of members of the Labour Party, whether they are in the nature of frank criticism such as that of the leader of the party, or are attacks like those of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, who gave us such a practical illustration of his preference for casting out one devil in place of seven. Sir WILLIAM LYNE the honourable member belong? Colonel FOXTON me to belong to the party which is opposed to Socialism. There is one other matter to which I wish to refer, the question of the Naval Subsidy. Every one must admit that if it were not for the protection afforded us as an integral portion of the Empire by the British Fleet, we should beat the mercy of at least half-a-dozen nations. We cannot hope to be able to defend ourselves for many years to come, possibly not for generations. tic view. Colonel FOXTON The honourable member for Darwin has stated that we could hold our own against the world, and, no doubt, we could make a good deal of trouble for any nation attempting the invasion of Australia. We might spin out the struggle for years; but at what cost to ourselves? would never effect a landing in Australia. Colonel FOXTON Undoubtedly it could effect a landing if we had not the British Fleet behind us. a landing even if we possessed an Australian Fleet such as is now proposed. But just as the Boers were able to give the British a lot of trouble-and other precedents can be found in history-w e could put any invading nation to an enormous expenditure, both in blood and treasure. But what would be the cost to Australia? We should have practically to f a l l back upon guerilla warfare and the best of our manhood would be wiped out in the struggle. Colonel FOXTON I am certain that that is the opinion which is shared by a large portion of the thinking section of the community. ton declared that no General would come to Australia with a view to conquer it with a smaller force than 300,000 men, and the idea that that number could be transported here is unthinkable. Colonel FOXTON -The Imperial Defence Committee think otherwise. They are of opinion that Australia is liable to be raided. For us to desire to establish a fleet of our own is a very proper aspiration. Notwithstanding the contrary opinion To what party does which has been expressed by the Imperial Defence Committee, I believe that the existence of an Australian Fleet, and the It is sufficient for knowledge .that we could very seriously hamper an enemy in an attempt at raiding or invading our shores, would confer upon what is now known as the "" Australian Squadron"" freedom to operate in other parts of the world. We should thus be able to assist in our own defence. The honourable member for South Sydney has declared that the annual subsidy of £""200,000 which we now pay under the Naval Agreement is a mean contribution. I hold that we should be acting in a still meaner fashion if we discontinued it. He declares that our proper contribution to the I do not think so. maintenance of the Imperial Navy is £""5,000,000 per annum. He altogether forgets that if we were contributing that sum towards the maintenance of the British Fleet we should be entitled with the mother country to a f u l l voice in the decision of Imperial questions. In his speech at the opening of the Imperial Conference the other day Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman O ' MALLEY A foreign foe is reported in the Times to have put the position thusThe cost of naval defence and the responsiI t could effect bility for the conduct of foreign affairs hang together. If we were to contribute £ 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 yearly as our f u l l share of the cost of maintaining the British Fleet we should be entitled to all the powers and privileges which that expenditure would confer upon us. We should have some voice in the making of war and peace which at the present time is exclusively enjoyed by the I m perial Government under the control of the Imperial Parliament.

Colonel FOXTON that it is not so. a good business proposition. Colonel FOXTON sons to whom I refer are not business men. To those of us who do not desire such a severance, who feel that we share in the prestige of the Empire, and who desire to continue to do so, it is a very proper aspiration that we should in time be in a position to claim our share-it may be a limited one -of the powers and privileges which are now exercised by the Imperial Government. that direction. It is going on every day. As we grow in population, wealth, and importance, our relations with the mother land will imperceptibly change. Undoubtedly in the minds of the statesmen and people of the mother country we occupy a totally different position to-day from that which we occupied fifteen or twenty years ago. That change is due to our growth. It is for us to decide-as was pointed out by the right honourable member for East Sydney, we have absolute freedom in this matter-whether the forces which are at work in connection with this movement shall be centrifugal or centripetal. I am glad to be assured that there are none in this House who desire that those forces shall be centrifugal, and that all wish to cement the ties which already bind us to the mother country. Surely it is not too much to. ask that we should give some earnest of our desire at-a future time, to claim those rights and privileges to which I have alluded. The discontinuance of the Naval Subsidy would be a most distinct step in the opposite direction. Possibly, our contribution-as was urged by the honourable member for. South Sydney-is of very small moment to the Imperial Exchequer, although it is something very considerable to us. If it be more than we can afford, by all means let us pay less, but do not let us discontinue the subsidy entirely. Let us increase it if possible, and by so doing we shall show that we appreciate in the highest degree the protection which the British Fleet affords us. The subsidy is not by any means in the nature of tribute. Under the existing agreement, a large number of Australian officers and men enter the fleet, and we are thus [ 9 ] -2 . practically paying for their services, whilst at the same time laying a solid foundation for that greater development which I sincerely trust will come at no very distant I am glad to hear date, perhaps-as the honourable member for Flinders said-withi n the lives of many of us here this evening.

Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) [9.55] I desire to draw the attention of the Postmaster-General to the conditions of the mail contract, which were gazetted last Saturday. Upon reading them this morning, I saw that they contain no provision for, no suggestion whatever of any request as to, cold-storage accommodation in connection with the new mail service. The Victorian has already drawn attention to this omission, and I certainly think there would be a great imperfection in the proposed new mail service if some provision in that respect were not directly made. It is all very well to say that this is a contract for the carriage of mails, but it has never been solely regarded as such.

Thursday last, when I put to the Prime Minister a question relating to the adminiswere allowed to be transferred from their tration of the Immigration Restriction Act, he stated that I had not so clearly indicated the nature of my inquiry as to permit him to reply. I could not, within the limits of a question, clearly put before him the case I wished to make, and I desire, therefore, to avail myself of this opportunity to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs, who, I understand, is acting for the Prime Minister, what the Government intend to do with regard to the Act. It has been held by the Attorney-General, as it was by Sir Edmund Barton, when a member of this House, and also by the right honourable member for Adelaide,' that sub-section k of section 3 of the Immigration Restriction Act does not prevent aliens from being landed and doing work on shore provided that they are mustered before their vessel leaves port. I have before me a copy of the decision of the Attorney-General, who holds that so long as such men are mustered before their ship is granted her clearance papers, they may go anywhere, and do anything they please. I contend that this is not the spirit, although it may be the letter of the law. When that Act was passed it was never intended that the section should be so read. The interpretation placed upon it by the Attorney-Generals readsWhether hedoes or does not work when ashore does not affect the exemption. The question may arise whether the Contract Immigrants Act 1905 passed subsequently to some of the previous decisionsThe decisions by Mr Barton and the right honourable member for Adelaide, to whom I have just referredaffects the question. Under section 8 of the Act the exemption of crews of ships is limited to the crews of vessels engaged in the coasting trade in the Australian waters, where the rates of wages specified in the agreement are not lower than the rates ruling in the CommonI hope it wealth. There is nothing in the papers to show whether the crews in question come within the exemption of the Contract Immigration Act; but in my view it is immaterial whether they do or not, as I am of opinion that crews of oversea ships acting under the orders of the captain in within the meaning of the Act. The question is not confined to the mere loading of ships in port. A case in point occurred a little while ago in Sydney, where there is at present an industrial dispute between the Coal-lumpers' Union and the Coal Stevedores' Association. Aliens ships to lighters-whic h is practically tantamount to their going on shore-and to work winches in loading coal on certain vessels. ThatI contend was contrary to the spirit of the Act, because in so working they were breaking a strike. Under the Contract Immigration Act men are not permitted to be introduced-and this prohibition is not confined to aliensunder a contract to break a strike.

322,Mr Tudor,"O r to work for a loweris considered necessary to provide for a prohibition against men being employed in those circumstances, honourable members must recognise that aliens should not be allowed to land under the Immigration Restriction Act. Another case occurred recently in Queensland. The Kumana Marti -came down the coast, and loaded and discharged her cargo with an alien crew. 1 am informed also that in a Western Australian port a short time ago alien crews were allowed not only to discharge their own cargo, but to unload railway trucks. That is altogether contrary to the spirit of the Act, and if permitted to continue may lead at any time to international complications. Let us suppose for a moment that a Japanese crew were allowed to land at Sydney. That crew might engage, not merely in loading or unloading vessels, but in work of any kind, and very serious trouble might arise. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company has large refining works in Svdney, and also employs a very large number of coolie workmen in Fiji, which is a comparatively short distance from our shores. In the event of an industrial dispute between the company and its employees in Sydney there would be nothing to prevent the former from bringing over from Fiji several hundred coolies to break the strike. The coolies would merely be required to muster not once in twenty-four hours, but when their ship was lea%'ing port. kept in port for six months. keep the vessel anchored in Port Jackson as long as it suited them, and send the men on shore to work in various capacities. 1 would therefore ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether it is the intention of the Government to so amend the Act as to insure that our intentions in passing it will be carried out? ring to the remarks made by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo as to the provision of refrigerating space on-mail steamers, I may say that if it is the Government's intention to stipulate for such space under the new contract for which tenders have been called, I emphatically protest against Brisbane being left out as a port of call. If it is fair for refrigerating space to be provided tor the ports of Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney, or of any other State, then Queensland must share the benefit. It is all very well for the Postmaster-General to say that in no previous contract has refrigerating space been stipulated. As a matter of fact, before the contract which has just fallen through, refrigerating space was made a condition. If refrigerating space is specified for-as I hope it will be, because it means quick transit for the dairy produce of every State-the same treatment should be meted out to Queensland as to any other State of the Commonwealth. Monaro-Postmaster-General) [10.8] -The honourable member for Maranoa is, I think, mistaken in regard to refrigerating space having been stipulated for in all previous contracts. However, the reference to the past is only by the way. Mail matter is not carried in an ice chamber; and it would not be a mail contract if the provision of refrigerating space were made a condition. The three essential conditions of a mail contract are white labour, a deposit, and bonds; but beyond these, tenderers can make any offer they like in regard to speed, space, and so forth-the contract is as wide as the ocean. Naturally, the Government, in making a contract, will give preference to those tenderers who offer the greatest facilities. have the dairy produce carried as it is to have the mails carried. agree with the honourable member, and that principle has been recognised in the acceptance of every tender. It would not pay a tenderer to enter into a contract to carry the mails, unless he also carried produce. The difficulty in making a stipulation of the kind suggested is that the Government could not give preference to Victoria or New South Wales and leave Brisbane or Hobart out of the allotment of. the space. That is why the conditions have been drawn so wide, and every provision has been made to allow the contractors to state what they are prepared to do. As I told honourable members the other night, the desire of the Government is to see that fair play is meted out to every State; and under the conditions of the proposed contract, I think that will be found to be the result. It ought to be remembered that the Government must take the responsibility of making a recommendation after submitting to the House the particulars of the tenders.
