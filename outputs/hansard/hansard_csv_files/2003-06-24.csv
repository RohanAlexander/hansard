(2) Are office bearers of registered political parties in receipt of public funds under the Commonwealth Electoral Act required to be fit and proper persons; if so, are Mr Turnbull’s actions consistent with this requirement. The report of the Royal Commission into the failure of HIH made no adverse finding in relation to Mr Turnbull. Education: Funding (Question No. 1144) Mr Wilkie asked the Minister for Education, Science and Training, upon notice, on 2 December 2002: (1) How many (a) primary, (b) secondary and (c) tertiary students are there in Australia. (2) What proportion of GDP was spent on education in 2001-2002. (3) What are the funding arrangements for secondary students in terms of State and Federal Government funds spent on non-government and government schools. (4) In monetary terms, to what extent does the Federal Government subsidise non-government schools. (1) (a) In 2002, there were 1,931,093 full-time primary school students in Australia (Australian Bureau of Statistics Schools Australia 2002, Catalogue 4221.0). (b) In 2002, there were 1,370,683 full-time secondary school students in Australia (Australian Bureau of Statistics Schools Australia 2002, Catalogue 4221.0). (c) The most recently published data (DEST-“Students 2002 (First half year)-Selected Higher Education Statistics”) shows 747,825 higher education students in Australia. This represents the “number of students enrolled in Submission 1 2002 undertaking units of study in higher education courses during the period 1 September 2001 to 31 March 2002”.

Government schools enrol 68 per cent of total students and receive 76 per cent of the public funding for schools and school students. Non-government schools enrol 32 per cent of total students and receive 24 per cent of the public funding for schools and school students. The majority of Commonwealth funding for schools is provided through the General Recurrent Grants Programme. Primary and secondary students are funded at different rates and different funding arrangements apply to the government and non-government sectors. For government schools, funds are provided as block grants calculated on a per student basis and are paid to State and Territory Governments for distribution to schools. The Commonwealth is not directly involved in the allocation of funds to individual schools. The final per student rates for government schools in 2002 were $504 per primary school student and $747 per secondary school student. For non-government schools funds are provided on a per student basis and calculated by the school or system’s level of funding. The final per capita levels of funding for the 2002 programme year range from $775 to $3,960 per primary student and $1,024 to $5,229 per secondary student. From 2001, the funding levels of non-government schools are based on the socio-economic status (SES) of their school community. The SES approach to school funding involves linking student address data to Australian Bureau of Statistics national Census data to obtain a measure of the capacity of the school community to support its school. The maximum funding under the SES model, payable to schools serving the neediest communities, has been significantly increased from about 59 per cent to 70 per cent of the average cost of educating a student in a government school. Schools serving the wealthiest communities receive 13.7 per cent of this cost. (4) The Commonwealth provides $4.1 billion annually for the one million students in non-government schools.

Immigration: Detention Centres (Question No. 1707) Mr Andren asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 20 March 2003: (1) How many detained asylum seekers have died in Australia (including Christmas Island) in a detention centre or in a hospital or other place to which they might have been taken while under detention in each year since the introduction of mandatory detention in 1989; of those deaths in each year, how many were: (a) women, and (b) children. (2) How many died: (a) prior to a first determination being made about their claim, and (b) prior to a final determination. (3) In respect of each detainee who died: (a) in which detention centre were they detained, (b) how long had they been detained, (c) what was the cause of death, and (d) how was the cause of death established. (1) To date there have been eight deaths of persons in immigration detention. Of these six were people detained following their location in the community and two were unauthorised arrivals. Of the unauthorised arrivals (a) one was a woman and (b) none were children. The break up of deaths by year is as follows: 1998-one male; 2000-one male; 2001-three males, one female; 2002-one female; and 2003-one female. None of the deaths were children. (2) Of the two deaths in detention of people who had arrived without authority and had sought asylum (a) neither died prior to first determination about their claim and (b) neither died prior to final determination. (3) In respect of each detainee who has died in detention: (a) Four were detained at Villawood IDC (of which two were transferred to Liverpool hospital where they died), one was detained and died at Maribyrnong IDC, one was detained in Port Phillip prison but was transferred to hospital where he died, one was detained at Port Hedland IRPC and transferred to hospital in Perth where he died and one was detained at Christmas Island IRPC but transferred to hospital in Perth where she died. (b) The eight detainees who died were in detention for the following period: 16 hours, 3 days, 12 days, 114 days, 124 days, 254 days, 1 ¼ years and one person, from the date of first detention to the date of the death, 193 days passed but for 101 of those days the detainee had escaped. (c) The cause of death in 6 of the cases was: (i) Liver failure and bleeding, gastro oesophageal varices, due to cirrhosis of the liver. (ii) Chest infection related to persistent sinus.",114,Questions On Notice

(vi) Head injury caused by a fall (d) The cause of death was investigated by the coroner in six cases, and is currently being investigated or to be investigated in two cases. Multiculturalism (Question No. 1720) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 24 March 2003: (1) Is he aware of research released by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission on 24 February 2003 on the phenomenon of cyber-racism; if so, does the research show that the Internet is being used to promote: (a) notions of racial superiority and violence, (b) racist groups, (c) extremist literature, (d) race hate music, and (e) racist games, via email, websites, chat rooms, newsgroups and web order catalogues. (2) Do the aims of the Living in Harmony initiative include an effective focus upon combating racism and encouraging respect, goodwill and understanding between Australians of all ethnic, cultural and religious backgrounds and does the prevalence of cyber-racism run counter to these aims; if so, what actions, if any, has he taken to initiate suitable educational measures to alert the Internet industry and users of the Internet to the need to combat the phenomenon. (1) I am aware of the research undertaken by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and agree that the research highlights the use of the Internet for a range of race-hate related activities. (2) Yes, the aims of the Living in Harmony initiative do include an effective focus on combating racism and encouraging respect, goodwill and understanding between Australians of all ethnic, cultural and religious backgrounds. The Living in Harmony initiative aims to do this through the three complementary elements of a community grants program, a partnerships program and the public information strategy led by Harmony Day each year. The Internet provides another forum through which racist propaganda can be promulgated. No specific actions have been taken to date through the activities of the Living in Harmony initiative to initiate educational measures to alert the Internet industry and users of the Internet to the need to combat cyber-racism. The presence of cyber-racism is a global issue and HREOC and other agencies are currently exploring possible options for regulatory control of racist material on the Internet generated from within Australia. I note that non-regulatory options to combat cyber-racism discussed at the related symposium hosted by HREOC included: the further supply and use of appropriate electronic filters by Internet Service Providers; the possibility of a content rating scheme for websites, and the need for a stronger presence of organisations and individuals on the Internet as anti-racist advocates and educators. While the Australian Broadcasting Authority may have a future role in addressing the first two options, the Living in Harmony initiative certainly has a role to play in relation to the third. The ini-",128,Questions On Notice
270,Mr Hardgrave,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:tiative has a strategy of encouraging the development of positive values and processes that promote community harmony and address racism at the local level. A large number of past and current Living in Harmony community grants and partnerships have used the Internet as a vehicle for promoting the positive outcomes of their projects and the broader messages of the initiative. The presence of the Living in Harmony initiative therefore continues to grow on the Internet and more broadly within the community, thus encouraging attitudinal change in a non-regulatory way. Since the commencement of the initiative in 1998, 179 community grants and 34 partnerships have been funded; all of which have addressed issues of racism and promoted community harmony in a variety of ways. On 21 March 2003 we enjoyed the most successful Harmony Day yet in terms of the level of community participation. The strengthening presence and recognition of the Living in Harmony initiative across the community and on the Internet helps to combat the phenomenon of cyber-racism. Immigration: ‘Children Overboard’ Affair (Question No. 1727) Mr Latham asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 24 March 2003: Has he recently declared his support for human rights in the Middle East; if so, will he now apologise to the parents whom he claimed to have thrown their children overboard during the last Federal election campaign. These matters have been extensively canvassed in both public and parliamentary forums. I refer the honourable member to the Government Members report of the Committee on a Certain Maritime Incident.

Bendigo Gospel Music Festival (Question No. 1828) Mr Gibbons asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts and Sport, upon notice, on 13 May 2003: (1) Is the Minister aware that the Bendigo Gospel Festival Inc, the organisation that conducted the 2002 Bendigo Gospel Music Festival, has been placed in voluntary liquidation. (2) Is the Minister aware that the 2002 Bendigo Gospel Music Festival, which was conducted from 2628 April 2002, resulted in a substantial loss, with creditors owed more than $90,000. (3) Is the Minister aware that the 2002 Bendigo Gospel Music Festival received a grant of $18,180 in the 13th grant round of the Festivals Australia Programme in October 2001. (4) Is the Minister aware that the people behind this incorporated association had conducted two previous private events in Bendigo that also ran at a loss. (5) What accountability processes are in place to protect the misuse of public monies. the honourable member’s question: (1) and (2) The Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, which administers Festivals Australia received unsolicited information on 16 September which indicated that there were financial problems with the Festival and it had a shortfall of $72,404. This loss on the whole festival was confirmed in the information provided by the festival director as part of the acquittal process for the project.

It does not provide funding for entire festivals. In this instance, the funding was provided towards the costs associated with staging the Australian Massed Gospel Choir event. (4) Applicants are required to complete a detailed application form, which includes the provision of a financial statement and evidence of incorporation. Evidence of community support is also sought to assist the Festivals Australia committee in making their recommendations. In this instance, letters of support were received from local businesses, service organisations and the Tourism and Events section of the Greater Bendigo City Council. This information included references to the success of the previous festival. As part of the assessment process, the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts also sought comments from Arts Victoria. In this instance no specific comments were provided. (5) All grant recipients are required to provide an acquittal report which includes information on attendances, media coverage and a financial report demonstrating that the funding was used for the purposes specified in the application. The project acquittal provided by the festival director indicates that the funding allocated to the Australian Massed Gospel Choir project was spent in accordance with the Deed of Agreement between the Commonwealth and Bendigo Gospel Festival Inc.

275,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:abled a full version of the RRT decision, which identified the applicant, to be published, contrary to the express statutory provision prohibiting this. Since the withdrawal of these RRT decisions from the database on 29 January 2003, all published decisions have been audited with the result that approximately 30 decisions were found to contain identifying information. These identifiers appeared in the decisions that had been made available on the Internet owing to the use by the RRT of electronic editing technology which, on publication on the Austlii database, resulted in the reappearance of previously deleted identifiers. Up until the decisions database was taken off-line on 29 January 2003, published decisions were available as normal. Between 29 January 2003 and 27 March 2003 (a period of 8 weeks) no decisions were available on the Internet. However, these decisions remained available on request at both the Sydney and Melbourne registries of the Tribunal. Since 28 March 2003, the previously published Internet decisions have been progressively returned to the Austlii database. The final instalment of most recent decisions became available on 22 May 2003. All decisions published from 1 June 1999 to 22 May 2003 are now available once again on the Austlii database (4,323 decisions). The remainder of the database (decisions prior to 1 June 1999) is being progressively returned to the Internet. RRT Registry staff have met all requests for access to published decisions while the database was unavailable. The RRT Bulletin summarises key recent decisions and has continued to be issued on a monthly basis. The current and previous Bulletins can be viewed on the Tribunal’s website. (3) Decisions of the RRT are selected for publication in accordance with the requirements of the Migration Act 1958 (the Act). Section 431 of the Act provides: “431 Certain Tribunal decisions to be published (1) Subject to subsection (2), and to any direction under section 440, the Registrar must ensure the publication of any statements prepared under subsection 430(1) that the Principal Member thinks are of particular interest. (2) The Tribunal must not publish any statement which may identify an applicant or any relative or other dependent of an applicant.” Those RRT decisions which are published are edited into a style and format so as not to contain information which may identify the applicant or relatives or other dependents of the applicant, in order to protect the identity of the applicant or his or her relatives and dependents. The current Principal Member’s direction relating to the publication of decisions considered to be of ‘particular interest’ states that decisions of ‘particular interest’ are those that: represent a broad cross section of decisions having regard to factors such as country of reference, the outcome of the review, whether there is detailed consideration of legal principles, and whether the factual circumstances are complex or unusual, or whether they are common to a large number of cases. On average the Tribunal currently publishes 20% of its decisions. The RRT decision’s database provides Internet based full text copies of published decisions. In addition, the RRT produces the RRT Bulletin, which covers recently published Tribunal decisions. The editor of the RRT Bulletin chooses the decisions that are to be published. The RRT Bulletin is a publicly available document that contains, amongst other things, summaries of selected decisions. The summarised cases represent a cross section of published decisions.

2003: (1) Can the Minister confirm that in letters dated 13 and 21 May 2002 he stated that Australia was favourably disposed to Taiwan being admitted to the World Health Organisation (WHO) with observer status, but would only do so when it was clear a consensus supported such a move. (2) Would consensus have to include the agreement of the People’s Republic of China; if so, is the Minister able to say whether this is likely to be forthcoming. (3) What other organisations or entities, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, or quasi states, already enjoy observer status and did Australia support their accreditation to the WHO as observers; if so, how did Australia explain its support for these organisations or entities. (4) Has the speedy spread of the SARS epidemic in Taiwan and the possibility of continued crossinfection between China and Taiwan via the busy cross-Strait trade and travel made the admission of Taiwan as an observer to the WHO even more urgent than before. (5) Will the Government, at the commencement of the meeting of the WHO in Geneva on 28 May 2003, move to join the recent statements of the Japanese government, the European Union, and the United States Congress and the bi-partisan private member’s resolution moved by the Member for Fairfax and seconded by the Member for Lilley supporting the admission of Taiwan to the WHO as an observer. eign Affairs will answer the honourable member’s question.
