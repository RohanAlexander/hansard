It being 8 pm,Wednesday, 14 September 2005 ----Poverty Ms BIRD (Cunningham) (9.30 am)-In eradicating poverty, it is obviously important that our community and future generations are committed to this important issue. I am pleased to provide to the House today some extracts from letters about this issue that I received from young people attending Lindsay Park Primary School in my electorate. I would like to read out some quotes from those letters, as follows: Dear Ms Bird, In my opinion I think the government should cancel the debt owed by the poorer countries since they can hardly pay the income. I also think that the government should put more money into supporting these countries because every three seconds someone dies in these countries. LastlyI would like the Government to continue fair trade with the poorer countries so they don’t get ripped off from buying things from us and they get better deals. Hopefully you can try to raise these issues with the government so they can do something about it and try to stop the poverty and let kids and their parents live a normal life without the worry that they will drop dead at any moment. I hope that you will do something to help these less fortunate countries through these rough times. Yours sincerely, Isabella. Dear Ms Bird, These are the goals that the UN have made-up. They are trying to achieve these goals. The UN summit is in New York from 14-16 September. If you can go along please wear your wristband to show you care about poverty. Yours sincerely, Jessica Dear Ms Bird, Congratulations on achieving the halving to poverty in East Asia and the Pacific. SoI think that you and John Howard can surely improve the poverty in countries that only live on $1 a day like sub-Saharan Africa. So Ms Bird, if you don’t mind, please give poverty a really big thought and say “Make Poverty History”. Yours sincerely, Samantha. Dear Ms Bird, We have been learning about people in poverty and I’m trying to help by writing a letter to you. I think that sub-Saharan Africa needs more help from people, but congratulations on helping East Asia and the Pacific but I want to help by halving property. Yours sincerely, Brittany. Dear Ms Bird, The UN has succeeded in halving poverty in East Asia and the Pacific from 28% to 14% in 9 years but have to work on sub-Saharan Africa which is only changed by 1% from 48%. Thank you for reading this letter and awaiting your reply, Jeremy. Dear Ms Bird, Congratulations on already halving poverty in East Asia and the Pacific, now the target has already been hit we also need to help sub-Saharan Africa, Europe and central Asia… The wristbands that we are sending you are to raise awareness of the G8 summit in New York, hosted by the United Nations… One person is dying every three seconds, that’s 30,000 people dying a day. With thanks, Haydn. Dear Ms Bird, The UN should be congratulated on the wonderful effort of cutting the poverty down in east Asia and the Pacific. Though we need to work on fair trade from larger … countries and the smaller poorer countries so the smaller countries are not ripped off. Yours sincerely, Sean.

209,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (9.33 Am),"TodayI would like to speak on a form of cancer that istion, and to urge those who fit into the at-risk category to have a check-up. The cancer I refer to is, of course, prostate cancer, which claims the lives of just as many men in Australia as breast cancer does women. The group that must be applauded for doing such a tremendous job in informing those most at risk is the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia. I would also like to commend the federal shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Lilley, and the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads for the letter they sent out, presumably to all members of parliament, dated 29 August, encouraging awareness about the insidious nature of prostate cancer. This month is Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. It is a time when the message about prostate cancer is given that extra push in the effort to spread the message to those at risk and, most importantly, to save lives. The issue of prostate cancer at present seems to be at a similar point on the public awareness scale as the issues of breast cancer and cervical cancer were perhaps a decade ago. Back then, and in the years preceding, it was difficult to have a public discussion about cancers that target those parts of a woman’s anatomy. They are private parts and it was widely considered to be rude to talk publicly about them. But things have changed and breast cancer is now recognised as the real problem that it is, and open discussion is encouraged because lives can depend on it. The topic of prostate cancer needs to go through a similar transition. It needs to change from being regarded as a private topic, discussed only behind closed doors, to being regarded as an open issue, the understanding of which can prolong life. It is a well-known truth that men often delay going to the doctor until they are suffering serious symptoms. They may regard it as a sign of weakness to admit that they have a problem. With prostate cancer symptoms can be minor. By the time symptoms become serious the cancer may be well advanced. The message from the Prostate Cancer Foundation is that prostate cancer checks should become routine. There is an Australian saying that ‘real men don’t eat quiche’. Real men do eat quiche, and real men should also take the topic of prostate cancer seriously. It is really important, if you are in the at-risk group, to go and have a check by your doctor. It is particularly important if you have a family history of prostate cancer that this occurs. It is important that as a community we raise awareness of this growing problem. It is a hidden problem to a certain extent, but all of us would know some people who have been affected by the tragedy of prostate cancer. There are a lot of support groups there. They deserve our backing. It is really important to raise awareness of prostate cancer in the Australian community in 2005. (Time expired) Australian Netball Players Association spectator sport on our TVs and radios. It is football finals time in Melbourne and I, along with most of my electorate, am confident that the mighty St Kilda Football Club is advancing to its first flag since 1966. We have had the epic tragedy of Australia losing the Ashes and Lleyton Hewitt’s gallant performance at the US Open. But not many people here realise that the most popular sport in Australia, certainly in terms of participation, is not football, cricket or tennis; it is netball, which is played by nearly 300,000 people, mostly young women, and has a huge following across the country. Last year 14,000 people watched the Australia versus New Zealand test in Sydney. Netball is one of the MAIN COMMITTEE",170,Statements By Members
210,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (9.36 Am),"During September we have had a wealth of great success stories of Australian sport and it is a pity that it does not get more media attention-although this is beginning to change and the ABC does screen some of the better matches. On 10 September the Australian Netball Players Association held a reception at Raheen, the splendid Victorian mansion at Kew which was the home of Archbishop Mannix and is now owned by the Pratt family. Richard and Jeanne Pratt generously and kindly lent Raheen to the Australian Netball Players Association for this event. Liz Ellis, the chairperson of the ANPA and Australia’s netball captain, welcomed netballers from all over Australia and other guests including the Victorian sports minister, Justin Madden, and women’s affairs minister, Mary Delahunty, and the legendary netball coach Joyce Brown OAM. At the reception, ably hosted by Sue Gaudian, the following awards were presented: the Brown/Ellis most valuable player award to Catherine Cox, the Simone McKinnis centre court award to Natalie Von Bertouch, the Vicki Wilson goaler award to Catherine Cox, the Kathryn Harby-Williams defender award to Liz Ellis and the rookie of the year medal to Jo Curran. I would like to congratulate all of those people, as well as Liz Ellis, the netball players and their supporters, for making the sport a success. The reception was organised by my friend Bill Shorten, the National Secretary of the Australian Workers Union, one of Australia’s largest and oldest unions. Most people think the AWU is a union for shearers but in fact it is one of Australia’s most innovative unions and has expanded to include workers in such diverse industries as metals, aviation, oil, gas, mining, construction, food processing and retail. The reason Bill Shorten was at the Raheen reception for the netballers was that the AWU and the ANPA have recently come to an agreement under which netballers are becoming unionised. We often hear from members opposite that trade unions are dinosaurs, that they have no useful role to play in a brave new world of individual contracts and that they are all run by crooks and thugs. The AWU shows that unions do have a role to offer and that they play a vitally important role in helping workers of all kinds maintain and improve living standards and conditions of employment. Why did all the glamorous young women and national netball players want to join a union? Because like other workers they suffer economic disadvantage in an unregulated labour market. Most of the players in the eight teams that make up the elite netball competition earn less than $5,000 a year, forcing them to maintain full-time or near full-time employment to make a reasonable living. But three-quarters of them spend more than 26 hours a week on netball related activities, creating an intolerable conflict between sport, employment and family commitments. If netball is becoming an elite professional sport it is time the sport started paying its players properly. (Time expired) Fuel Prices House one of the most pressing issues worrying consumers in my electorate of Bass-petrol prices. I have been contacted by many local people, including people like Mr Kerry Bonney of Ravenswood, who ask me and the government to do all we can to bring prices down. I read today that the recently released Sensis Consumer Report has shown that petrol prices are at the top of the list of Australians’ concerns, even ahead of terrorism, the health system and the environment. Fifteen hundred Australians were surveyed in late July and early August. The report finds that people are not anticipating any petrol price relief in the near future, with half MAIN COMMITTEE",171,Statements By Members
211,Mr Michael Ferguson (Bass) (9.39 Am),"I rise to bring to the attention of theof those surveyed expecting to spend more on transport costs in the coming year. The report also finds that Australians in rural and regional areas are more concerned about petrol prices than their city counterparts. That is easily explained by the fact that people outside the cities have to travel longer distances and then there are the implications for freight costs impacting more in regional areas. Petrol prices in Australia are among the lowest in the developed world. The most recent figures available from the International Energy Agency show that the post-tax retail price of petrol in Australia was the fourth lowest among OECD countries at $A1.03 per litre. For the same period, average prices in the UK were $A2.05 per litre, in Japan $A1.49, in Germany $A1.89 and in the USA $A0.69 per litre. Australia has the fifth lowest pre-tax petrol prices in the OECD. Australian petrol prices are linked to international prices because around two-thirds of the oil used in Australian refineries is imported. Australian producers are free to export crude oil, LPG and petroleum products into international markets and to obtain the best price they can. So one can appreciate how imported product and locally produced product would have similar price movements. International prices for petrol, as with other commodities, are set by supply and demand factors rather than products costs. The government therefore has as much ability to control the market price of petrol as it does for milk-except for the taxation that governments levy on fuel. That brings me to excise and the GST. Petrol is subject to the GST. However, the Australian government does not receive any direct revenue effects from changes in petrol prices. It is a common misconception that the Australian government spends the GST, but that is not so. The Australian government does not benefit from the GST-all of it is passed on to the states. Interestingly, the only winners from higher fuel prices are the state governments, which receive increasing amounts of GST. I have been advised that every 1c increase in the retail price of petrol yields the states a bonus of $18 million. I also note that only one state in Australia uses its GST to subsidise the cost of fuelthat is, Queensland. Today, I challenge other states, including my state of Tasmania, to follow this lead. (Time expired) Public Libraries: Internet Pornography and also to the many families residing in my electorate-that is, my call to install internet pornography filters in public libraries, particularly in the city of Casey. This arose out of a seminar that I attended by American academic Mary Anne Layden, who spoke about the fairly pernicious effects of internet pornography, particularly on young children. Given that, one would think that the community standard would require that, if a child or an adult accessed a publicly funded library, they would not be able to access pornography in any way, shape or form, but the fact is that, across Australia at present, you can walk into public libraries and in many cases access pornography of the most violent and vile type. Recently at a library in New South Wales a gentleman was caught downloading child pornography. I do not know whether I come from a different planet but I think that in a government funded facility you should not be able to access something that causes harm to children. Subsequent to raising this matter in parliament on 17 AugustI have been inundated by people across Australia and from within my own electorate supporting this not unreasonable call. Libraries are funded partially by the federal government and by state and local governments. MAIN COMMITTEE",172,Statements By Members
212,Mr Byrne (Holt) (9.43 Am),"On 17 AugustI raised a matter of concern to this HouseAfter this call, one would think that libraries-particularly the Casey-Cardinia Library Corporation, which has a lot of children accessing these services-would as a matter of priority install these filters-but no. In fact, before I had risen to speak about this matter in parliament, a journalist from Leader Newspapers had, as an experiment, gone into one of these libraries and downloaded pornography for half an hour-unchecked and unsupervised. This matter was addressed by the Casey-Cardinia Library Corporation after I raised this matter, and a letter written to the Leader Group by Councillor Gary Runge, chairman of the CaseyCardinia Library Corporation, effectively says that it cannot be done-that it does not need to be done. As a parent and legislator, I am not going to have a librarian or someone representing librarians saying to me, ‘If, as a matter of chance, people can access pornography in a library, so be it.’ That is not acceptable. We in this place set the community standards and I say that libraries have to install internet pornography filters as a matter of priority, and if they cannot do it by choice then it should be mandated. I will continue this campaign until, as a matter of public policy-federal, state and local-a child who walks into a library will be protected by an internet pornography filter in the library. (Time expired) Carers: Disability around Australia gathered in Canberra at a rally called ‘Walk a mile in my shoes’. They wanted to convey a powerful message about the difficulties faced by people with a disability and by their carers. I fully support their cause. The Australian government is continually working to improve conditions for carers and announced new measures yesterday in which carers of children with severe intellectual, psychiatric or behavioural disabilities that result in challenging behaviours may be eligible for the carer payment. Eligibility for the carer payment will give more support to several thousand people. These changes to the carer payment, which are worth around $57 million over four years, underline the Howard government’s strong commitment to supporting the needs of carers around Australia. It is an issue that I have committed myself to. On 30 June this year I had the privilege and honour of being adopted by Ms Jodie Quarmby as part of the politician adoption scheme. As many of you would be aware, this is a program coordinated by the Development Disability Council that allows for a disabled member of a community to adopt a politician. Jodie, who turned 29 last week, suffered brain damage at the age of 23, after her brain was starved of oxygen, and she was not expected to live. Against the odds, and showing her fighting spirit and determination, Jodie has pulled through and continues to make daily improvements. Three and a half years after her life-altering injuries, Jodie moved into her own residential unit, which was provided through Homeswest. Shortly afterwards, she was granted funding by the Disability Services Commission, which allows for carers to assist her for approximately 20 hours a week. Whilst this is invaluable help, the responsibilities that this places on her mother, Jenny, and the rest of the family are immense. I hope to become better informed about the issues and challenges they face, in order to assist them to the best of my ability. Jodie’s mother, Jenny, like so many other carers, is a remarkable individual. She is Jodie’s primary carer. I know that this presents immense challenges, but her positive attitude is inspiring. Amidst these challenges, Jodie is very lucky to have a mum like Jenny.

Hopefully, through being involved in the politician adoption scheme and with the opportunities I have had through meeting the Quarmby family, I can become better informed about the issues that Jodie and her family face. I take this opportunity to congratulate all my colleagues in both houses who have decided to become part of this invaluable program. (Time expired) Port Adelaide ment in South Australia, state governments and authorities have had a very uneven record when it comes to infrastructure investments, particularly in the north-west suburbs of the Port of Adelaide. In 1941 the Birkenhead Bridge was built in the wrong place for the wrong reasons. In 1961 the former opening Jervois Bridge was replaced by a fixed bridge, destroying the upper reaches of the Port River and the future connections to West Lakes and the sea at Grange. When in the 1970s and the 1980s employment levels fell by thousands and the port was desperate for redevelopment of its business, retail and leisure centres, the state governments of the day ignored their plight. Major shopping centres were built at Andale and Westlakes and a badly thought out Myer project was abandoned, yet managed to destroy a whole community. In the meantime, the Port Adelaide shopping precinct, formerly the biggest outside of Adelaide, continued to deteriorate. The Bannon Labor government certainly recognised the problem and a renaissance was begun in the mid-1980s. Unfortunately, the 1987 stock market crashed and the demise of the State Bank put an end to that. The subsequent Brown-Olsen Liberal government totally ignored the needs of Port Adelaide, but it was not always like that. From 1836 the Port of Adelaide and its surrounds was the landing place for the first and subsequent generations of European free settlement. Before roads and railways were built, South Australian farmers, miners, merchant traders, shipping companies, ships’ captains, engineers, doctors, teachers, clergy, stonemasons, carpenters, builders, artisans and labourers met in the meeting rooms of the port, in hotels, tearooms and church halls and basically planned the future of the fledgling colony of South Australia. They did not get everything right, but what they did lasted many years. Railways, electric tramways, bus ways, bridges, electricity and so on were quickly introduced, often before anywhere else in Australia. The community demanded the best options, and largely got them. However, that terrible decision in 1941-the Birkenhead Bridge-was followed by even worse decisions in every decade after World War II until Mike Rann in grand final week last year announced a $1.2 billion redevelopment of Port Adelaide-at long last, positive action. But if some people get their way, that much needed development will be threatened by another proposed development at Cheltenham Park Racecourse. Both cannot be sustained. The SAJC, forgetting that its core business is horse racing, wants to sell the Cheltenham racecourse. Some in the state bureaucracy, the Liberal opposition and the Charles Sturt Council want to do the same.

Mr Graham Gow set Territory legend. People reckon that the Territory is a place where only crocs, beer and page 3 girls survive and where going troppo is a disease suffered by all and sundry. But Graham Francis Gow was a man who made the Territory the place it is now. Graham came to live in Darwin in 1973 and by 1974 was curator of reptiles and amphibians for the Northern Territory museum, undertaking many tasks such as preserving Sweetheart for the museum to display. After setting up the crocodile farm at Noonamah, he opened Graham Gow’s Reptile World at Humpty Doo in 1982. He achieved many things in the world of herpetology and tourism. Graham discovered and described species and he has had species named after him. He was the quintessential snake man. He wrote many books, posters and papers and won the inaugural Northern Territory Brolga Award for his contribution to tourism. In 1989 he won the Whitely Award from the Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales for the best field guide. His consultancies to government, universities, hospitals and education at every level gained worldwide recognition for his work and observations. Rugby League was one of Graham’s other great loves, where he had friends and he participated at every level of the game. He loved his juniors and he had great success coaching at the club and at the representative level. The kids at Camp Quality will also miss Graham Gow. He used to put on fund raisers at shows and country fairs and the like where he raised many thousands of dollars for Camp Quality. Graham was a larger than life character who would help people from every walk of life, from doctors in England and America to someone he met on the Birdsville Track. He loved to contribute. He was famous for his one-liners. He loved the Northern Territory and he loved his block at Humpty Doo. In 2001 Graham was diagnosed with cancer. He fought it with everything he had. He was cared for by his wife Suzanne to a level that only love can give. Graham is also survived by his children Stephen, Johanne, Lisa, Jason, Samantha and Michael. Graham Gow was a Territory legend, a man who saw the Territory as a frontier and one who wanted to live his life on the frontier.

As members, we are currently all busy organising or attending VP celebrations in our electorates to highlight and to recognise the contributions that veterans made during the Second World War. But what we are giving them is in fact a second-class medical service. Yesterday, at the 90th national conference of the Returned Services League of Australia, this issue came up again. I would like to put on the public record comments made by some of the key movers and shakers at that conference. The Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, the Hon. De-Anne Kelly, detailed the commitment in an address at this congress. Mrs Kelly said that, of the medical specialists across Australia, 381 had chosen not to accept the gold card-which is one of the two repatriation health cards. There are 381 bloodsucking specialists, rich people, who I think are demeaning the profession that they work in. Three hundred and eightyone specialists across this country have said: ‘Stick it up your jumper. We’re not going to recognise that.’ I think we ought to name them, and I am going to work as hard as I can to find out who they are. I know that some are in my state. We have the ludicrous situation of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs flying veterans out of Tasmania for treatment. At the conference, the RSL Tasmanian president, Mr Ian Kennett, described the solution as impractical. He said: We had one veteran go over with a bad back, he went 18 times. You only have to have one bad landing and they are back to zero where you need to have him. This is a ridiculous situation, because the government and the specialists have not agreed on payments. I say to the specialists: ‘You bloodsuckers, you’re taking advantage of the benevolence of the Commonwealth health system. You’re abusing the trust that you put in our veterans when they went overseas.’ We are short-changing the veterans. I know that members on both sides of the chamber see this as a real issue. I urge the government to settle it once and for all, to drag the specialists to the table at a national level and say to the 381 specialists: ‘Enough is enough. You’re making enough money out of the government. Let’s do something to resolve this issue.’ (Time expired) Special Air Service Regiment join with the Prime Minister at a book launch at Duntroon, here in Canberra. It was a family affair with Ian’s wife, brother, father and close friends from the Southern Highlands all in attendance with many defence personnel. The book is titled The Amazing SAS, written by Ian McPhedran and launched by the Prime Minister. It details the contemporary history of the role of Australia’s elite Special Air Service Regiment, which is headquartered at the Campbell Barracks in Western Australia. Ian is the son of Colin McPhedran, who wrote a book titled White Butterflies. It details his story as a young man in Burma during the Japanese invasion in World War II. Colin is in many ways my mentor-a role he has played for most of my life-and is someone I deeply admire. His son Ian is a credible Australian journalist and correspondent, with a particular interest in defence matters. He writes from his experience of the many countries where he has witnessed the work of our men and women at the front lines. He speaks, lives and works with them and develops a first-hand understanding before he writes his articles. He went to Iraq on the commencement of hostilities and it was from there that he gained an insight into the shadowy world of the SAS-our finest soldiers and front-line defence against our war on terrorism. MAIN COMMITTEE",176,Statements By Members
218,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (9.58 Am),"Several weeks ago, I was invited by Ian McPhedran toIan’s book records the recent activities of the SAS and makes a damned good read. But it is not my purpose to review the book as such, for it has been well done by others. In a way I am paying homage to his father, for in IanI see many of the qualities of Colin. Ian and I do not always see eye to eye on many issues and his brand of politics is slightly different from mine, but that does not stop me from giving credit where credit is due. Ian’s journalistic expertise has enabled a book to be constructed that will serve as an insightful aid to anyone who is interested in how our premier military unit operates. As legendary as the exploits of the SAS regiment are, we should not be lulled into thinking that they are ‘super soldiers’. Indeed, in the preface to the book Ian comments: The soldiers and commanders of the SAS regiment have made it clear to me that they do not consider themselves heroes. Nor do they think of their actions as particularly outstanding or amazing. There is a certain ability in their laconic humbleness, but everyone has a limit, even highly trained soldiers as these men are. Ian’s message is that if these soldiers are so well regarded and if we want to encourage others to follow in their footsteps, we should be guaranteeing that they are looked after when they need help. Their jobs are highly demanding and highly stressful and it is natural that they will suffer as a result-not only they but their families. IfI might paraphrase Ian’s comments, things have improved in terms of compensation for war veterans, but there is still a long way to go. It is not good enough for families to have to rely on charities, such as the SAS Resources Trust. Those sentiments I can only echo. We must do more to protect one of our most valued defence assets. As in the Battle of Britain, the aircraft can be replaced but good pilots cannot. So too our SAS troops. Ian has done a sterling job in highlighting the humanity behind the legend. We will never share the experiences of these soldiers, so we will never appreciate what they are feeling. This book opens a little window, and from that I hope we see enough to appreciate an asset when we see one. the time for members’ statements has concluded.

To this the honourable member for Oxley has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question. my friend the honourable member for Oxley in his perceptive comments on the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Amendment Bill 2005.

220,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ir Causley),The original question was that this bill be,178,Protection Of The Sea Shipping Levy Amendment Bill 2005
221,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (10.01 Am),"I am pleased to rise this morning to supportprovisions of the bill. It amends the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Act 1981. The original bill enabled the government to impose a levy on shipping at the rate of 6c per tonne of a ship’s tonnage to fund the national plan to combat pollution of the sea by oil and other noxious and hazardous substances. The original bill was passed with bipartisan support and has generally served the nation well. This bill removes the maximum level of the levy, enabling it to be set by regulation. This will allow the levy to be increased to fund a national approach to maritime emergency towage while still continuing to provide funds for the national plan to combat pollution of the sea. For a number of reasons, outlined by the member for Oxley, this is a sensible and necessary measure and it has the support of the opposition. Worldwide shipping is growing at an exponential rate, and Australia is a major user of shipping services for both international and domestic trade. As trade will grow, particularly in Australia, there will be more and more use of ships coming through Australian waters. This is particularly true of my home city of Melbourne. This means we need to adopt innovative measures to ensure both maritime safety and environmental protection of our waters and coastlines. It is essential for Australia’s maritime emergency services that they be maintained at a high state of readiness so that the ever-present threat of a catastrophe, such as the Exxon Valdez, can be prevented. Most Australians live within a short distance of our very long coastlines, which are seeing an ever-increasing volume of shipping as international trade grows. We therefore have a major responsibility to prevent maritime ecological disasters. We must protect national treasures such as the Barrier Reef. I was pleased that my friend the member for Oxley pointed out the very regrettable pollution of the Barrier Reef in 2002 by the Panamanian registered flag of convenience ship the Pacific Quest, which left an oil slick of 70 kilometres along the Barrier Reef. We must do everything possible, including passing this billand the member for Oxley suggested an amendment-to prevent that type of incident occurring in the future. It is appropriate that these services be paid for by the shipping industry itself through this levy, and it is also appropriate that the government have the power to vary the rate of the levy so that it produces enough revenue to meet the need for maritime emergency services and to prevent pollution of our maritime environment by oil spills and other discharges from ships in Australian waters. It is commendable that the member for Oxley has taken such a close interest in this subject, since he represents an electorate which has no coastline. I, however, represent a waterfront electorate containing both the great port centre of Port Melbourne and a long stretch of beachfront in Melbourne’s beautiful Port Phillip Bay. My constituents take a close interest both in maritime safety issues, since many of them work in the maritime industry, and in the maritime environment, since they enjoy the beachfront lifestyle in areas like South Melbourne, Middle Park, Albert Park, St Kilda and Elwood. They do not want to see a maritime environmental disaster such as an oil spill in the enclosed waters of Port Phillip Bay. I agree with the comments of the member for Oxley that, while we support this bill, we have some doubts that the government will carry through their good intentions. This government have shown in the past that their relationship with some shipowners and stevedoring companies is far too cosy for the national good. To make this arrangement work, the government need to cooperate with industry, unions and state governments. But this government’s MAIN COMMITTEE record is not one of cooperation with state governments and certainly not with unions. It is one of special deals for some corporate friends, especially in the maritime industry, where some people in particular are very high on the list. For example, the government tell us they will undertake a roll-out of upgraded emergency maritime towage operations at strategic locations around the Australian coastline. They have committed to consulting with the industry on that roll-out of the national emergency towage scheme, including identifying the locations of these operations. No-one knows the Australian maritime environment better than the people who work in the maritime industry, including of course the maritime unions. But we know that this government is deeply hostile to the maritime unions. It is true at the moment that the chief object of its hostility-and we see this particularly from the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations-is the CFMEU. But I am sure the minister has not forgotten his predecessor’s and this government’s dislike of the MUA. This is a pity, because I know there are many local leaders of the MUA, particularly in my home city of Melbourne. As far as I am concerned there is no-one who knows more or cares more about maritime safety than they do. If this government is serious about consultation it will swallow its ideological extremism and talk to the people who know the industry and Australia’s maritime environment the best. The bill provides that the levy will apply uniformly to Australian and foreign flagged vessels. This is an important provision because the share of Australian owned and Australian crewed ships involved in Australia’s shipping industry has steadily declined under this government and so, therefore, has Australia’s ability to protect both maritime safety and the marine and coastal environment, which is increasingly out of our hands and in the hands of foreign shipowners, some of them reputable and some, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, less so. It would be interesting to know how many single-voyage permits this government has issued to foreign shipping companies. That is why I asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services in February 2000 how many single-voyage permits had been issued to single-hulled vessels over the previous five years. Of course, Deputy Speaker, as you know, single-hulled vessels are older kinds of ships which are particularly polluting when they have accidents, because a single hull means that the materials they have inside come straight out. More modern ships are double hulled. The minister has told me, in response to this question: This information is not captured electronically in processing Single Voyage Permits, and I am not prepared to direct the use of the considerable resources required to extract this information manually. In other words, the then minister for transport and shipping, the former Deputy Prime Minister, did not know and he was not prepared to find out. In my view, this is a disgraceful state of affairs. As part of its general policy of undercutting industrial standards and favouring some corporate friends, this government has allowed the least reputable shipping interests to take increasing control of Australia’s maritime trade. These companies, many operating under flags of convenience and therefore in some respects beyond the reach of the law, undercut Australian vessels by paying extremely low wages to their crews, many of them recruited in countries much poorer than Australia. These crews often operate in conditions which would be outlawed in Australia now and in fact would have been outlawed in Australia a century ago, thanks to the actions of Australian trade unions. These companies frequently default, even on MAIN COMMITTEE the wages they agree to pay, leaving their crews stranded-as we saw recently in Adelaide, where a Filipino crew was left with no money and no redress. The relevant point in relation to this bill is that these cut-rate shipping owners operating in Australian waters, with little regard for the environment or other standards, are an ongoing concern to this parliament. So while the government, on the one hand, is bringing this bill in with the aim of strengthening maritime safety and protecting our environment, its other policies are working in the opposite direction, making it more likely that sooner or later one of these shonky shippers-say, a single-hulled older ship from one of these flags of convenience countries-will be responsible for a major industrial accident in one of our busy ports or for a major environmental disaster along our coasts. I want to turn to another aspect of this bill, one that was mentioned by the honourable member for Oxley and also recently by the Leader of the Opposition. This is a national security issue. The sad fact is we live in an age of international terrorism. We know that, after the Bali and Jakarta bombing attacks, regional terrorist groups such as Jemaah Islamiah have made Australia a target. Australia has a long and vulnerable coastline and, as I have outlined, is heavily dependent upon the maritime trade. Few countries are more open to a maritime terrorist attack than Australia. It was therefore shocking to learn that last week an Antiguan flagged vessel with a predominantly Ukrainian crew carried 3,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate between Newcastle and Gladstone. I have talked about ammonium nitrate in this House before and I will go on doing so until I am satisfied that this threat has been seriously addressed. In fact, I think I was one of the first people to raise this matter in this House. Ammonium nitrate is a common fertiliser and I quite understand that farming interests need to have ready access to it, but in certain circumstances, such as the outbreak of fire on a cargo ship or if it is mixed with fuel oil, it is an explosive of devastating force. It was used by American neo-Nazi Timothy McVeigh to carry out the attack on the public service building in Oklahoma City which killed 168 people. We had two members of the government, the member for Flinders and the member for La Trobe, raise this issue in the newspapers, and perhaps there is some dissent in the government about whether the issue of ammonium nitrate has been properly handled or not. I am pleased to see that, because obviously members of the government place the security of Australians at a very high level, as does the opposition. Ammonium nitrate does not have to fall into the hands of terrorists to be a threat to Australian lives. Let me relate to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, what happened in Texas in the Port of Galveston in April 1947. A French freighter, the Grandcamp, carrying 7,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate for export to European farmers caught fire and exploded. Another ship moored alongside was also carrying ammonium nitrate and it exploded as well. The resulting explosion broke windows in Houston, 60 miles away. People felt the explosion in Louisiana, 250 kilometres away. In Texas City the blast and resulting fires destroyed most of the town. At least 581 people were killed and more than 5,000 were injured. It was the worse industrial disaster in American history. This is what the shipping of ammonium nitrate can lead to, and there have been a number of other explosions on ships and in ports caused in this way. The government will reply, of course, that the ways in which ammonium nitrate is handled have changed greatly since 1947 and that Australia has strict regulations which-if observed-make a disaster impossible in Australia. Theoretically I suppose that is true, but the MAIN COMMITTEE revelation last week that ammonium nitrate is being shipped along the Australian coast by cutrate shipping companies under flags of convenience makes a mockery of such claims. How can the government regulate the safety procedures of a ship registered in Antigua whose real origins and ownership are unknown-probably there is some shonky shipowner in the Middle East-which is crewed by underpaid Ukrainians who have no knowledge of what they are carrying or how to prevent an industrial catastrophe? Clearly they cannot, and it just shows the lowest common dollar value foolishness that underlies the entire extremist ideology of this government. There should be Australian crews who have some knowledge of safety managing the Australian coastal trade, not the kind of ship that I have just outlined, carrying ammonium nitrate. This situation is made even more urgent by the security environment in which Australia finds itself now. It would not be very difficult for Jemaah Islamiah or some other group to take control of one of these foreign owned and foreign crewed ships, full of ammonium nitrate or some other dangerous cargo, and make use of it in an attack on an Australian port. After September 11, Madrid and London, is there anyone prepared to say that this is impossible? I have great confidence in our intelligence services and police preventing an attack on Australians. I believe-and it is a well-informed belief-that they have been very effective in preventing the infiltration of terrorist cells into Australia. But their work is made more difficult by a government which is so keen to please some of its friends in the stevedoring and shipping industries that it fails to take elementary precautions such as banning the carriage of ammonium nitrate by ships operating under flags of convenience. The minister has advised me that the Australian Customs Service records the identity of all crews entering Australia from a port overseas and that it maintains these records on its database. But, as we have seen in recent times, this provides no real guarantee that the people intent on carrying out a terrorist attack will not succeed in getting themselves onto a freighter. None of the September 11 terrorists showed up on the databases of US security services when they entered the US, and they walked onto airliners on 11 September with no difficulty. Does the government really claim that it can investigate the background of every crew member of every foreign flagged ship that enters Australian waters? If it does make this claim, I for one am not persuaded. Earlier this year I asked the minister a detailed question about the shipping of ammonium nitrate in Australian waters. He advised me of the measures which the government had taken to regulate this, including on foreign flagged vessels. Of course I do not assert that nothing has been done to prevent the possibility of an ammonium nitrate explosion. In 2003, with bipartisan support, the parliament passed the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act, under which every ship carrying ammonium nitrate in Australian waters is subject to a regulatory regime and is required to meet the requirements of the International Maritime Organisation’s international maritime dangerous goods code and the code of safe practice for solid bulk cargoes. In addition, all ships seeking to enter an Australian port are subject to Australia’s system of port state control. Under this system Australia, as a port state, undertakes risk assessments and can impose, when required, measures to ensure the ship meets Australia’s requirements with respect to a range of matters including safety and security. I do not dispute any of that. But the minister also told me in an answer to a question last year that since 2000 four cargoes of ammonium nitrate have been carried into Australian waMAIN COMMITTEE ters by ships registered in the Bahamas-a notorious haven for unscrupulous shipowners-as well as by a ship registered in Antigua that I mentioned earlier. Why does the government think that shipowners register their ships in places like Antigua, the Bahamas or Panama? It is to evade shipping regulations, safety standards and environmental laws which they know are imposed by legitimate shipping nations. Ships registered in such places are by definition unlikely to have any interest in complying with Australian law, whether to do with safety, labour standards, the environment or security. It may be that the security regime the minister outlined to me in his answer will ensure that most of the shippers will comply with the law, but its chances of effectively regulating all of them are greatly reduced when ships under flags of convenience are allowed to carry dangerous cargoes into Australian waters. My view is that such vessels should not be allowed to carry ammonium nitrate into Australian ports. The minister told me that Australia’s regulatory framework for the carriage of ammonium nitrate, together with the preventative security framework for maritime transport, has been recognised as amongst the world’s best. I have to say that I do not draw much comfort from that. There are not many countries which use as much ammonium nitrate for agricultural purposes as Australia does and still fewer which transport so much of it by sea. I dare say there is no other country except the United States which combines a high exposure to the threat of terrorism with a high vulnerability to ammonium nitrate. I would like to be assured that our security regime is not just the world’s best-whatever that might mean-but as tight as it reasonably can be. So long as the government permits flag of convenience vessels manned by underpaid crews whose real origins cannot be investigated to carry ammonium nitrate into our ports, it cannot make that claim. of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Amendment Bill 2005. In doing so, I am pleased to see this bill before the House. In many ways, it is not unrelated to a notice of motion that I moved and which was last debated in the House on 7 March 2005 regarding the integral role that maritime salvage plays in the safety of Australian mariners. This bill represents a partial solution to the issues raised in that notice of motion, and I refer to part (2)(b) of that notice of motion which called on the government to: … work with the industry and State Governments to develop a long-term plan to ensure that the Australian maritime sector is protected through adequate salvage capacity ... It then went on, in part (2)(c) of the notice of motion, to request that the government: … fund an interim solution to ensure that adequate salvage capacity exists at Australian portsand on Australian seas. An emergency towage is part of that solution. As my colleagues have said in the course of this debate, the purpose of the bill is to allow for the extension of the protection of the sea levy to fund a national approach to maritime emergency towage, and I regard that as exceptionally important. It is in the nation’s best interests. The levy will also allow for the continuation of activities in relation to the national plan to combat pollution of the sea by oil and other noxious and hazardous substances, which is exceptionally important to our marine environment and also to the tourism industry, which is so important in terms of jobs and export earnings for Australia. The bill will also remove the maximum level of the protection of the sea levy, enabling it to be set by regulation. I consider this to be an important issue. It is important in terms of safety, MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Protection Of The Sea Shipping Levy Amendment Bill 2005
222,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (10.19 Am),"I rise today to speak on the Protectionsecurity, environmental protection and economic considerations. Unfortunately, whilst this bill is before the House today, my criticism is that it has taken the government so long to front up to its responsibilities in this regard. In that context I draw the attention of the House to the fact that, in June last year, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport and Regional Services-chaired by the motion that I referred to-which was last debated in the House of Representatives on 7 March this year-flowed from the unanimous report of that committee. That report, which was well prepared and well received not just in the maritime and tourism industries but in the Australian community generally, unfortunately reflected the ongoing incompetence of and mismanagement by the Howard government in taking years to address the findings of the inquiry. The inquiry was undertaken in response to a Productivity Commission report which recommended that provision of salvage services at Australian ports be opened up to market forces. In some ways this debate is a signal to the Productivity Commission to start to think about the implications of some of its recommendations in the future in terms of not only a hard-headed approach to economic considerations but also the potential impact of some of the recommendations on our maritime environment and, importantly, the tourism industry. The record will show that evidence presented to the committee suggested that such an arrangement would be likely to lead to an overall reduction in salvage capability. That is exceptionally important, given the fact that we are a large island nation. I do not believe that Australia should be placed at such risk. We need modern and efficient salvage capabilities. The committee recommended that a number of actions be taken by government. Firstly, it recommended that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, in consultation with the industry, determine the most strategic placement for salvage capability at Australian ports. That is pretty fundamental-we work out strategically where we maximise our salvage capability. Secondly, it recommended that additional revenue be raised to support the continued provision of salvage and that the cost be met through a three-way split between the industry and the state and Commonwealth governments. I believe that it is a joint Commonwealth and state government responsibility to ensure that we have proper salvage capability around Australia. It is not just a Commonwealth responsibility. There is also an onus on our state governments and port instrumentalities to have proper regard in their tender process to ensure that there is not only salvage capability but salvage capability across the whole broad spectrum of maritime activities. There are very few companies in Australia that can actually maintain that salvage capacity on an Australia-wide basis. Thirdly, the committee recommended that the company which provides salvage capability be paid a subsidy to cover the costs incurred. I support our endeavours as a community to meet that requirement, because to walk away from that responsibility is to walk away from our national interests. Finally, the committee recommended that the three-way funding agreement be reviewed every three years. I am pleased that the Australian Transport Council has now agreed to a national approach to emergency towage and that work is now under way to identify appropriate locations around the Australian coastline. Having said that, it is exceptionally important that the momentum be maintained and that the government makes sure that the agreement translates into action immediately. In that context, I remind the House that earlier this year a container ship, MSC MAIN COMMITTEE",183,Protection Of The Sea Shipping Levy Amendment Bill 2005
223,"Member For Hinkler, Mr Neville","tabled a report on the issue of ship salvage. The notice ofDenisse, was left drifting near Christmas Island after engine trouble. Fortunately for Australia, two Navy frigates were in the area and able to go to the aid of the ship whilst salvage vessels were dispatched from Western Australia. Imagine the consequences to Christmas Island and the marine environment, not to mention the safety of the crew, if no assistance had been available to that vessel. We may well have found ourselves in the situation of having to rely on our nearest neighbour, Indonesia, for assistance. The worldwide shipping task, as we appreciate, is growing at an exponential rate. In actual fact, there is at the moment a shortage of available shipping, which is placing additional costs on industry. We as a world are faced today with one of the most rapid expansions of economic activity that has occurred in world history. Just think about what is occurring in China and, potentially, what will occur in India in the immediate future. That expansion effectively means that we as a global community can expect more and more ships to be plying Australian waters in the course of international trade. The truth is that at the moment we cannot dig up enough iron ore and coal to supply the needs of China and other countries as immediately as they would desire. This is because of a lack of shipping capacity in the world at the moment. So, as we actually expand our export capacity, we are going to have more and more ships plying our waters, coupled with the fact that we are going to move into huge exports of gas in the foreseeable future to the Chinese market. It is an irony that worldwide improvements to ship safety and quality have also, correctly, seen the demand for salvage services decline over recent years. This is something that we should be grateful for but not complacent about. One shipping disaster could cost the Australian economy much more than the cost of subsidising shipping capability in key locations around our vast coastline. That is why the opposition actually argues that this investment by government, in association with industry, is an investment in our future. I suppose it is akin to the fact that industry should start to front up to the fact that investment in training of its work force is actually an investment in its future rather than a cost to industry that disadvantages industry from a cost point of view. I want to raise some other important issues today which I do not believe the government is giving sufficient attention to. They go to Australia’s maritime security, which was also raised in today’s debate by the member for Melbourne Ports. Perhaps the minister can respond to some of these issues in his reply to the debate this morning. I specifically refer to what we as the opposition believe is the failure of the government to provide an effective maritime security regime and the risks specifically associated with flag of convenience vessels to carry ammonium nitrate around the Australian coast. I was amazed to recently read in rural newspapers a proposal by the new Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to actually weaken the existing regulations concerning the sale and use of ammonium nitrate in Australia. It is a source used by terrorists to maximise damage, as has been experienced by a number of countries, including the United States, in recent years. We should also understand that part of this debate is a deliberate decision by the Howard government after March 1996 to open up much of the domestic shipping trade to foreign vessels through its abuse-dare I say absolute abuse-of cabotage provisions in the Navigation Act. In some ways, this might be new to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Perhaps a new broom can bring a new approach to actually accepting some responsibility by the Howard government for these issues. MAIN COMMITTEE I remind the House that these provisions require that Australian vessels only are to operate on our coast, but shippers can apply for permission to use another vessel if no suitable Australian ship is available. That effectively means that you can get a permit when there is no suitable ship available. That is pretty important because this is also about the employment and training of Australian seafarers. Under the Howard government, this system has been exploited by shippers. With absolute support from the department and the minister they are able to access cheap foreign vessels and avoid the use of Australian ships, to the detriment of Australian employment and economic activity. On that note, I also refer to the fact that a KPMG review of the government’s administration of coastal shipping licences and permits for foreign vessels found the system to be in a shambolic state. The review also found that one in six permits for foreign vessels were granted without a signed application and that inadequate financial controls mean that the government may be unaware of fraud, errors and other irregularities relating to permits. In June last year COAG agreed to a regulatory regime for ammonium nitrate which is designed to ensure accountability at all stages of the ammonium nitrate supply chain. The regulations require vessel identification, details of quantity and location of arrival for the importation of ammonium nitrate. The regulation of ammonium nitrate carried on foreign vessels around the Australian coast is of little value because the permit system that controls these foreign ships is fundamentally flawed. The record will show that the Howard government is allowing huge volumes of ammonium nitrate to be carried on a regular basis around the Australian coast by flag of convenience vessels with foreign crews and with little or no security. Let us go to the issue of these flag of convenience vessels. It is clear that the permit system that controls the operation of foreign flag of convenience ships is shambolic. This is important, and I hope the minister is going to start considering these issues. Flag of convenience ships are registered in tax havens such as Panama and Liberia, centres of terrorism activity. In addition our government, through its encouragement of the use of these vessels, is propping up tax evasion. These vessels are often subsidised by foreign governments and do not need to meet the same safety and environmental standards or working conditions as Australian vessels. So we are potentially encouraging terrorism activities, an undermining of our environmental standards and a weakening of training and employment opportunities in Australia, and we are permitting a loss of economic earnings for Australia. I believe that, in many cases, it is almost impossible to trace the beneficial owners of flags of convenience ships, and perhaps the minister would like to comment on this issue this morning. Can the minister give a guarantee that the beneficial owners of these flag of convenience vessels can be traced by his department? In that context it has also been suggested-and this is a fundamental question on which I am looking to the minister for an answer this morningthat these ships could well be owned by terrorist groups or other criminal groups. If this government is serious about our fight against terrorism, the minister has to answer these questions this morning. Can he give the Australian community a guarantee in terms of the shipment of ammonium nitrate in Australia that none of the beneficial owners of these flags of convenience ships are terrorist or other criminal groups? With respect to the foreign crewing of these ships in Australian waters, there is no intention or ability to bring these groups under the provisions of the maritime security act. In addition, there is little or no regulation of ships carrying high-consequence cargoes along the Australian MAIN COMMITTEE coastline, either for domestic or for international purposes. By way of example, on the day that the maritime security bill was introduced into the Australian parliament in September 2003, a foreign ship thought to be operating under a single-voyage permit and carrying over 10,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate as well as hundreds of tonnes of diesel was plying the Australian coastline. This ship had a crew totalling 20, made up of seven nationalities, including people from Indonesia, India, the Philippines, Ghana, Egypt, Turkey and the Maldives. Interestingly, some of those countries are potentially on the terrorism alert list, yet we had a ship carrying ammonium nitrate and diesel and plying the Australian coastline, crewed by people without proper border control permits, on the day that the Maritime Transport Security Bill was introduced into the parliament in September 2003. ment dismisses this as a minor problem. Conversely, if dangerous goods such as ammonium nitrate are carried in bulk on land transport in Australia they are regulated under dangerous goods legislation. The government has initiated a review of the carriage of high consequence cargo but, unfortunately, this does not appear to extend to its carriage by foreign flags of convenience ships. That is a huge gap in our armoury in the fight against terrorism. The department of transport revealed at Senate estimates hearings in May this year that in the period from 1 July 2004-when the maritime security regime came into effect-to 9 February this year, 10,800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate were carried on the Australian coastline by foreign ships operating under permits with foreign crews. I question whether the Australian government gave proper consideration to the background of these foreign crews on sensitive ships carrying ammonium nitrate, which in the ports of Sydney or Melbourne, for example, could do untold damage to the Australian community. Australian authorities have no way of properly checking the bona fides of these foreign crews. We see the government focusing-perhaps rightfully, because I am not able to access government advice on the deportation of a young American, and nor should I-on problems with respect to an individual. But I suggest to the House today that there are others on foreign ships, foreign crews, who pose potentially more serious problems in terms of character and potential terrorism activities and proper regard is not being had to that by the Australian government. I raise these issues because I have long been involved in the debate on transport security and, as the former shadow minister, I have also complimented the government on some of its endeavours on maritime and aviation security. But there are glaring holes that the minister has to deal with. Having said that-and I raise these criticisms in a proper way-I am pleased to see at least that the levy provided for in the bill applies uniformly to Australian and to foreign flagged vessels. That is a step forward. For a change, foreign vessels are going to have to start to pay their way. Nevertheless, the Howard government has spent nine long years undermining the Australian shipping industry by promoting the cheapest foreign flagships in the world to ply our coast without proper regard for their ownership or their crewing. Many of these ships operate well below the standards that we expect from our own local industry. These people are poorly treated and poorly paid. The ships themselves are poorly maintained and their environmental and safety standards are suboptimal. MAIN COMMITTEE",184,Protection Of The Sea Shipping Levy Amendment Bill 2005

225,Mr Martin Ferguson,"Yes, 10,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate-and the governThis is consistent, unfortunately, with the philosophy of the Howard government not to set the standard for the rest of the world but to join the rest of the world in a retreat to the lowest common denominator, a race to the bottom. It is akin to their approach to industrial relations in Australia at the moment. This approach is un-Australian. It is wrong in terms of industrial relations, racial and cultural tolerance, health and education, and all those associated issues. Nevertheless, I welcome the bill as a step forward. I call on the government to implement it properly and expeditiously and also to respond to some of the serious issues raised by opposition speakers in the course of this debate. The issues go to the use of foreign vessels, whether or not proper consideration is given to the character of the crews of foreign vessels in terms of border protection, and why we continue to have a glaring hole in our fight against terrorism by allowing the carriage of ammonium nitrate around the Australian coastline. I commend the bill and the second reading amendment to the House. Firstly, I thank the members who have contributed to this second reading debate on the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Amendment Bill 2005 and acknowledge, in spite of some of the rhetoric, that there seems to be unanimity that the bill should be supported. I thank the opposition for that support. BeforeI sum up on issues related to the bill, I should comment on what I think has been the main issue raised by opposition members-the carriage of ammonium nitrate around Australian ports. Frankly, some of the rhetoric we have heard clearly follows on the ill-fated visit of the Leader of the Opposition to Gladstone a few weeks ago and may have been more in place at a meeting of the Maritime Workers Union than somewhere where issues can be subjected to the light of the facts. The clear reality is that every ship seeking to enter an Australian port, including ships carrying ammonium nitrate, is subject to a security risk assessment process. We have a range of options for addressing security concerns about ships, including ultimately denying access to our waters or our ports. It is simply wrong to claim, as some speakers have, that there are no security checks on foreign seafarers coming into Australia or on foreign flagged freight vessels. Before ships even arrive in the country the Office of Transport Security undertakes a complete risk assessment of every ship, its cargo and its crew-including checking all the relevant alert lists. Those vessels are then subject to immigration checks to verify the crew information at the first port of call. Any ship identified as posing a serious security threatwhether because of the crew, the cargo or other factors-is simply not allowed entry into Australia. It is also wrong to claim, as some speakers have, that there are no safety regulations for the shipping of ammonium nitrate. Ships carrying this substance in Australian waters are subject to the safety regulations of the Navigation Act 1912. I briefly mention that ensuring that Australian shippers have access to internationally competitive shipping in the international trades is a priority for the government. Our shipping policy is a blend of providing shippers with access to competitive shipping to support the needs of exporters and a level of preference for the local shipping industry in the coastal trades. We are committed to enforcing higher standards of safety, security and environmental protection. It also needs to be pointed out that there is no evidence that a foreign flagged vessel taking cargo from one Australian port to another poses a greater threat than a foreign flagged vessel arriving directly from overseas. In fact, the risk would seem to be even lower. All ships, as I mentioned earlier, are required to report the details of their foreign crew at least 48 hours beMAIN COMMITTEE",187,Protection Of The Sea Shipping Levy Amendment Bill 2005
226,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Minister for Transport and Regional Services) (10.39 am)fore arriving in Australia. Crew members of security or immigration concern would be restricted on board the vessel or detained onshore. Foreign seafarers are not given unmonitored access to maritime security zones. This is a requirement in relevant ports’ security plans, and Customs officers undertake immigration checks on the arrival of vessels. In relation to the specific references to a vessel carrying 10,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate between a couple of Australian ports, I think members opposite need to think about what the alternatives would be to using shipping to transport a commodity of this nature. To move 10,000 tonnes between two Australian ports would require around 500 semitrailers. Would you prefer one ship or 500 semitrailers up and down our roads carrying a commodity like ammonium nitrate? Clearly, ammonium nitrate does have to be carried on the road and rail networks-certainly not close to the ports-because it is used largely in the mining and agricultural industries. So there is a transport task. It is a high-risk product and, for that reason, high levels of security have to be taken. But from an overall perspective, looking at the safest way to move this commodity around the countryside, as far as we are able, shipping offers a very good alternative. CanI also comment on remarks made by the member for Batman-who has now left the room-in relation to the audit that was undertaken of the coastal trading permit system in 2004. This was not some kind of process enforced upon the government because of allegations of inappropriate behaviour. It was in fact commissioned by the Department of Transport and Regional Services itself to help in the establishment of the new 24-hour operation centre within the department to effectively deal with the coastal trading permit system. The report was actually done in 2004, and it seems that it was about 12 months later that the opposition found out about it and tried to make something of the findings, all of which had been addressed. I do not think any of them were unexpected, and all had been addressed well and truly before the opposition sought to make an issue of this. The reality is that it is a dead issue. Identifying ways to improve the administration of the system was exactly what the department was looking for when it commissioned the review, and action has been taken to address the matters raised in the audit. We now have coastal trading permits being issued by the same group of people who undertake maritime security risk assessment and compliance checks for ships visiting Australian ports. Ships with coastal permits comply with the requirements of the maritime security legislation and regulations, and these new arrangements that are being put in place help to ensure that there is greater scrutiny of the matters associated with the issue of these permits. Finally, I turn to the bill at hand. As a result of a number of recent high-profile ship sourced pollution incidents overseas, the general public the world over has become more aware of the serious impacts a maritime incident can have on the environment and coastal communities and businesses. The costs of such incidents can and have run into hundreds of millions of dollars. For Australia, any such accident would be particularly serious because of the pristine nature of much of our marine environment. The existence of these risks is not something we can ignore or avoid. The government are constantly assessing the preventative measures we have in place and what more we can do to minimise or eliminate such risks. Shipping carries over 99 per cent of our international trade. It is vital that we maintain this lifeblood of our economy while also ensuring that we minimise the risks of one-off catastrophic incidents near our coast. MAIN COMMITTEE Ever since the release of the Neville committee report in 2004, we have been aware that our emergency towage response capability is being affected by changes in the salvage and port towage industry, creating the potential for significant gaps in our ability to respond to a maritime emergency to prevent major pollution from occurring. Let me say that I agree with the honourable member for Batman when he states that this is not just a Commonwealth responsibility; it is an issue where the states also have a key role to play, along with industry. Unfortunately, the states were not willing to make a financial contribution to the cost of this important task, so as a fall-back measure the Australian government and our state and territory counterparts agreed in principle that there needed to be measures to ensure that Australia’s emergency towage capability was adequate and that the funding to achieve this goal should be recovered from the shipping industry by a single national levy. This bill itself does not alter the levy rates. The actual rate of levy required can only be determined after a final decision on the national approach is taken. That decision, for the information of the honourable member for Batman, is expected later this year. Rather, this bill proposes a simple amendment. It removes the provision of a legislative cap on the levy rate in the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Act 1981. The removal will allow appropriate levy rates to be prescribed directly by the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Regulations, sufficient to meet the funding requirements of the emergency towage program as well as to provide for the recovery of any pollution clean-up costs that cannot be recovered directly from the relevant shipowner. I have already indicated, during a visit to North Queensland, that there will be tenders called soon for the provision of a suitable vessel in North Queensland to be available to undertake this important work, should an incident occur. The regulation-making process maintains sufficient safeguards to ensure that the levies paid by industry meet only the costs incurred for the emergency towage program and the national plan to combat pollution of the sea by oil and other hazardous and noxious substances. Any levy regulations will be subject to scrutiny and disallowance by the parliament. I am confident that these measures will be of great benefit to the Australian public, especially to the coastal communities, and will help us deal with any incident which might occur in the future. I thank members for their support of the legislation and commend it to the Main Committee. now read a second time.

Ms ROXON (Gellibrand) (10.51 am)-I am grateful for the opportunity to speak again on the report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the exposure draft of the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2005. I flag to those who are listening to or reading this speech at a later time that I have had an opportunity to write in detail a dissenting report on the decisions of the committee and, although I would like to discuss a number of issues that I have raised, I will not be going through each and every recommendation that I have referred to in my dissenting report. However, let me say that I think that the committee did a very good job in a very short time in dealing with a complex bill which is going to bring about significant change in the family law area. AlthoughI have strong concerns about a number of aspects of both the bill and the committee’s report, there are large numbers of provisions in the bill which were supported and recommended by the committee that I agree with and think will be positive changes to the way family law operates. In particular, I agree with the proposal that the children’s cases pilot, which is currently being undertaken in Family Court registries in New South Wales, should be extended to the rest of the community. I think everybody shares the view that the incredibly adversarial processes of the court are not always in the best interests of children and if there are new and better ways to run these cases that will result in less conflict then that will be of benefit to everybody. I have made those general comments and I have expressed in my dissenting report a number of concerns which I briefly summarise as being focused on violence and the way our current system handles allegations of violence in dealing with family law matters. The second area that I am increasingly concerned about is the concept of shared parenting and the way that that is proposed to be introduced into the law. Finally, I also have a concern that there are significant risks that a number of the proposals put forward by the government-which have been supported and sometimes amended by the recommendations of the committee-will actually increase and not decrease reliance on litigation. I think everybody in the House, across parties, is trying to make this an area that is less litigious rather than more litigious. However, we may have got ourselves into a position where, although that is the aim and ambition of many on both sides of the House, a number of the changes will not result in that outcome. I want to put on the record that I do not intend, today, to recanvass the issue of family relationship centres and the government’s proposals for handling that. I notice that the member for Wakefield is here and he will obviously play a role in the committee that the government has set up to oversee this. I have expressed my reservations and concern that this is politicising the process in a way that will be unhelpful for the community-and in the longer term for the government as well. I intend to focus on the provisions of the report and particularly the issue of shared parenting, because I have not had an opportunity to do that in the detail that I can go into today. MAIN COMMITTEE I would first like to focus on the issue of violence. I have expressed a concern that the cumulative impact of the changes in the bill and a number of the committee’s recommendations are not going to provide an improvement in the way that we handle circumstances and families that come before the court where violence is at issue. I am particularly concerned that a number of issues have not been dealt with at all by the bill or by the committee. Everyone knows of a problem within the system-the length of time that it takes for these matters to be dealt with, the way allegations are investigated, the way we ensure that children’s interests are put first and that families are not at risk if there are circumstances of violence in the family. I used as an example an issue on which I know the member for Wentworth has expressed disagreement with me. The committee looked at whether or not the definition of family violence should be altered-the existing definition has been there for a long time and is well understood and accepted by almost everybody-to deal with an apprehension of violence. The committee made a recommendation that a reasonable apprehension of violence would be a more appropriate test. As I have explained in my dissenting report, that is something that, superficially, sounds like it would be an improvement. We regard ourselves as reasonable people. We think that the test of reasonableness is a fair one. I know the member for Wentworth has said that he thinks that would be applied by a court in any case. In fact, that is not what happens in the family law area. There is a reason that the test is apprehension of violence rather than whether it is a reasonable apprehension, because it focuses on the fear that a person might have and that fear, whether reasonable or not, is one that can have a very real impact on people. I express my concerns not to disagree with the committee’s recommendation but to ask that, before the government make a change of this order, we actually get some experts in the field to give us advice about what such a change would mean. I know that the Attorney’s office has now been consulting with people in the community about this and other matters and has received from the Women’s Legal Service some comments about this particular recommendation, and that has been copied to me. But I trust and hope that the government is seeking much broader input on this. This is just one example of my concerns of recommendations which are well intended and sound sensible but have been adopted under a very tight time frame with very little proper advice and could actually have a damaging impact. In their submission to the committee, the Women’s Legal Service raised a concern that: There is a tendency to see family violence as a series of incidents, when in fact it is a pattern of behaviour that involves the use of violence as a tool of power and control. The quote continues: Victims of family violence learn to read the perpetrator of violence and know what is coming next. It may appear to an outsider that a specific incident should not reasonably cause the victim to fear for their safety, but her experience tells her otherwise. These are very real issues that we have to take account of, and, if we are going to change an existing provision, we need to make sure that it is an improvement, not something that risks actually making the system less sensitive to circumstances of violence. The Women’s Legal Service go on to say: Tests of ‘reasonableness’ have been demonstrated to operate in gendered ways, i.e. although expressed in gender neutral language, they often are interpreted as what the ‘reasonable man’ might think or, in this case, what might make him fear or be apprehensive about his safety. MAIN COMMITTEE Obviously the unfortunate reality of our community is that we need to look at making sure that women and children as well as men are safe in their family circumstances. They continue: Including a reasonable test would send a very unfortunate message to the community about the use of violence and experience of violence-that is, it is only a problem if it causes someone to ‘reasonably’ be in fear. I think this is interesting and of course true as a quote: Being a victim of family violence is not a reasonable situation and it should not be the victim who is required to respond reasonably to the violence. I put those quotes on the record because I have a number of specific recommendations and concerns that I have raised in the area of violence. The other issue that I particularly want to focus on is shared parenting. I would like to do this because I think that we talk a lot in this House about how strong communities grow out of strong families, whatever shape or size those families might be. As a society we need to look more closely at how we can support families in the face of social, economic and demographic changes, and this means we need to look at how we can support both intact families and those who have gone through separation. This is the context that I think has been lacking from the debate about shared parenting and the debate on the bill that was the topic of the committee’s report. The major changes of the past decades-the introduction of no-fault divorce, better support for parents, less stigma being attached to children born out of wedlock, women being permitted to continue to work in the Public Service after marriage and the rise of de facto relationships-came about largely as a result of feminism but also, I think, as the result of a less strict or religious approach to life and a growing tolerance within our community for a range of family ideals and structures. With this has come the increased participation of women in the work force and, although more slowly, the welcome and increased involvement of many more fathers in the care and development of their children. I have a vested interest in this. I am pleased that Michael has embraced wholeheartedly the idea of fatherhood, because in this job the care of our child, Rebecca, would be very much more difficult if he had not. The Sex Discrimination Commissioner has recently released a paper on the way that men and women share-or do not share-work and family responsibilities within the family. It is interesting that, with all the changes over the decades, the idea of shared parenting is getting currency. It has such a nice ring to it and it is such a positive-sounding idea. The natural reaction is to say that it is a good idea that all parents share the care of their children. But what I think is unfortunate-and I wish we could have a better debate on it-is that the concept is almost only ever raised in the context of family breakdown. It is a concept that has been promoted primarily by fathers who are seeking more involvement with their children after separation. It is a very important area and it is often a very fraught issue for these fathers. But I think the problem is even bigger. We as a community are not talking enough about shared parenting when families are still intact. We need to start talking about that. We need to start talking about shared parenting not only for those who have separated but perhaps also as a way to avoid separation. We need to look at supports for, and barriers to, shared parenting that go way beyond family law and the Family Court. I have used the recent example of the Industrial Relations Commission, but I think we can look at a whole range of other examples. The Industrial Relations Commission made access to maternity leave, paternity leave and MAIN COMMITTEE part-time work easier for workers and parents after the birth of a child. This was a great milestone in this debate. We should see these changes and ideas as part of the shared parenting debate and not think of them as being isolated to family law. We need to make more of these ideas and continue to make workplaces and working arrangements more family friendly. We need to be prepared to tackle head-on the barriers that face families when both parents try to work part time or the social impact if a dad takes time off to care for a sick child or even a break from the work force, as women have been doing for so many years. The member for Wentworth might even take on board the discussion about how family tax benefit works-there are payments if one parent stays home full time, but you cannot get those same benefits if both parents work part time. These sorts of things are part of a much broader debate that we need to have. They are barriers to people making a decision within their relationship that they will share equally or substantially in the care of their children. This issue becomes stark and contentious when we talk about how a family separates. This is where the committee’s report comes in. We were looking at changes to the family law system. Many of the changes are constructive, seeking to make the process of separation less adversarial and trying to make sure that the best interests of the children are put first. I believe, though, that other changes that seek to apply shared parenting to many families where there is very high conflict, and sometimes even violence, are difficult. The trend is that shared parenting is only being discussed as a family law matter and a family breakdown matter, when we should be looking at it as a much broader idea. We would then have a sense of balance in the debate, which inevitably we have not had so far. The bill and the committee’s recommendations do not indicate the broader debate and the balance that we should have in this system. It is an unsettling trend that the changes focus very much on the rights and demands of non-resident parents, and currently that is mostly the fathers, and leave many of the responsibilities and burdens on the resident parents-in most cases, the mothers. The problem, as I see it, is that we focus on what tests can be applied in family law matters and not on changes which could be brought about more broadly in the community that might have a positive impact on the ability of parents to truly share in the care of their children, even after separation. It is essential that we get these changes to the family law system right, and to do this we need to hear a whole range of views and opinions from the wider community. What difficulties do people face within the family law system? That is something that we have heard much about through a number of different reports, including the one that has just been presented. But what about other questions that should be asked more broadly in the community such as: what pressures are making it harder for people to maintain a work and family balance? All of these issues impact on the family unit. They impact on the way people participate in the wider community, and for some they have such a devastating impact that they lead to poverty, homelessness and much more. Unless these wider issues are debated, I fear that the real concept of shared parenting will not develop and will remain a blind spot in the community, let alone in the law. That is why these changes to family law need to encourage parents to put aside their differences in the best interests of their children. I see it as my job as a parliamentarian to help promote this idea more broadly in the community and to make sure that the legislation will help people look at the options of shared parenting. MAIN COMMITTEE I hope that, by touching on some of these issues, not just in the parliament but in other forums such as at Lions Clubs and elsewhere we are invited to speak, we might start a much wider conversation in the community about some of the challenges we face in getting truly shared parenting as an idea in the community. (Time expired) Karenina, said, ‘All happy families are the same, but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.’ That is a very good insight that I think hung heavily on all the members of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs as we considered the reference from the Attorney-General that produced the report on the exposure draft of the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2005. Divorce or family breakdown is a tragic business. Everybody sees divorce through the prism of their own experience. And they see it through the prism of their experience whether they have been divorced, are the child of divorced parents or, indeed, have had a perfectly happy family-a family that has not suffered breakdown. There is a tendency for people in that situation-too often, I think-to be a little too quick to judge others whose family relationships do break up. This is an area that needs the utmost compassion, understanding and care. It is probably the most emotional subject matter of any act of parliament. It is an act of parliament that affects people very differently to most other acts of parliament. The Family Law Act is a very large and complex piece of legislation. So, of course, is the income tax legislation-it is larger and more complex, one might say-but people deal with the income tax legislation through their advisers; they have no choice. The Family Law Act is a piece of legislation that citizens deal with directly and read themselves. And it is very important that it be a piece of legislation that is comprehensible and accessible. In many respects, the Family Law Act does not meet those requirements, and I think that is broadly recognised. There is always a tendency when legislation is amended to just add additional sections in the parts of the act where that subject matter was originally dealt with. That probably makes it easier for the practitioners. But, for somebody in an emotional situation of a family breakdown going to the law of Australia that deals with their rights and duties, to confront this complex document is really not good enough. Recommendation 49 of the report was that resources be allocated to enable a rewriting of the Family Law Act 1975 as soon as possible. That would be a very valuable step. Of all the acts of this parliament, this is one that should be comprehensible and accessible to the people. It should be expressed in clear language and not in legalese. The major focus of the Every picture tells a story report-the report of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs that the member for Riverina so ably chaired and upon which the member for Chifley so ably served-was for a presumption of shared parenting. That emerged in the legislation as a presumption of ‘joint parental responsibility’. That is in the new section 61DA. Probably the most noted recommendation of this committee, which as I said earlier was a committee that worked very well and was very ably chaired by the member for Fisher, was to change that language from ‘joint parental responsibility’ to ‘equal shared parental responsibility’. A lawyer-our committee is naturally full of lawyers-could say the two phrases basically mean the same thing, but it is a very different use of language for people who do not have a legal background. Equal shared responsibility means equal MAIN COMMITTEE",190,Protection Of The Sea Shipping Levy Amendment Bill 2005
228,Mr Turnbull (Wentworth) (11.06 Am),"Leo Tolstoy, in the first chapter of Annashared parental responsibility-it is very clear. What does joint parental responsibility mean? That is a more debatable issue. That was a very valuable recommendation and one that I commend strongly to the government. The member for Gellibrand said that we as a community and as a parliament should be talking about shared parental responsibility not just in the context of divorced and separated parents. I agree with her. I think there is an overemphasis in our allocation of resources in Australia to the breakdown of families versus the creation and the maintenance of families. We spend billions of dollars dealing with the consequences of family breakdown and the failure of marriage. I am not suggesting we should spend a penny less, but what do we spend promoting the institution of marriage? We know that our society is stronger if families are stronger. We know that children are best brought up in a home with both their parents. You do not have to have a particular moral, ethical or religious point of view-that is fact. Everyone from the most humanist to the most religious will agree on that. What are we doing to promote families? What are we doing to promote marriage? The answer, I am afraid to say, is that we are not doing enough. It is not easy. The member for Gellibrand said we should be promoting equal shared responsibility in the home so that husbands and wives-fathers and mothers-share the responsibility of looking after their children. That is a very worthy ideal, but it is hard to see how it can be legislated for. You cannot pass a law that says that husbands have to do the washing-up. Ms Hoare-That’s a shame. but it would have practical enforcement difficulties, notwithstanding that it would no doubt be a very well intentioned move. That is a vital issue, I believe, for us to reflect upon as we note this report. We are dealing with trying to ensure that the best interests of children are protected in the context of a marriage that has broken down. We have recommended family relationships centres-a very worthwhile recommendation, which the government is taking upso that there will be a compulsory effort at conciliation before it gets into court. Obviously, it is better if the parties can agree on arrangements without having to litigate. We all understand that, and I am very hopeful that this will work well, if common sense can prevail. Divorce is an occasion when common sense is not always readily available; there is a high degree of emotion. What are we doing to encourage and promote the idea that people would be better off working on their marriages and staying married? It is not easy to see how the parliament can legislate for that, but it is something we need to turn our minds to. Preserving marriage is as important-many would say more important-than dealing humanely, compassionately and practically with the consequences of marriages that have broken down. I want to deal now with the comments that the member for Gellibrand made about violence. In particular, the effect of the recommendation is that the definition of family violence, which is found in section 60D, would read: Family violence means conduct, whether actual or threatened, by a person towards, or towards the property of, a member of the person’s family that causes that or any other member of the person’s family reasonably to fear for, or to be reasonably apprehensive about, his or her personal well being or safety. Family violence is an enormously important issue in families, be they intact or separated, but it is also a very important legal concept in this legislation. For example, the presumption of MAIN COMMITTEE",195,Committees
229,Mr Turnbull,"Members opposite are thinking that might be a very good innovation,joint parental responsibility in section 61DA, which is the key recommendation of the whole inquiry-the keystone of that edifice-does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe a parent of the child or a person who lives with the parent of the child has engaged in abuse of the child or family violence. So the whole presumption can be swept away if there is family violence. Equally, in section 60I, which is another vital part of the recommendations, the compulsory visitation to the family relationship centre-the compulsory conciliation-does not apply if there has been, among other things, family violence. Family violence can exclude the operation of two of the key recommendations of the whole inquiry. So it is perfectly reasonable, if I may use that term, to look at the definition of family violence in the light of the many submissions that we received expressing concern about allegations of family violence being made for tactical reasons. We all understand that many allegations made in the Family Court are made for tactical reasons-as in every court; the Family Court is not unique. But this is a very important concept. It is important for this parliament to keep faith with the whole of the community and for the law to have integrity and credibility with the whole of the community. With respect to the member for Gellibrand-and I note she was the only member of the committee who dissented on this point-I do not regard it as being unusual or rash for the committee to recommend that a fear or apprehension of violence has to be one that is reasonably held. She stated in her remarks earlier that I had commented on her dissent unfavourably, and I would comment on it unfavourably again today. I believe that any judge acting responsibly would read into that definition of family violence an element of reasonableness. It would be unacceptable to deprive someone of the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility or to enable somebody to avoid going to the family relationships centre because a party had a completely unreasonable and unfounded apprehension of violence. With respect to the member for Gellibrand, I think the reason she was a lone voice on this point was that she was mistaken. Finally, I wish to speak about recommendation 4. This again is a very important recommendation. This recommends that section 65DAA, which currently requires-and in the current proposed drafting requires-in making a parenting order that the court considers that a child spend substantial time with each of the parents, instead provide that the court must consider that the child spend equal time with the parents. This should always be the starting point. Substantial time, as we heard, could mean anything from 50 per cent to five per cent. It is a concept that means anything-as I think one of the witnesses said, ‘Anything which is not insubstantial.’ (Time expired) cating that the work of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs was intense and drew on a considerable amount of goodwill from all members, and the report, I believe, is a substantial one. With respect to the member for Wentworth-a very fine legal mind, sadly wasted in industry, in circumstances where no doubt he now reflects on the fact that he needs a legal adviser to do his tax affairs and cannot rely on the Tax Pack as us lesser mortals are still capable of doing, but nonetheless his economic reward for that has been substantial and his parliamentary career, no doubt, will not be diminished by the fact he no longer practices in the law-his contributions were very valuable. However, I do not share his criticism of the member for Gellibrand. I think the member for Gellibrand approached the issues in MAIN COMMITTEE",196,Committees
230,Mr Kerr (Denison) (11.21 Am),"Firstly, may I join the member for Wentworth in indirelation to this inquiry with a slightly different philosophical starting point but I think she applied herself extraordinarily earnestly to the task that she undertook. In the note presented by the three Labor members in the report on the exposure draft of the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2005 we do draw parliament’s attention to the need to give some weight to issues that were not specifically within the focus of this inquiry-that is, the fact that we look almost exclusively at the responsibility of persons who have care and custody of children but we do not look at all at what would be a reciprocal obligation of persons who would wish to walk away from those responsibilities. The quite proper focus of this committee was to try and balance issues and to find a framework where essentially both parties are seeking to share responsibility for their child in a practical working way. One of the things that we did not look at is the very distressing circumstance, that all too often arises, where one parent is left with the whole burden of the responsibility of a child and the other partner walks away without wishing to exercise any responsibility. We do not have mechanisms in the Family Law Act to address that indifference to the responsibility of being a parent. The weight of these recommendations should not be dismissed, but the member for Gellibrand throws a salutary amount of cold water on our enthusiasm in that regard by pointing out that it is not always the case that separating parents are each, for proper reasons, seeking to maximise their access to their children. On some occasions some parents are actually actively seeking to avoid their responsibilities to the greatest possible degree. We do not go there in this report and that is a matter she draws attention to. However, I join with the member for Wentworth in saying that, on balance, I do agree with the way in which we have drafted the definition of ‘violence’ in relation to these matters, because it is a triggering event, to the exclusion of the normal path that will be required to be followed through the family relationship centres. We gave a lot of thought to how this trigger event should be designed. We have made recommendations that differ from the proposals that were contained in the bill. The bill contained provisions that would require an adjudication of whether or not violence had occurred before a matter would go into the stream and automatically go to the Family Court. In the minds of all of the members of the committee, that led to the prospect that that would itself create a trial before a trial, because no person against whom an accusation of violence is made who was seriously contesting an arrangement for care and control of the child could leave that matter uncontested. That would mean that the resources of the court would be deployed at that very early stage to determine the validity of those matters-often with insufficient materials and without the capacity to examine the matter fullywhere a finding made in relation to those matters might colour the whole subsequent proceedings. Rather than that, we recommended in paragraph 3.50 of the report: The Committee poses an alternative model for the operation of the exception. The Committee proposes that an exception to attendance at compulsory dispute resolution on the basis of family violence or abuse be available to an applicant upon the provision by the applicant of a sworn statement that the dispute is not suitable for family dispute resolution on the basis of family violence or abuse. The concomitant side of that, given that there would not be a preliminary determination, is that we recommended that there be serious consequences for making a false declaration of that kind. We made subsequent recommendations that, where a false allegation of abuse or family violence has been made knowingly, that that has very serious consequences. We think MAIN COMMITTEE that that balance will lead to a much more effective resolution of the way in which these extraordinarily difficult matters are normally streamed through the family relationship centres, where there are proper bases for an allegation of family violence or abuse to be made directly to the court. Let us not pretend that the recommendations that we have proposed, the amendments, the bill-or any other structure that could be proposed-is the end point of debate and discussion of these matters. There is no perfect solution that could commend itself to members of parliament or the community that is capable of finding ideal solutions to these highly contested matters. There is no model that will satisfy the range of different interests that legitimately impinge on a family in distress. People are often highly emotional, people are sometimes vindictive, people sometimes act unreasonably and yet are very much driven at depth often by the most noble of motives: the love for their child. Yet they manifest that from time to time in the most ignoble of ways. So there is not ever going to be a perfect set of recommendations. In looking at this legislation we had only a relatively short span of time, and we regretted that. Nonetheless there was an opportunity to have a wide range of public submissions considered by the committee, and the committee itself worked very hard to try to find practical and thoughtful recommendations to improve this legislation. Broadly, I think the community should be very pleased with the degree to which their representatives in this House worked, largely in a bipartisan way. I would think that such divisions as existed from time to time in this debate rarely reflected any partisan division; indeed, I think all of us joined at the end of the proceedings in congratulating the chair, Mr Peter Slipper, for the way in which he had conducted the inquiry. I want to draw attention to a couple of matters which have been less public in the debate relating to the recommendations, because inevitably in the presentation of this report only a few aspects will get significant public attention. One of the important side issues that came up in the discussions in our committee relates to circumstances where counselling or advice is given to persons in family relationship centres. There are provisions in the legislation which generally provide that, where a person is going to receive assistance through counselling or similar processes, what they say properly remains confidential between them and the counsellor. But that is not an absolute confidentiality, and it never has been. Yet the provisions related to that issue are headed that disclosure is not permitted, potentially giving a very misleading appreciation by those who are subject to counselling, and by counsellors themselves if they do not read the detail of the legislation, that disclosure would never be permitted or allowed. At recommendation 27, paragraph 3.135, the committee recommends that the measures be redrafted and divided into circumstances where disclosure would be required and those where it would be at the discretion of a practitioner, and of course the balance would be prohibited. So you would have three categories of disclosure: the routine matters that pass between counsellors and persons subject to counselling, which would never be disclosed to anybody; and serious matters which relate to matters ‘which may prevent or lessen a serious or imminent threat to the life or health of a person, or where the disclosure relates to the commission, or may prevent the likely commission, of an offence involving serious harm to a child’ would be obligatory. That brings it into line with the kind of mandatory reporting provisions that now apply in the health system, which I think are fair to apply in this area. MAIN COMMITTEE It will of course be seen by some as removing some of the discretionary elements, but I think the community at large would think that a counsellor who becomes aware of a matter which, if it were disclosed, might prevent or lessen a serious or imminent threat to the life or health of somebody, or which relates to the commission or likely commission of an offence involving serious harm to a child, would have an obligation to report. Making that clear helps both the counsellors and the people participating to understand precisely where they stand. In relation to the other matters listed already in the legislation as permitting disclosure, the committee recommends that they remain discretionary but that there should be a general presumption against disclosure and that it should be disclosed only on the basis that the counsellor forms the view that the interests of another person or persons substantially outweigh the private interests of the person making the communication. Because the list of permitted areas is relatively large, if you leave it to an unrestricted discretion it could potentially poison the ideal that these conversations are essentially confidential. So that before somebody discloses some of that material they would have to form the view that, although it falls within those descriptions, the public interest or the interests of other individuals substantially outweigh the private interest of confidentiality that is being protected. In that regard they are helpful recommendations which clarify and make quite explicit what we actually mean in relation to these provisions-what I would have hoped was done before but was left quite vague. There is a whole range of other recommendations which time will not permit us to travel over. Let me conclude with two points. Firstly, the report recommends further ongoing work in relation to a number of matters. Recommendation 13 suggests that there be a further inquiry to look at improving the effective protection of persons who are or may be victims of family violence-a very important matter-and a range of other matters. Do not think that the work has been done by the passage of this legislation. Lastly, I join the criticism of Labor members about the way family relationship centres are going to be established and the partisan way in which they have been allocated to a backbench committee of government members to determine priorities. It is an absurd political whack, after we have done a lot on a bipartisan basis, to then foul the nest by the minister’s announcement that these decisions, which may have significant electoral consequences, are not being made independently but being made by a backbench committee overwhelmingly made up of new members and members from the most marginal seats, who would not have been chosen for proper reasons but for political advantage. (Time expired) Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the exposure draft of the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill. There is probably nothing more divisive and time consuming for people than marriage breakdown. A stream of people are constantly coming into my office with concerns about family law, child custody arrangements, the Child Support Agency and a range of related areas. It is probably the most talked about affair in my office, and I do not believe that my office is any different from that of other members in Australia. When I first got elected I was invited to turn up and say a couple of words at a Child Support Agency forum that was being held in Darwin.

The committee as a whole worked very closely together and in a spirit of cooperation, although from looking at the report I understand that some people might not see this. saw the benefits in taking such an approach because of the seriousness of the issue and the fact that we all wanted to produce the best outcome in the interests of the community, in the interests of parents and, most importantly, in the interests of children involved. The committee rightly, I believe, took the attitude that the first obligation and the underlying objective was always to consider the best interests of children involved in marital breakdown. It is a very difficult area for legislators to work in because of the diversity of circumstances that constantly pop up and because a one-size-fits-all approach cannot be taken. However, I believe that the recommendations formulated by the committee address many of the current inadequacies in the legislation and, when implemented, will achieve what they are designed to achieve. The recommendation to more heavily scrutinise violence and sexual assault claims against former partners is, I believe, a positive move. There should always be some sort of presumption of innocence in the law and there have been circumstances in the past-and I do not think anybody denies this-where false claims have denied a parent the right to be involved in their child’s upbringing. One of the recommendations-and I believe it is well overdue-is that of providing more out-of-court mechanisms for resolving disputes instead of engaging in the long and often costly court battles that can arise from marriage breakdown. This will also lead to less acrimonious and far less costly separations. The establishment of family relationship centres will be a very positive move, bringing and enhancing professional skills and knowledge to local communities where they sometimes have not existed. They will help to resolve parental disputes. I am very happy that the Attorney-General has seen fit to look at putting a family relationship centre in my electorate of Solomon, based in Darwin. I think that is a great move by the government, and I fully support that decision. that they worked cooperatively together. I particularly want to thank the chairman for the excellent job that he did in making sure that everybody got their say and had input into how the report was formulated. I think the cooperative way the committee worked was a result of the chairman’s excellent management of the committee.

I am critical of the Attorney-General’s time frame for this very important inquiry which forced the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to report in seven weeks. Accordingly, I seriously question the motives of the Attorney-General to have our committee deal thoroughly with the exposure draft of the bill in such a ludicrously short time. I guess I should not be surprised when I am witnessing the Telstra privatisation bills being rammed through the parliament in a fire brigade environment this week, denying many members like me the opportunity to speak on these bills. Having got that off my chest, I draw attention to the statement by the Hon. Duncan Kerr SC, the Hon. Roger Price and me on page 223 of our report. There was a great volume of submissions, exhibits, correspondence and oral testimony put before the committee during the inquiry. One submission was forwarded to Mr Slipper, Chairman of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, on 28 July 2005 and, in my view, provides an honest and graphic insight into the plight of one loving father and the burden and frustration he now shoulders and shares with his new partner in his endeavour to secure substantially equal time with his two children who are in the custody of his former wife. The author of this submission is the new partner of a father who is a victim of the legislation as it now stands, and I intend to read this letter in its entirety to the parliament today. I trust the Attorney-General takes seriously the issues identified in this case when proposing future amendments to the draft bill before it is introduced into the House. The letter reads: Dear Mr Slipper… … … You may recall one interested observer in the Jubilee Room on Thursday 21 July at Parliament House, Sydney. At that time you had some time to spare and generously offered me the opportunity of making a submission to the Committee. With no preparation and inadequate knowledge of the Family Law Act 1975 or the proposed amendments I declined. However since that time. I have been continuing to read on the subject and attended meetings with parents so I am now forwarding to you some of my observations. FirstlyI come, not as a lawyer or a scholar in the area, but as a stakeholder who became involved as the partner of the father of two beautiful children caught in the middle of a terrible system. Additionally I have a number of friends who are single mothers and I have become aware of the plight of many separated fathers. Initially I tried to wade through the proposed amendments and although I realise that lawyers must address these issues I would like to point out that for self-represented parents there needs to be a simpler set of rules. I applaud Kay Hull’s statement that we need to have a lot more common sense introduced into this whole area and that we need to keep the lawyers only for the most difficult cases. During the hearing last week it seemed to me that a large proportion of the time focussed on the issue of family violence. Luckily this does not enter into our situation, or indeed the situations of most cases, so my comments apply to children in families where there is no violence or abuse present. MAIN COMMITTEE I was disturbed to learn that “equal shared parental responsibility” does not mean “equal time”. It seems absolutely unfair to say to people that they have the burden of equal responsibility but not share in equal rights. And by perpetuating outdated stereotypes we are destroying good fathers, and teaching boys, the fathers of the future, that they will not be as important to their children as the mothers will. I wonder what sort of society we are thereby creating. In our situation, equal, or substantially equal time, would have put some balance into the lives of the children. When the mother involves the children in the conflict on an almost daily basis they become indoctrinated. They believe that they should not love their father. And they know that they must not show any affection for their father in the sight of their mother. Because “contact” visits are weeks apart it takes some time with each visit for them to settle down and become less confused and anxious and the longer they spend with their father the more normal their behaviours become. Spending equal time would have prevented the alienation of the 11 year old son who decided that it was easier for him not to go to see his father so that he wouldn’t have to bear the brunt of his mother’s derogatory comments for the days leading up to the weekend and again on his return. Equal time would have prevented the mother moving to the outskirts of Sydney, without the knowledge of the father, making the mid-week afternoon “contact” impossible for a father who works in the city. Equal time would certainly have prevented her taking the children and “relocating” over 300 kilometres away, without the knowledge of the father, making full “contact” weekends impossible, fortnightly “contact” very difficult, and mid-term family functions virtually a thing of the past. And equal time would have prevented the mother from registering the children in her new partner’s name at the new private school in the country town. Allowing the children to “live with” one parent signals to that parent and the children that the decision making is his or hers. After all if the children live with you, you choose the doctor and the dentist; you encourage one sport or musical instrument above another; you counsel on subjects to be taken at school; the children sit with you at the school functions, at the end of year ballet concert or sporting fixtures and so on. In the mind of an insecure parent this “residence” is absolute power – power to control and manipulate – the children and most importantly the other parent. A parent wishing to demonise the other parent can project their own feelings onto the children and coerce them to have other plans, feel sick or straight out refuse to go with the other parent when he or she calls. A parent seeking to alienate the other parent can deny “contact” whenever he or she wishes. And the perception in the community is that the Family Court will not enforce the orders. Equal time would also allow “resident” mothers time for themselves to develop new relationships and most importantly the freedom to pursue paid work options and a career outside the home. The Government Response to Every picture tells a story recommends “both parents having a meaningful involvement” in the lives of their children “to the maximum extent possible”. Spending three hours with children at the bowling alley on Wednesday afternoon does not provide “meaningful involvement”. Even spending every second weekend and half school holidays with children does not mean that you are integral to their lives as it is completely artificial. In reality they “live with” their mother and “visit” their father. It’s almost as if every time they get to see their father the children are “on holiday” and it doesn’t have anything to do with normal living-that’s for Mum. “Meaningful involvement” for fathers surely means the same as it does for mothers-taking the kids to school, making sure they have their lunch, helping with homework, knowing what food your child likes and hates, teaching them to make a bed, cleaning up after your child’s been sick, sharing laughs as well as reading bedtime stories together. And you can’t even hope to be a good father if you don’t share the time. Fathers who want to be active fathers should not be deprived of the right or the responsibility. If fathers had a fair chance of seeing their children this would remove the major cause of discontentment with the Child Support Scheme. Fathers are primarily angry at having to pay when they don’t even get to see their children on a fair basis. A fairer time allocation would also alleviate the frustrations MAIN COMMITTEE faced by men in merely trying to see their children. This would in turn reduce some of the unacceptable behaviour displayed by some fathers and ultimately some of the entrenched conflict. When your wife leaves, sometimes for no apparent reason, it’s traumatic-you feel a failure. But when the children leave as well it’s very painful. The pain persists and is only relieved by being with the children again. At the very least a default minimum must be established so that parents don’t have to spend large sums of money just to arrive at this conclusion of a minimum or in some cases zero time with the children. Because his ex-wife kept relocating, my partner has spent upwards of $30,000 just trying to get the standard minimum contact provisions of alternate weekends and half school holidays and there have never been any objections to his character. Of course violence or child abuse would override any default minimum provision. It is also critical that any interim plans are set up on a basis that they are likely to remain in place. Creating interim orders where the children live with one parent sets up the expectation for both parent and children that this will continue. All of this change is hard enough on the children without living with one parent for a couple of months and then changing to another plan. The ideal would be that the parents start at the Family Relationship Centre while still living together to explore various parenting plans. I would also like to draw the committee’s attention to terminology that continues to augment the role of one parent over the other. The terms “live with” and “spend time with and communicate with” do not remove the inequality of the importance of both the parents in the equation. The same term must be used for both parents. We say that our child “lives with” us when she is with us and “lives with” her Mum when she is with her Mum. The official term should perhaps be “parenting time”. “Contact” and “spending time with” are such demeaning terms that inadvertently add to the pain of separation. In summary I urge the committee to create a system: Where children are able to spend equal, or substantially equal, time with each of their parents. This will Allow the children to develop in a balanced way and achieve their full potential Allow both parents to develop their own paid work options and reduce the reliance on welfare Allow both parents to develop new relationships Prevent both parents from moving away without making arrangements that take into account the views of both parents and the children Reduce the anger felt by frustrated parents and reduce the entrenched conflict Reduce the financial burden on a resident parent Increase awareness of costs for the payer parent Reduce the discontentment with the Child Support Scheme Where time and responsibility are shared immediately after separation on an interim basis until all details are finalised With a default minimum for “contact” for ordinary cases in the absence of violence or abuse, to prevent unnecessary court costs for parents when one will not agree Using the same terminology for both parents such as “parenting time” rather than “live with” versus “spend time with and communicate with” With strong enforcement measures for parents who contravene the parenting plans With a set of rules and likely outcomes of the Family Law system in plain English Thank you for your consideration … MAIN COMMITTEE I could not have put the case more succinctly than this submission has done. I urge the Attorney-General to give these matters serious consideration so that Australia gets better family law. government now seems to be using House committees to look into legislation and make inquiries into the sorts of matters which previously would have been the preserve of Senate committees. No doubt, there is still a role for Senate committees, but I want to commend the Attorney-General for using our committee. I was very pleased with the way our committee was able to work together. I have always operated on the basis that, wherever possible, House committees ought to be conducted in a bipartisan way. We all bring different talents. When one looks at the quality of some of the lawyers on our committee-and I exclude myself from that group-it is almost as though we have some of the most expensive legal minds on tap and ready to make a contribution to sorting out particularly complex aspects of any inquiry being undertaken. I would like to thank the members, who have been very generous in their praise of my chairmanship, but it was a cooperative effort. I believe this is a really important subject and I am pleased that we were able to achieve what one could describe as an almost unanimous support. There was only one dissenter, the honourable member for Gellibrand, and she was in a difficult position. She was a member of the committee and desired to contribute in that context, but, as shadow Attorney-General, she had other responsibilities. Members opposite have also referred to an expression of concern by the member for Denison. He was joined by his Labor colleagues in that expression of concern, but the matter raised did not relate to the terms of referencereport was almost unanimous, with only one dissenting person, and even the member for Gellibrand did not dissent on all points. The report is a strong and bipartisan report. I am hopeful that the government will accept the report in its entirety or almost in its entirety. Honourable members have pointed out that family law is one of the most challenging policy issues that parliamentarians deal with in our day-to-day interaction with the Australian public. While the committee considers that the best interests of the child must always remain the primary focus of all parenting decisions, we did recommend changes to the exposure draft to better reflect the recommendations of the former Joint Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs report Every picture tells a story, which were accepted by the government, to better facilitate the opportunity for both parents to contribute in their role as parents post separation. Consequently, the committee recommended the use of the term ‘equal shared parental responsibility’ rather than the term ‘joint parental responsibility’, which was in the exposure draft, to describe the presumption about the sharing of major decisions by both parents about a child. The committee also recommended-and this is a very important recommendation-that where there is an equal share of parental responsibility there should be an obligation on advisers and the court to consider specifically whether it is in the best interests of the child, and reasonably practicable, for the child to spend equal time, not just substantial time, with both parents. Some people consider this recommendation to be outside the terms of MAIN COMMITTEE",201,Committees

241,Mr Slipper,"and they would be the first to admit that it related to something else. Ourreference, but the committee does not agree. The recommendation does not introduce a presumption of fifty-fifty joint custody. Further on that point, we strongly believe that we took on board the matters that were raised by the Attorney-General when he sent us the terms of reference and that we observed those prohibitions very closely. The committee has sympathy with the submissions and witnesses expressing concern that the substantial time provision in the exposure draft may not operate to facilitate shared parenting. The committee notes that the paramount consideration in all parenting orders will remain the best interests of the child. If the committee’s recommendations are accepted by government, parenting orders will include, firstly, a presumption about the equal sharing of parental responsibility. This ensures that major long-term decisions about a child are made jointly. This presumption will not apply in cases involving family violence and abuse. Secondly, there will be an obligation where there is equal sharing of decisions that the court consider equal time as an option. This is only relevant if it is in the best interests of the child and reasonably practicable. The committee strongly rejected any suggestion that this introduced a presumption of fiftyfifty joint custody. A presumption of fifty-fifty joint custody would require a presumption that encompasses both parental responsibility and time. A presumption of equal shared parental responsibility, coupled with the recommended requirement that where that presumption applies the court must consider whether the option of reasonable time is in the best interests of the child and reasonably practicable, is clearly not the same thing. We were advantaged by having coopted to our committee for the purposes of this inquiry the honourable member for Mitchell and the honourable member for Chifley, both of whom served on the former House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. We have as a permanent member of the committee the honourable member for Riverina, who was the chair of that committee at the time it brought down its Every picture tells a story report. Those three members brought to us the corporate knowledge of the prior committee inquiry and what was intended when that committee handed down its report. That is why we very strongly support what is in our report, and we are hopeful that the government will look at that particular point favourably. The committee also recommended a number of changes to the part of the Family Law Act dealing with children to better focus on the paramountcy of the best interests of the child. The committee was of the view-and I think it is fairly obvious when you look at the Family Law Act-that the act has become increasingly complex and difficult to use. After all, it has been around now for close to a third of a century. The committee is also of the view that a complete rewriting of the act will be required at some time in the future. We hope that the Attorney General will be able to find the resources to allocate to this not minor task. We recommended addressing concerns that we heard about family violence and abuse and about the potential for false allegations of family violence and abuse to be made. Specifically, we recommended to the government that provision be made for family law courts to directly access reports about investigations into violence and abuse conducted by state and territory agencies, that a specific cost provision be made where a court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a person has knowingly made a false allegation and that a change be made to the definition of family violence to introduce an objective element by ensuring that the apprehension of harm is reasonable. MAIN COMMITTEE While examination of the family relationship centres was not part of the terms of reference, the committee is aware that the success of the proposed legislative changes is linked to the successful roll-out of some $400 million in services in the establishment of the family relationship centres, as announced as part of the 2005-06 Costello budget. The committee therefore recommended the development of accreditation standards for family relationship centres and for family dispute resolution practitioners as a matter of urgency, extension of the proposed community education campaign to accompany these reforms and close monitoring and evaluation of both the roll-out of the proposed family relationship centres and the impact of this legislation to ensure the positive introduction of these major legislative reforms. In his speech my good friend the honourable member for Lowe expressed some concern about the time frame the committee was given by the Attorney-General. Nobody would deny that it was a fairly quick inquiry. While I am not going to talk about Telstra in this speech, I see this issue as being quite different from the issue of Telstra. I think the time available was short because the Every picture tells a story report and the government response have been around for a while. The Attorney is particularly keen to pick up the ball and run and get the legislative changes into the House as soon as possible, and we certainly endeavoured to meet the time frame imposed. I believe that, even though the time frame was tight and the hearing program was somewhat arduous, the report that we have handed down is not detracted from by the fact that we had to do it quickly. I think it is a good report and, even if we had more time, while the report might have been easier to do, it would have been of no higher quality than this report, and I believe this report is of a particularly high quality indeed. The committee heard a diversity of strongly held views about the proposed changes contained in the government’s exposure draft. We endeavoured to consult widely. We sent letters to about 250 organisations and individuals with an interest in this issue and received some 88 submissions, 15 supplementary submissions and 36 exhibits. The committee held public hearings in Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra, including video links with a number of interstate witnesses. I want to comment briefly on the letter that the member for Lowe read to the Main Committee. That was a very moving expression of a point of view, and I am pleased that it is on the public record. While the tight reporting deadline meant that more extensive consultation was not possible, the committee is confident it did hear a broad cross-section of views on the exposure draft. As I said earlier, we were very pleased that some members of the former Family and Community Affairs Committee inquiry were able to participate in this inquiry, because those members have been involved in a very extensive consultation process which included contributions from over 2,000 people and extensive hearings across the country. I would like to thank all of those who have contributed to this process. There has been a very valuable opportunity to ensure that the findings of the former Family and Community Affairs Committee inquiry are better reflected in the legislation. While the committee makes some 59 recommendations, the committee concluded that the bill generally implements the government’s key reforms to family law which it announced in June 2005 in the government response to the Every picture tells a story report of the Family and Community Affairs Committee. The recommendations of the committee will strengthen the proposed bill in its implementation of the recommendations of the report. Many of our recommendations are of a minor and technical nature designed to improve the clarity of the MAIN COMMITTEE provisions, in particular for self-represented litigants. The committee considers that the proposed changes to the Family Law Act are of vital importance to ensure a focus on the best interests of the children in all decisions made post-separation. In line with the terms of reference, the committee considers the proposed changes will: create an opportunity for parents, where appropriate, to make post-separation parenting arrangements outside of the court system; recognise and promote the benefit to children of having both parents involved in their lives, even where they have separated; recognise the need to protect children from family violence and abuse; and ensure that the court system is less adversarial and is focused on the best interests of the child. There were a number of issues that arose during the inquiry that we did not have the capacity to address. In relation to these, the committee recommended a reference to an appropriate parliamentary committee to examine family violence, with particular reference to: measures that the Commonwealth may initiate on its own or with the cooperation of state and territory governments; longitudinal research into family violence, particularly the incidence of false allegations and false denials; and urgent introduction of a system of accreditation of children’s contact centres. The committee was particularly disturbed by evidence presented to iting to ask a question? duced into parliament? high level of effort is going into responding to our report. The legislation should be introduced into the parliament very soon. I was disappointed that a dissenting report has been lodged by the member for Gellibrand. A number of matters covered are clearly outside the terms of reference. In conclusion, I would like to thank the committee secretary, the secretariat and the administrative staff. (Time expired) have supported and endorsed the committee system in this place. It is a valuable tool in assisting the parliamentary process, particularly in its investigation of bills. With goodwill and hard work, a bipartisan result is often possible. This report is the result of the diligent work done by committee members and the secretariat. Unfortunately, I was unable to participate to the extent I would normally due to other commitments. I have now had time to consider the report and I endorse the recommendations. There is no doubt that the concept of the best interests of the child must underpin both the law and the letter of the law in dealing with family breakdowns and access. This is an extraordinarily difficult concept to put into practice for any number of reasons. The committee has obviously spent considerable time in attempting to deal with this in a manner which will be reflected in the legislation. More than that the practical recommendations are also a reflection of the effort by the committee to put a realistic framework around this idea and to provide the mediators, officials and courts with a realistic construct to use in dealing with this most difficult of circumstances.

248,Mr Melham (Banks) (12.10 Pm),"Since being elected to parliament 15 years ago ISpecifically, I draw the attention of the chamber to recommendations 4 and 5. Recommendation 4 states: The Committee recommends that section 65DAA be amended to provide that the court shall, in making parenting orders in situations where there is equally shared parental responsibility, consider whether equal time with both parents is in the best interests of the child and reasonably practicable. I particularly note the phrase ‘reasonably practicable’. Guidelines for the obligations on advisers propose that the adviser in his or her discussions with parents on the making of a parenting plan must: (a) inform them that, if the child spending substantial time with each of them is: (i) practicable; and (ii) in the best interests of the child; they could consider the option of an arrangement of that kind ... I am aware that some witnesses to the committee indicated a concern with this as if the obligation on an adviser to make the suggestion may imply some authority to accept that specific suggestion. Despite the best interests of the child, it may be that the emphasis could be on parents’ right to access to the child and not what is in the best interests of the child. It is important that the notion of the rights of the child supersede any perceived rights of the parents. I support recommendation 5 that subsection 63DA(2) be amended in addition to the other obligations so that the adviser is obliged to: inform parents that if the child spending ‘equal time’ with both parents is practicable and in the best interests of the child they should consider this option. I also draw members’ attention to chapter 3, which deals with conflict resolution outside the legal system. The bill provides that a family disputes process be utilised prior to a court hearing and application for order, with some exceptions. The explanatory memorandum states: This change will assist people to resolve family relationship issues outside the court system, which will have the benefits of providing flexible solutions, minimising conflict and avoiding costly court procedures. I particularly note the final reference to costly court procedures. In cases of dispute in relation to child custody, there is no doubt that tensions and passions can run very high. Often the dispute is running alongside adults coming to terms with the fact that their lives are changing substantially. At the same time, it is very easy to suggest that people go and get legal assistance. Very few people are entitled to legal aid these days, especially with ongoing government cutbacks. For many people on low to middle incomes, finding the $1,200 or so for an initial consultation with a solicitor is simply out of the question. Bear in mind that for most people, apart from the psychological upheavals in their lives, financial disruption is another side effect of family breakdown. Therefore many people are simply not in a position to access an umpire, with the cost of a solicitor for both parents. So it is no surprise that, by the time these matters reach the Family Court, tempers are frayed and parents and children are stressed as they try to reach an agreement without the benefit of professional expertise. I support the requirement that dispute resolution must be attempted before applying to the courts for parenting orders. I note the conclusion of the committee report that the success of this process: ... will depend largely on the successful implementation, staffing and resourcing of the new Family Relationship Centres and the maintenance of resources for existing family services. MAIN COMMITTEE At the same time, recommendation 21 notes that ‘exceptional circumstances may apply in certain cases’-for instance, on the basis of family violence and child abuse. I understand questions were asked during the committee hearings as to whether ‘reasonable grounds’ was the appropriate test for the court in making those exceptions. The Family Court of Australia in its submission referenced the High Court’s authority in Georgev Rockett when it stated: ... where a statute prescribes that there must be ‘reasonable grounds’ for a state of mind ... in a reasonable person. It is not necessary for the judicial officer to personally hold the relevant suspicion or belief but it must objectively appear to a reasonable person, and not merely the alleging party, that reasonable grounds exist ... Presumably, those grounds would have to be credible and sworn to. The committee considered the matter of the possibility of false allegations in order to satisfy the exceptions. The report notes that there will be disincentives to knowingly making false allegations, provided by the provision of penalties in the event that the court is satisfied on reasonable grounds that a false allegation has been made intentionally. Committee recommendation 21 states that exceptions to attendance at conflict resolution will be made on the basis of a sworn affidavit ‘asserting the existence of family violence or child abuse’. I would like to draw particular attention to the development of the concept of parenting plans. While not currently legally enforceable, parenting plans nonetheless do have the benefit of a written agreement, which will suffice in many cases. These can only assist the parents in reaching an agreement in a non-adversarial manner, without the need for legal intervention. I commend this concept endorsed by the committee. My final comments relate to recommendations 44, 45, 46, 47 and 48. It is worthwhile to note that these recommendations deal expressly with matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. Specifically, they recognise the need for consideration of kinship obligations and differences in child-rearing practices for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. The matters dealt with in these recommendations indicate that, as a parliament, we are moving to better understand the lifestyle, traditions and cultures of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I particularly commend recommendation 47, which seeks an examination of the term ‘relative’. This would be to consider whether, under Indigenous customary law, the definition within the bill should include explicit mention of relatives other than those currently contained in the legislation. I congratulate the committee members and staff on their work, and I commend this report to the House. port tabled in the House of Representatives on the exposure draft of the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2005. In rising to speak on this issue, I want to say that the term ‘shared parental responsibility bill’ outlines and defines exactly what the committee that I chaired found in our report entitled Every picture tells a story. What has now been supported by the report on the exposure draft of the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill is what the committee that brought down the report entitled Every picture tells a story agreed unanimously: that it was in the best interests of children that the committee recommend we create a clear presumption that can be rebutted in favour of equal shared parental responsibility as the first tier in post-separation decision making. In our Every picture tells a story report, recommendation 2 states: MAIN COMMITTEE",208,Committees

Part VII of the Family Law Act 1975 be amended to create a clear presumption against shared parental responsibility with respect to cases where there is entrenched conflict, family violence, substance abuse or established child abuse, including sexual abuse. In rising to support the tabling of the report on the exposure draft, I would like to come back to Every picture tells a story. It was a unanimous committee reportMrs Irwin-An excellent report. the committee as its deputy chair. Every member went to great lengths to overcome their own personal feelings and personal stance on issues to ensure that we looked at the best interests of the children. well. So, when we come to the legislative process of changing the Family Law Act, it is important-in fact, it is critical-that we go back to the Every picture tells a story report. This report is saying clearly that the concept of equally shared parental responsibility is supported by both the opposition and the government. And the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has come to agree on that as well. The Hon. Peter Slipper, who chaired this committee, did a crash course in family separation and breakdown and the emotive issues that surround all of the circumstances of families when parents are no longer able to live together but are still responsible for sharing the lives of their children for an indeterminate time. The report on the exposure draft that has been tabled in the House reflects the wishes and desires of the committee that deliberated on the Every picture tells a story report. I support equally shared parental responsibility and think it should be clearly included in the new Family Law Act. Myriad people have called me and expressed concern about this report and its recommendations because of what they might mean for people who are victims of domestic violence. CanI say that all the committees have looked at domestic violence as being one of the significant factors where a decision should never be made that would not be in the best interests of the child. Every committee member who contributed to Every picture tells a story and every member on the Slipper committee who contributed to the report on the exposure draft of the bill recognise the significance of family or domestic violence and sexual and mental abuse. Not one of us would ever legislate to put a child or a family in a position of being subjected to violence. However, having said that, we think that we have quite adequately coped with such incidents in our list of recommendations. In fact, domestic violence is a criminal law issue. That it is a facet of criminal law has to be taken on board by all parties who deal with domestic violence. Of great concern to me has been the indiscriminate use, or perhaps the emergence of indiscriminate use, of AVOs and DVOs. Domestic violence orders and apprehended violence orders have a place in our society, and their place is to try and protect those people who are being subjected to violence. It has become so commonplace to apply for an AVO or a DVO that I believe the law enforcers in the states basically say, ‘Here we go, another AVO.’ The problem is that people who MAIN COMMITTEE",210,Committees

252,Mrs Hull,"We did have very good witnesses. The member for Hinkler was a witness asneed protection are standing in line with some who may use this in a vexatious way. We do not support the vexatious use of AVOs, simply because it exposes legitimate sufferers of domestic violence to not being considered in the most efficient, effective and timely manner. That concern has always been raised with the committees as they have gone through this process. Every woman, every man and every child should be protected from family violence. There is no excuse for any child, any woman or any man being in a position whereby they are not considered seriously when there has been a report of domestic violence. When I became aware of the fact that some shelters and other groups were advising clients to apply for AVOs in order to remove a partner from the house to get established residence of children, I became very alarmed. If people out there are giving that advice, they are doing no favours to those genuine sufferers of domestic violence that we know exist. It is simply not acceptable to do such a thing. Nobody would ever agree that anybody who is in fear of domestic violence should be held back or should not be treated in the most timely, urgent manner because somebody is doing something that is not required in the first place. Both men’s groups and women’s groups have their positions. I do not take the position of either group. I do not take a position for men; I do not take a position against men. I do not take a position for women; I do not take a position against women. I do take a position for children in circumstances for which they have no responsibility. I think every member of the committee that handed down the report Every picture tells a story and every member of the committee who was responsible for reporting on the exposure draft of this bill would agree with that. So it is with great concern that I feel that at times we are using this circumstanceand families on both sides of this equation come to see me. When there is a dispute within a partnership, sometimes people get heated and do something that they have never done before-it might be raising their voice, shouting, using abusive terms et cetera. The police have always taken the stance that, if they are called to a place where there is a report of abuse, they will remove the male from the house. We then have the position that, because the male is seen to have left the house, to have left his place of abodenot because he has been removed from the house-he is considered to have walked out. An interim process then keeps him away from his family home, because he has been almost evicted from that family home. This happens time and again: the male might turn up to mum and dad’s house with a small bag, if that, because there has been a blazing verbal row-there have probably been abusive comments made by both parties to the argument-and it got so heated that somebody called the police. The police have removed him from the house in order to settle things down and he goes off to mum’s place or a mate’s place. It is then recognised that he left the marital home and it is very difficult for him to get back in. I do not think that is a fair position at all. I think the committee, in trying to communicate through this report the very real issues it came across, has come up with the best list of recommendations. In the issue of men not taking responsibility for their children, no greater insult or offence is caused to children than the situation where a father (a) does not take responsibility for their child-he might go to any lengths to ensure that they do not meet the financial upkeep of their child-or (b) does not make himself known to the child as far as parental responsibility goes. There is no excuse for either of those actions. There is also no excuse for a mother to be terribly hurt and bruised emotionally and mentally-not physically perhaps but have difficulty MAIN COMMITTEE with the circumstances in their lives-and withhold involvement from a father who wants to be in their children’s lives. I have been abused by the best over this report and I have been abused by the best over the last report. I am almost bullet-proof, but we were given a task to do and we carried out that task to the best of our ability. We have looked at the domestic violence issues confronting women. We do not concur with domestic violence and the criminal courts should come down hard on anybody who perpetrates domestic violence on a woman or a man in a relationshipbecause it is not just an act perpetrated on women. We say the criminal courts should slam down hard on domestic violence. We also say that if there is no domestic violence then children should have the right to have the love and attention of both parents in the most responsible way. You may not be partners in a household, you may have differences that can never be overcome and you may have to separate for whatever reason-and, goodness knows, there were thousands of reasons given as to why people separated; sometimes you could not understand the reasons, and they were personal reasons-but, if you cannot live in the same house and under the same roof and raise the children together, if you cannot be partners for life, there has to be a recognition that you are parents for life. You are responsible for your child’s clear and concise understanding that their mother and their father love them regardless of whether or not they are living in the house and that you are going to put your differences aside to the best of your ability in the best interests of the children. I will get another 10, 20, 30 or 100 abusive calls and emails about my speech in the Main Committee today, but I rest easy because we have done the best we possibly can. This has been the first opportunity we have had to restore proper intent to the Family Law Act that gives a right to both parents, all circumstances being equal. The right of the child is for both parents to ensure that they are loved. Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the exposure draft of the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2005. I acknowledge the presence of the member for Riverina, who has just spoken, who is a member of this committee but also was the Chair of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs who produced the report Every picture tells a story, and also the deputy chair of that committee, the honourable member for Fowler. At the outset I wish to place on record my appreciation of the honourable member for Fisher, the chair of this committee, and the permanent members of the committee for the generosity and kindness they extended both to me and the member for Mitchell as participating members in this inquiry. I have to be frank and say that it was hoped that either the honourable member for Fowler or even the honourable member for Throsby on our side might have participated in my stead, but I regret to say that, notwithstanding their desire and their willingness to do so, they were unable to and the committee got me as a third prize. I have supported all of the recommendations in the committee’s report. Attorney-Generals on both sides have had a good record of referring draft legislation to this committee. It is a practice that I think should continue and one which should be, and can be, extended to other committees. I have made public reference in the House to the fact that all members were provided with a marked-up copy of the legislation-that is, the legislation showed the clauses in the current Family Law Act that were proposed to be deleted and those that were being added. MAIN COMMITTEE",211,Committees
253,Mr Price (Chifley) (12.33 Pm),"It is a pleasure to enter the debate on the report by theI am not sure how we could ever have done a good job without it and I sincerely thank the Attorney-General. This actually prompted an interest as to why-particularly when major bills are before the House-all members cannot be provided with marked-up copies of legislation. I am embarrassed to say that I was not aware that there was a practice of having so-called black bills, which is the very thing that I am referring to. In fact, this government has not provided one black bill for members of parliament to consider legislation. Ironically, the last time a black bill was produced was back in 1989 and it was on child support. I hope that members will take note of the great utility for this committee in having that marked-up copy from the Attorney-General. Other members of parliament, when considering legislation, may be interested in having-not for every bill, or even most bills, but certainly for the significant bills that radically change legislation-either a black bill or a marked-up copy, as this committee was privileged to receive. There are many things that I would like to say about this report but time prevents me from doing so. Therefore, I will devote my attention to just a few areas. One of the most difficult issues in family law is domestic violence. The member for Riverina made some remarks about that. There are too many instances of gross domestic violence-if I can put it that wayusually perpetrated upon a woman. To my mind, and in their experience, the system as it currently operates provides inadequate protection. In fact, under the laws of most states two instances of physical abuse are required before the system swings into action. That is not a situation that any member of parliament can be comfortable about. However, there are cases, particularly in family law, where there are allegations of domestic violence that have more to do with the break-up of a relationship or a marriage than any real criminal activity. It appears that the current system will continue. I am very pleased that this committee has taken a stand, particularly in recommendations 12 and 13, and has proposed that there be a comprehensive inquiry into domestic violence. I will not repeat the precise wording of the recommendation. In fact, there was a view in the committee that it would be an excellent idea if two committees which have established their reputations by the work that they have done were jointly responsible for such an inquiry. I refer of course to the committee on which the member for Fowler currently serves as deputy chair-that is, the Family and Human Services Committee-and the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, which for many years has had a fine reputation. Would it not be a really good thing to have a committee skilled in the law, in law enforcement, looking at the issue together with one that is looking at the social impacts and impact on individuals? Unfortunately-I notice that our learned Deputy Clerk is at the table-there are no provisions in the standing orders that facilitate such a joint inquiry. As a member of the Privileges Committee, I must say that it is not something I have thought about previously, although we have devoted much attention to the operation of committees. I think the parliament would be well served if we were to consider what was originally the intent of this committee for a joint inquiry. It is not an inquiry in which we would play politics, it is not an inquiry with predetermined outcomes, it is not an inquiry where just one level of government would be solely responsible for processes and outcomes; it would be a great opportunity to work cooperatively and constructively, as parliamentary committees often have a reputation for doing, and looking at how different levels of government interconnect and operate, getting MAIN COMMITTEE better outcomes, most importantly, for the people we seek to serve. I honestly believe that all the issues around domestic violence-much like family law or child support-are being put in the too-hard basket and people are not prepared to confront what needs to be confronted. Forgive me for saying that I hope the government, in its response to this report, will pick up the recommendation. In no way do I wish to denigrate the concept of family relationships centres, but one of the key thoughts of the original committee was that there needs to be an enforcement mechanism, that there needs to be an opportunity for redress to accommodate not only a change of circumstances but more particularly where access orders were not being carried out. The committee recommended a tribunal. I looked up the Hansard record and found that I am a most unsuccessful member of this parliament, that I have been talking about family tribunals for nine years. In this instance, I must say the committee’s recommendations about the tribunal were rejected by the government as being outside these terms of reference. I think that is a pity. What really killed it in a way was a magical figure of some $600 billion in costs for the tribunal as recommended by the committee. I have always believed that this was an outrageous and wildly exaggerated figure. I am, most unkindly, going to accuse the Attorney-General or his officers of floating that with the media. It did have its effect-it killed off a tribunal. The key element of the tribunal was this: I will not say that lawyers or solicitors and barristers were barred but they needed to seek leave of the tribunal to appear. Therefore, they were effectively going to be free of the legal profession. One of the things I have never understood about family law is that more than any other profession we entrust the lawyers to deal with matters. It is as though we have never migrated from the concept of marriage as being one of contract law involving goods and chattels. Indeed, in that situation lawyers are probably the perfect people to have arbitrating. But, when people go through difficulties and challenges in raising their children, they do not go to the family solicitor and ask, ‘What’s our next step?’ If they have difficulty about a child’s progress in a school, they do not rush off to the solicitor and say, ‘What is the next step?’ but when people are having difficulty in relationships, by and large under our family law system we demand that they go to solicitors. We are offering those who have broken up an alternative-that is, the family relationships centres or an approved practitioner-and we are demanding that they take it up. I could go into that, but I invite people-not in a condescending way-to read the report. We are insisting that they do that and that they develop their family plans. But I keep on saying that you need an enforcement mechanism-I sincerely believe that. The committee at the time had legal advice that the tribunal was perfectly constitutional and would avoid the Brandy case limitations in its operations, so why am I so anxious about it? In a sense this report and the change legislation are trying to develop a better climate for those who will, in the future, suffer relationship or family breakdown where children are involved-a very worthy aim. But there are about one million children, if I am not incorrect, who are suffering as a result of being in a family that has already broken down. As every member of this parliament knows, in terms of access the system is not working well. There are many cases where it is not working well and where parents, and often grandparents, have exhausted themselves financially before the courts and still have no redress. It is an issue we need to revisit. I will sum up on a couple of points. I support the recommendations and I think the committee has brought down a good report. I have talked about two aspects of the report. I certainly MAIN COMMITTEE want to one day stand in this parliament and say, in an unconstrained and unqualified waywhatever the government; whether it is this government or a future government that may not be of the same persuasion-that we have totally tried to tackle every challenging issue in this family law child support and counselling area and that I can find no criticism that we have not covered it completely or done our best. It is true that it requires a great deal of bipartisan support to get changes through the parliament, even notwithstanding the government’s majority. Bipartisanship is the way-this ought not be an area for politics. But, even if we have been so miraculous as to get everything right, we should never hesitate to review what we have done, whether that is in pre-marriage counselling, child support or family law. We should never be frightened to review and ask: ‘Is this working as it was intended? Has something changed out there in the community?’ It is not a disgrace to review matters and it is not a disgrace to change things. I hope we will both be in this parliament, Mr Deputy Speaker, when I get up and make that speech. I commend the report. the report on the exposure draft of the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2005. I would like to speak on a number of areas covered by the report-in particular, equal-shared parenting, family violence and the family relationships centres. BeforeI do so, I want to say that I welcome the bipartisan approach to family law-I think it is an area where, if we are going to support our families, we need that to continue. I want to place on record some background on the task force that is looking at the family relationships centres. Concern has been expressed by members opposite, today and previously, about the role and motivation of members of the task force. The motivations are actually well known. I refer to an article by Stephanie Peatling that appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald on 7 June. It says: Liberal backbenchers concerned that the Federal Government’s new Family Relationship Centres will be seen as “crisis centres” for fractious couples have formed an informal policy committee to try to expand the role of the centres. That role is very much where we are at. We seek to make sure that these family relationship centres and the supporting family relationship program have an equal, if not greater, weighting towards promoting healthy and functional families in our community-rather than waiting until they have fallen off the edge of a relational cliff. If these family relationship centres are seen as just a divorce shop, we will have failed Australian families. NeitherI nor any other member of the task force has a role in selecting the locations of these centres or in choosing providers. In fact, as a member with a marginal seat, politically speaking there are other things I could far better be doing with my time than being involved with this. But as somebody who is passionate to see stronger and functional family relationships in Australia, I am compelled to get involved in the most effective way that I can. To come back to the bill, I would like to speak on three areas. The first area is covered predominantly by recommendations 1, 3 and 4, which deal with shared parenting. I would like to discuss this in the context of the bill but also in the context of the broader community-the 90-odd per cent of Australian families with dependent children where both biological parents are still present. They, surely, deserve our attention as well as those who are in the unfortunate circumstances of having separated. MAIN COMMITTEE",213,Committees
254,Mr Fawcett (Wakefield) (12.48 Pm),"TodayI rise to support the recommendations inIn recommendation 1, the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs recommends that, to be consistent with the recommendations of the former Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, all references to ‘joint parental responsibility’ should be replaced with the term ‘equal shared parental responsibility’. In recommendation 3, it suggests the deletion of a note which would imply that there is no reason to have equal time. And recommendation 4 means that parenting orders should consider whether equal time with both parents is in the best interests of the child and reasonably practical. In the context of this report, I do not think there is a member of this House who would not realise the significance of this whole area for people who have separated. It is the cause of much anger and much litigation. It is the cause of much debate about parents’ rights versus the best interests of the child and versus children’s rights. Much attention and many resources are devoted to treating the outcomes, but very little is devoted to identifying and treating the causes. Why does it give rise to so much anger and feeling? Why must it be resolved? It is fairly well known that there is a realisation of loss-that the parent who now does not have regular access, probably in some cases for the first time, realises just how much they have lost. There are feelings of hurt, anger and resentment. There is also a need. Children need both parents. Many studies highlight the benefits of the involvement of both parents. The mother and father are not just an additional pair of hands; they bring a completely different set of behaviours into the home. The facts are out there about absent parents, particularly absent fathers-covering child abuse, crime, drug and alcohol abuse, educational outcomes, emotional and behavioural problems, physical health, poverty and sexual activity. It is particularly the case for daughters where the father is absent. There is a whole range of facts as to why we should address this to make sure that both parents have the opportunity to be involved in their children’s lives, partly for the sake of the parents but predominantly because of the outcomes for the child. Most importantly, I wish to highlight that the best way for a child to achieve the best outcomes is if the parents equally share the investment of their parenting time when they are an intact family. Sadly, the effect of dealing with the crises that occur from separation is that most of the attention and resources go to post-separation cases. We can no longer afford this neglect of our families. That is something that I will address further. The second area I wish to touch on briefly is recommendation 13, which deals with family violence. It looks at a number of areas of family violence, but in particular the fourth point looks at assessing the effectiveness of initiatives in public education, prevention and rehabilitation. That is a really important aspect. I strongly support it. Nobody should accept or condone family violence, whether it be by men to women, women to men or either parent to the child. But family violence is a significant cause of concern in relational difficulties. There is the fear of violence, whether that is experienced violence or just threatened violence in the home, and, post separation, there is the frustration at the vexatious claims of violence that occur in the system. Programs to address domestic violence are starting. In South Australia at the moment there are some good programs being broadcast on TV which are highlighting what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. But there appears to be very little being done to ask why some men and women resort to violence as a way of expressing themselves in their relationships. I beMAIN COMMITTEE lieve that there is a lot to be done, which brings me to the third point, recommendations 56 and 58, dealing with the proposed family relationship centres and education programs. I think this is the key to actually achieving a change not only in the circumstances facing families post separation but, importantly, in the health and well-being of families while they are intact. The family relationship initiative has the potential to be a key part of the solution to equal shared parenting both in marriage and if a couple separates. It can also play a part in reducing the factors that lead to violence in the home. As I have stated, the best interests of the child require that that child be brought up by a mother and a father who themselves are in a functional relationship which, even if not perfect, is characterised by love and respect for all family members. We should be focusing effort not only on helping people to achieve this post separation but also in the marriage, because in this way the chances of a marriage surviving are increased and the issues post separation, if that occurs, are likely to be less traumatic. One parent, however, is increasingly absent most commonly in today’s society-that is the dad. This absence can occur while the marriage is intact as well as post separation. While the marriage is intact this can be due to the pressures of work, poor relationship skills or simply a lack of awareness about the part that their role as a parent should be playing, and that often stems from poor role modelling from their own parents or family of origin. Post separation there is even less ability to be involved in a meaningful way. Some biological fathers choose not to be involved, for valid reasons, but some simply desert their children. Some are prevented from spending time with their children through circumstances but, all too frequently, some dads are prevented by court orders from meaningful involvement in their children’s lives. There was an article in the Australian last week talking about ‘Disney dads’ and the fact that a real relationship requires the mundane involvement as well as the holiday. There is a lot of research talking about the benefits of both parents being involved, but that involvement needs to be across a whole range of activities, not only the exciting times but also the hard times. Members opposite have spoken today about the roles in which parents-dads and mums-need to be involved, whether it is cleaning up after a child has been crook or helping them with homework; it is about doing the mundane things as well as the exciting things. Unfortunately, that is not the case for many men, also those who live at home. Psychologist Ross Campbell highlights that it often is not the case because of a lack of desire or want on the part of the father but because their life skills, perhaps their communication skills, their role modelling about how to communicate or how to show respect or love to their spouse and the children are absent. He recounts stories of fathers who are shattered when their family falls apart or when a child goes off and starts getting involved in a range of things that they never thought could be possible. The feedback from the child or the spouse is, ‘You may have thought that, you may have felt that, but you never showed it.’ By not supporting our fathers, by not helping to build a fence before they reach the edge of a relational cliff, we are doing families a great disservice. So what can be done? I believe that recommendations 56 and 58 point to the answer, which is part of the reason that I am involved with the family relationship centres: I believe that we need to make a significant investment in education and awareness. I say awareness because people need to know. Smoking as have helped people understand the costs involved and the damage that smoking does to people, and that brings about an attitudinal change. People need MAIN COMMITTEE to be aware of the role they have in relationships, the need to improve their skills. We all accept that Lleyton Hewitt has a tennis coach, even though he is one of the best players in the world; but most men would say that they do not need any help, thanks very much, with their relationships. The fact is that most of us do. We need to increase opportunities and incentives for involvement in relationship education and we need to increase the funding that we put into increasing communication skills and conflict resolution skills. Those are the things that will also help reduce domestic violence, which often comes from the frustration that builds in relationships. Coupled with the other initiatives, such as encouraging workers and their employers to negotiate more flexible work practices that allow for better balance of family and work life, the proposed family relationship centres and the supporting educational awareness programs can make a difference. I point out that what is required is not just a change of circumstances but a change of heart, a change of attitude. I, along with other parents, live in a changing world where the pressures of work and other responsibilities impact on the time available to spend with my spouse and children. Many couples living under these pressures still have a good relationship and substantially share in the lives of their children. To achieve this, however, requires an awareness of the risks, a motivation to overcome the difficulties and the life skills to do so. I support the report’s call for equal parenting responsibility, both in the context of separations and in the context of intact families; reduced domestic violence; the roll-out of the family relationships centres and the educational program that goes with that; and the review to look at its effectiveness. But I do this in a context of saying that there needs to be significant investment in support for Australian families which sees a change of attitude towards how intact families work as well helping those families who need it post separation. I commend the report to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Broadbent) adjourned. Main Committee adjourned at 1.02 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Asylum Seekers (Question No. 746) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 9 March 2005: (1) When does the department expect that the final decision will be made on permanent protection for asylum seekers who landed by boat in 2001. (2) If an asylum seeker’s claim is rejected, does he or she have a right to apply to the Refugee Review Tribunal for review; if so, what is the estimated cost of such a review. (3) Where the review process concurs with the original decision, what right of appeal is there to the (a) Federal Court and (b) High Court and what is the estimated cost of an appeal. (4) At what stage in the appeal process will the applicant (a) become ineligible for Medicare benefits and (b) lose permission to work. (5) At what stage in the appeal process is an applicant detained. Mr John Cobb-The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Department expects that Temporary Protection Visa (TPV) holders who landed in Australia by boat in 2001, who had made a further protection visa application by 17 June 2005 (and held their TPV for 30 months at that time) will receive a departmental decision on their application by 31 October 2005. All other TPV holders who have applied for a further protection visa will receive a departmental decision 90 days after they have held their TPV for 30 months or the date of application (which ever is the later) as they are then able to access a permanent protection visa. Exceptions will be where there are delays beyond the Department’s control, such as security and character clearances. A final decision for those people whom the Department refuses a further protection visa will depend on the timing of outcome of any merits review by the Refugee Review Tribunal, and any subsequent litigation, if pursued. (2) Yes. All onshore asylum seekers have a right to seek review at the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT). RRT and Departmental management systems do not disaggregate review processing costs for further applications for protection visas by Temporary Protection Visa (TPV) and Temporary Humanitarian Visa (THV) holders from the review processing costs of other tribunal reviews. (3) (a) and (b) Where the RRT affirms the decision of a primary decision maker, the applicant may seek judicial review in the Federal Court, the Federal Magistrates Court, or the High Court in its original jurisdiction. If the applicant is unsuccessful before the Federal Court or Federal Magistrates Court, they have a right of appeal to the Full Federal Court. If the applicant is unsuccessful before the Full Federal Court they may apply to the High Court for special leave to appeal. On average, the expected cost to the Department in defending an application for judicial review filed in the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court is approximately $6000. The expected cost to the Department in defending an application for judicial review filed in the High Court is $4,175 (based on average figures for all High Court cases in the 2004-05 financial year). (4) (a) and (b) Temporary Protection Visa (TPV) and Temporary Humanitarian Visa (THV) holders retain work rights and Medicare access until the final resolution of their application for further protection at merits review. For those granted a further protection visa, work rights and Medicare access will continue for the term of that visa, which in many cases will be a permanent protection visa. Those whose application for a further protection visa is refused can access an 18 month Return Pending Visa which will continue work rights and Medicare access while the individuals make plans to leave Australia or pursue mainstream visa avenues to remain in Australia. (5) Applicants for further protection remain lawfully in the community throughout the merits review process. If unsuccessful at review they can access an 18 month Return Pending Visa and also apply for a range of mainstream visas during this period. If litigating or have not departed for other reasons at the end of that period, they may be able to access bridging visa arrangements under the Migration legislation.

In addition, Bearcage Productions will provide post production support and language conversion options.

The aim of the corporate video/s is to communicate a range of information and training services to target audiences, including corporations in remote areas.

A key strategy underpinning the development of the corporate video/s is to showcase Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander boards, members and key staff communicating good corporate governance messages and practices, and the services ORAC provides, to other Indigenous peoples and corporations in a visual format using the language most suited to the target audiences.

In this email, distributed on Monday 18 July, the Secretary said: There is one other key message I want to pass on to you here and now, right at the beginning of my time heading the Department. And that goes to the importance of reassuring ourselves that our actions are lawful. It is the one absolute requirement in a complex decision-making environment… If any of you ever believe that we have not acted lawfully in reaching a decision, in relation to visas or other applications, or in detaining a person or in removing them from Australia, you must personally inform your Overseas Post Manager, State or Territory Director or Branch Head in Central Office immediately. They in turn must obtain legal advice and, as appropriate, advise both the Minister’s office and myself or the relevant Deputy Secretary, and take personal responsibility for properly resolving the situations. I cannot stress this requirement too highly. The Secretary has subsequently followed up this email with other all staff communications, outlining the same key message.
