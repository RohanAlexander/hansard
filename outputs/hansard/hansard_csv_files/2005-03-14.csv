206,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) The F3 was formerly part of the National Highway and is now part of the AusLink National Network. States and Territories have been required to report annually on a range of measures relating to their National Highway roads as a condition of receiving Australian Government maintenance funding. In the future they will be similarly required to report on their AusLink Network roads as a condition of receiving Australian Government maintenance funding. (2) In 2004-05 the Australian Government is providing funding to each State and Territory for the maintenance of the former National Highway system (of which the F3 forms part) on a formula which is based on road lengths and vehicle usage. From 2005-06 the Australian Government will contribute towards maintenance funding for the AusLink National Network, which includes the former National Highway. Funds will be apportioned on the basis of the formula as applied to the AusLink National Network instead of the National Highway. (3) to (5) The section of the F3 north of Toronto interchange was constructed in 1993, and the RTA carries out regular inspections and undertakes pavement maintenance works as appropriate to ensure the safety of the travelling public. The section’s pavement, while considered by RTA to be performing satisfactorily, is susceptible to mine subsidence and is exhibiting some cracking and spalling.

(2) In respect of the Government’s Enhanced Aviation Security package announced in December 2003, have any funds from the $35 million grant program to assist eligible smaller airports with security measures been allocated to Bankstown Airport; if so, what sum has been made available to Bankstown Airport for security measures? (3) What are the details of the security measures that (a) have been completed at, (b) have commenced at, and (c) are planned for, Bankstown Airport? (4) What other action has the Government taken to improve security at Bankstown Airport since September 2003? (1) No funds from Securing our Regional Skies have been specifically earmarked for individual airports such as Bankstown Airport. Bankstown airport will however be eligible to access aviation security training for its staff under Securing our Regional Skies. (2) Bankstown Airport’s draft transport security program has been assessed and the airport has been advised of those basic security measures identified in their draft transport security program that are eligible for funding. (3) To ensure the best security outcomes are achieved by each security regulated airport it would not be prudent to publicise the exact nature of security measures in place and being installed at a particular airport. In general terms, the measures that can be approved for funding include installation of fencing, lighting, surveillance equipment and alarm systems. (4) Bankstown Airport has participated in workshops run by the Department to assist them with security arrangements in compliance with the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004. Bankstown Airport can also access information as required from the Department’s New South Wales Office. Airport Security Measures (Question No. 353) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 7 December 2004: (1) In respect of $35 million announced by the Government on 11 May 2004 to assist smaller airports to implement security measures (Ref: TRS11/Budget), (a) what sum has been expended, (b) which organisation has been used to allocate the funds, (c) how was the organisation allocating the funds selected, (d) what was the cost of using an external organisation to administer Government funds including both direct costs to the organisation and administrative costs to his Department, (e) which projects have been funded, including (i) the full the cost of each project, (ii) co-contributions",179,Questions In Writing
214,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(if any), (iii) details of the proponents, and (iv) the expected commencement and completion dates of each project, (f) have guidelines been developed for the expenditure of the funds; if so, will he provide a copy, and (g) how did each of the successful projects meet the guidelines? (2) For each of the seven areas identified in the Government’s announcement on 23 August 2004 of $48 million to improve security at Australia’s 146 regional airports (Ref: A94/2004), (a) what sum has been expended, (b) which projects have been funded, including (i) the full the cost of each project, (ii) co-contributions (if any), (iii) details of the proponents, and (iv) the expected commencement and completion dates of each project, (c) have guidelines been developed for the expenditure of the funds; if so, will he provide a copy, and (d) how did each of the successful projects meet the guidelines? (1) (a), (b) The $35m has been expensed to the Australian Airports Association. (c) The Australian Airports Association was selected on the basis of it being the peak national industry body of airport owners and operators, its understanding and support of the industry and its non-profit status. (d) Expenditure of funds by the organisation are subject to the conditions of the Agreement between the AAA and the Commonwealth that state: AAA may, on receipt of the Funds, recover the reasonable costs incurred by it since 11 May 2004 in considering, negotiating and entering into this Agreement (including its legal, travel and accommodations costs); and provided that it first obtains written permission from the Commonwealth Representative to do so, AAA may spend a reasonable and appropriate portion of the Funds on the costs necessarily incurred by AAA in properly performing its functions and obligations under this Agreement. Since July 2004 to December 2004 the AAA have expended $175,320; administrative costs to the Department since July 2004 to December 2004 are $98,739. (e) Currently, 83 airports are in the process of negotiating payment with the Australian Airports Association. (f) The provision of funds to airports by the AAA is regulated by the contract between the AAA and the Commonwealth. A copy of the contract can be provided if required. (g) Assessment of basic security measures to be funded at airports is dependent upon airports conducting a security risk assessment of their airport and drafting a transport security program for the airport. The draft transport security program identifies security measures and procedures to be implemented at the airport, including the basic security measures where funding is sought. DOTARS assesses the security outcomes achieved by each proposed basic security measure, against the risk environment of the airport and either approves or rejects a basic security measure. DOTARS assessment is provided to both the airport and the AAA. The airport applies to the AAA for funding of approved basic security measures and, following a value for money assessment by the AAA, funds are provided for the installation of the security measure. (2) (a), (b), (c) and (d) Securing our Regional Skies is not a grant program. With the exception of the pre-existing hardened cockpit-door funding program, aviation industry participants do not directly apply for funding. $1.574 million has been paid as first payments to seven eligible regional airlines. Four remaining eligible airlines are finalising contractual arrangements to receive payments. Projects have been funded on the basis of providing appropriate cockpit security for relevant aircraft. Formal guidelines were not developed. Each eligible airline was written to outlining eligibility and specifying standards. These standards are consistent with US Federal Aviation Regulation standards. The Australian Federal Police advise that $480,000 has been expended for the Regional Rapid Deployment Teams.",181,Questions In Writing
215,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Under the State and Territory police aviation joint training and exercise program, $149,000 has been approved for the Western Australia Police Service to undertake a joint training and exercise operation in late February 2005. Negotiations are currently underway to pay a further $1.23 million for exercise and training initiatives to other State and Territory Police Services. In total, DOTARS expects to spend $11.865 million on Securing Our Regional Skies initiatives this financial year. Airservices Australia (Question No. 362) December 2004: (1) To what extent does the Airservices Australia Noise and Flight Monitoring System monitor aircraft noise at reference points above ground level that are over-flown by aircraft as opposed to height above aerodrome reference? (2) Is the Government considering modifications or extensions to the measurements used in the Airservices Australia Noise and Flight Path Monitoring System; if so, what are the details? (1) All the aircraft noise levels reported by Airservices Australia from its Noise and Flight Path Monitoring System (NFPMS) are exactly as measured by the microphone at each of the monitoring locations. As such, they relate directly to the terrain elevation at the monitoring locations and do not require adjustment for height above aerodrome reference. (2) The Government is not considering modifications or extensions to the measurements used in the Airservices Australia Noise and Flight Path Monitoring System. However, Airservices Australia is always amenable to proposals or suggestions from the Noise Abatement Committees or Environment Committees at the NFPMS-equipped airports for additions or variations to the presentation of measurement results included in its NFPMS reports. Aboriginal Reconciliation (Question No. 363) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 7 December 2004: (1) Can the Minister confirm that on 3 October 1998 the Prime Minister committed the Government to the cause of true reconciliation with the Aboriginal people of Australia by the Centenary of Federation; if not, why not. (2) Has the Minister read the article titled ‘Reconciliation a must, says Howard’ in The Age on 14 December 2000 which reported the Prime Minister as saying Australia’s priority should be to strengthen support for reconciliation between blacks and whites and the mood of the community was now “overwhelmingly in favour of reconciliation” and “an unstoppable force”. (3) Has the Minister read the article titled ‘Reconciliation: Howard’s unfinished business’ in The Canberra Times on 8 November 2001 which reported that the Prime Minister failed to deliver reconciliation in his second term and has now dedicated the Government to achieving practical reconciliation, “a term coined by his government to bury the rights agenda and focus instead on education, health, unemployment and housing”. (4) Has the Minister read the article titled ‘PM vows to aid Aboriginal cause’ in The Age on 6 December 2004 which reports that the Prime Minister is prepared to go more than halfway to meet indigenous leaders to fix Aboriginal problems.",182,Questions In Writing

217,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(5) Will the Minister explain the difference between ‘reconciliation’ and ‘practical’ reconciliation’. (6) Why did Australia fail to achieve reconciliation by the Centenary of Federation and what progress had been made toward achieving this commitment. (7) Can the Minister say when Australia will achieve lasting reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) Yes. (4) Yes. (5) Reconciliation involves both symbolic and practical measures. At a symbolic level for example, the Government has sponsored the development of Reconciliation Place within the Parliamentary Triangle and at a practical level it has focused on education, employment and health, increasing spending on related Indigenous programs by 39 percent in real terms since 1996. (6) Reconciliation is an ongoing process that will not be complete until Indigenous inequality and disadvantage are finally eliminated. By 2001 however, significant progress had been made. There have been considerable improvements in the rate of Indigenous home ownership, the proportion of Indigenous students completing high school, Indigenous private sector employment, household occupancy rates and health indicators. In addition, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people now have title to, and maintain and manage, around 20% of the land area of Australia. (7) Reconciliation is an ongoing responsibility of all Australians. The legacy of history and of past policy mistakes will not be remedied in the short term. Official Establishments Trust (Question No. 378) Mr Melham asked the Prime Minister, in writing, on 9 December 2004: (1) Is it the case that the Official Establishments Trust has in past years recommended that planning commence for a new official residence for the Prime Minister in Canberra. (2) Can he confirm that he has indicated to the Official Establishments Trust that planning for a new residence should not be pursued; if so, when did he do so. (3) Will he reconsider the Official Establishments Trust recommendation. (4) Will planning for a new official residence for the Prime Minister be undertaken in 2005, 2006 or 2007. (1) Yes (2) Yes. The Official Establishments Trust was advised of my views during 1996-97. (3) I remain of the view that planning for a new official residence for the Prime Minister should not be pursued. I regard the current residence as quite appropriate. (4) No.",183,Questions In Writing

219,Mr Howard,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Telstra Mobile Online Short Message Service (Question No. 415) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Special Minister of State, in writing, on 8 February 2005: In respect of the Government’s decision to grant Senators and Members access to Telstra Mobile Online SMS Business Service for one of their mobile phones, (a) does the service extend to the phones held by Senators and Members, and members of their staff, in their capacities as Ministers and Shadow Ministers, (b) what consultations were undertaken by the Government before making the decision, (c) were representations made by any Senators and Members or political parties requesting this service; if so, by whom and on what date(s), and (d) what is the estimated cost over the next three financial years if the service is fully utilised by Senators and Members. ourable member’s question: (1) (a) No, in respect of mobile telephones provided by Ministerial and Parliamentary Services. I have no discretion in relation to any facilities provided by portfolio departments to Ministers. (b) I approved access to the Telstra Mobile Online Short Messaging Service Business (SMS) on the recommendation of the Department of Finance and Administration. (c) A number of requests were received from Senators and Members for the provision of a bulk Short Messaging Service (SMS); however, I do not consider it appropriate to publish this information, consistent with the principle that disclosure of such information may deter Senators and Members from making submissions to me in the future. I frequently evaluate requests for access to facilities and services and only approve those where a strong business case convinces me that approval is reasonable given the rapid changes in technology. My decision to approve the provision of SMS acknowledges that SMS is an efficient communication tool that enables Senators and Members to confirm meeting times, changes in travel arrangements and confirming decisions and directions when they are conducting business away from their electorate offices. (d) This is a hypothetical question. As a result the answer below sets out a substantially inflated and highly unlikely outcome, as it is doubtful that the facility will be fully taken up.

Customs is the Chair for the National Passenger Processing Committee (NPPC). The major role of the NPPC is to develop whole of Government policy approaches to processing international air passengers. The NPPC membership is AQIS, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA), the Department of Health and Ageing, the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources, Australian Federal Police (AFP), Attorney General’s Department and the Department of Transport and Regional Services. Customs is also represented at the National Advisory Facilitation (NatFAL) committee meetings chaired by the Department of Transport and Regional Services. NatFAL is made up of NPPC Members plus airport and airline representatives. The role of NatFAL is to implement as much as possible the internationally agreed standards and recommended practices for facilitating the movement of travellers through international airports while maintaining Australia’s obligations to maintain adequate aviation security and Australia’s border control legislation and policies. Regional Facilitation committees at every airport meet regularly with similar agency and industry representation to provide formal avenues for addressing facilitation issues on an airport-by-airport basis. In addition to these formal mechanisms, Customs also has close and regular consultations on an informal basis with airlines and airport operators at both national and local levels. There is regular consultation with other border agencies, at a range of levels both nationally and at individual airports. Customs is unable to supply the figures requested.

Within States, the grant is distributed to councils according to the recommendation of the respective Local Government Grants Commission established by each State as a condition of receiving funding under the Act.

(2) What consular assistance, if any, was provided by the Australian Government to Mr Habib while he was in Egyptian custody. (3) What inquiries has the Australian Government or any Australian Government agencies made in respect of Mr Habib’s allegations of torture in Egypt. (4) Has the Government, or any Government agency, interviewed Mr Habib regarding these allegations; if so, (a) who conducted the interview(s), (b) when did it or they occur, and (c) what further action was or is being taken. The Australian Government became aware in November 2001 that it was likely Mr Habib had been transferred to the custody of the Government of Egypt. Despite numerous requests by the Australian Government, including representations at the highest levels, the Government of Egypt has never acknowledged that it held Mr Habib in its custody. Therefore it has not been possible to obtain a response from the Government of Egypt about its treatment of Mr Habib. The Government remains very concerned about these allegations, and on 3 February 2005, the Secretary of the Attorney-General’s Department wrote to Mr Habib’s lawyer, Stephen Hopper, requesting details of Mr Habib’s allegations. No response has been received as yet. In light of the public statements made by Mr Habib on 13 February 2005, I have asked our Embassy in Cairo to raise these allegations to the Government of Egypt, and to request that the Egyptian Government investigate their veracity.",193,Questions In Writing
