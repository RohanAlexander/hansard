Treasurer a question relating to endeavours that have been made to have the Australian Government give financial assistance in connection with the Burdekin Valley development scheme. Is it correct, as reported in this morning's issue ot the Courier-Mail, that the Australian Government has decided that, because of some weakness in the reports on the scheme, it is definitely not going to assist the Queensland Government financially in the development of the Burdekin Valley? come to no decision in connection with the Burdekin Valley development scheme which is still being .investigated. surer seen the report that a company known as Arup and Bruhn Proprietary Limited, which has been trading with the Soviet for the last twelve months, has been ordered by the court to wind up its affairs? Does the Treasurer know that this company receivedfinancialassistance from thc Commonwealth Bank of Aus. tralia to the extent of not less than £26.156. which it now owes on a paidup capital of £3,375 ? Will the Treasurer haye an investigation made into this matter and inform the House why did the Commonwealth.

5,Mr Eadden,"I shall have this subconsider that the 'Government's recently announced decision to re-institute capital issues control is. an adequate means of combating inflation and reducing the cost of living? If this is so, what consideration did the Treasurer give to the question of abolishing this control? Can this decision he regarded as an indication that the Government intends to reinstitute a number of other prices control measures which were advocated by the previous Government and criticized by members of the present Government? ber's questions will be dealt with in the budget speech to-night and, if he will wait until then for his reply, his patience into concerns will be rewarded. IRON AND STEEL. smiths and wheelwrights have approached me concerning the shortage of shoeing iron and steel. Does the Minister for National Development know that one of the results of the shortage of these materials is that many youths cannot be apprenticed to this trade and that many of the old established master blacksmiths and farriers arc going out of business? As this will have a serious effect, particularly on primary producers and on those who live in areas where horse-drawn vehicles are used to provide home deliveries, can the Minister devise some way in which his department may assist in securing' iron and steel to meet such requirements? age in Australia of all forms of iron and imported sulphur is likely to be resteel. That has arisen largely from the stricted? If that is so, seeing that it is shortage of eoal, but has also been caused so 'important to our agricultural indusby other factors. I am aware that steel tries, have any endeavours been made used for .the purposes the honourable memto ensure a reasonable supply of ber describes is in short supply. Such low sulphur to Australia? If there is a poscarbon steel is made largely at Port sibility that Australia may not be able to Kembla, I believe, and there is no early -get supplies from overseas, will the hope of relieving the shortage of iron and Government develop known sulphur steel, and the products made from them, in deposits in Australia, particularly those Australia other thanby the means that in Western Australia? the Government is adopting.

All that I can say is that brimshall do my best to ensure that stone, which is elemental sulphur, is they are alleviated. In the meantime, I advise merchants to do their best to import such products to the limit of their ability.

The only commitment that my department has enteredmercerized shirting material, and material for the making of khaki duck trousers for military uniforms. We could not obtain suoh materials anywhere in Australia. not obtain them anywhere, in Australia, nor could we obtain them from countries other than Japan. Those materials are urgently required, and the Department of Supply had offers on very favorable terms from the Australian agents of Japanese firms. Accordingly the contract was entered into.

15,Mr Beale,"That matter is receivobtained chiefly from the United States, the main producer of sulphur apart from Soviet Russia. The purchase of brimstone from the United States involves the use of dollars. The sulphur by-product, sulphuric' acid, which is used in the manufacture of explosives and superphosphate, and which is mostly used in Australia, can also be obtained from pyrites, which, is sulphate of iron. Pyrites are freely obtainable'in Australia, and at present we are making sulphuric acid in this country from pyrites. The honourable member may rest assured that the Government is taking care that the sulphuric acid industry, and those industries which use sulphuric acid, are being protected and safeguarded in the interests of this country. for Works and Housing whether he will end the border barbarism that his department is practising by restricting the supply to New South Wales of bricks that are produced in . the Australian Capital Territory? I point out that only 3 per cent, of bricks produced in the Territory are allowed to be sold outside the Territory. Will the Minister consider what would be the effect upon the Government's housing programme in the Australian Capital Territory if New South Wales, for example, similarly restricted supplies to the Territory of many other huilding materials? Will he also consider what would be the effect upon national developpurposes were these properties acquired? ment programmes if every State in Australia adopted the Government's dog-in the-manger attitude in this matter? If the brickworks in Canberra have to be operated as a government enterprise will he try to ensure that they shall be operated as nearly as possible in the way that a healthy private enterprise is operated? the honourable member's question and caught the word "" barbarism"" at one. point and the words "" private enterprise "" at another point, the two terms being antithetical conceptions. quite sure which side the honourable member is on. As I understand it, his question related to bricks. Bricks are in short supply throughout Australia, and notably so in the Australian Capital Territory. We are endeavouring to increase the supply by installing more modern brick kilns in the Territory in order to serve the needs of this very rapidly growing community. I had not considered the possibility that more of the bricks produced here should be sent to New South Wales. I am not sure whether that emerges from the honorahle member's question. If he desires that fewer bricks produced here should be sold outside the Territory, that is another matter. In any event, if he will place his question on the notice-paper with the clarity for which he is noted, I shall be glad to see if I Gan understand what he is speaking about, if he is speaking about anything at all. the Army whether, in view of the shortage of accommodation on the Mornington Peninsular, it was unavoidable that the Army had to acquire Mount Martha House, which accommodates 150 guests? What was the price paid for that property? What price was paid for the furniture and fittings? Is it a fact that they have been declared for disposal? Is it a fact that Whitehall Guest House at Sorrento, which the Army acquired some time ago, is not being utilized? For what ber was good enough to let me know that he would ask for the information that he now requests. The properties that he has mentioned were purchased by the Army in 1940. The Army urgently needed additional land close to Balcombe Camp for the erection of quarters for married personnel. Mount Martha House came on the market and was purchased by the Army in 1949. It is the only suitable property that has become available in proximity to Balcombe Camp. The price paid for it was approxiI am not mately £22,500.

19,Mr Francis,"The honourable memused by the Army. A small proportion not suitable for Army use will' be declared for disposal. The Whitehall Guest House at Sorrento has been partially occupied since the Army took it over in December, 1949. Until recently, the need to effect alterations and repairs has restricted the number of guests that could be accommodated. At present, there are in residence at that guest house eight families, including 22 children, of ex-Royal Navy ratings serving in the Royal Australian Navy. The remainder of the accommodation has been earmarked for the families of ex-Royal Navy personnel who are being recruited in the United Kingdom. Some 500 of them have already been accepted for service in the Royal Australian Navy, and their families are expected to arrive here in the new year. Mount Martha House is required for conversion into fourteen flats, and the erection of twenty quarters for married members stationed at the Army signals camp, which is situated only one mile from the hostel. The Army and the Navy are using it jointly. Whitehall Guest House was purchased in December. 1949, as a going concern for the accommodation of the families of exRoyal Navy personnel who were recruited in the United Kingdom last year for six years' service in the Royal Australian Navy and who were unable to secure accomodation for their families in this country. The hostels are being conducted on behalf of the Army and/or the Navy by the Department of Labour and National Service. attention of the Prime Minister been directed to a report to the effect that inflation is now galloping forward at such a rate in America that it is likely to result in the dollar loan to Australia buying as much as 30 per cent, less than when the loan was made? If that forecast is correct, will the right honourable gentleman say whether the Government still intends to use that loan ? If it proposes to do so, will it take steps to ensure that the rate of interest which Australia will pay for that inflated money shall be reduced proportionately? report to which the honourable member has referred, and, therefore, I can say nothing about it. If the report is to the effect stated by the honourable gentleman,. I should have difficulty in helieving it. Minister for Commerce and Agriculture instructed the Division of Agricultural Economics to make a comprehensive investigation of the dried fruits industry, and to furnish him with a report thereon. Will the Minister acting for the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture inform me whether that report has. yet been received ? If it has not come to hand can he say when the result of that investigation will be revealed, because a considerable number of growers are financially interested in the matter? investigation which has been carried out by the Division of Agricultural Economics into the dried fruits industry has extended over a period of some months. It has been necessary to secure a vast quantity of data of all kinds, and that material is now being tabulated and analyzed. I understand that it will be a little time yet before the analysis will be completed, hut when it has been prepared, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, on his return from abroad, will make a statement on the matter. Minister for Health relates to the hardship which is suffered by certain sick persons who, unfortunately, have to purchase drugs that are not included in the free list. Will the right honourable gentleman inquire into that matter with a view to ensuring that drugs which are essential for the maintenance of the health of many people shall be included in the list of free drugs? inember will forward to me his request and the names of the drugs that he has in mind, I shall have the matter submitted to the proper authority.",15,Compulsory Acquisition Of Property

We decided to make television a national monopoly and included a provision to that end in the Australian Broadcasting Act of 1948. We believed that the.harm that has been done in the field of commercial broadcasting by those who had been lucky enough to get licences and who had exploited the public should not be repeated in the field of television. Furthermore, we did not know much about the possible future developments of television. The situation was fluid. The Menzies Government has now decided that it w ill t r y to amend the Australian Broadcasting Acti n order to allow private enterprise to enter the field of telecasting. It w ill not be possible to establish more than three television stations in any capital city. Therefore, if the Government were to grant a f r a nchise to operate a television station to private enterprise before we obtain more knowledge about the subject than we now possess, it would merely present to the lucky person who received the franchise an opportunity to make a large sum of money by invitin g other persons to participate in the fortune that they had missed at the price that the successful applicant would demand. : lucky enough to get it . I now come to events in September. with what I have already said. The preceeding with the plan that the Chifley Government laid down it to television is contamed in a statement that the Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony) made on the 29th June. He said, in effect, that the Cabinet had approved of the general plan for television, that the first experimental station would be erected in Sydney based on the 625-line standard that had been adopted by the Chifley Government, that the present Government had also approved in principle of private enterprise taking part in the development of television, and that an amendment of the Australian Broadcasting Act to give effect to these decisions would be introduced into the Parliament as soon as possible. The Government's declaration that it approves of the general plan for television means nothing. We want actions, not words. The Chifley Government did l a y ' the groundwork for the erection of at least six transmitting stations. This Government says that it w ill proceed to erect only one station, and that it w ill be in Sydney. Following that announcement an official statement was made to the press to the effect that Australia's first television station w ill be operating in Sydnej within about two years. That means that television stations w ill not be operating in the other capital cities for some considerable time to come. We believe that the people of Australia an article entitled "" Social Effects should not be asked to wait so long before of Television"" in which some very the benefits of telecasting are made availinteresting statistics are presented. able to them.

69,Mr Calwell,"It is a matter notare enjoyed by 400,000 viewers, surely the Government will be justified in developing television in this country as rapidly as possible. Television will undoubtedly bring changes in our social life. It will affect the investment of a lot of people in cinemas, theatres, the promotion of fights ancl radio broadcasting as well as the interests of manufacturers in the radio field. However, we must ensure that the interests of the people shall be served, because, primarily, governments exist not to protect the vested interests of individuals 'but to serve the interests of the general public. should televize proceedings in the Parliament. come ahout; but it would have disastrous effects for the Liberal party and would result in the complete extinction of the Australian Country party. For obvious reasons, the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) would be the greatest opponent of the telecasting of proceedings in the Parliament. When the Ohifley Labour Government inaugurated the broadcasting of proceedings of the Parliament, reactionaries opposed the innovation. I believe that the people of Australia would destroy any government that attempted to interfere with the present system of broadcasting proceedings in the Parliament. If parliamentary proceedings were televized the people would better be able not only to hear but also to see in operation those whom they have sent here to represent them. The Government must recognize the inevitability of change. Change is the law of life. Very few things in life remain stationary. Most of the things that remain stationary become stagnant. Life is made up of progression and retrogression. It is extremely foolish to try to stop changes or to retard the rate at which those changes are proceeding. Although, recognizing that change is inevitable, this Government is trying to fool the people, 'but it will not .succeed in doing so, when, in relation to television, it says that it has some reason for not hastening. I consider that vested interests are holding the Government back. Some people, who do not want the introduction of television unless they can get in on the ground floor and control the whole system, do not favour that change. Considering all the progress that has been made with television in other countries, Australia, as a nation, is beginning to look foolish in deciding that it will be at least another two years before we do anything about it. The Postmaster-General cannot justify that inaction by saying that the development of television will interfere with the departmental programme for installing telephones and building new automatic exchanges in the country. All those works can proceed as a part of the one programme. When the Chifley Government was in office, an enormous number of telephones was installed, and as many exchanges were built as was possible with the labonr and materials that were then available, yet we laid the foundations for the installation of underground cables to improve our telecommunications services between the capital cities, and that work will facilitate, in due course, the introduction of relays of telecasting from capital to capital when our television stations are established. The engineers of the Postal Department speak of coaxial relays, and that development should be proceeded with immediately.

The last thing that I would do would be to accept that policy without thoroughly examination led me to the conclusion that the erection of six television stations in Australia at this stage in the history of television would be the most senseless course of action imaginable Every authority that had studied the problems of television had recommended that we proceed cautiously. The field of television was unknown territory.

This Government sent the chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, Mr Boyer, abroad recently so that he could study developments overseas. When he returned to Australia less than two months ago, he wrote an article for Australian newspapers in which he made the following statement, which I quote from the Sydney Morning Herald:There is no shadow of doubt that it puts new and distressing strains on discipline in the home-simpl y because it is quite irresistible to children, aud hosts of parents are bewailing the domestic battles that go on about bed-time, and the unsuitability of some of the programmes. Members of the Opposition laugh at the statement, but that is an important factor that must he considered in relation to television. However, the greatest factor is the unfitness of a policy of constructing television stations before homes. That is the real issue. The honourable member for Melbourne takes credit for his formulation of the programme which brings a stream of immigrants to Australia at a rate exceeding 200,000 annually, yet apparently he would be satisfied to let immigrants go homeless and to divert our resources to the production of luxuries such as television stations. I have before me a report, which states that there is a backlog of 250,000 homes in Australia to-day. [24] ment doing a'bout it? examining it , and my that it will not do is divert essential materials from the housing programme to non-essential projects. Our population is rising rapidly as the result of both immigration and the natural increase. Our people require approximately 90,000 new homes a year, but the best that we have been able to do up to date has been to construct 57,000 houses last year, an all-time record. The Postal Department has a backlog of more than 100,000 unsatisfied applications for telephone installations. If the Government undertook the construction of six television inadequate depend for the provision of various essenThe honourable tial services, would be depleted further by 180 or 200 experts. I am indeed astonished that the honourable member for Melbourne should endeavour, in effect, to censure the Government for failure to divert already scarce materials to the construction of television stations. I have before me a picture of the honourable gentleman that was published in the most recent issue of the Sunday Herald of Sydney.

It has disregarded Quebec, Ottawa, Vancouver and many other provincial capitals. parallels that of this Government. the television service extend from each of the two centres that the Minister has mentioned ? has an effective radius of only 40 or 50 miles. Although that country has the example of its neighbour, the United States of America before it, it has not erected a myriad of television stations but has contented itself with erecting two television stations. For the moment it has debarred private enterprise from entering the field, although private enterprise will be permitted to do so when the time is considered appropriate. AlthoughI have said a good deal this morning to explain the reasons why the Government should exercise caution in this matter and why we should give \ essentia], I still consider it important that we should introduce television in Australia and that we should not lag behind the rest of the world in the application of modern scientific knowledge. The view that I expressed to Cabinet, which was accepted, is that we must make a start with television in this country, but before doing so we should obtain first-hand information and the most expert advice from abroad so that television will be established in this country on sound lines. We believe that the soundest principle to follow is that which was laid down by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Broadcasting in a report which it submitted to the Parliament in 1946. That report recommended that we should begin with only one station and that we should gradually expand our knowledge of the most suitable type of programmes to be televised and should acquire technical experience of the operation of television under local conditions. Those are exactly the lines upon which the present Government is proceeding. After all, television must he viewed in its proper perspective, which is that it is merely one factor in a properly balanced economy. In other words, whilst we must keep in step with the rest of the world by making available to our people the most modern amenities, we owe a prior obligation to Its policy exactly those Australian citizens who are without many existing amenities that are essential to a decent existence. The facts placed before the House by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) this morning have not been answered by the Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony). The Minister commenced his speech by indulging in personal abuse of the honourable member, who is a former Minister, and he devoted fifteen minutes of his time to an attack upon the honourable gentleman and only five minutes to the subject of television. The Minister sought to defend the tardiness of his Government in introducing television by stating that in Great Britain there are at present only two television stations although a third one is in course of construction. That is quite true, of course, but it is also true that since 1938, when the first station was built, a world war priority to matters that we consider more and an economic crisis have supervened and have prevented the United Kingdom from devoting its national energies to anything but the task of survival. The television apparatus that was erected in the United Kingdom was a 405-line system. The Chifley Administration, which reviewed very thoroughly the experience of other countries in which television operated, decided, on the recommendation of experts, that a 625-line system was the most appropriate for Australia. The argument put forward by the Postmaster General that we must proceed with extreme caution because television is a new field of experiment, is not altogether convincing because we have the advantage of the experience of countries in which television has now been operating for some years. The honourable gentleman also made much of the fact that Canada has only two television stations, but, at least, that is twice the number of stations that the present Government proposes to establish. The previous Government decided to make the benefits of television available to all parts of Australia, and for that reason it determined to erect six stations, which would be located in the capital cities. However,",27,Evatt Wha T Social Changes Staff Of Technicians Upon Which We

83,Mr Riordan (Kennedy) . [11.57],"the present Government, which like previous anti-Labour governments is affected by the "" Sydney Harbour"" complex, has decided to provide only one station, which will, of course, be located either in Melbourne or in Sydney and will serve only the favoured few who reside in either of the southern capitals. By erecting six stations the cost of each installation would have been considerably less than that of a single station, and the cost of maintenance and administration of each of the six stations would have been considerably les3 than the cost of operating and maintaining a single station. Indeed, under Labour's plan, it would have cost only approximately £1,000,000 to erect the six units, and the total annual cost of administration would have been only £1,300,000. That is a very small item in the national budget, and it is idle, therefore, for the Minister to suggest that the expenditure involved in our programme was a valid reason for not proceeding with it. Tha Minister contended that because of the demands made upon our funds by the expansion of the defence services the money could not be spared. Whilst members of the Opposition are just as keenly interested in defence as are members of the Government parties, I remind the Minister that we are not at the moment discussing defence but are debating the right of the Australian people to participate in a new amenity that is enjoyed by the people of the TJnited Kingdom and the TJnited. States of America. The honourable member for Melbourne some criticism of the operation of ampliinformed us that the French Government tude modulation stations, but I point had decided to operate an 819-line system, out to him that the commission was but whether that decision has actually established years ago in order to been implemented I do not know. The deal with the confusion that had arisen 625-line system, which the Chifley Adminbecause of the excessive number of radio istration was advised to install, has the stations that were operating on ordinary merit that it would furnish maximum amplitude modulation. It was never efficiency for a minimum of cost. It is intended at the outset that the commission idle, therefore, for the Postmastershould deal with television, and, in any General to speak of the merits of the event, television had not then been impleE.M.I. and the P.Y.E. systems, which mented. It seems clear, therefore, that Jiave only 405 lines. The system in operathe reference made by the Postmastertion in the TJnited States of America is General to the Federal Communications the 525-line system, and we should profit Commission has no real bearing on the by the experience of that country.. I ask myself, what is the real motive for tralia are congregated in the capital the attitude adopted by the Government cities, a television station in eaoh of those in this matter? Is it due to the influence cities would be the means of giving the of Mr Warner, a member of the former Hollway Liberal Administration of Victoria, and a very influential member of the board of Electronics Industries Limited, who threatened to institute legal proceedings against the Ohifley Government if it accepted a tender for the supply of television equipment? Or is the explanation that the Government has been influenced by a representative of P.Y.E., of Great Britain, who recently visited this country, or by Sir Ernest Fisk, the former general manager of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, who is now a high executive of E.M.E., and who recently visited Australia ? Of course, we know that these organizations are unofficially associated. I stress the significance to the Government's decision of the attitude adopted by Mr Warner some time ago and of the special visits made to Australia by the representatives of big business from overseas. Is the reason for the Government's decision to scrap the comprehensive plans of the Chifley Administration and to proceed with its own inadequate proposal that it wishes to make merely a token gesture to the people of Australia ? I remind the Postmaster-General, who spoke as though television were still in its experimental stages, that 103 stations are now operating in the United States of America. Of course, the Minister attempted to make capital out of the fact that the Federal Communications Commission ih that country had criticized television. It is true that that .body did make matter under discussion. We say in effect that as most of the people of Ausbest service to the greatest number of people at the minimum of cost. The. Government should take cognizance of the fact that the establishment of six stations would provide the training of six times as many technicians as would the establishment of only one station. Therefore, in the interests of technical advancement and of the development of the teelvLsion industry, it is necessary that six stations be established. The Postmaster-General's references to housing and to the use of building materials that would be involved in the construction of six stations, which were produced as excuses for the Government's proposed action, are just red herrings. He made no reference to the fact that prior to the war, when an anti-Labour government of the same kidney as the present Government put through an act to deal with the provision of hous ing, it built only one house,"" and that house was for occupancy by the present Minister for National Development ( Mr now in Australia a sort of dog's breakfast Casey). National Development and Minister for Works and Housing) [12.7] -The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr thing that makes a community tick-ar e Calwell)a proud title-wh o was a senior and responsible Minister in the late Labour Government, has moved the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing "" a definite matter of urgent public importance""-that is, that we should add to our already overcrowded market for public entertainment in Australia. held a high and responsible post in the late Government, yet he appears entirely to overlook the fact that the world is in probably the most disturbed and serious state that it has ever been in during a time of so-called peace. Yet at such a time he seriously urges that we should expend our energies and our raw materials in adding, as I have said, to our already overcrowded entertainment market. I ask the honourable gentleman to consider some aspects of this matter. The Government of which he was a distinguished .member aimed, and as the Opposition now aims, at a great, planned economy for Australia. I suggest that, as a result of that Government's eight years in office, this country has the most unplanned economy in the world. Under the aegis of the late Government the industries of Australia, either with or without encouragement, expanded their production by a great many times during the war years. All those industries used electricity, oil, coal, steel, bricks, cement and other basic materials. The late Government was perfectly content to watch industry expand at a record rate during the war years, and use up those raw materials, without giving one moment's thought to taking steps to increase the production of basic materials. Snowy Mountains hydro-electric project? fect example to illustrate the .point that I am making. It was entered into without any thought having been given to the necessity to increase the production of : steel, cement and all the other materials that are involved in the carrying out of such projects. The result is that we have that the present Government has inherited from the previous Government, in which all the important raw materials, without any exception-power , transport, coal, steel, coke, cement, bricks, tiles, and everyin gravely short supply. At the same time, I suppose we have, picking a not unreasonable figure out of the air, £1,000,000,000 worth of urgent developmental works that need to be carried out. I should classify any constructional work as being in two categories, the first of which might be termed "" muscle ""' and The honourable gentleman the second "" f a t "" . In the "" muscle "" category I put the rapid increase of power generation, coal production and the manufacture of steel, cement, bricks, coke, hydrochloric acid and all the other basic materials. That is "" muscle "", because it adds to the ability of the community to produce, which is the goal to which the Government is primarily giving its attention. The other category, which could be described as "" f a t "" . includes television and a number of other activities that are now being carried on in this community. They add nothing to the country's constructive ability, to the strength of its industry and economy, or to its ability to defend itself.

The honourable member for Melbourne has seen fit to castigate the Government for not providing for the erection of six television stations in Australia. This matter was considered in the Cabinet at great length. The Postmaster-General submitted to th© Cabinet, in a reasonable and logical way, a number of alternatives -wliethe r we should have no television or whether we should have one, two, three or up to six stations. Oabinet decided, I consider rightly, that Ave should have telelist is limited toworks and propositions vision in homeopathic doses, starting with one station. In other words, we believe that we should enter the television field gradually. I believe that television has some small defence significance in that it involves the training of technicians who may be of some use in time of war. We do not wish Australia to lag behind the rest of the world. vernment allow private enterprise to build it has heen said, is to oppose, but I the proposed television station? television station, to be built by the Goof facetious argument is not in the best vernment in Australia's greatest capital interests of this country.

By so doing, it would strengthen the magnet that the capital cities constitute, which draws people from country areas. We do not want such a movement of population. I consider that tlie Postmaster^General, whose political origin was in the Australian Country party, was statesmanlike, to say the least, in proposing that, instead of providing for television on a big scale at the outset, we should establish one station and learn by experience. I propose in the very near future to circulate to honourable members and senators a short list of the principal developmental activities in Australia. It occupies about ten pages of close type, each item being allotted six or seven lines. The each of which will cost £500,000 or more, and annexed to it is a map which shows their location. This will bring home to honourable gentlemen the vast task that presents itself to this country in the developmental field-in the muscle field and not in the fat field. It seems to me that the honourable gentleman's motion is bred of a desire consider that, under present conditions, opposition for opposition's sake by means to the people of Australia?

92,Mr Casey,"If the honourable gentlesaying that the Government is doingshould be that they will not be any worse off, and may be vastly .better off, if they wait a few years until the sea is a bit calmer before they make this addition to the already swollen field of entertainment in Australia. Honourable members have listened to a very interesting speech hy the Minister for National Development ( Mr Casey). His allegation 'that the House is wasting its time in debating this matter is most extraordinary. The Government has no other business with which to proceed. After this business concludes a debate that is a week old will proceed on international affairs, which have changed since the debate began. If the House is wasting its time, the Government has the rem,edy in its own hands. If the subject of defence is of such urgent importance as the Minister indicated, then it would be perfectly feasible for the Government to say that it would not proceed with television at all. But that is not the Government's attitude. The Government has put aside a plan for the erection of six television stations. It has not said that the plan cannot be implemented iu a. time of emergency, but has limited it to one station which is to be built in Sydney. If the argument of the Postmaster General were consistent with that of the Minister for Development, one could understand the Government's point of view but the arguments of the two Ministers are in absolute conflict. The Postmaster-General claims that television is a very dangerous thing about which we do not know very much. He says that it might disturb the life of the home because there might be competition among members of the family to look at the various television programmes and that therefore it must be developed prudently. Is there any difference, in this way, between television and radio? Is there not competition in the home for the right to listen to certain programmes? Every parent knows that there is. That point is complete^ irrelevant to this matter. Australia is lagging behind every other country of the world in this modern, scientific age. There is some reason impelling the change that has been made. A number of powerful interests in this country are opposed to television. An article that was published in the July issue of Fortune magazine dealt with television and the caption "" Who's afraid ?"" described the tenor of it. Among those who are opposed to television are the radio interests. This article saysRadio and television are certainly in collision. They compete in time and space with not dissimilar programmes and attractions. The Minister says that this is another adventure in the entertainment field. That will be said by the owners of the profit-making broadcasting stations. The introduction of television will revolutionize the whole industry as it has already done in the United States of America. I gave some figures to the House recently which indicated the change that has been made by television in the transmission of sporting events. Whereas the fee paid for the broadcasting of a baseball competition in America amounted to about 50,000 dollars, the fee for televising the same entertainment amounted to about 670,000 dollars. By this medium of entertainment, events are brought into the home and shown as they would be in a cinema. I do not think that the Government should try to put back the hands of the clock. I do not think that the lack of materials is the reason why a station is to be erected in Sydney only. I believe that fear is gripping certain interests in Australia. The chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission has made a most extraordinary statement concerning television. What he has said was said about radio when it started. I do not regard it as a function of his to indicate the ridiculous possibilities that he mentions in the passage that was read by the Postmaster-General. It is true that television programmes are of considerable public importance and that it might be possible to have programmes that would be detrimental to the community but that applies also to radio broadcasts. Why should the chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission venture to engage in this controversy ? unfair to him.",31,Evatt Wha T Social Changes Staff Of Technicians Upon Which We

I want to know why he wishes ( Mr Casey). If there has been, any to call a halt on television development. unnecessary delay in the introduction of I do not know who wrote the article in this service it is completely justified Fortune, but it is written from the point because there was never a time when the of view of business interests in general introduction of what is entirely a luxury and not from the standpoint of radio or was less opportune than it is in Australia television stations. It is very important that Australia should not lag behind the United States or Britain in the development of television. There is an educational aspect of television which could be of enormous advantage to the people of Australia and the Government should take the initiative in the establishment of television stations. I cannot see why, if the experiment may be dangerous, the homes of Sydney people are to be treated as being of no importance. If there is no danger it is absurd that only one city should 'be selected for the erection of a television station. Under the control of the British Broadcasting Corporation, television is one of the features of the life of the English people who are within reach of the service. Dramas are transmitted and educational work is done by means of television which could not he done in any other way. Why cannot the Government follow the example of Britain and proceed with the television programme? ( Mr Ryan) -'Order! The right honourable gentleman's time has expired. is extraordinary that honourable members opposite should have criticized the Government for not hastening the development of television in Australia. The bonorable member for Melbourne ( Mr America during the last four years more Calwell) and the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) are supposed, primarily, to represent the interests of the Kennedy would not be able to benefit berause they would be too far away from Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony) and at present. I am opposed to the motion because, as the Minister for National Development, pointed out, no one could treat this matter as being of first-class importance. Compared with the problems before this House and another place it is a fourth rate matter and it has been introduced with ill-informed argument with the sole object of diverting the attention of the people from ' the failure of another place to bring the anti-Communist legislation into operation. Australia can ill afford a luxury of this sort. Houses, steel, coal and everything by which we maintain our standard of living are in short supply and another great industry can be superimposed on that state of affairs only at the expense of the production of those essential materials. Therefore, I cannot imagine a time less suitable to bring television into operation. I heard the honourable member for Melbourne talk loosely about six television transmitters costing £1,000,000. I have studied this matter for some time, and from my investigations during the last twelve months I have reached the conclusion that on one station alone £1,000,000 could easily be spent. It is of no use for the honourable member for Melbourne to shake his head; he has had access to the same publications and documents that I have had, and he should know that in the United States of than two billion dollars has been spent on television.",32,Evatt Wha T Social Changes Staff Of Technicians Upon Which We

Television rnust cast a very heavy burden on thc taxpayer. Remembering that, it is well to consider that the only people who will be able to enjoy its benefits will horse races and other sporting events. be a few privileged and wealthy people. That is quite plain from a consideration of the cost of television receiving sets. The cost of a very ordinary set has been estimated as being between £80 and £100, but I have spoken to experts who have estimated that the cost will be at least £120. The only persons who will be able to afford to own such sets will be the wealthy few whom honourable members opposite spend such a lot of time criticizing. That is well known to the honourable member for Melbourne, yet he demands a 'television service for those people. I have not heard such nonsense in all my life. It is the poorest stage where it will be enjoyable, I do not horse that he has ever started in this House. Whilst only a few will benefit from television everybody will have to pay for it because, as a government instrumentality, it will be a charge on the of bringing great harm to this country. public exchequer. Its cost will be defrayed The honourable member for Melbourne out of the weekly instalments that the worker pays as tax on his wages. He will pay for it but will not benefit from it. I estimate that considerably less than 1. per cent, will benefit from television for the reason that I have stated, and also because reception is possible only within a limited distance from the transmitter. The honourable member for Darebin( Mr Andrews) said that television will be of advantage to the defence of this country. He might as well have said that it would increase our defence preparedness to engage in the building of supersonic bombers. We cannot afford, considering our industrial potential, to engage in the construction of complicated and expensive engines of war of that type. We should concentrate on doing the things that we can best do. Highly technical and expensive instruments, such as advanced radar, we hope to be always able to get from the .United States of America or Great Britain, which have the industrial capacity to manufacture snch things. . I do not think that many honourable members have had personal [12.37] -It is amusing to hear honorablo experience of television, and certainly, members on the Government side comjudging from the remarks of the honorplaining about the so-called waste of time Mr Gullett. must be very limited. I have seen television programmes, and they left me un enthusiastic. It is said that people will be able to watch cricket matches, The television screen is a small thing about 3 or 4 feet square at the most. Honourable members are asked to believe that a cricket match can be watched in that small screen. I have seen a baseball match televised and I could neither follow the game nor understand which side the players were on. On the screen the ball was no bigger than a fly, and I suggest, from my experience, that it is impossible to follow a cricket match on a television screen. Nor is it possible intelligently to follow a horse race or any other sporting contest. Television is in its infancy and whether it will ever advance to the know; but certainly it has not reached that stage to-day. I believe that television has possibilities suggested that the proceedings of the Parliament should be televised. I think that he committed his party to that course oi"" action if it attains office again. It is most disconcerting to think that likenesses of honourable members may be taken into the homes of the people while making their speeches. Think of the effect on the children of this country of the speeches of those who not so long ago were advancing this particular proposition. The honourable member for Melbourne has himself taken part in television performances. It is very questionable whether it would be an advantage to televise parliamentary debates in the private homes of our people where innocent children and others could see and hear them. It is well known that television programmes leave a great deal to be desired and that the cost of the industry is so enormous that much time is spent in televising out-of-date motion pictures.

101,Mr Clyde Cameron (Hindmarsh),"in the discussion of this very important matter. I inform the Government that if it is in a position to bring down its budget this very minute the Opposition will forthwith cease this discussion and deal with that hudget. Moreover, if the Government is in a position to bring in any important legislation, this debate will not be pursued for one moment longer. The most important legislation ever introduced by any Government is the budget, but this Government's budget has not yet seen the light of clay. I rise to take part in this debate on behalf of the people of metropolitan Adelaide. Parliament represent that area. Only three of those, the honourable memher for Adelaide( Mr Chambers), the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr survey of American television proThompson) and myself favour giving to the people of Adelaide an opportunity of participating in television. Net one Adelaide member OJI the Government side -neithe r the honorahle member for member for Sturt( Mr Wilson) nor the honourable member for Angas( Mr try to make the changes good,"" . . . Downer)-is prepared to allow the people of Adelaide to have an opportunity of viewing television. The previous Government decided on a plan which would have given to the people of Adelaide an oppoj-tunity of enjoying television. That Government's plan was to build a television transmitting station in Adelaide, ancl it even reached the stage of calling tenders for the construction of it. When it relinquished office everything was in readiness to provide the 300,000 people of the metropolitan area of Adelaide, with a television service. We find now that the Government has decided that the Australian people are to be denied television services until private vested interests are ready to provide them. The reason for that is that the Government realizes the effect that television will present. They broadcast all kinds of have upon the community and knows that in the hands of private enterprise it will be the means of putting hundreds of thousands of pounds of profit into the pockets of those fortunate enough to obtain transmitting licences. The effective radius of a television transmitting station is as far as the human eye can see. A transmitter placed on high ground can transmit further than one on low ground. In Adelaide, Mount Lofty offers an excellent site for a transmitter. If situated there, one transmitter eould be used for the whole of Adelaide because the whole of Adelaide can be seen from that point. The Government, which is bound hand and foot to wealthy vested interests, has sold out the right of the Australian Parliament to determine, in the interests of the people, that television shall be used as a new modern instrument of education. The Government has determined that it shall be used to distort the minds of the Six members of this people for the benefit of private enterprise. In the Adelaide Advertiser of the 2nd September, 1950, appears a report of what Mr R. J. F. Boyer said after a grammes. The report readsTelevision would make a different ijeople of Australians, the chairman of tha Australian Broadcasting Commission ( MT . R. J. F. Boyer) said yesterday after a 10-day survey of American television system programmes. "" We cannot and should not he afraid, of that,"" he said. "" All that remains to us is to understand that it will change us, and Mr Boyer said' that the survey had convinced him that television as a medium was more direct and dynamic than radio ever was. It influenced people and their homes in a more revolutionary way. ""Many educators here and in England are afraid of its influence,"" he said. ""They fear that television wil l alter the national habits, making people starers instead of readers and thinkers, because it tends towards the spectacular and showy, and is apt to ignore or play down good values."" If what Mr Boyer said is correct, and I believe that it is, then I am not prepared to allow commercial broadcasting stations in this country to impose upon the viewers of television the type of programme that the radio stations acting for commercial interests in Australia impose upon thc listeners at horror stories and thriller serials as well as low-class advertising and propaganda of various kinds. It is time that honourable memhers realized the importance of television and broadcasting, and the fact that television in the hands of private enterprise can adversely affect the whole nation.

I am certain that this Government is wedded not only to the commercial interests but also to the picture interests and others that would be affected by the introduction of television. American experience shows that television is gaining public acceptance at a rapid rate. Its diffusion pattern is quickly building a broad base among those who live at or near .the basic wage and is constantly stimulating new interests withir the family circle. It is a fact that thei is a new awareness of family unity and an enlargement of the immediate circle of social relationships. Television is not yet stable or mature; it is fluid and as yet unpredictable in many aspects of its growth. Buti t is growing and we must take cognizance of that fact. Its growth and development will alter significantly the daily habits of Australians and all other peoples. It will have its effects on our culture, our leisure and our future. It is important and vital that the Government of the day shall keep in the hands of the people the control of this essential means of entertainment and education. statistics show that in 1949 there were 42,000,000 homes in America that had radio sets, and that in those homes there were 81,000,000 radio sets. There were also 3,250,000 television sets in America. In this, country there are 2,000,000 radio sets, but, as yet, not one television set in operation. AlthoughI disagree with the political views of the honourable inember for Henty( Mr Gullett) I admit that he is one of the most handsome men that I have ever seen. For that reason he would have nothing to fear if the proceedings of the Parliament were televised. However, he made the remarkable statement that it would be wasteful to use materials in the construction of television stations when such materials were urgently required for the construction of houses. What would be the difference between the Government itself using those materials to construct suoh stations and allowing private enterprise to use the' same materials in the construction of their own stations?

106,Mr Roberton,"I am glad thataddress of a Scottish, king, Eobert Bruce, who lived more than 600 years ago. Bruce, in speaking to his army before the battle of Bannockburn, saidWlia will be a traitor knave? Wha can fill a coward's grave? Wha sae base as be a slave Let bim turn and flee! The present Government is facing a similar situation in the same spirit. I give the next words back to .the honourable member for HindmarshBy oppression's woes and pains! By your sons in servile chains! Wc will drain our dearest veins, But they shall be free! Those words express the view of the Government, as it has been enunciated by the Prime Mmister( Mr Menzies) in his references to our responsibilities in Korea, and to our defence system generally. One Opposition member after another has stated that the only way in which to meet the situation that has developed in international affairs is to adopt the socialist ideology. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) said, in effect, "" The only solution is a form of socialism "". As I have been answering questions up to this point in my speech, perhaps I shall be permitted to ask one. If the solution of the world's problems is a form of socialism, will the Leader of the Opposition tell me the brand of socialism that he has in mind? Is it the socialism that is advocated by himself, tlie socialism that is expressed by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Opposition members interjecting, Calwell), the socialism of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) or that delightful form of socialism that is so adequately expressed by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Minogue) ? It is futile, in a House of this description, member for Eiverina( Mr Eoberton) is to say that the solution of the problems of the world is the adoption of socialism, unless the speaker is prepared to qualify his view and specify the brand of socialism that he means. The idea that socialism is the solution of international problems is neither new nor novel. That procedure has been attempted in many parts of the world during the last 30 years, and wherever it has been applied in practice, it has become, in the final analysis, communism. That is the bitter experience of every socialist country, and Mr lioberlon. it will be the bitter experience of this countrji f the Australian people accept the advice of the Leader of the Opposition or of any other member of the Opposition who has addressed himself to that subject. In my contribution to this debate, I should like to avoid, if I can, the subtle temptation to indulge in vague political abstractions. It is so easy to move out of the Pacific, across the Indian Ocean into the Mediterranean, and from the Mediterranean into the Atlantic Ocean, thence into the Pacific Ocean and finally back home, only to find that we have not solved any of our problems. It is so easy to look at the world through the wrong end of the political telescope, and see international affairs reduced to insignificance and so utterly remote that they can be of no possible importance to Opposition members or to those people outside tliis chamber who follow them so blindly. It is a common practice which must he stopped by sheer reason if this country is to be saved from its enemies. It is also not difficult, even if the telescope is used in the proper way, to colour a single lens with red, pink or even blue, according to our respective political approaches, and see the world, not as it really is, but as we wish to see it. That has been done by every Opposition member who has spoken on international affairs in this debate, and it can only be described as a childish form of selfdeception. Some Opposition memhers are treating this vital debate as if it is a humorous subject. I mean to preserve order in the chamber, and ensure that the honourable heard in silence. of you, sir, but I shall try, as far as I am able, to defend myself against interjections.

That is why foreign affairs are of such vital importance to our people. There was a time when the foreign policy of Australia wa3 clearly defined. As a component part of the great British Commonwealth of Nations our security was underwritten and guaranteed by the valiant men and women of that Commonwealth, who constituted the greatest force for good that the world has ever known. That is true, and this country is a classical example of its truth. But now we are led to believe by members of the Opposition that the British Empire is in the process of dissolution.

Our foreign policy at that time was .clearly defined and we proceeded forthwith undismayed to discharge our responsibilities undei that foreign policy, both in the letter and in the spirit.

Of course, honourable members opposite are following the lead of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), who, in initiating this debate, eulogized the work of the United Nations. When the anti-Labour parties were in Opposition they consistently attacked the Labour party for supporting the United Nations, and sneered continually at the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. E v a t t ) , who was then Ministerf o r External Affairs, for his efforts to preserve world peace through the United Nations. The best possible proof that could be given of their lack of sincerity at that time is to be found in their attitude towards that body to-day. The honourable member for Riverina went out of his way to attack the Lender of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley), who, he alleged, was not prepared to provide one man or one shilling for the defence of this country.

Labour was called upon to take office, and approximately eighteen months later a -eneral election took place. At that elecon the people had a fair opportunity o express their opinion of the fitness of Labour to govern the country during the var. What was the result of that election? Labour swept the polls. South Australia, which had returned only one Labour member to the Parliament at the previous elections, MrN . J. 0. Makin, who represented Hindmarsh, returned five Labour candidates to the ""Parliament at the 1943 election. The Labour party in South Australia won all three seats in the Senate and five out of six seats in the House of Eepresentatives. In fact, it was only by sheer luck that the anti-Labour parties managed to have one representative elected to the House of Eepresentatives. The soundness or otherwise of a nation's foreign policy is best proved in a time of peril, and the period of Australia's greatest peril was between 1939 and 194=5. For the last four and a half years of that period Labour was in office and it. laid down the foreign policy for this country. I remind honourable members opposite who falsely suggest that members of the Australian Labour Party are not prepared to defend Australia to the last man and the last shilling, that no administration that they have supported ever had the courage to introduce legislation to compel men to fight outside Australia to defend this country. Even during World WarI . , the present right honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Hughes), who was Prime Minister of Australia, did not have the courage to introduce legislation to authorize conscription. He decided instead to refer the matter to a referendum of the people, and conscription was rejected. However, I repeat that it remained for a Labour Government to order men to serve outside Australia tralia ? GoA'erninent parties did not have the courage to send them outside Australia at all. In fact, the present anti-Labour Administration Avould not have sent troops to Korea unless the United Nations had appealed to it to do so. Of course, the vigorous stand taken by the United Nations in the Korean dispute disposes of the criticism of that body uttered by honourable members opposite to the effect that the United Nations Avas merely a talking body. Even now, however, the Australian GoA'ernment has not declared Avar on the Communists in Korea although our men are fighting them in South Korea. Had it not been for the ideals, courage and patience of men like the right honourable member for Barton, who fought so. hard for the United Nations, the Communists would long ago have overrun Korea. I said! in this House four years ago, and I repeat it now, that unless the United Nations oan enforce its decisions it will be no more effectiA'e than was the Leagueof Nations. I am very glad, therefore, that Avhen the testing time came that body did display force. I was particularly disgusted by thesabre-rattling in AA'hich the honorable member for Eiverina engaged, and by his insulting insinuation that the Labourmovement in this country Avould not stand by the British people. WhilstI may not speak Avith the thick accent of"" the old country which the honorable member possesses, I yield to none in my veneration for the British people, and I utterly repudiate the implication contained in the honourable member's speech that no member of the Opposition is prepared to stand up for the King and theBritish people.

The honourable member went so f a r as to suggest that socialism leads to communism. open to the same criticism? Does not Christianity lead to socialism? and honourable members opposite know that Christianity originated in the greatest socialist who ever lived. We know that from the teachings of Christianity. I am not here to preach sermons to honourable members, but I say to some supporters of the Government that if they sincerely attempted to follow the teachings of Christianity they wonld be obliged on many occasions to cross the floor of the House and vote with us. The poliey of the Australian Labour party, whether it be called socialist or anything else, is closer to the teachings of Christianity than is the policy of any other political party. Government supporters honourable members opposite are trying to howl me down, but I am merely putting before them something that is recognized as a fact. It is all very well for them to vaunt their imperialism and to advocate military alliances with other countries, but Labour is just as determined to defend this country as they are. We, on this side of the House, know very well that we cannot successfully confront with popguns an enemy who is armed w i th machine guns. We know that this country must have adequate defence. reply to the taunts hurled at our defence policy by the honourable member for Riverina and some of his friends, I ask them what is the greatest defence project in this country. Undoubtedly it is the long-range weapons project. Was that project established by a Liberal government? that Labour established it and represents the most costly and powerful attempt to provide weapons of war with which to defend this country and the British Commonwealth that we have ever known. Yet the honourable member for Riverina had the audacity to accuse' us of not being prepared to spend a shilling on the defence of this country. Isi t likely that the Labour movement, which represents the major proportion of the people of this country rabbits ? member for Chisholm( Mr Kent, Hughes) has quite a number of rabbits Of course it does, around him at the moment. I gave the honourable gentleman, whose w it t y poetry I have admired, credit for a little moro intelligence. However, I think that a lot of his wi t must originate in a rabbit warren, where young rabbits run round and round. However, I shall leave the honourable member at that point. But 1 say that any one who tries to belittle the Labour movement by saying that it was not prepared to defend this country is telling an untruth. I admit that honourable members opposite have a perfect, right to their opinions about the methods that should be used for the defence of this country and to decide whether we should have -compulsory training. I do not interjecting, argue with that right. I say, however, I know that that in the last two wars the feats of Australia's fighting men won for them the reputation of being the finest fighters in the world. To whom belongs the credit for the provision by Australia of fighting forces to take part in the war in Korea? How much did the present Government have to do with the training of those men? It came into oflice only last December. How much did it really have to do w i th the preparation of those forces? Thet r u t h is that the.Australian forces now fighting in Korea are the proIn duct of Labour administration of our defence policy. were trained in Japan only recently. bers of the Royal Australian A i r Force unit fighting in Korea were enlisted, We all know, of course, trained and supplied with their armaments by the present Government? ber can thank Jimmy Fairbairn for that.

155,Mr Thompson,"T h a n k Jimmysay that the Labour party would not spend one shilling to defend Australia. Jimmy Fairbairn could not have done anything unless we had given him the authority to do it by agreeing to the recommendations that he made. I say definitely that the Labour party does not retreat one iota from its belief that when it was in office it did the right thing for the defence member for Riverina and other Governof this country. If the present Government can do better I shall give it all the credit it deserves. I do not say that all of the Labour Government's actions were perfect. I have heard a great deal of talk from honourable members opposite about things that require to be done before sufficient homes can be built for the people. One Minister rose and read something that was quite irrelevant about an immigrant child whom the former Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell) kissed. He said that she was now living with her family in a cow shed and he implied that the Labour party was to blame because the family did not have a proper home to live in. The Labour party believes that Australia's defence policy should provide for an integrated system of defence, including an air force, a naval force with aircraft carriers, aiid an army of the maximum strength commensurate with the requirements of man-power to maintain the industrial production of which we are in so much need. I do not mind honourable members opposite saying that they do not agree with that policy, but I do mind them attempting to belittle us by saying that we have no care for Australia's defence. Honourable members on this side pf the House have on the average just as many children and grandchildren as have Government supporters. We have just as big a stake in the future of Australia as Government supporters have, and we are just as keen to ensure that this country will be able to provide nil the needs of our descendants. The honourable member for Riverina( Mr But many of the children for whom Roberton) boasted that when he was a youth it was possible to go anywhere in the world and have the protection of British citizenship. 1 was merely expressing my gratitude for the fact. Mr Thompson. honourable member that it is not the Labour party that is responsible for deciding just who can come and go to and from America nowadays. [Extension of time granted.] The United States to-day is regarded by many people as the great democracy of the world. The honovable ment supporters are all the time holding up the United States to us as an example. Let the honourable member go to America now and try to earn his living in a job there and he will see how he will got on. Honourable members opposite try to insinuate that the Labour party brand of socialism is responsible for many modern evils. The honourable member for Eiverina asked, ""What is socialism?"". Then he talked about the different brands of socialism which, he said, were advocated by members of the Labour party. I can tell him that the Labour party's brand of socialism is very easily understood. It is to give every child in Australia an equal opportunity. It is to remove conditions in which only the children of the wealthy can afford to Httend universities while other children have no future before them but work as factory girls and labourers, because their parents have not sufficient money to give them a higher education. We do not believe iu such a system, and I do not say that all honourable members opposite believe in it. The Labour party brand of socialism has as its aim the achievement of a state of affairs in which every child in this country shall have a reasonable opportunity to gain a fair share of the rewards of production. There are many wealthy men to-day who did very little towards the accumulation of the great, possessions they now hold. On the other hand thousands of people have worked hard and long, and have gone prematurely to their graves, because of their heavy labour, so as to give their children a chance in life. they toiled are still battling along and are still on the lowest rung of the ladder. not boasting. foreign affairs?

159,Mr Thompson,"Why did not thethat interjection when the honourable member for Biverina was speaking? The reason is that as long as somebody is uttering a lot of dirty sneers about the Labour party no honourable member on thc Oovernment side will attempt to interrupt. But when I attempt to answer the statements that have been made by Government supporters the Minister in charge of the House interrupts because he can see the house of cards that was built by the honorahle member for Riverina being toppled by my arguments. There is no honourable member who desires to abide by the Standing Orders more than I do, but at the same time there is nobody in this chamber who is more ready tc take up the challenge when other honourable members take an opportunity to smear the Labour party. We can justly claim that the Labour party is a clean party, and I commend to Government supporters the virtue of such cleanliness. Many of them are very decent, clean men, but they should remember, when they start slinging off about the Labour party, lhat the Labour party is trying to prevent communism gentleman asks, ""When?""

164,Mr Swartz (Darling Downs) [3.30].,"supports the proposals of the Government that the personnel of the Australian Regular Army and the Citizen Military Forces should have the opportunity to volunteer for overseas service. I know that in that respect he is at variance with the leader of his party. I know also that other members of the Labour party are completely at variance with their leader on other matters. The honourable member made only two points in his rather long address. The second point was a definite criticism of the Menzies Government for its alleged inability to meet the defence needs of the country in the early days of the last war. He criticized it very severely and stated that when a Labour government took office in 1941 it had to do all the work of building up the armed services to a stage where we could carry on the war. I wish to remind the honourable member of the words of the late Mr of the rebel parties who could do so fled Curtin which give .a complete answer to this criticism. On the 28th May, 1941, he said. . maximum of Australia's capacity, and I doubt filtrated as far as the United States. After if anj' great improvements could have been made on what has been done That, of course, was on what had been and established temporarily in China. done by the Menzies' Government, Mr Dr. Syngman Rhee, who had led Curtin's statement continued as follows:1 have been in association with Ministers He was referring to the Australian Kim Koo was the Prime Minister. This Advisory War Council. He then progovernment functioned in some sort of ceeded as follows:The Advisory War Council and the Governwar. ment have grappled with problems in a way which I believe has been as satisfactory as was possible in tlie circumstances. In the brief time allowed to me I wish to refer to three points only. First, during this debate the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) and the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr the Potsdam Declaration and in the Beazley) criticized the Government ol South Korea under the leadership of Dr. Syngman Rhee very strongly. Before becoming critical of that Government, I think that one must have a full understanding of the background of the problems that it has faced since its inception in 194S. As honourable members know, Korea came under Japanese domination in 1905. In 1910 the kingdom of Korea was annexed by the Japanese Government. Korea has been subjected Mr Swart*. to Japanese occupation for 35 years. Those who have lived in countries urder Japanese domination can realize that, during tliose years, the Koreans lived under what were virtually slave conditions. The people suffered great privations, individually and nationally. They suffered great humiliations, and performed in the main, menial tasks. During this entire period the Korean masses were kept in a state of ignorance. Even at the present^time only 10 per cent, of the population of Korea is literate. The Japanese realized that they could wield great poweiby keeping the masses in iarnoranc-e and they did that very effectively. Despite this fact, during the period of Japanese occupation there were a number of minor rebellions and thera was one large rebellion in 1919. After this had been ruthlessly suppressed by the Japanese occupation army those leaders from the country and quite a lot of them took refuge in China, across the northern border in Manchuria, and in the islands the war has been prosecuted to the south of Japan. In some cases they in the rebellion of 1919 a provisional government of Korea was set up the rebellion, was the leader of the provisional government. A person named way until the commencement of the la=t Honourable members know that in thu Cairo declaration of 1.943, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and China declared that after the war Korea should become a free and independent nation. This was confirmed by Japanese instrument of surrender which was signed in Tokio Bay. It was agreed by all the signatories to these-agreements that Korea should eventually become a free and independent nation.. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was a signat tory to both the latter agreements. 'Since the termination of the last war, Korea has been divided into two distinct sections which, geographically, politically or in any other way were never intended to exist. Despite the remark made some Sime ago by a member of the Goverament to the effect that, racially, the people of Korea are divided, I contend strongly t h a t they are not. I support the Prime Minister's statement that they are racially one. Although there are some distinctions between the north and south they are no -more divided racially than Australia is racially divided between New 'South ""Wales, Queensland, Victoria and the other .States. Tliere were two major difficulties in the way of the establishment of any .government in Korea after the last war. 'One was that the Japanese, as part of their policy of subjection, encouraged large land holdings, particularly in south Korea, the main agricultural area. This .policy aimed at establishing what has been described in this House as a kind of feudal system. .arose from the fact that at the conclusion >of the war the groups of revolutionaries who had been responsible for the rebellions which occurred throughout the -Japanese occupation returned to Korea ;and took an active part in the political .affairs of the post-war period. When the .government was established in 1948 there were approximately 100 separate political -groups functioning in Korea. The TJnited Nations temporary commission undertook to supervise elections for the establishment of a national government in Korea. Wheni t arrived there ifc found that the conduct of elections north of the 38th parallel was-impossible as that area was under Russian -domination although Russian troops had left the area by that time. Prior to the. free election a government known as the National Assembly of Korea had been -established in the southern part of the -country. recognized by the TJnited Nations temporary commission, and it came to be known as the "" Seoul Assembly"". .Dr. .Syngman Rhee was appointed as its president. It was not until May, 1948. that the United Nations Commission was able to arrange for the first free election to be held, in South Korea. In the words of the report of the commission, the elections of May, 194S, proved to be a valid expression of the free w ill of the electors in those parts of Korea that were accessible to the commission. The new government was faced with almost insurmountable difficulties. The people and the members of the government had had no previous training in democracy as we know it . The country was divided into approximately 100 political groups. A tremendous problem had been created by its division into North and South Korea. North Korea had the main industrial centres while South Korea was principally an agricultural area. Taking all these factors into consideration, I think that it is the duty of honourable members, not to criticize the existing government of Korea, but to help it . I know the Koreans. I lived with them for some years. I have met good and bad Koreans, and I know what posAnother big problem sibilities the average Korean has for the future. I think that it is the duty of Australia and the United Nations organization, not only to the Koreans, but also to the rest of the world, to teach the people of Korea democracy. I do not think that the government of the republic of Korea should be criticized at this stage. It should be encouraged to overcome its difficulties and helped to become a real democracy. The second point to which 1 wish to refer is that of the present situation in Indo-China. To realize the problem of that country, I think it essential to have some idea of the present political and military position there. The modern history of Indo-China goes back to the years between 1862 and 1897, when France acquired this territory. In 1898, the Union of Indo-China came under the control of the French Government. Certain native territories, at that time, were still maintained on an independent That government was not basis, but came within the sphere of influence of the French Government. The most important of these was the Annamese territory, which has figured prominently in the news of the last few days. For 42 years this country was under French control, which did not end until the French capitulated to Germany in 1940. That event brought the close economic and military association between the province of Indor-'China and France to an abrupt end. Immediately this occurred, the Japanese pressure on Indo China commenced and, within a few months, the border between Indo-China and China was closed, despite objections by the Erench administration in Indo China. Shortly afterwards, Japanese troops marched into Tongking, a northern province of Indo-iChina, and occupied it, but, at the same time, they agreed to recognize the French administration over the whole of Indo-China. In the southern part of the country, pressure was brought to bear by the Thais who moved across the Thailand border and militarily occupied a portion of the territory of Laos, which was within the borders of Indo-China at the time. In July, 1941, the Japanese occupied the whole of Indo-China, excluding the southern portion of Laos, but maintained the existing French administration of the territory. When the war was drawing to a close the French administration ljecame a little more friendly towards the allies and the allied cause. This was disturbing from a Japanese point of view, and Japan issued an ultimatum to Indo China. It was rejected and the Japanese conducted military manoeuvres in the country and removed the French administration from office. In March, 1945, the Japanese took complete control of the territory. At this time Tokyo announced that the Emperor Bao Dai had renounced the existing French treaty and had joined the co-prosperity sphere which was being extended as a sphere of Japanese influence throughout the Far East. At the same time the Japanese administration declared the independence of Cambodia and Laos. After the Japanese surrender to the Allies this system of independent States wa9 overthrown by a revolution led by a group known as the Vietminh. Up to this time the Vietminh had been a nationalist movement, had been active in Indo-China since 1908. In .1945 the Communist party of Indo-China gradually extended its influence into the Vietminh, and by 1.949 the Communist party of Indo China had completely dominated the Vietminh party. The Communist party in Indo-China. had been founded in 1930 by a person named Ho Chi Minh, a name which has some significance to-day. He had made a careful study of Marxism and had spent a considerable time in Moscow, Mr Swartz. where he was completely indoctrinated with the philosophy of communism. In 1930, Ho Chi Minh had established the Indo-Chinese Communist Party, and shortly afterwards he was imprisoned by the British for his Communist activities in this area. [Extension of time granted.'] After his return to' China he immediately commenced to organize uprisings on the Indo-Chinese border. That was during 1940. In 1941 he founded the Vietnam or League of Independent Vietnam. He was arrested in 1943 by the Chinese National Government but was released shortly after. He again operated against the Chinese through the Vietnam. After the surrender of Japan, Bao Dai, the original Annamese Emperor, abdicated, and the Vietminh proclaimed a republic of Vietnam. At that time France was not in a position to re-occupy Indo-China, so arrangements were made with the British and Chinese Governments for British and Chinese troops to re-occupy the territory. The Chinese troops were to occupy fche northern part of Indo-China and the British troops the southern part, and the French administration was to be recognized. At this time the Vietminh Government bad declared itself a Republic of Vietnam and was administering the country. Certain difficulties arose when the British and Chinese troops tried to recognize the French administration. The Vietminh group was still in power, but although in the south the British did not officially recognize the Vietminh administration,, in thc north the Chinese did so. In 1945 there was a most interesting occurrence. The Indo-Chinese Communist Party was dissolved and something occurred which should make honourable members opposite think carefully. Within one month of the dissolution of the Indo-Chinese Communist Party it had been reformed and was known as the Marxist Association. The Chinese withdrew from the north of the country in 1946 and were replaced hy French units. The area previously occupied by Thailand in the south was taken over by the French forces. There was an agreement between France and Vietnam in' March, 1.946, which recognized the Republic of Vietnam within the French Union. The French TJnion at that time was intended to include the Eepublics of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. A break-down of negotiations occurred between the Vietminh organization and the French Government. In July, 1946, at Fontainbleau in France, the cleavage was made wider and from that day the Vietminh' Government has been openly opposed to the French administration. The French realized this, and Bao Dai was persuaded to return to Indo-China, where he became president of a new Government of Vietnam. From the establishment of Bao Dai's regime in Indo-China warfare commenced between the provisional Vietminh Government and the recognized official governments in the French TJnion. That is the story loading up to the pvesent situation, but of more significance is the fact that the Vietminh Government is recognized by the central Peoples Government of China at Peking and hy Eussia. There are two distinct forces operating in the French TJnion. One is the Communist, force of Vietminh, and the other is the French and Republican force of the French Union. Thc present attacks on the French forces are definitely those conducted by Ho Chi Minh, whose Vietminh forces are being strongly supported by the Chinese Communists under Mao Tse-tung. Supplies, ammunition and specialist troops are being supplied at the because personnel under the national present time to the Vietminh forces by Mao Tse-tung. The trouble in Indo China is more than a horder incident. It is a further advance of international comtraining periods in the Citizen Military munism in the East. While the pressure may ease in Korea, it is becoming stronger on the border of Indo-China at the present time. This situation that I have detailed should be closely examined and its implications should be realized so far as the future of Australia is concerned. Finally, I refer to the third matter. During the speech of the honorahle member for Parkes( Mr Haylen), he made a statement to the effect that he did not consider the national service prowhen I was wrongly accused of having posals of the Government were necessary, ar.d that the present Citizen Military Forces were sufficient to carry on the work to answer some charges made by the required of them. I have been a serving member of the Citizen Military Forces since they were re-established in 1947. I can say definitely to the honourable member for Parkes and to other honourable members opposite that the post-war Citizen Military Forces system is a complete failure for three reasons. The first reason for its failure is its lack of numbers. The paper strength detailed to the people of Australia by the previous Government indicated that its strength was reasonably satisfactory. The majority of those figb.esgiven to the public were on paper only, and the personnel was just not there. That was a form of deception practised by the previous Government, and I know from my experience that the figures it gsve were completely false. The second reason for the failure of the Citizen Military Forces is that they are given insufficient periods of training. In the time allotted soldiers cannot be trained to bts efficient. They can be given only slight background training. The third reas?,u for thc failure of the Citizen Military I'orces is the lack of continuity of training. Some members of the forces, for example, attend parades one night or one week-end, and stay away possibly for a long period. There is also a big turnover of personnel which means that there is an entire lack of continuity of training. Under the present proposals of the Government an opportunity exists to give complete training service system are to be given three months' continuous training with further periods of a fortnight a year and home, Forces. That system should ensure a reasonable standard of efficiency. It is vital that our defence system should be capable of ready expansion. When honourable members analyse the political situation in the Far East they would do well to remember the motto of an Australian Imperial Fo' ^es unit of which I was once a member, it was "" Never unprepared "". not intend to speak in this debate, but interjected I thought that it was time that I had something to say. I also desire honourable member for Eiverina( Mr Eoberton). Apparently he tried to quote",45,Opposition Members Hear Hear
165,Mr James (Hunter) [3.43],"I didpoetry. I cannot understand why he defeated his predecessor in the last general election, because that gentleman was certainly the better poet. The honourable member for Eiverina accused the Opposition of being concerned only with money. Some honourable members on this side have sacrificed a considerable amount of money for the privilege of-sitting in this House. 1 refer particularly to the right honorahle member for Barton (Dr. Evatt), who sacrificed a position, the salary of which was £3,000 a year, with the prospect of a pension upon retirement of £2,500 a year, for the possibility of £850 a year if elected to this House. Despite the criticism of the honourable member for Riverina, the right honourable member for Barton was one of those who was instrumental in setting up the United Nations organization, which was created precisely for the purpose of preventing future wars. On the other hand, the present Government regards the United Nations as an organization which should be used to cause war and not to avert war by agreement among its members to make available to it quotas of armed forces in order to combat aggression in any part of the world. Riverina said that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) had stated that the Labour party would not make available a man or a shilling to defend this country. T challenge the honourable member to produce his authority for that statement, because the Leader of the Opposition did not say anything of the kind. What the right honourable gentleman said was that the Labour party would not co-operate in the Government's recruiting campaign because recruits were to be enlisted for service in any part of the world. At the same time, he made it clear that Labour would support the recruitment of forces for the defence of Australia. I shall remind the honourable member for Riverina of certain events that occurred during World War II. What happened when the present Government parties were in office during the early part of that conflict? They quarrelled among themselves with the result that two of their supporters gave their allegiance to the Labour party and were instrumental in bringing about Labour's Mr .lumen. assumption to office in October, 1941, because they believed that only Labour,, which was then led by the late John Curtin, could effectively prosecute thenation's war effort. That belief wasfully justified by subsequent events. A t great risk as leader of the Labour party,, the late John Curtin succeeded .in persuading the party to liberalize its defencepolicy to allow men conscripted for warservice to fight outside our shores in areas as far north as the equator. Thenewspapers, not only in Australia, but also overseas, praised the Labour party for the magnificent way that it prosecuted our war effort. In contrast, what was the record of the Liberal party when it was in office during the early years of the conflict? At that time Australia did not possess a modern aeroplane or tank,, and it did uot have nearly sufficient rifleswith which to equip our Army. In manydistricts in my electorate I saw recruitsdrilling with broomsticks because no rifleswere available. In the industrial spherein 1942, after Labour had assumed office, coal production readied a record that has-not been equalled since. When the present Government parties were in power previously, the Minister for The honourable member for External Affairs( Mr Spender), the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) and the Minister foithe Interior (Senator Eoll) made visits overseas. Upon1 their return to this country the two lastmentioned gentlemen declared that Singapore was safe. But shortly afterwards, Singapore fell to the Japanese. What contribution did the Ministerf o r External Affairs, who was then Minister for tlie Army, make to the war effort?' He made a visit to the Middle East and' wheii he saw that our troops in that area were doing nothing, he suggested that the Government should send women'sauxiliary forces to the Middle East because suoh forces would have a. quietening, or softening, effect upon the Australian troops. About the same time, hepromoted himself to the rank of colonelhe had recommended that women's auxiliary forces should he sent to the Middle East. The late John Curtin, when he was Prime Minister, was veryworried , when the Japanese entered the-",49,Opposition Members Hear Hear
166,Mr Ward,What for?,50,Opposition Members Hear Hear
167,Mr James,"Apparently , becauseconflict. It is now history that when the Japanese were within 80 miles of the Queensland coast he had a wireless telephone conversation with Mr Churchill, -who was then the British Prime Minister, in which he demanded that the Australian troops in the Middle East he returned to these shores. Mr Churchill replied, "" I cannot get sufficient ships -even to transport food for the people of Britain because of the losses that are being caused by U-boats"". Mr Curtin then said, "" I will go elsewhere"". Details of that conversation were recounted to members of the Parliament at -a secret session and also at a meeting of the Labour caucus. When Mr Churchill .asked where he would go, Mr Ourtin replied, "" I will go to America "". He did -so, and I say with all reverence, "" Thank God, Roosevelt answered Curtin's call to -send American troops to this country"". The honourable member for Riverina :said that Australian troops who were serving in the Middle East were bundled hack to Australia. The Labour Government brought them back here in order to -defend this country against the Japanese. Because of the action that Mr Curtin took on that occasion some newspapers said that he was cutting the painter. To those charges he replied, "" No; I am -defending Australia. As Churchill has the duty of defending Great BritainI , ;as the first citizen in Australia, have the -duty of defending it, and I shall do so "". Mr Ourtin was then living at the Prime Minister's Lodge at Canberra, and we !know that while the troopships from the Middle East were on the water he did not 'have a wink of sleep because if one of those transports had been sunk the fathers .and mothers of those who would have lost tbeir lives would have blamed him for bringing back those troops without escorts -and in defiance of Churchill's wishes. If ever a man died as a casualty of war Mr Cnrtin did so; and -honourable members who have criticized Labour's .administration during the recent war have done him a grave injustice. The press of Australia had nothing but praise for Labour's war-time administration because Labour saved this country from invasion. When Roosevelt answered -our call, I admit that he could see the advantage of using Australia as an outer bastion in the defence of the United States of America; but by the same token we benefited immensely from the action that he took. Many peculiar circumstances have arisen in the international sphere since the end of the recent war. Most honourable members will recall that Russia made a pact with Germany shortly after that conflict broke out, although just prior to doing so the Russian Government had shot 21 of its generals because they had fraternized with members of the German General Staff. We were informed at a secret session that the endeavours of the Government of Great Britain to make a pact with Russia had failed and that, following that faihire, representatives of the Labour party, with the blessing of the Russian Minister in London, sent a mission to Russia to make another effort to arrange such a pact. While those representatives were negotiating with Molotov in one room, Stalin in another 2*0010 signed a pact with Germany under which Russia later supplied armaments to Germany. Subsequently, however, Hitler made the fatal mistake of attacking Russia. It is useless for members of the Communist party to say that Russia came into'the war of its own volition. It was forced . into the war because Hitler attacked it ; and 1, personally, was thankful that he did. Prior to Germany's attack upon RussiaI met a Communist who was a. member of the miners' management board. I said, "" Sammy, I suppose you will be back in the war now"". He replied, "" No; no imperialist war for me "". I then said, "" But Russia is in the war now; it is not an imperialist war "". When I said that, he stopped and thought. That was typical of the attitude of the Communists in this country at that time. What happened? Shortly after Hitler attacked Russia, the Australian Communist party changed its policy and, instead of declaring that the conflict was an imperialist war, Communists said it was a just war because Russia was fighting on our side. Later still, industrial production in Australia increased substantially. Russia has signed a pact under which it agreed to permit every nation to work out its own destiny in its own way. But is it honouring that pact at present? It is not doing so. has happened in Eussian satellite countries in which the people are no better off than the Germans were under Hitler. I sincerely believe that Eussia is bent upon world conquest. Now, when Eussia is at variance with its old allies we hear the Communists in this country raising the cry, "" Ban the atom bomb 1 Hands off Korea!"" WhilstI do not claim to be a religious man I am a good Christian. The Labour party stands for democracy and Christianity. Sovietism and Hitlerism believe absolutely in dictatorship and totalitarianism. I do not believe in them. I am a great democrat, and I want to die a Christian democrat. Above all, I shall stand, and fight, and shed my blood in opposing any person who tries to deprive ns of the right of freedom of worship. tory) [4.1] I have listened with great interest to many speeches that have been made in this debate on international affairs. Some of them have been fiery, and have met with such fiery retorts as to make them entirely interesting. The idea has even occurred to me that it was not wholly fortuitous that Sampson selected the jawbone of an as with which to cause such havoc among his enemies. However, I do not wish to dilate on matters of that kind. I should merely like, as an independent member of this House, and as one who is not burned up with party politics on this occasion, to express my appreciation of the Government's most realistic approach to foreign policy. I believe that never before in the history of the Commonwealth has a Government, in time of peace, approached the problems of international relations ancl foreign affairs with such positive views as the present Government has approached them. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) is to be congratulated on having linked in such a definite manner the foreign policy of Australia with the defence of this country, and every Australian who is prepared to devote some critical and analytical thought to the whole position will agree that a great service has been done not only to Australia but also to the Commonwealth of Nations by the right honourable gentleman, not only in the precincts of this We know what House but also overseas. The complete co-ordination of our foreign policy with our home defence policy, and even witb our domestic policy, is the surest^ and,, indeed, the only method by which we can prepare ourselves to meet an emergency,, and enable us to play our part if , unfortunately, we should be called upon to doso. The Government has adopted a positive approach that has been neglected for too long in peace-time. Frankly, I am one of those who, in the past, offered criticism of the TJnited Nations. When the League of Nations rose Phoenix-like from thecrematoria! ashes of World WarI . , we built great hopes upon it. The whole world was animated with the belief that all the international problems and obligations that had been the dynamic force in driving countries to war, would be dispelled, and that, in the forum of the League of Nations, international difiiculties would be resolved to the satisfaction of all parties. However, the League of Nations, born as it was from good intentions, and fostered and nurtured by those who trod the international stage, became an international debating society and ultimately passed away, drowned by the verbosity of the delegates who attended its assemblies. Even while our hopes were centred on the League of Nations, some men, with criminal intent, were planning for war. In the fullness of time, the world again approached the brink of conflict, and then was engulfed in World War II . After the democracies had emerged successfully from that conflict, the TJnited Nations arose from the cremated ashes of extraordinary destruction of human life and devastation of property. Never wa3 an organization founded in more auspicious circumstances. It had the goodwill and good wishes of many countries, and was in the hands of competent statesmen, whose place in history is assured. However, the TJnited Nations, like the League of Nations, threatened to become verbose. Its delegates clapped the telescope to the blind eye so that they failed to see many developments that had all the pattern, of war. It is hardly necessary for me to remind the House of the many incidents affecting the peace of the world that occurred under",50,Opposition Members Hear Hear
168,Dr. Nott (Australian Capital Terri,"their very noses. The Malayan incident, the Burma incident and the Indo-Ohina incident are prominently in our minds. Throughout the world, the greatest industrial turmoil in history occurred. All tliose developments were a part of a pattern of events that were being fostered and encouraged in many countries. What was their origin ? Most of them were due to the infiltration of fifth columns. The honourable member for Hunter( MrI consider that Australia is privileged James) has referred to the Iron Curtain that isolates the satellite countries of Bussia from Western Europe. They became satellites after plans had been well and truly laid by fifth columnists who had made peaceful penetration or industrial turmoil the basis of their infiltration, until more sinister figures who had been lurking in the background were ready to seize power. Then the Iron Curtain was rung down on each satellite. Those dramatic incidents were occurring while the TJnited Nations was in session. When the delegates of the democracies were earnestly discussing measures to safeguard the peace of the world, Vishinsky and other Soviet delegates engaged in sabre-rattling and stage-acting, always at the crucial moment attempting, by discussions on procedure,' to distract attention from those incidents, and to prethe Government that the Citizen Milivent the TJnited Nations from reaching a decision that would be a contributing factor to world peace. So far as I have been able to discover, in reviewing the activities of the United Nations, no effort was ever made by the delegates to combat the greatest and most fearsome of all the infiltrations that the world has contend that we must wait until we are known. For those reasons, I became critical of the United Nations. I thought that it was functioning like many centenarian eunuchs would if they were discussing birth control. That was about the status that I awarded to the United Nations at that time. Then the dark clouds of war loomed on the Korean horizon, and the United Nations immediately called for support against the aggressor. Thank God, Australia was one of the first nations that answered the call, and sent forces overseas to give backbone to the United Nations action. Thanks to the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the other countries that provided military, naval and air forces and financial aid to the United Nations, that organization will be a contributing factor to world peace in future. I believe that the Korean incident has stiffened the United Nations, and made possible an organization that, for all time, will be a contributing factor to world peace, and will make potential aggressors think twice before they take the irrevocable step. to be a memher of the United Nations, since it has proved itself a dynamic organization, but our membership imposes responsibilities upon us. One of them, which is now obvious to every one, is that we must accept our share of military, naval and air preparedness. I was pleased to learn that the Prime Minister, in a positive fashion that will give general satisfaction in this country, has decided to dovetail foreign policy with home defence. I am astounded that any objection should be offered to the proposal that men who wish to enlist in the Army shall become liable to fight overseas. Members of the Labour party have no qualms about throwing the Royal Australian Air Force into ahail of bullets in Korea, yet they are offering an illogical objection to the decision of tary Forces and the Regular Army shall be available, if necessary, for service overseas. Opposition members do uot object to the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force fighting in any quarter of the globe. It is a quaint kind of fireside strategy to attacked before we may strike a blow. Under the United Nations, a global strategy may be devised in accordance with which every member of the United Nations will take its place in the field of battle. I believe that the rally to the United Nations that has taken place since the outbreak of the war in Korea has made the possibility of a global war more remote than ever. I listened with considerable interest to the speech of the honourable member for Hunter, and particularly to the tribute that he paid to the late Mr John Curtin. If anything, his praises of the late right honourable gentleman understated the facts. John Curtin was as definitely a war casualty as was any man who was struck down on the field of battle because of the overwhelming burden that he had to bear as the leader of this nation. Yet nobody in Australia paid a higher tribute to the war preparations of his predecessor than did he. Living in a democracy, we always hope for peace and are never fully prepared for war. Therefore, notwithstanding the sound foundations that had been laid by anti-Labour governments, a considerable period had to elapse before Australia was in a position to strike any blows of consequence against our enemies. I shall not discuss the recall of Australian forces to this country during the war. The decision to bring our fighting men back to Australia was made, I assume, upon the decisions of the war staffs as well as those of the Prime Minister and the war cabinet of the day. I offer no cviticism of those decisions. I merely remind honourable members of the praise of the war-time anti-Labour governments that was uttered unstintingly by John Ourtin. I deeply regret the intrusion of rancour into a debate upon a subject which affects the very existence of the nation and which should bring forth from all parties the utmost willingness to co-operate for the good of the people. Our position to-day is perilous and it can be improved only by continued preparation for defence. The development of industry lies pari passu with the development of aerial defence. The very basis of an adequate defence plan for Australia is a proper system of aerial defence. Our air striking forces should be based well inland in readily defensible positions adjacent to industries wbich can provide replacements promptly. Everybody should know that, in the event of war, we should be prepared for about 30 per cent, of casualties in the air in the first shock of conflict. must be replaced immediately, and properly located industries are necessary for that purpose. I believe that the Government is not unmindful of the nation's needs in that respect. I believe also that, it is. earnestly endeavouring to equip Australia to meet the dangers which threaten us, but which will recede in the fullness of time if we pursue a positive foreign policy. As an independent member of this House who has listened to all Or. Nott. speeches in this debate and stripped thenn of party bitterness, I congratulate the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) upon the realistic approach that he has made to a very difficult subject. I am sure that naycongratulations will be endorsed by most, of the people of Australia. After listening to most of the speeches by members of the Opposition in this debate on international affairs, it was quiterefreshing for me to hear the honorable member for Hunter( Mr James) expressthe opinion that the Communist empirethreatens the peace of the whole world. He said that the Communist empirerepresented a greater menace to the peaceloving nations than Hitler had ever been.. I join with him in that belief, and I regret that so many of his colleagues disagree with him. In June of this year,, the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) told us that there was no danger of war and that any talk of war was mere bluff, bombast, and hypocrisy. A few short weeks later, the honourable? gentleman saw the spark that was in Korea burst into a flame that spread intoa conflagration which menaced not only Korea, but also the peace and security of the rest of the world. Militarily, the tideof f ortune is with us in Korea now. Fortunately for humanity and the future of democracy, the United Nations was able to rally its forces in time. We have been able to save face in Korea and the threat to us there is diminishing. But a great and terrible danger still threatens"" usfrom the Communist empire, which is thegreatest empire, in numbers, and perhaps in force, that this world has knownMany of us conjecture, but none of us know where the next Communist thrust will be launched. Deep in the hearts of Casualties the most optimistic of us lies a dreadful fear that there will be another outbreak of hostilities. We do not know whereor when it may occur. We do not know what preparations to make against it.. But the people who backed the North Koreans with their might are eager and' willing and have the initiative to move into battle against the free peoples of the world at the hour when they are ready to do so. And when they strike the wholeworld will be shocked.",52,Opposition Members Hear Hear
169,Mr Pearce (Capricornia) [4.19],"Aftei the Prime Minister( Mr1 Menzies) had made his statement on international affairs, memlbers of the Opposition rose one after the other to tell us that we must not send our soldiers overseas. In other words, they said what tlieir masters, the Communist-inspired and controlled trade unions, had been saying for a long time"" Hands off Korea"" or "" Hands off "" somewhere else. I wonder whether those honourable gentlemen will be consistent if the "" red "" tide that is rolling towards Australia sweeps on until finally it touches the shores of New Guinea, as it may well do? Will they then say, "" We would not allow troops to go to Korea and so we cannot send them to New Guinea""? If the tide sweeps on to Australia, will they chorus, "" Hands off Australia "" ? Our enemy is the giant octopus of communism that straddles the world, and we do not know wiiere it will make its next attack. The free peoples of the world have an obligation to resist communism and, if they value their lives and their security, as well as the peace and prosperity of the world, they must unite to fight the menace. Much has been said about the foreign policy that was pursued by Labour governments in recent years. I watched the activities of those governments from the sidelines and, as an onlooker, perhaps I saw more of the game than did the players. The activities of the socialist Government that preceded this Government endangered the international relations of Australia. The manner in which its immigration, policy was administered angered neighbouring nations. Its attitude towards the United Nations was short-sighted. The right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt), as Minister for External Affairs, was a Oommunist dupe or stooge. Whether wilfully or ignorantly, he carried Communist and socialist policies right into the very heart of the United Nations, and thereby seriously threatened the peace and security of the world. Within Australia, as the socialists gradually gained might, they became power-drunk and control-crazy and sought to give unrestrained effect to their ideas about nationalization. The result was that many people whom we wanted to come to Australia, and who could have aided us, became jittery. Thus we were deprived of the help of many friends who would have settled amongst us if socialists had not been in charge of the country. In 1946, the socialists declared that we were entering upon a golden age and were about to reap all the fruits of peace and prosperity. They told the people of Australia, "" This is your opportunity to enjoy greater wealth than ever before"". Eor three years prior to the election of 1949 their cry to the people was, "" Do not worry about what is * happening outside. Leave it in the hands of the right honourable member for Barton; he will handle all those problems. We are all right. We are secure ancl we can sell all our war equipment. We still have a .few men in the Citizen Military Forces. This is the golden age."" I believe that history does repeat itself, and my mind goes back to the fall of the great Babylonian empire after Belshazzar had succeeded his grandfather, King Nebuchadnezzar. Belshazzar, looking at the Medes and Persians arrayed outside his city, said to his people, ""We have huge walls to protect us. We have farms inside those walls that can produce all the food that we need. Bring out the golden vessel and pour out the wine."" Sothe. Babylonians lived much as Australians lived under the Labour Administration. Their eyes were blinded to the danger that threatened them. The full might of the Medes and Persians was poised aga.inst them just as the full might of the great Bussian empire has been poised outside the walls of Australia for such a long time. There came a day when the empire of Babylon fell in the midst of a feast. The people stood on the walls and jeered at the armies of Darius, the Mede, and said, "" We are safe. They will never capture us. We are living in a golden age."" That night the kingdom fell and their king was slain. It is interesting to note that the Medes entered the city through the seivers. The Communists who are trying to sabotage Australia are rising from the sewers also. Under the administration of the Labour Government we behaved just as the Babylonians did. But fortunately, though no godly hand wrote "" Finish"" to that Government's reign, as happened in Babylon, the hand of the Australian people took up its pencil on tlie 10th December last, put its mark in the right square, and elected a Government which, at the very .least, has a realistic appreciation of the dangers that threaten us from beyond our shores. We must face up to the fact that the period in which we are now living is one of greater danger to us than has been any other. The hungry and hurt eyes of other nations are looking enviously on our wide fields, scattered population and untapped potentialities. Therefore, we must be realistic ^n our foreign policy. The policy that has been advanced by this Government might be expressed in the slogan, ""Population, production and preparation"". Indeed, those objectives have gone forth to the people as a clarion call, and I believe that they realize that in the present Government they have a body of men which intends to govern. I think that the people also recognize the present Government's appreciation of the difficulties that confront us, and are confident that it is prepared to populate the country, increase production and prepare us to defend our heritage in case that should become necessary. WhilstI believe that we should support the TJnited Nations, and that that organization affords our only hope for peace in the world, I do not think that the Government of this or of any other country can properly defend itself and co-operate whole-heartedly with the TJnited Nations in the defence of peace while its internal security is menaced by communism. The Australian Government is being hamstrung at every turn by the antics of the followers of the former Labour Administration that was defeated so soundly at the last general election. Indeed, it is tragic that even in this Parliament the Socialist party should play the game which the Communists want them to play. By its attitude the Opposition is affording the Communists an invaluable breathing space in which to organize their defences. Although the Communists are lurking in the sewers and gutters, preparing to rise and take our kingdom from us, the Labour party says, "" Leave them alone and let them come out into the open. After all, communism Let us be realistic and recognize Mr I'earce. that the great majority of Australians know that a Communist can never be a good Australian, a good citizen or a good Christian. All that he can be is a good Communist. After all, the Australian Communists have exactly the same outlook as have the Communists of North Korea and those in the heart of Moscow. The Communists in this country live in the hope that some day they will be able to take over Australia and subsitute their way of life for the democratic freedom that we enjoy at present. Of course, there will be no war unless Russia begins it. But how can we be assured that Russia is content with the territorial gains that it has made during the last few years? No one but a fool would believe such a thing; but, unfortunately, it appears that we have many fools in Australia and that some of them are not far from here. I listened to the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson) discussing socialism, Christianity and a lot of other matters. Whilst there is no doubt that the problems which confront us at present involve great moral issues, including Christianity, it is absurd that such a professed champion of Christianity as is the honourable gentleman should use his vote ia this House to assist the Communists, who are the declared enemies of Christianity. It is utterly hypocritical for the honourable member to advocate socialism, and to compare it with Christianity, while all the time he knows of the deadly struggle that is being waged by the Communists to sweep away Christianity and everything that we hold dear. It must have been a great relief to the people of Australia to hear the speech made by the Prime Minister who initiated this debate. The result of recent Gallup polls shows that the people are confident that in the right honourable gentleman they have one who is able and ready to lead them, and who will leave no stone unturned to protect our way of life and to ensure, as far as it is possible for any government to do so, that we shall live in peace, contentment and security. The debate has covered most of the is just a philosophy"". matters with which our foreign policy should be concerned, and considerable emphasis has been placed on the part that",54,Opposition Members Hear Hear
170,Mr Mackinnon (Wannon) [4.37],"Australia must play if it is to f u l f i l its ing the defence of this country must be duty as a member of the United Nations. I think that on all sides of the House there is a genuine realization of the actualities of the situation and of the dangerous threat of war which hangs over the world. There seems also to be general agreement that the forces of communism, which are spreading over the face of the earth, constitute a most dangerous menace to the freedom of the democratic and peaceloving nations. flare-up in Korea, many people have speculated regarding whether our intervention in that country would lead to another world war. I have never believed that it would, and I see no reason to alter my opinion. long as Russia continues to gain its objectives by the methods that it has been using so successfully I do not think that it will commit itself to war. Although we believe that, fortunately, the Korean situation has reached a satisfactory conclusion, we are still confronted with immense dangers and difficulties that arise out of Communist aggression. If the future of Korea is to be determined satisfactorily the greatest statesmanship will be required from all members of the United Nations, including of course, Australia. Our successful intervention in Korea has administered a tempo-rary check to Soviet ambitions there, but it is only reasonable to expect that Russian aggression w ill be manifested in other countries, particularly in East Asia. The The honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Swartz) stressed the significance of what is occurring in Erench Indo China, and we must expect the Communists to continue to make trouble there. There is evidence of a similar situation arising in Tibet, and the conquest of that country would threaten the integrity of the entire Indian peninsula. Middle East and particularly in I r a n , where trouble may occur over the oil deposits, we may expect further Communist intervention. In Europe, we cannot regard with equanimity the present situation in Berlin or in the rest of Germany. Those are some of the difficulties that confront us to-day. It is clear, therefore, that we must have a realistic approach to world affairs, and that those who are responsible for organizalive to the dangers that beset us. Our foreign policy and our obligations to the United Nations have three principle features. The first is, of course, defence, about which a great deal has been said in this debate. I believe that the general public is f u l l y aware of the necessity for Australia to he ready, not only to protect itself, but also to support the United Natio-ns. The Government Consequent upon the believes that our security can best be safeguarded by having our three armed services available for service on our outpost lines, where they may be required by the United Nations to deal with any situation that may threaten world peace. So Most, but not all, members of the Opposition have adopted the extraordinary attitude that whilst our naval and air forcesshould be available for use any where in the world, our volunteer ground forcesshould not be available for service overseas. Honourable members w ill notice that I have deliberately qualified my reference to members of the Opposition by using the word "" most"". It should hardly be necessary to point out that if our ground forces are not available for service overseas we shall merely repeat the mistakes of previous wars, when, in order to despatch ground forces overseas, we had to break up pur existing formations and establish an entirely separate organization which, of course, necessitated costly and' dangerous delays. The second feature of our foreign policy, which has also been thoroughly discussed during the course of the debate, is the provision of economic aid to backward countries, particularly to those inSouth-East Asia. I believe that, speaking generally, the Australian public recognizes that because we enjoy a high In the standard of livin g we should be prepared in the interests of world peace, tofurnish some assistance to backward peoples. The important point to bear in mind is that in conferring economic aid on backward nations we should ensure that it shall be put to proper use. In otherwords, we should insist that tliose nations that receive the goods and services which we supply use them for the sole purpose of raising their standard of living and so bring about a state of contentment amongst their peoples. Another problem that ha.; been casually mentioned during this debate relates to education, particularly religious and political education. An analysis of the fantastic success of Communist imperialism in various parts of the werld would show that it has been due, to a great degree, to the indoctrination with Communist ideology of certain elements of the populations of countries outside Eussia, who had been selected for their mental and physical qualifications, and had then been sent back to their own countries to force the Communist doctrine on their own people. I think that we have in that policy a lesson that we might well study. I propose to refer at greater length to that suhject, but I shall deal now with the subject of Christianity. I recall a remark that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) made, in an earlier debate, concerning the rapid growth of communism in Eastern European countries. If my memory serves me aright he said that the Christian church must bear its share of responsibility for that rapid growth. I consider that to be both an amazing and an inaccurate statement, because all the world knows that the various countries concerned -Poland, Eastern Germany, Bulgaria, Boumania, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary-were not conquered from within by communism. They were conquered because of the presence of the "" Eed"" army and by the assistance that the M.V.D., the Eussian secret police, gave to subversive and criminal Communist elements in those countries when they acted to assume control of their governments. Communist parties before that happened. fact, but those parties did not represent majority public opinion in those countries. It was only the pressure of the "" Eed"" army and the activities of the Eussian secret police that enabled those Communist parties to assume member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) would be the first to admit that if ever there was flavour. But in the next two or three a case of a country in which a free democracy was overthrown, .'it was Czechoslovakia. ment of the Leader of the Opposition, in which he attached blame to the Christian church for the rapid 'growth of communism in .the countries of Eastern; Europe, and for which, incidentally, he was taken to task at the time by a member of. his own party, quite rightly I believe, was not justifiable. An analysis of the facts will show that far from failing to combat communism the Christian church has been, and will continue to be, one of the greatest bulwarks against the future spread of communism. I suggest that the activities' of the Christian church are an aspect of the struggle for world peace that might well be studied by the TJnited Nations, and particularly by the TJnited States and the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. Anybody, no matter of what church or creed, will agree that there is a place in world affairs for the Christian church, not only in providing an actual example of right thinking, but also in spreading Christian education. ' That point brings me back to the subject of education, particularly political education. I believe that the TJnited Nations can achieve distinct results in this regard. As I stated earlier, I believe in learning from one's opponent. It is an old military adage that a commander should study the character of the opposing commander. I consider that iu this matter of political education we can take a leaf from Moscow's book. I mention as an example the present educational position in Poland. A very thorough system has been developed under which, in an eleven-year period, every Polish child will have heen com 1 pletely indoctrinated with the Moscow line. Before teachers are allowed to carry on their work they must satisfy a most comprehensive and -searching inquiry into their credentials and their knowledge of the party line. Under that system Polish children receive a normal primary education for the first three control. The honourable years of their schooling. The curriculum at that stage has a slightly political years the indoctrination becomes more intense and more in consonance with the line of Soviet policy, until finally each",56,Opposition Members Hear Hear

Russians flee to the American zone of Germany each year. do so because they have had an opportunity of seeing the world outside the Soviet Union. But when people do not have the opportunity to see the outside world, and when travel by outsiders into Russia and its satellite countries is completely barred, the powers of political education are almost insuperable. Australia, as a member of the United Nations, must study this problem, because I believe that it is one in which we can, to a great degree, combat the spread of communism. Apply my argument to our own immediate neighbours. Suppose we decide that there is the risk of indocimagine that any country can, by simply trination by communism in New Guinea, where we have a sphere of influence. One of the first steps that we should take is to bring into our educational system as largo a number as possible of the natives of New Guinea. They^should be educated by us in the spirit' of British democracy, because it is obvious that sooner or later the New Guinea natives will take charge of their own' country, and it would be well for us if there were available to take charge of New Guinea at that time, natives who had been trained in the spirit of British democracy. I consider that there is a challenge which the United Nations should take up in connection-with the points that I have mentioned,, particularly in regard to the encouragement and spread of Christianity and to the use of our political opportunities to educate people who may be principles of the United Nations but it [25] influenced by communism. As a member of the United Nations, Australia should Furthermore, all -be among the first nations to support a policy that is aimed first at world peace and secondly at the preservation of free peoples and of democracy. sider that a proper review of foreign affairs should be based on three main principles. These are, first, the strengthening of the greatest force for world peace, the nations of the British Commonwealth; secondly, the strenthening of the ties between the English-speaking nations, particularly the British Commonwealth and the United States of America; and thirdly, the strengthening of the ties between all the democratic nations. The Liberal party always supported the League of Nations and has always supported the United Nations. It supports the United Nations, however, only to the extent that that body is able to carry its decisions into effect. The failure of the League of Nations arose not from the fact that it did not have good intentions, but from the fact that it had no means of effectively carrying out its decisions. When the United Nations was established an endeavour was made to correct the mistake that had been made with the League of Nations. It is futile, however, to passing a resolution that it supports the United Nations, consider itself thereby to be immune against aggression. The extent to which any country can rely upon the United Nations is the extent to which the. United Nations is able to give effect to its decisions. It is in that connection that difficulties have arisen between the Liberal party and the Labour party. The Labour party seems to take the view that the mere adoption of a resolution that we support the United Nations is sufficient protection for us, and that we do not require to do anything about the defences of our own country or take any steps to see that other countries have defences.

179,Mr Wilson (Sturt) [4.55],"I conrealizes that the TJnited Nations is absolutely ineffective unless it has the power to enforce its decisions. The prestige of the TJnited Nations is higher now than it has ever been for one reason alone, which is that when the North Koreans invaded South Korea the TJnited Nations was fortunately able to act quickly because the TJnited States, Great Britain and Australia happened to have forces serving near Korea that were able to be brought into action to carry out the decision of the United Nations. party that made that action possible as far as Australian forces are concerned because it was responsible for the presence of those Australian forces in Japan. M.r. WILSON -The whole position would have been absolutely futile if the Labour party policy had been in operation. policy that put our men in Japan. we had a Government in power that was prepared to allow Australian forces in Japan to be used, and other forces to be brought into being, to support American and British servicemen did the decision of the United Nations, and because the United States and Great Britain were also ready to intervene in support of the United Nations, that the prestige of the United Nations is higher to-day than it ever was. If we are to take a realistic view of international affairs and the defence of this country we must adopt the Government's policy of whole-hearted support for the United Nations organization. Nations should have at its disposal suffimembers of the Opposition are going cient forces to carry out its decisions. The United Nations can operate only if a sufficient international police force aid of this country? The world is is placed at its disposal to enable it to threatened only by Eussian communism. enforce its decisions. The day may come when the United Nations will have that force at its disposal and then it may be possible for memhers of the United Nations to consider disarmament. Until that situation arises, the United Nations, if it is to mean anything, must be a body which will not only make decisions, but also have at its disposal sufficient forces site to alter their decision not to help to carry tbose decisions into effect. Memin the recruiting campaign. I was bership of the United Nations requires not only the signing of a document, attendance at conferences and the passing of resolutions. Such membership places an obligation on every member to put at the disposal of the United Nations organization sufficient army, navy and air forces to serve overseas wherever they may be required. The Labour party, which professes to support the United Nations organization, has been doing everything to sabotage it and make it ineffective. The Labour party has resisted the Government's recruiting campaign to enlist volunteers for service overseas in order to assist the United Nations to protect the small nations of the world. Australia is a small nation. It depends for its security entirely upon the British Empire, the United States, the United Nations organization and such forces as we ourselves are able to marshal. If Australia is to accept the assistance of the United Nations organization this country must support other members of that body. Then, if Australia is attacked it will be entitled to expect that their soldiers, airmen and sailors will serve overseas to defend Australia as the during the last war. Australia can expect protection from the United Nations organization at present because, when the United Nations organization called on this country to assist in Korea, the Government said that our sailors, airmen and soldiers would stand for peace and fight against aggression in Korea.

In this Commonwealth there are traitors to -the country. The present Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Chifley), when Prime Minister, described them as traitors. Yet those men are still at large, destroying the defences of this industrial unrest, and passing resolutions stipulating that materiel shall not be shipped to our men who are fighting in Korea. The very bill that the Government has introduced to deal with those gentlemen has been blocked by members of the Labour party for nearly six months. I know that many honourable members of the Opposition are just as strongly opposed to these traitors as are Government members, but apparently a majority of them are able to protect them from the consequences of their wrongdoing. enemy within.

Foreign affairs concern every indivicountry, causing dual in the country. The nations of the world have come much closer to one arms and another.

"" Then when they said, "" What did you do ahout defending some other country ?"" we should simply be able to say, "" Oh, we did nothing "". This is a two-way problem. If Australia does not play its part in world affairs we cannot expect other nations to give the lives of their soldiers, sailors and airmen in our defence.

He claims to have revealed the failure of the present Government parties during the early war years and pre-war years to prepare for the adequate defence of Australia. That would be a very serious charge indeed, if it could he sustained. When one passes beyond the region of rhetoric such as has been indulged in by the honourable member and gets to the facts of the case, one realizes that in regard to the attitude on defence of the Australian Lahour party during the pre-war years, particularly in 1939, 1940 and 1941, they are vastly different from what the honourable member has pictured them to be. work himself into a fury. for me to work myself into a fury. When I have finished the honoralble member for East Sydney will no doubt rise to tell us something about "" the Brisbane line"" and other things that are merely hoary memories to Australia. Perhaps he will not tell us about that matter, because it was properly dealt with at the instance of his own Prime Minister, who appointed a royal commission, which the honourable member refused to attend-and I do not blame him. We find on the part of honourable memibers opposite a disposition to hold certain, beliefs that cannot be sustained. I am sure that the honourable member for Adelaide believes that he, as Minister for the Army during the post-war period and perhaps the late war years, really won the war for Australia. He believes that had it not been for men like him and the great Prime Minister of the day and the greater one who succeeded him, Australia would have been left to the mercy of the enemy. Of course, no credit is due to the men who wear the returned soldiers' badge and sit in all parts of in the conflict. It all is due to the Labour party. So that there may be no mistake I shall detail what the Labour party did in 1940. in the records of Hansard and that is where it can be read. The war broke out when the Menzies Government was in oflice in 1939, and the first declaration of that Government was that an Australian Imperial Force should be sent abroad to where the fighting was taking place near the Suez Canal in the Middle East. From what we know now, if the Suez Canal had fallen at that time the outcome of the war would probably have been different from what it was. When Great Britain urged Australia to send aid to the Middle East because Britain itself was unable to do so as it was fighting on the European and many other fronts, the Australian government of the day organized and despatched the Australian Imperial Force to that region; and when it did so, the Leader of the Labour Opposition in this House at that time moved a vote of censure upon the Government for its action. Yet, members of the Labour party now say, in effect, "" Look at the organization we set up to preserve this country "". When the war took a more serious turn following Dunkirk, and when the Britishpeople were left alone to fight the NazisFrance had capitulated and the United States of America had not entered the war-'the Australian Government, in view of those developments which occurred in the middle of the conflict, proposed to introduce compulsory military training so",63,Opposition Members Hear Hear

Was not that the principal lesson that we learned from the last war ? I repeat that when the Labour party assumed office in 1941 it took over from the preceding Government an expeditionary force consisting of three divisions a voluntary military service, what does and munition factories in all parts of the Gommonwealth that were then going into production. Later, when the Japanese came into the war, although Lahour had always condemned giving help outside, the Prime Minister of the day appealed over the head of the President of the United States of America to the American people to come to Australia's aid. He appealed for that aid to Americans who were allowing their own sons to be conscripted for service in any part of the world. The Labour party, which refused to allow any Australian to serve beyond a limited area outside our territorial waters, appealed over the head of the President of the United States of America to American conscripts, if you like to describe them so, to come and save Australia. honourable member for Hindmarsh believe that if we call upon the people of another flict in Korea is not war? No one can nation which, conscripts its youth to serve say where the Korean trouble, or any of in any part of the world to come and save us when we are in mortal danger, we should reciprocate to some degree? We are not proposing at this particular moment of the Government has suggested that there should be conscription for overseas service in general. General say, "" at this particular moment ?"" my friend opposite-h e knows to whom I refer-brin g about a position in this country that will necessitate every citizen I am sick to death of hearing about carrying arms, the time may come when for our self-preservation we may be obliged to do all kinds of things that we would not dream of doing in time of peace. That is why I said that at this particular moment the Government has no intention to do other than carry out its proclaimed policy, that is, to build up defence forces in Australia in which each recruit will voluntarily enlist to serve in any part of the world. If members of the Labour party do not believe in it believe in? The people of Australia are entitled to hear from the Labour party a declaration of what, exactly, its defence policy does mean. Doesi t mean merely pressing a button? Does Labour stake the salvation of this country on the rocket range in Central Australia? Doesi t expect Americans to come to our aid with the atomic bomb ? Does it not believe that Australians, who have some self-respect, should do their utmost before calling upon anybody else to defend them? Should we not make proper provision for our own defence? That is all that the Government is endeavouring to do. Whilst it is preparing for the worse, it hopes that the worse will never happen. However, having regard to the present international situation, only a very optimistic person would believe that the danger of war is a remote possibility. At this very moment, Australians are fighting in Korea. Does any one say that the conthe many Communist-inspired incidents, are likely to end. At any moment a match may set ablaze another conflagration more terrible than World War II . I am sorry that I have taken up so much of the time of the House.

I , myself, am a son of a working man, and all honourable members who wear the ex-service badge are sons of working men. Let us bave a look at Labour's allegedly wonderf ul war effort. Back in 193S, leaders of the Labour party in this House said that after the Munich pact was signed any person who prepared for defence, or expended money on defence, was a warmonger and only wanted to stir up war. That statement is recorded in Hansard. At that time. I was not interested in politics but, as a private citizen, I could see the disastrous effect motives to those two independent memthat that kind of talk would have. We are hearing it again to-day. In 1939, war was declared, and the Labour partj' did not co-operate with the Government in any way. It objected to the formation of the Second Australian Imperial Force, yet to-day Opposition members tell us that the Labour Government brought back battle-trained troops from the Middle East to defend Australia. Where would the Labour Government have obtained such troops if they had not volunteered to serve in the Second Australian I m perial Force and had not been battletrained overseas? Opposition members refer to the action of the Labour Government in bringing the Second Australian Imperial Force back to Australia to save this country. The Labour Government brought those men back across the Indian Ocean without escort, and thereby ran the risk of losing them, although it knew that the TJnited States of America had agreed to send troops here. The transports in which our soldiers returned to Australia were required to carry munitions to the Middle East, and the Germans nearly got to the Suez Canal as a result of the shortage of armaments and tha withdrawal of those troops. That action was taken, by the Labour party, which now speaks of its wonderful war effort. As a civilian at that time, I felt that the Australian Labour party did not come in on our side until Japan entered the war, and that members of that party were then afraid for the safety of their own hides. Opposition members also claim that the Menzies Government was put out of office because it had not done anything to further the war effort, yet a former Labour Prime Minister, the late Mr John Curtin, commended the work of the Menzies Government. That administra^ tion was put out of office because two independent members who had been supporting it, crossed the floor of the House, and, by their votes, put the Labour party into power. ment was hopeless, useless and inefficient. worthy motives to people if I can possibly do so, and I shall try to attribute worthy bers, Mr Coles and Mr Wilson. The fact is well known that, in 1941, the Prime Minister of the day, Mr Menzies, made an offer to the Labour party to form a coalition government, under the Prime Ministership of Mr Curtin. That offer was refused. Yet, in Great Britain, a coalition government was formed, and when a vote of confidence in Mr Churchill was moved in the House of Commons, there was only one dissentient, and he was a Communist. That unity could not happen here, because the Labour party would not co-operate. I believe that Mr Coles ancl Mr Wilson felt that the Menzies Government was being harassed by the Labour* party in opposition-, and that the Opposition would not accept it3 responsibility and co-operate with the Government to help the war effort; so they crossed the floor of the House and put the Labour party into power because they knew that the other two political parties in the chamber were loyal, and would help the Labour Government to do its job. sition members tell us stories about the wonderful war effort of the Labour Government.

249,"Mr Teeloae,","Oppositio n memAustralia had really known what had happened behind the scenes and in the' minds of those persons, and how they had delayed the preceding Government in its war efforts, they would never have been returned to the treasury bench. But the trouble is that they are the best mob orators I know, they are marvellous mob psychologists, and they live on class hatred. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Ohifley) said in this debate that he could understand perialism and of several other things. Personally, I cannot understand hatred. The greatest trouble in this country is that there is too much hatred. I do not say that I hate Communists, because it is not in me to hate anybody, but I shall do everything in my power to see that those people do not disrupt this country, and upset our defences and production. As I said at the beginning of my speech, I had no intention of speaking in this debate, but I was practically forced to do so by the habit of Opposition members of continually thrusting down the throats of the people of Australia the story about the Labour Government's great war effort. adjourned.

The proposals in this budget, and the related financial measures which w ill be brought down this session, arise from a complex national situationa situation which carries many difficulties and risks but which also has great possibilities for good if it can be guided wisely. Australia at the present time is in the midst of a vast and many-sided movement of expansion, to wbich two strong forces are contributing. Of these forces, one is the need for security, brought so urgently hatred of Bussiani m before us by events abroad in recent times, and the recognition that for security we must have far greater economic strength; the other is the faith , held almost universally in Australia and by many people abroad, that this country is capable of immense progress in .the coming years. Under the stimulus of these ideas, governments and all their connected authorities are pushing on with large programmes of works to provide power, fuel, water, transport, housing, hospitals and schools for a larger population and a more highly developed economy. Private firms, in all branches of production, are increasing their present capacity or launching new projects to meet the wider demands of the future they foresee. Immigrants are pouring in from overseas, eager to try their fortunes and build new lives in this country. Immense amounts of capital are coming here, a great part of it for permanent investment. In times like these, real and substantial transmitting Estimates of progress is always made. Population grows, industries are built, new resources are opened u p ; and these are permanent gs;ins. There is, however, a danger under such conditions that the effort to expand w ill out-run resources ahd spread itself too widely. Then you get bottlenecks, competition for scarce labour and materials and a bidding-up of prices and costs. These are tbe familiar growing pains of a vigorous economy. For a considerable time past it has been clear that something of the kind is hapI t is my privilege to present Estipening in Australia. Many types of labour have been scarce, and remain scarce, despite the inflow of migrants; the turn-over of labour in various industries has been extraordinarily high; there",68,Opposition Members Hear Hear
250,Debate (On Motion By Mr Bbyson),,69,Budget 1950 51
251,Mr Fadden (Mcpherson,"Treasurer )have been chronic shortages of coal, steel, various building materials and other commodities; and progress in many undertakings has lagged because the resources to complete them could not be procured. The problem has been greatly accentuated by a large and increasing surplus of purchasing power in the hands of the public. To some extent this purchasing power has been created in the process of industrial expansion, through higher expenditures on wages, materials and so on. There have, however, been other sources as well. There have been the large unspent balances carried over from the war, when commodities were scarce, prices were pegged and people earned much more than they could spend. There has been the large inflow of overseas capital and there has been the steep increase year by year in the proceeds of our exports, especially of wool. By creating a demand for commodities greater .than available supplies, the existence of this purchasing power has stimulated investment in all kinds of industries, so intensifying competition for resources already too scarce to go around. It has acted directly on prioes and wages and all the other elements iu costs, causing them to rise in a cumulative way, each rise in one factor leading to further rises in the rest. This situation had been developing for a long time before the present Government took office last December. Prices and costs had been rising rapidly long before then; the shortages of coal, steel and other key materials had existed ever since the war and they were steadily becoming worse., In its approach to this situation the Government has been determined that migration and essential development shall go on, and, so far as possible, be accelerated. It is convinced that the general economic problem must be attacked in fundamental ways and not by mere palliatives. In particular, it holds that there must be a vast increase both in production and in the resources for production. With these ends in view, the Government brought down legislation to deal with those enemies of Australia who Mr Fadden. working through the trade union movement, were organizing industrial strife and deliberately fostering practices which hold back production. It abolished obstructive and unnecessary controls, such as petrol rationing. It intensified efforts to relieve labour shortages in basic industries, where lagging output has been retarding progress throughout every branch of the economy. It has donp everything in its power to encourage essential imports, especially of those items most needed by industry and constructional works. It has remitted duties under by-law on a great number of articles and it has subsidized imports of coal and prefabricated houses. Obviously under circumstances such as the present, we should obtain from abroad as much as we can both of equipment and materials for production and of finished consumable goods. ""The overseas supply position, which was so difficult in the early post-war period, improved considerably in the past year or two, especially in the TJnited Kingdom ,and also in Western Europe, and a rapidly increasing volume of imports is now coming forward. The removal of currency difficulties under the European Payments Union has helped to increase the flow of goods from important industrial countries such as Belgium with whicli we had previously been able to trade only on a strict hard-currency basis. In 1949-50 the value of imports to Australia was £537,000,000, which represented an increase of £122,000,000 on the previous year. In this financial year, we can expect a further very substantial increase, although the speeding up of defence preparations abroad may cause serious and increasing difficulties in obtaining some of the commodities we need. At 30th June this year, the total international currency reserves of Australia stood at £650,000,000. A substantial part of this large total, however, has been accumulated through the temporary inflow of capital, and when allowance is made for this fact and for the greatly increased value of imports and exports as compared with earlier years, the total cannot be regarded as excessive for our requirements. If we are to obtain the still greater quantity of imports we need, it is important that we should have adequate international reserves against the contingency of a fall in our export earnings or a reduction of the inflow of capital. In one other vital direction the GovernAustralian forces have been actively enment has acted to improve the availability of supplies from abroad. When the Government took office, supplies from the dollar area were still narrowly restricted and producers in this country did not have access to many types of plant, equipment and machinery which can be obtained only from North America but which are absolutely essential to the efficient running of our basic industries and the progress of our developmental plans. The Government recognized the gravity of the general dollar problem and it has co-operated to the full with the TJnited Kingdom ancl the other sterling area countries in measures to economize in the use of dollars. It was not satisfied, however, that enough had been done in a positive way by borrowing or otherwise to make more dollars available for developmental purposes. Accordingly, the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) made it one of the chief objects of his visit abroad in the middle of this year to explore the possibilities of raising a dollar loan. As you know, he was successful in negotiating a loan of 100,000,000 dollars from the International Bank for immediate' use in purchasing vital equipment for agriculture, industry and developmental construction. Furthermore, by arrangement with the International Bank, a mission will visit Australia early next year to study our developmental requirements for dollars over a period of five years. As the Prime Minister has said, the loan by no means removes the dollar shortage. It remains necessary to economize strictly in dollar expenditure. What the loan does, however, is to give Aiistralia times as great as those of pre-war years. the chance to get key types of equipment which will have enormous value in raising the productivity of our industries and furthering the progress of developmental works. I am convinced that the loan will prove to be one of the best bargains this country ever made and that, in terms of increased national output and efficiency, it will repay itself several times over. During the brief period the Government has been in office, there have been two developments which must tend to increase the difficulties of the general economic problem. One is the worsening of the international position, as indicated by the outbreak of hostilities in Korea where gaged as part of. the United Nations forces. The consequent speeding up and expansion of defence preparations will be directly reflected in the budget, as I shall explain later. It will, however, also intensify the problem of resources, because men, materials and equipment for defence must have high priority. As yet, the numbers of men and the quantities of material needed are not great; but these requirements are likely to increase and, as they do, the question of priorities in the use of our resources, as between defence, developmental and other uses will become progressively more acute. It is with this situation in view that the Government proposes to set up a National Security Besources Board which will have the task of examining our civil and military resources and needs and making recommendations to the Government ori national planning and priorities. Furthermore, as the Prime Minister has announced, the Government will establish an organization to supervise the general allocation of key materials. It is also proposed to re-institute the Capita] Issues control. The other development has been the sensational rise in wool prices, notably during the past few months. Wool prices have tended generally to increase ever since auctions were resumed after the war and last season the average price was 63d. per lb. greasy. This was nearly six times the average price in the years 1936-39 and the wool cheque of £300,000,000 last season was nearly six The recent market, however, has risen far above last season's levels. Whilst future trends in the market are impossible to predict, if current prices hold throughout the season, the clip will bring between £450,000,000 and £550,000,000. That is to say, the wool cheque will be somewhere between £150,000,000 and £250,000,000 greater than the record cheque of 1949-50. This rise in wool prices will add to our international reserves and from that standpoint it can be counted a national advantage because of tbe larger quantity of imports we w ill be able to buy. Tbe internal consequences, however, could be very disruptive unless firmly controlled. To make a further great addition to the volume of purchasing power, not matched by an equivalent quantity of additional goods, would increase competition for available supplies and divert resources still further from developmental activities into les9 essential uses. This would tend to disperse and weaken the national effort at a time when it should be more and more concentrated. Moreover, there would be direct effects on the cost of living because of higher prices for clothing and meat and this in turn would lead to higher wage costs throughout the whole economy. W it h in tbe wool industry itself, property value9 would soar to boom levels and wages and other working costs would rise, thus weakening the long-term position of an industry whose strength throughout the years has lain in its ability to produce wool at competitive cost levels. The Government will therefore bring clown measures to restrain the effects which this excess purchasing power would have upon the economy. the main details of these measures at a later stage. interests of the wool industry will be fully safeguarded. desire to take from a body of producers, who have had a full share in past adversities, the good fortune which has now come their way. found, however, to harmonize the interests of the wool industry with those of the community as a whole and this is what the legislation to be submitted by the Government seeks to do. By wool-growers to make certain ments of taxation in this financial year, it will hold off a substantial part of the excess purchasing increase in wool prices has given rise. On the other hand, by giving to growers credits enabling them to. use these credits to meet tax obligations at a later date, .it will ensure that they are not deprived of the gains which the present high wool market should bring to them. ilr. Fadden. These special factors apart, the Government recognizes-and it is highly important for everyone to recognizethe implications for the community of a major programme of migration and development. Both add to the calls upon our resources. Although migrants increase our labour force-the y have already made notable contributions in certain key industries and elsewherethey also add to demands for housing, transport, schools, hospitals and all the other facilities of community l if e demands which even now are f a r from being satisfied and which for the most part can only be met from local lahour and supplies. Essential development in turn, requii'es a concentration of resources on tliose projects, such as power supply, transport, housing and the expansion of basic industries which are most vital to the progress of the economy. When to these necessities are added the immediate over-riding demands of defensive preparedness, it becomes obvious that, almost as in time of war, the primary tasks of the nation must have a stronger claim than ever on our energies ancl wealth even though this may mean that other wants and projects, justifiable in themselves though not so urgent, must bide their day. I shall give The rise in prices we have experienced is a product of this general situation. In Here let me say that the part, it represents an adjustment of the Australian economy to conditions overThe Government has no seas where, during the war and post-war years, prices ancl costs in most countries rose much further and faster than here. In part it springs from forces w it h in our Means must be economy-the excessive purchasing power of which I have spoken, the competition for labour and materials, the lag in output of basic industries, and the scarcity-whic h is only now being requiring remedied-of essential supplies from pre-payoverseas. Comprehensive measures for dealing with these problems have been stated power to which the by the Prime Minister and I do not propose to re-state them here. In their financial aspect, however, they are necesfor tliese pre-payments and sarily reflected in budget policy a9 to revenue and expenditure, to details of which I shall now turn. permanently BEVENUEAND EXPENDITUEE, 1949-50. Excluding the self-balancing items, total revenue in 1949-50 was £567,000,000 which was £35,000,000 greater than the budget estimate. The main increases over the estimates were customs £17,000,000, sales tax £7,500,000 and income tax and social services contribution £3,500,000. Total expenditure in 1949-50 was £592,000,000, this being £25,000,000 greater than the estimate. The principal items in which increases occurred were post office ordinary services £5,600,000, subsidies £4,200,000, capital works ancl services £4,800,000 and departmental expenditure £2,400,000. The amount transferred to the National Welfare Fund was £123,300,000. This was £2,300,000 greater than the estimate because of greater collections of social services contribution and pay-roll tax. Expenditure from, the fund was £92,800,000, which was £7,600,000 le3s than the estimate. The net addition in 1949-50 to the balance in the fund, including interest received, was £31,200,000. Expenditure on defence services fell short of estimates by £5,700,000, of which £2,500,000 was in respect of ordinary services and £3,200,000 in respect of capital works and services. The deficit for 1949-50 was £25,000,000 as compared with the budget estimate of £35,000,000.. Details of actual revenue and expenditure in 1949-50 compared with the budget estimates are contained in Statement No. 1. W it h the consent of the committee this statement and other statements to which I shall refer later, w i ll be included in Hansard without being read. Estimates of national income and expenditure in 1949-50 are contained in a separate paper which is being circulated with the budget papers. LOAN TRANSACTIONS, 1949-50. During the year two loans were raised in Anstralia. Three and one-eighth per cent, securities for eleven to fourteen years and 2 per cent, securities for three years, were offered for both loans, which were issued at par. The total amount received in these loans was £199,000,000, of which £124,400,000 £74,600,000 represented conversions of maturing securities. £18,600,000 from cash subscriptions to redeem unconverted securities, £105,800,000 was available for Oommonwealth and State purposes. No conversion operations were undertaken in London. A Victorian loan of £6,055,000 sterling, which matured on 1st October, 1949, was paid off at maturity from funds provided by the Commonvealth Bank and the National Debt Sinking Fund. Details of loan transactions are given in Statement No. 10. On the basis of existing commitments the estimate of expenditure on defence services in this financial year is £83,000,000, compared with actual expenditure in 1949-50 of £54,000,000. In addition, provision w ill be made for stockpiling certain types of strategic stores and equipment. The three-year defence programme which the Government has announced, began on the 1st July, 1950, and will extend to the 30th June, 1953. It comprises, broadly, the remaining two years of the previous five-year programme, together with additional measures adopted by the Government in the light of the changed international situation. These measures include the introduction of national service, under which training w i ll commence in the course of this financial year, the establishment of a CitizenA i r Force active reserve, the re-establishment of women's services in the Navy, A r m y and A i r Force, the production in Australia of the latest high speed bomber and of the latest development in Jet-propelled fighter aircraft as well as extension of present contracts for a type of jet fighter now in production in Australia, the modernization and conversion of existing destroyers and a new naval construction programme which will extend over several years. Provision has been made in the above estimates for the forces in Malaya and Korea and also for the very substantial increase in pay of the forces which the was new cash and Prime Minister lately announced.

It is proposed that this year expenditure on war be financed from loan fund of Consolidated Revenue as in Details of capital works and services are contained in Statement No. 7. Expenditure on Immigration ordinary services in 1950-51 is estimated at £13,200,000 as against actual expenditure of £8,900,000 in 1949-50. Additional provision this year is mainly on account of Dutch, It a l i an and German migration, free and assisted passages for British migrants and the equipment of workers' hostels for displaced persons. As already mentioned, £9,300,000 is heing provided for capital works and services connected with immigration, compared with £7,300,000 spent last year. Thus the total expenditure on immigration in 1950-51 is estimated to he £22,500,000, which w ill represent an increase of £6,300,000 on last year's expenditure. On the basis of existing legislation and commitments, total payments to Statesi n 1950-51 are estimated at £104,200,000. Payments £101,100,000. Through the operation of the formula under the States Grants (Tax Reimbursement) Act, the tax reimbursement grants this year w ill reach £70,400,000, an increase of approximately £S,000,000 over the grant in 1949-50. On the other hand, payments to States last year included the coal emergency grant of £8,000,000. Proposals for an additional reimbursement grant and roads grants w ill be detailed at a later stage. On the basis of present legislation and tax rates, the amount which would be transferred to the National ""Welfare Eund in 1950-51 is estimated at £132,000,000. Adjustments w ill , however, be made in this item in connection with taxation proposals to be indicated presently. Expenditure on existing subsidies in 1950-51 is estimated at £24,400,000. This amount includes £11,300,000 for subsidy on butter, as against £8,000,000 last year, £3,200,000 for subsidies on imported coal, £7j000,000 for tea subsidy and £1,500,000 for subsidy on imports of prefabricated houses. Details of subsidy payments are contained in Statement No. 9. Estimated post office expenditure of £49,800,000 in 1950-51 represents an increase of £5,300,000 over expenditure of 1949-50, this being due mainly to increased wages and salaries and costs of materials. Estimated expenditures in 1950-51 on railways, £3,100,000 and the national broadcasting service, £3,400,000, show increases of £300,000 and £500,000 respectively on actual expenditure last year. Estimated departmental expenditure of £33,700,000 represents an increase of £3,500,000 over expenditure last year. The Government has given special attention to this field of expenditure. Almost immediately on taking office, the Government set up a Cabinet committee to review the Public Service generally. This Cabinet committee has been assisted by an advisory committee comprising a chartered accountant and three of have also been ad hoc committees of experienced public servants or wellqualified persons from outside the last year amounted to service to carry out special investigation. Acting on the advice of these bodies, the Government has abolished three departments, re-distributed functions as between departments, curtailed some departmental activities and reduced departmental establishments. The work of the committees is being continued. The Government also proposes to approach the States with a view to convening, under an independent chairman, a conference of Public Service Commissioners of the Commonwealth and States, together w i th outside persons of administrative experience, to find out to what extent there is avoidable over-lapping between Commonwealth and State departments. On the basis of existing legislation and commitments and excluding self-balancing items, total expenditure in 1950-51 is estimated at £691,000,000 as compared with actual expenditure of £592,000,000 in 1949-50. Estimates of Commonwealth expenditure from revenue in 1950-51, compared with actual expenditure in 1949-50, are contained in Statement No. 3. Because of its concern at the trend in public expenditure and because of its view that parliamentary control of at £41,200,000 compared with £38,300,000 public finances should be made as effecin 1949-50. tive as possible, the Government proposes to re-constitute the Public Accounts in 1950-51, on existing legislation and Committee.

To meet expenditures from bank finance, and so add further to the volume of community spending power, would be wholly in defensible. In practical terms, revenue from taxation, business undertakings, and other current sources, together with the proceeds of public loans, ought to be adequate to cover all expenditures, either on current or on capital account. In revenues, together with the amount of cash likely to be raised by public loans during the financial year, may be taken as constituting the pool of financial resources available. On the other hand, Commonwealth expenditures (which include payments of more than £100,000,000 a year to .the States) together with State loan programmes, comprise the commitments to be financed. This year, as I have shown, Commonwealth expenditure is likely to increase very considerably, mainly because of new defence requirements and the expansion of immigration and development plans. An amount of £30,600,000 has been provided in the Estimates for payment of war gratuity. There is, in addition, a war gratuity reserve of £36,700,000 created by appropriations in previous years; but as cash w ill have to be provided to cover this amount as well as the balance included in this budget, the total amount of cash to be found for war gratuity in this financial year is £67,300,000. Proposals will be outlined presently for additional payments to the States, in creased rates of war pensions, increased rates of age and invalid pensions, and extensions of health services. If adopted, these proposals w i ll of course increase the estimates of expenditure I have given earlier. State loan programmes, as submitted to the Loan Council, are also much larger than State loan expenditures last year. This is due to progress in State public works made possible by greater availability of labour, materials and equipment, as well as to rising costs. It may be that a substantially larger amount of cash can be raised by way of public loans in this financial year than in 1949-50. On the other hand, options become available in the course of this financial year in respect of large amounts of securities carrying relatively high rates of interest and subject to costly tax concessions. Both Commonwealth and State governments have important interests in either converting these securities at lower, rates of interest or else redeeming them. If operations of this kind are undertaken, considerable amounts of cash may be required for redemptions, so diminishing this context, Commonwealth the amount available for other purposes. The Government has made a thorough survey of the whole financial position, taking account of revenue, loan and expenditure prospects, and the likely impact of budget measures upon the general economic situation. Whilst making every effort to eliminate unnecessary expenditure, it has had to face the probability that some forms of expenditure especially in the defence field, w ill continue to rise strongly. It has been concerned particularly to ensure that, in this time of high and rising incomes, government finance shall not contribute to inflationary pressure by recourse to central bank credit through treasury-hills. In the light of these considerations it has formed the conclusion that, subject to action necessary to correct anomalies and relieve hardship, present sources of revenue .from taxation must be preserved and, further, that when rising export prices are adding to inflationary pressure, special forms of financial action should be used in due measure to correct these effects. Expenditure Proposals. I shall now outline certain proposals which will be submitted to Parliament, involving expenditures additional to those for which provision has been made on the basis of existing legislation. Strategic Stores and Equipment Reserve. In view of developments overseas and the necessity to increase our defence preparations, the Government has decided that measures should be taken to build up in Australia reserve stocks of certain key materials and equipment needed for the defence services and war industries. An estimate of expenditure on these purchases during the current financial year is difficult to make, but it has been thought advisable to include provision, of £50,000,000 in the Estimates for the purpose. Legislation w ill be brought down to establish a Strategic Stores and Equipment Beserve Trust Account, to which it is proposed to transfer the abovements to the States have been made in mentioned amount.

The States have abandoned control over land sales but have requested the Commonwealth to continue to reimburse them in 1950-51 in respect of the cost of the controls over prices and rents. The Government has agreed to this request and legislation to authorize the grants will be introduced shortly. It is estimated that these grants will amount to £660,000 in 1950-51 as compared with £706,000 in 1949-50. Further details of payments to the States are given in Statement No. 8. WAR AND SERVICE PENSIONS. Substantial increases in war pensions are proposed. The special rate war pension for totally and permanently incapacitated members is to be raised from £5 6s. to £7 a week and the 100 per cent, general rate war pension for incapacitated members from £2 15s. to £3 10s. a week. The pensions payable to the wife and each child of a special rate or 100 per cent, general rate war pensioner are to be increased by 6s. 6d. to £1 10s. 6d. a week and by 2s. 6d. to l is . 6d. a week respecwill therefore be increased by some tively. The war widows' pension is to be increased by 10s. to £3 10s. a week and the domestic allowance of 7s. 6d. a week now payable only to war widows with one or two children is to be raised to lffs. a week and will be payable to all war widows who have children or who are 50 or more years of age. The war pensions payable to the first and each of the remaining children of a war widow are to be increased from 17s. 6d. to £1 2s. a week and from 12s. 6d. to 15s. 6d. a week, respectively. The war pensions for orphans where both parents are deceased is to be raised to £2 a week, the increase being £1 2s. 6d. a week in the case of orphans fourteen years of age and under and £1 a week in other cases. It is also proposed to increase service pensions by 7s. 6d. to a maximum of £2 10s. a week. Otber proposals include increased medical sustenance allowances, increased pensions for widowed mothers, increased allowances for war pensioners with certain specified disabilities, the removal bf certain time limits for dependants and the provision of specially equipped motor cars for certain disabled ex-servicemen. The cost of the war and service pensions increases and the repatriation proposals is estimated at £5,800,000 in a full year and £3,900,000 in this financial year. C.R.T.S. AND RE-ESTABLISHMENT LIVING It is proposed to increase by 7s. 6d. a week the living allowances payable to C.R.T.S. Trainees and to settlers under the war service land settlement scheme and the business re-establishment allowances for ex-servicemen engaged in agricultural and other occupations. The additional expenditure involved is £160,000 for a full year and £107,000 in 1950-51. Child Endowment. The amendment of the Social Services Consolidation Act to provide child endowment of 5s. a week for the first child under sixteen years of age took effect as from the 20th June, 1950. The number of families receiving child endowment in this financial year as compared with 1949-50 450,000 to about 1,110,000 and the number of endowed children from 1,130,000 to about 2,240,000. The full year additional cost of £15,000,000 which will be payable this year will raise expenditure on child endowment to £45,600,000 in 1950-51. Age and Invalid Pensions. It is proposed to increase age and invalid pensions by 7s. 6d. to a maximum of £2 10s. a week. The additional expenditure involved is estimated at £8,250,000 for a full year and £5,500,000 in this financial year. The increase of 7s. 6d. a week in these pensions will result in an automatic lifting of the maximum permissible income (inclusive of pension) of a single pensioner from £3 12s. 6d. to £4 a week and in the case of a man and wife both eligible for age pension from £7 5s. to £8 a week. Widows' Pensions. It is also proposed to increase the class A widows' pension, that is, the pension payable to a widow with one or more' children, by 7s. 6d., to a maximum of £2 15s. a week; and to increase the widows' pensions payable to other classes of widows by 5s. a week. These proposals will, it is estimated, raise the cost of widows' pensions by £700,000 for a full year and £500,000 in this nnanciai year. Miscellaneous. The Government will also propose amendments to raise from £200 to £500 the exemption for means test purposes ol the surrender value of life assurance poli£127,000,000, made up of pay-roll tax cies and to exclude war pensions from income in assessing unemployment and sickness benefits. Health Services. On 4th September, 1950, amended regulations under the Pharmaceutical Benents Act came into operation. A comprehensive range of life saving and disease preventing drugs is now available without charge to all sections of the community when prescribed by a registered medical practitioner. This scheme, together with the free supply of pharmaceuticals in hospitals, is estimated to cost which have operated since the 1st July £2,300,000 this year and £3,000,000 in a full year. As a means of improving nutritional standards, the Government is planning free milk supplies to all school children through the instrumentality of the States. The scheme is expected to cost about £1,500,000 in a full year and £500,000 in the current financial year. The States have been approached as a preliminary to the review of the hospital benefits agreements which expire shortly, and those negotiations are proceeding. The Government is also developing its plans for a medical benefit scheme. An amount of £2,000,000 has been included in the Estimates of the National Welfare Fund to cover the cost of medical benefits in the current financial year, including a genera] practitioner service and a wide range of medicines for age, invalid, widow and service pensioners and their dependants. Expenditure on these additional social revenues from which payments to the service and health benefits will of course be met from the National Welfare Fund. The social service and health proposals I have outlined, together with the enMr Fadden. i dowment of the first child and tbe normal increase in the number of beneficiaries,, will raise estimated expenditure from the National Welfare Fund to £122,000,000 in 1950-51. This will be nearly £30,000,000, or almost one-third, greater than actual expenditure from the fund in 1949-50. After making allowance for taxation adjustments, payments to the fund in this financial year are estimated at £26,000,000, social services contribution £71,000,000 and a special appropriation of £30,000,000. (The need for this special appropriation will be explained in connection with the taxation proposals, which I shall relate presently.) Payments to the fund in 1949-50 were £123,300,000. Including interest the estimated excess of receipts over expenditure in this financial year will add £6,000,000 to the balance of the fund which now stands at £131,000,000. During a full year, however, the increased rates proposed and the new benefits last, would cost nearly £5,000,000 more than they are estimated to cost this year. Moreover, the number of beneficiariesparticularly those receiving child endowment and age pensions-ca n be expected to increase rapidly. Furthermore, any additional services, especially in the field of health, can be expected to involve heavy financial outlays. It has become clear from the trend in receipts from those sources from which payments to the National Welfare Fund have been made in recent years that the income of the fund will before long fall short of expenditure from the fund. At present there is a large credit balance in the fund. It has to be borne in mind however that the fund is, in large part, intended to provide a reserve against adverse circumstances such as the occurrence of unemployment or a fall in the fund are made. As I have explained on a number of occasions, the balance in the fund is inment itself must provide cash to redeem. Under present circumstances it would add to inflationary pressures if more were spent from the f u n d than is currently being received from taxation sources. Obviously, therefore, in view of present sources of revenue, so that no general trends in receipts and expenditure of the National Welfare Fund, the basis on which it is financed w ill have to be rement proposes to make certain major examined. The need to do this will be all the greater if any progress is to be made towards removal of the means test. The Government is at present giving -urgent attention to this complex matteT. Details of the National Welfare Fund are contained in Statement No. 12 and -details of Commonwealth social and health services 1.938-39 and 1950-51 in Statement No. 13. In view of the steep increase in the -cost of living within the last three years, amending legislation will be introduced to provide that, pending the general review of the superannuation scheme in 1952, the value of the first eight units of pension, where the contributions there for are required to be made tp the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund, be increased by 20 per cent. The bepefit of this increase will be extended to pensioners who were contributors to the fund , to present contributors on retirement and to the widows of such pensioners or contributors. Similar amending legislation will be submitted in regard to pensions payable under the Defence Forces Retirement .Benefits Act. Comparable action will also be taken in respect of future benefits from the, Provident Account of the Superannuation Fund. The estimated cost is £340,000 in a f u l l financial year and £227,000 in 1950-51. As» means' to offset, the effects of recent higher auction prices for wool on prices of woollen -products used locally, t.he Government proposes to pay a subsidy in respect of .=ueh goods produced in Australia for local nse. £20,000,000 is being provided for this purpose. Details will be announced later. Income Tax. As I have said earlier, the Government considers that in the light of the inflationary economic situation and of present and prospective expenditure commitments, it is necessary to preserve existing reduction can be made in rates of income tax this year. Nevertheless, the Governreforms in the taxing system which w ill in themselves contribute in an important way towards amelioration of the tax burden. The major reforms which the Government proposes are(a) to merge income tax and social services contribution into a single levy upon incomes; (b) to revert to a system of deductions for dependants and other concessional allowances instead of the present rebates of tax and to liberalize the concessions ,(c) to adjust the rates to enable the foregoing reforms to be effected smoothly; and (d) to simplify the method of expression of the rates of tax. Since the adoption of the scheme of uniform taxation, there has been widespread complaint of the complexity which has been introduced from time to time into the system of taxing incomes. I am confident, therefore, that the proposals of the Government w ill meet with universal approval, and constitute a landmark in the history of taxation legislation in this country because they w ill so simplify our system that it will be understandable to all those called upon to contribute to the revenue. The reforms and concessions contained in these proposals w i ll provide relief in particular to taxpayers with family responsibilities, heavy medical expenses, superannuation and like payments. These proposals cannot be implemented without some loss to revenue. However, the loss estimated at £7.000,000 in the current financial year and £.15,000,000 in a. f u l l year, is considered to be more than justified by the An amount of benefits which w ill flow to all classes of taxpayers as a result of the simplification of the system and ease of calculating and checking their liabilities. The avowed purpose of the social services contribution when introduced in 1945 was to provide a firm basis for the financing of the National Welfare Fund. It is the strong conviction of this Government that the financing of the National Welfare Eund should continue to be on a firm basis, but this Government is equally convinced that such a basis can be provided without the bewildering complexities consequent upon the division of income tax into two separate levies, each progressive over its own range. It is unnecessary for the proper protection of the National Welfare Eund for separate calculations in all their ramifications to be made. The National Welfare Fund can be fully protected and taxpayers assured that their contributions are devoted to the purposes for which they are made without recourse to the confusing procedure of the past five years. Although much has been made of the separation of the two levies to engender the belief that special sections of the community have contributed only to funds for social services, under the weekly deduction scale applied to the salary or wages of 2,500,000 taxpayers, no separation of the two levies is, in fact, made. One amount and one amount only is deducted and the amount deducted may be used to meet liability for either social services contribution or income tax. Thus, for the great majority of taxpayers, the separation of the income tax field into two levies is fictitious rather than real. So far as conversion of the system of concessional rebates to concessional deductions is concerned, the simplification achieved will be of a major character. In association with the slight adjustments which are proposed in the rates at various points, the result will be that taxpayers generally who are entitled to dependent allowances or to allowances in respect of superannuation, medical expenses, &c., will benefit to a small extent. At the same time, every taxpayer will be able to calculate his taxable income by simply subtracting his allowable deductions from his assessable income. The change which is proposed in the basis upon which the rates are declared will enable any taxpayer in the simplest possible way to arrive at the amount of tax and contribution payable on any given amount of income. It is proposed to print the scale of rates on the back of assessment notices Mr Fadden. in such a manner that the tax and contribution payable on any taxable income can be readily ascertained. The proposed simplified scale of rates, which will retain sufficient flexibility to enable any desired change in the incidence of taxation to be made in the future, will be expressed in pence without the present complications of decimals or fractions of a penny. The rates will apply to income steps of £50, or multiples of £50, but will be so designed that the liability will not differ materially from that under the existing scale. Eeady-reckoners will be required for official purposes only and these will be simple booklets replacing the large and complicated volumes at present in use. The proposals in connection with the deductions to be allowed for dependants and expenditure on such items as medical expenses, superanuation payments, and the like, whilst achieving much greater simplicity by making the tests of maintenance, &c, uniform, will also confer benefits through being made more liberal. It is proposed(i) to raise the maximum age for the student child allowance from nineteen to 21 years; (ii) to rationalize the allowance for dependent parents so that a partial allowance will be granted to taxpayers who partially maintain parents; (iii) to increase the maximum medical expenses in respect of which a taxation concession is allowable from £50 to £100 for each person; (iv) to extend the concession to medical expenses incurred by the taxpayer on behalf of any dependant on whose account he is entitled to a deduction; (v) to raise the maximum dental expenses subject to the concession from £10 to £20 for each person; (vi) to allow deductions in respect of any therapeutic treatment or medical or surgical appliance, provided that such treatment or appliance is ordered by a legally-qualified medical practitioner ; -(vii) to allow a deduction for funeral is estimated it would have been if proexpenses up to £30 in respect of visional contribution had been separately each dependant for whom the calculated. taxpayer is entitled to a concessional deduction; (viii) to increase the present maximum services contribution payable as a separate in respect of life insurance prelevy on income of past years will not miums, superanuation fund exceed £10,000,000. contributions and similar payments from £150 to £200; and subsequent years, the fund will have an (ix) to extend that allowance to include it would have had if the existing provicontributions to medical and sions had continued. This matter will be hospital benefit funds.

Special Appropriation to National Welfare Fund. In my reference to the National ""Welin short supply and skilled man-power. fare Fund, I indicated that a special It is hoped that the discouragement of appropriation of £30,000,000 to the fund the higher rates will check, to some will be necessary in the current financial extent, the growth of this competition for year.

TAX Following the decision of the Commonwealth Government to continue uniform taxation of incomes and entertainments indefinitely, provision was made in the States Grants (Tax Reimbursement) Act 1946 for payment of tax reimbursement grants to States which did not levy income taxation. This legislation set out the basis on which the aggregate tax reimbursement grant was to be determined for payment in 1946-47 and in subsequent years aud also the basis on which the aggregate grant was to be distributed among the States each year. Legislation was passed in 1947 and 1948 amending the basis for determining the aggregate grant, but the basis of distribution of the aggregate grant between the States was left unchanged. Under the States Grants (Tax Reimbursement) Act 1946-1948, the aggregate grant was fixed at £40,000,000 in 1946-47 and £45,000,000 in 1947-48, whilst in respect of subsequent years the act provides for the aggregate grant of £45,000,000 to be varied in accordance with a formula which takes account of(a) since 1st July, 1947; and New South Wales Victoria Queensland South Australia Western Australia Tasmania Total The tax reimbursement grants paid annually to each State are reduced by the amount of any arrears of State income taxation which may be received in that year by the State. In 1949-50 these an-ears amounted to £267,000 and are estimated at £119,000 in 1950-51. Following discussions at the Premiers Conference in September, 1950, it is proposed to make available to the Statesi n 1950-51 an additional tax reimbursement grant of £5,000,000. This grant will be distributed States in the same proportions as the tax reimbursement grant payable in 1950-51 under the States 1946-48. It is estimated that the share of each State £5,000,000 will be as follows:Mr Fadden. (6) The percentage increase (if any) in the level of average wages per 1945-46. The aggregate grant paid to the States in 1949-50 in accordance with this formula amounted to £02,537,000 whilst it is estimated that the amount payable in 1950-51 will be about £70,393,000. The aggregate grant was distributed among the States in 1946-47 and 1947-48 in accordance with the first schedule to the 1946 act. In respect of years subsequent to 1947-48 the act provides that the aggregate grant is to be distributed in accordance w i th a distribution formula which, takes account to an increasing extent each year of the respective populations of the States after adjustments have been made to those populations for relative sparsity of population and the number of school children aged five to fifteen years inclusive in each State. The effect of this distribution formula in respect of the grant for 1950-51 is to provide that seven-tenths of the aggregate grant be distributed among the Statesi n the proportions laid down in the schedule to the 1946 act and the remaining three-tenths in proportion to the adjusted populations of the States. By 1957-58 the aggregate grant w ill be distributed solely in proportion, to the adjusted populations of the States. The estimated grants payable in 1950-51 are Variations in the States' populations compared below with the grants in the four previous years: 1050-51 1946-47. 1947-48. 1948-49. 1949-50.

COAL STRIKE EMERGENCY GRANT. In 1949-50 a special non-recurring coal strike among the emergency grant of £8,000,000 was made to the States to alleviate the burden placed on State budgets by reason of the coal strike, Grants (Tax Reimbursement) Act coal shortages and the associated effects. The grant was distributed among the States in this additional grant of in the same proportions as the tax reimbursement grant paid in 1949-50. The distribution among the fellows:New South Wales ..

In its seventeenth report, the Commonwealth Grants Commission has recommended that special grants aggregating £12,175,000 be paid to South Australia, Western Australia and Tiisiimnia in 1950-51. recommendations have been adopted by tlie Government and legislation to authorize the payment of tlie grants will be introduced shortly.

The agreement provides that the Commonwealth w ill in each year during the period of 58 years commencing on 1st July, 1927, contribute a fixed amount of £7,584,912 towards the interest payable on the State's debts. The sinking fund contributions made by the Commonwealtli in respect of the States' debts vary according to the nature of tlie borrowings and may be described briefly as follows:(a) In respect of States' debts existing on 30th June, 1927, the Commonwealth contributes 2s. Od. per cent, per annum and the States 5s. per cent, per annum for 58 years, (ft) In respect of borrowings to meet State deficits incurred between the 1st July, 1.927, nnd the 30th June, 1935, butes 5s. per cent, per annum, and the States concerned 15s. per cent, per annuni, such contributions to continue for 39 years from the 1st July, 1944.

Under the W.estern Australian Grant (Water Supply) Act 1948, the Commonwealth agreed to provide financial assistance to the Western Australian Government in respect of a scheme for the reticulation of water to certain agricultural areas in the north-eastern portion of the State's mixed wlieat and sheep belt, and also for the provision of domestic water supplies to certain towns along the Great Southern Railway. The Commonwealth financial assistance is limited to one-half of fche capital cost of the project, witb an upper l i m it of £2,150,000. The grant was i-onsidcred to be justified because of the developmental possibilities of the project and the limited financial resources of the State. Up to 30th June, 1950, payments to the £ Western Australian Government amounted to . . 597,409 £37,367.

Following the Commonwealth's undertiiking to the Government of the United Kingdom to promote development schemes which offer a frood prospect of increased meat supplies for export, the Government is pressing on with measures designed to stimulate the development of the pastoral industry in northern Australia. The provision of new and improved facilities for the movement of cattle both by road and stock route is proceeding in the Northern Territory, in the Channel country of south-west Queensland and in the area serving the meat works at Wyndham, Western Australia. The Governments of Queensland and Western Australia are responsible for the constructional work within their respective States and Commonwealth financial assistance is being afforded to them in accordance with thc States Grants (Encouragement of Meat Production) Act 1949. Commonwealth expenditure during 1950-51 on these developmental projects is estimated as follows:the Commonwealth contri£ Northern Territory . . 200,000 Queensland ' .. 175,000 Western Australia . . 1.45,000 520,000 COAL-MININO INDUSTRY-LON G SERVICE In the States where coal-miners have been awarded long service leave by the industrial tribunals concerned, viz., ali States except South Australia, the State Government have agreed to reimburse employers in the coal industry the amount of the costs they incur individually in granting the leave awarded their employees. The Commonwealth has in turn agreed to reimburse the States the amounts paid and the administrative costs incurred by the States in giving effect to tliese arrangements. To provide the funds required for these purposes ah excise has been imposed on coal under the Coal Excise Act 1949. An amount equivalent, to the proceeds of the excise is appropriated to a trust account under the State Grants (Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave) Act 1949-1950.

As a result of the committee's most recent findings, the Commonwealth decided that returns to farmers should be guaranteed at 2s. (1.27cl. per lb. of commercial butter during 1950-51. This represents an increase of 1.77d. per lb. over the return guaranteed for last year. It was also found that butter factorj' costs had risen by 0.18d. per lb. compared with the previous year.

Subsidy w ill be paid on the coal imported on Commonwealth account so as to bring the landed cost down to that of first-class Newcastle coal. If it is also necessary for these two States to use coal imported on their account to make good deficiencies arising from the diversion of Newcastle coal, such coal will be eligible for a similar subsidy. It is estimated that the subsidy will cost £3,200.000 in 1930-51. Prefabricated Bouses -The Commonwealth Government has offered the State governments a subsidy to assist them to meet the additional costs of prefabricated houses imported by State housing authorities. Thc subsidy is to be an amount of up to £300 per house and for a maximum of 10,000 houses, provided the subsidy does not reduce the average cost of all the prefabricated houses imported to less than the cost of traditionally built houses of similar accommodation.

B ill presented, and read a first time. surer) [9.2S] I move That the bill be now read a second time. In accordance with assurances given by the Government, a comprehensive review of the sales tax law has been carried out, and due consideration has been given to the many requests that have been made from time to time for exemption from sales tax of numerous classes of goods. It will be appreciated that it would be quite impossible to accede to ali tliose requests, but relief is being given as far as is possible in the present cirtaxes that will be payable as cumstances. The new concessions relate chiefly to building materials and foodstuffs. It is a fact, of course, that most goods of those classes are already exempt, but the amendments now proposed will provide further substantial relief in this direction. The new exemptions of building material include builders' hardware such as nails, bolts, screws, door handles, locks and similar fittings of a kind installed by builders as fixtures in houses. The present exemption of specified household electrical fittings is being extended to previously excluded because of the extent of their use in buildings Bath heaters, equipment of a kind installed as fixtures the scope of the exemptions. Exemption is also being allowed in respect of structural steel in the form of girders, which, although used mostly in industrial and business premises are to some extent used in 'buildings which provide residential The problems of housing and accommodation generally. The extensions of the exemptions of foodstuffs are designed chiefly to eliminate competitive anomalies, and they apply to foods which are closely comparable with other foods already covered by existing exemptions. The foods now being made exempt from tax include certain foods in the form of sandwich spreads, relishes and meat extracts. The Trea-restoration of coflee and cocoa to .the exemptions schedule is based on the fact that they are sold in competition with tea, a beverage which does not hear sales tax.",69,Budget 1950 51

This splitting of prices and dual calculation of tax was soon found to cause considerable practical difiiculties, particularly in view of staff shortages, and the Government was strongly pressed to relieve the position by causing the goods and the containers to be taxed at the same rate. This is being done in the 'bill. It is provided that the new ""maximum rate of 33$ per cent, will apply not only to toilet preparations, but also to containers in which they are sold. The goods that are affected by the increases of rates are specified in the amendments relating to the second, third and fourth schedules to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. Goods that are covered iby items in these schedules will be subject to tax at the rates of 10 per cent., 25 per cent, and 33$ per cent., respectively. Details of the goods affected are set out in the explanatory statement which has been circulated. It is estimated that those increases will bring in approximately £10,000,000 additional revenue in a full year, or about £7,500,000 for the balance of the current financial year. In accordance with the usual practice, it is pre vided in the bill that the amendments shall commence to operate on and from to-morrow, the 13th October. I commend the bill to honourable members as a measure that will ibe a material factor in the fight against inflation, and also because of its beneficial effects in the removal of anomalies. 1950.

That a producer be liable to pay to the Commonwealth an amount equal to one-fifth of the sale value of wool produced by him and, on or after the twenty-eighth day of August, One thousand nine hundred and fifty, sold Or otherwise disposed of by him otherwise than for delivery out of Australia. 2. That a producer be liable to pay to the Commonwealth an amount equal to one-fifth of the appraised value of wool produced by him and, on or after the twenty-eighth day of August, Oue thousand nine hundred and fifty, exported by him. 3. That the foregoing resolutions do not apply in relation to wool produced in the Northern Territory of Australia. 4. That expressions used in these resolutions' missioner in any case where it is have the same meanings as they have in the Wool Sales Deduction (Administration) B ill 1950. 5. That the acts passed to give eifect to these resolutions be expressed to continue in force until a date to be fixed by Proclamation but not dn any event after the Wool Sales Deduction (Administration) Act 1950 ceases to be in force. As I said when introducing the budget, the Government is preparing an organized and balanced plan to bring the various inflationary forces under control. A close shall deduct from the sale price an examination is being made of the measures amount equal to 20 per cent, of necessary to draw off some part of abnorthat price, and pay the amount mal profits. The high prices that are deducted to the Commissioner, instead now being obtained for wool are well of to the person on whose behalf known to honourable members. The Go-the wool is sold. A person who vernment rejoices with the wool industry purchases wool, other than through in the present prosperity, but is cona wool-selling broker, will also be required cerned about the effect that the greatly to pay 20 per cent, of the sale price to the increased spending power will have on the national economy. The Government believes that unless some positive and immediate action is taken to reduce the effect of this increased spending power a further impetus will be given to tbe inflationary spiral. The proposed resolutions that I have submitted are a part of the overall plan of the Government for controlling the inflationary forces. Honourable members may have heard it suggested that the Government intends to impose some additional tax on those persons who are benefiting from the high price of wool. The Government'? proposals, however, do not impose any additional tax on that class of taxpayer. The Government considers that the present situation can be adequately met by withholding from circulation a proportion of the moneys that are now being obtained from the sale of wool. Accordingly, these proposed resolutions, provide that 20 per cent, of the price obtained for wool shall be paid to the Commissioner of Taxation and be held by him until income tax becomes payable on the wool proceeds. The first proposed resolution requires that 20 per cent, of the sale value of wool shall be paid to the Commissioner in any case where the wool is sold. The second proposed resolution requires that 20 per cent, of the appraised value of the wool shall be paid to the Comexported. It is .proposed that this plan shall apply to all wool sold or exported on or after the 28th August, 1950, that being the date of commencement of the current season's wool sales. At a later stage, a bill will be introduced to provide the machinery and procedure for the collection of the amounts which by these proposed resolutions will be payable to the Commissioner. It is proposed that wool-selling brokers",101,Sales Tax Bills Nos 1 To 9
259,Mr Fadden (Mcpherson,"Treasurer )Commissioner, instead of to the person from whom it was purchased. In the case of a person who exports wool, the payment will be made by him to the Commissioner and will, of course, be based upon an appraised value. Those persons who have sold wool since tbe 28th August last, and have already received the proceeds from the sale, will be required to make a direct payment to the Commissioner. Provision will be made in the machinery bill to ensure that a payment will be made only once in respect of any wool. Details of the procedure for the collection of amounts that become payable to the Commissioner, as a result of these proposed resolutions, will be explained when the machinery bill is introduced. However, it may be appropriate for me to explain, at this stage, that the procedure will provide for wool-selling brokers to issue wool deduction certificates to the persons on whose behalf they sell wool. In a similar manner, a person who buys wool will issue a deduction certificate to the person from whom he purchases the wool. When a person to whom a wool deduction certificate is issued furnishes his income tax return for the year in which the wool was sold, he will forward the certificate to the Commissioner with the return. The Commissioner will give him credit, against the tax assessed, for the value of the certificate and will refund to him any excess. The proposed resolutions provide that wool produced in the Northern Territory will be exempt. This is proposed priated is £61,189,000, and details may because primary producers who are be summarized under the following: residents of the Northern Territory are heads:not required to pay income tax on income derived from primary production. I want to make it perfectly clear to lionorable members that the Government's proposals do not impose any additional tax burden on the wool industry. They merely require payment of an amount at the time of the transaction, which will be applied later in payment of any income tax that may arise from that transaction. This'principle has been followed for the last nine years in the case of salary and wage earners. It has operated very successfully over a field of 2,500,000 taxpayers. The proposals represent an anti-inflationary device necessitated by existing economic circumstances. I commend these proposed resolutions to honourable members. Progress reported.

262,Mr Fadden (Mcpherson,"Treasurer)In the past it has been the practice to base the provision in a Supply Bill on the appropriations of the previous year. Under present conditions, however, it has been found impracticable to limit the amounts to one-sixth of the expenditure for the ordinary services of last year. Salaries have been progressively increasing with the rise of the cost of living, .and the recent award of the Public Service Arbitrator, which dates back to December last, has required the provision of a substantial additional amount. 'The increased cost of materials has had a considerable impact on the amount required. The amounts in the bill are, therefore, based on the current needs -of departments, but there is no provision for the increase of the basic wage that was announced to-day. The amount of £27,325,000 for defence services provides for expenditure on the post-war defence plan and,the additional commitments which the Commonwealth ""has undertaken in respect of Malaya and Korea. The amount of £597,000 provided for ""War (1939-45) Services covers -expenditure on repatriation and rehabilitation and other charges arising out of World War II .

This bill provides for a further appropriation of £18,592,000 to enable Commonwealth works in progress at the 30th June, 1950, to be continued, pending the passing of the budget by the Parliament. Amongst the major items for which further appropriation is sought are £10,000,000 for the Postal Department, £2,300,000 for immigration and £1,450,000 for civil aviation. The Government has adopted a policy of comprehensive long-range planning for The Government has adopted a policy of . comprehensive long-range planning for capital works, covering from periods of three to five years, in the defence services and in departments such as Works and Housing, Postmaster-General and Civil Aviation. To enable these programmes to be continued successfully, it is essential that funds be available without interruption for the purchase of materials in advance, both in Australia and overseas, to ensure continuous employment on the many projects. The bill provides therefore for a further two months' expenditure on works based approximately on the expenditure programme of £69,000,000 included in the capital works estimates 1950-51, which are now being considered by the Parliament. Together with the amounts provided in Supply (Works and Services) Act (No. 1) 1950-5,1, this bill makes provision for the estimated requirements for six months of the current nnanciai year. I might mention here, as I did in my budget speech, that the Government has given the closest scrutiny to all works programmes and has made heavy reductions on original departmental proposals to ensure that there shall be no undue competition for scarce labour and materials.

The formula was amended in 1947 and again in 1948. The general effect of the 1948 amendment was to increase the grant for 1948-49 by £8,740,000, whilst this year the formula will result in the States receiving a'bout £19,000,000 more than they would have received under the 1946 formula. A further indication of the amount by which the grant has been increased in recent years is given by the fact that in the five years since 1946-47 it will have increased from £40,000,000 to just over £70,000,000, an increase of 75 per cent. commitments of the Commonwealth, the monwealth could not contemplate amending the f ormula, but that it would be prepared, as a special measure this year, to supplement the amount payable under of £5,000,000 in 1950-51.

[10.22] I move That the bill be now read a second time. The budget proposals for 1950-51 provide for an expenditure from the Loan Fund of £25,000,000 for war service homes and £4,000,000 for war service land"" settlement. parliamentary authority for the raising and expending of these moneys. The amount of £25,000,000 for war service homes is required to meet expenditure under the War Service Homes Act to assist ex-servicemen to obtain homes. Under that act the War Service Homes Division purchases and develops estates for housing, finances both individual and group housing projects, and makes advances for the purchase of existing properties, or the discharge of existing mortgages. In the financial year 1949-50, the expenditure on war service homes amounted to £16,000,000 from Consolidated Revenue and Trust Fund balances. The expenditure now proposed thus represents an increase of 55 per cent, on that of the previous year. It is expected that about 15,000 houses will be made available to ex-service personnel in this financial year. The amount of £4,000,000 for war service land settlement is to be paid to the States as financial assistance for the settlement of ex-servicemen on the land. This expenditure is designed to assist the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania in acquiring, developing and improving land for suballotted to ex-servicemen settlers, and in In the other States, of course, the provision of capita] moneys for these purposes Financial assistance to all the States for other expenditure on war service land settlement, such as living allowances for settlers, the writing down of the value of wealth from the Consolidated Revenue adjourned. 1939-45 WAR-DEPARTMEN T OF SOCIAL The present measure seeks That the House do now adjourn. wish to place before the House a matter on which I ask for the assistance of either the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) or the Minister for Social Services (Senator Spooner). I am aware that it is not a responsibility of the Federal Government, but because of the peculiar circumstances of the case I bring it to the attention of the appropriate Minister, in the hope that some action may be taken in regard to it. The case to which I refer concerns a man who suffers from miner's phthisis. He made an applicak tion originally in Western Australia for the payment of compensation because he had contracted that disease but was informed that as he had not applied within the prescribed period he was not eligible to receive any compensation payment from that State.

286,Mr Bryson (Wills) [10.25],"Iof a letter from the Victorian Treasury that will explain the case to some degree. Ih that letter the Victorian Director of Finance made the following statement:Tlie facts of the case arc that the applicant mined in Victoria during ten years from 1899 to 1909 followed by 17 years ""in Western Australia. He left the Western Australian mine in 1920 because he was suffering from miner's phthisis. His subsequent mining experience was for odd very short periods only, in Victoria, Tasmania and again in Western Australia. Treasurer feels it would be very difficult to say that the applicant's condition is due to mining in Victoria. In the circumstances he regrets that he cannot vary the decision given hy his predecessor. The actual position is that this man worked in the mines of Victoria and Western Australia for quite long periods. It is almost certain that his work in Victoria was partly responsible for his having contracted dust disease, whilst his work in Western Australia was also partly responsible. Because of his activities in both States he is now a chronic sufferer from miner's phthisis. Until now both State Governments have disclaimed responsibility. I appeal to-night to either the Minister for Health or the Minister for Social Services, whichever is the appropriate Minister to handle the case, to negotiate with those State governments with a view to ascertaining whether a scheme can be evolved whereby this man and any other man who is suffering under similar circumstances, can receive benefits from one State or the other or partial learned this evening that, during the benefits from both States. of a home? about, but is not able, to engage in any the battle of the Coral Sea ordinary work, and he is permanently receiving treatment.

Everything that took place in the War Cabinet and in the Advisory War Council has been recorded by the permanent secretary of both bodies, Sir Frederick Shedden. The Curtin Government believed that Japan should surrender unconditionally. I do not suppose that anybody really believes the honourable member's statement to be founded on truth. I do not think the honourable member for Gwydir could himself believe it to be true for it is absolutely untrue. The general conduct and planning of the war was not only in the hands of the War Cabinet. Its decisions came before the Advisory WaiCouncil on which the Opposition was represented.

I have no complaint to make against the administration of the hospital, nor have I anything but praise for the efforts of the staff, which is working against great odds owing to staff shortages. I know that the hospital board is in possession of plans which, if implemented, would lead to an immediate amelioration of the position; but, at the moment, owing to the extraordinary demand on the accommodation, people are not able to gain admission and many of them are compelled to proceed to Sydney and elsewhere in order to obtain at a greatly increased cost treatment that they should be able to receive in Canberra. I do not propose to mention some of the exceedingly excessive fees that have been charged people who have been compelled to proceed to Sydney in order to obtain treatment that is essential for their welfare. The hospital cannot at present meet the demand and its extension is urgently necessary if it is to give the service which it is anticipated will be required of it. not a new problem. We do not expect the Minister for Health to produce the necessary accommodation overnight simply by waving a magic wand, but J do hope that the matter will receive urgent consideration, and that it' will be given immediate priority so that the hospital can be developed to meet the expanding needs of the Australian Capital Territory. I have discussed this matter with the Minister for Health, and I know that he is sympathetic, but, at this stage, something more than sympathy is required. The problem is rapidly becoming acute. Many people are being seriously inconvenienced, and are incurring medical expenses out of Canberra which, in some instances, are out of all proportion to the services that they are receiving. I beg allocated to the National University, but of the Minister that he take this matter into consideration immediately and leave no avenue unexplored in an endeavour to provide increased hospital accommodation for urgent cases. Even to-day a patient who was to have been admitted had to be refused admission because more urgent cases were awaiting accommodation. The position is entirely unsatisfactory. Even an emergency plan would go some distance towards overcoming the shortage that exists. The inadequacy of the nursing staff is another consideration, and I do not propose to touch upon it to-night. I shall have an opportunity to deal with that matter at a later stage. However, I am most concerned for the welfare of people who, owing to the shortage of accommodation, are unable to obtain treatment at the Canberra Community Hospital, and I trust that the matter will be regarded as urgent. -The honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory (Dr. Nott) speaks with close knowledge when he describes affairs at the Canberra Community Hospital because, until comparatively recently, he was the executive head of that hospital and saw, during his period of administration, the growing problem that he now regards as being of great urgency. I know of the honourable member's keen interest in the affairs of the hospital, and I appreciate that his remarks to-night have been made in the most helpful spirit. I must say, in fairThis is ness to the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) that since I , as chairman of the Hospital Board, have had dealings with him, he has shown great readiness to handle all matters affecting the hospital as expeditiously as possible. It is quite true that there is pressure on the accommodation available at the hospital at present. That, of course, is a problem that is common to public hospitals all over Australia. It is quite true also that the shortage of beds has not suddenly arisen in recent months. The accommodation problem will be partly met by the completion of the obstetric block now under construction. I was very disappointed that it was not found possible to secure for the hospital a portion of the old building which, instead, has been I must pay a tribute to the Minister for his action in obtaining the highest priority for the construction of much needed new accommodation. * With the assistance of departmental omcers, plans have been prepared, and the Minister has agreed to meet representatives of the Hospital Board one night next week to examine those plans. I am hopeful that,",110,Services Canberra Community Hospital
305,Mr Fraser (Eden,"Monaro) [10.43].in view of Cabinet's decision to give top priority to this work, it will soon be undertaken., I appreciate the action of the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory in making his plea to the Minister for sympathetic consideration of our requests. I am confident that the Minister will continue to give sympathetic consideration to the affairs of the hospital. Management of the hospital is in the hands of a board elected by the citizens of the Australian Capital Territory at a compulsory poll. It represents all shades of political of old and chronically ill patients. opinion, yet it works as a team in the interests of the hospital which i» by far the largest under the control of the Commonwealth. All our requests have had a very fair reception not only from the present Minister for Health, but also from his predecessor. WhilstI shall be quite prepared to criticize the Ministeri f at any time he fails to continue his present sympathetic attitude towards us, I am confident that we shall obtain from him in the future decisions that will facilitate the expansion of the hospital in accordance with the rapidly growing needs of the Australian Capital Territory and the adjoining areas of the Eden-Monaro electorate which the hospital serves. for Health) [10.46] -As the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Fraser) and the honourable member for the Australian Capita] Territory (Dr. Nott) know, I have taken a personal interest in the affairs of the Canberra Community Hospital since I have been Minister for Health. In fact, I have believed it to be my special prerogative to look after the Canberra Community Hospital, which, as the honorwere circulated:able member for Eden-Monaro has said, is the largest under the complete control of the Commonwealth.

Regular payment is being made in respect of the disability allowance. the honourable member for F a r r e r ( Mr. F a i r b a i r n ) asked w it h o u t notice a quest i o n concerning the slow t u r n r o u n d of ships in A u s t r a l i a n ports. The M in is t e r for T r a d e and Customs has n o w f u r n is h e d the f o l l o w in g in for m a t i o n : * The Department of Trade and Customs is fully mindful of thc need to keep a steady flow of trade through tbe various Australian porta and with this end in view has .done everything possible, consistent with the obligation to safeguard the revenue, to facilitate the clearance of goods through the customs.

In Mich vases thc related goods are cleared froin On the 28th Septemcustoms control as soon as payment of dr.it.y has been made.
