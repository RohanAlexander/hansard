What are the prospects of obtaining cargo for them, or of turning them to some profitable use? Or is there some difficulty in the matter of putting them to use owing to the competition of private companies? Prime Minister, and speaking subject to correction, I desire to say that there are at present only three Commonwealth ships out of forty-seven idle. One of those ships is definitely out of commission. The other two, I understand, are awaiting cargoes; and the first opportunity which presents itself will, no doubt, be availed of to commission the ships and send them abroad. I do not know if DEPARTMENT. presenting the Prime Minister inform me if the Government have considered the question of building shops in the proposed street between Wellington and Murraystreets, Perth, adjoining the new post office building; and, if so, whether it is intended to let the whole of the shops hy tender or to give those persons who are in the shops about to be demolished a prior opportunity of leasing the intended new buildings? be addressed to the Minister for Home and Territories, whose Department is concerned with the leasing of all Commonwealth properties. in charge of the House give honourable members any definite information concerning when notice of motion No. 1 appearing on the paper is likely to be discussed.

I was present the other evening at a more or less noisy gathering in the Assembly Hall, Melbourne, and heard the statement made by a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly that the fruit-growers of his State had discovered how to avoid the use of sugar in the making of jam. Will the Minister make inquiries in order to ascertain what ingredient is being used as a substitute for sugar, and whether it is not calculated to interfere with the health of the community? make the inquiries the honourable member desires, but the matter is one that comes within the control of the State Government.

LOAN FUNDS AND SUGAR notice1. Will he state if that portion of the loan dated 7th February, 1921, issued at 95 with 6 per cent, interest to meet Treasury-bills that fall due to meet payment for Sugar Account, as per statement of the late Treasurer in the House of Bepresentatives, will be debited to the Sugar Agreement Account with interest? 2. If refunded, will that amount be placed to the redemption of the loan; if not, to what account will it be placed? orable member's questions are as follow:1. The loan dated 7th February, 1921, was not issued to meet Treasury-bills, but was floated for war purposes. The raising of the loan in London enabled the Treasury to overcome exchange difficulties, which were then acute, and thus payment of all the obligations of the Government, including those relating to sugar, was facilitated. The loan moneys were not used directly, however, to meet obligations in respect of sugar, which was paid for by means of an overdraft granted by the Commonwealth Bank for that .purpose. Interest was charged to the Sugar Account at the rate of 5 per eent. on the amount of that overdraft from time to time. 2. Moneys received by the sale of sugar were, of course, taken in reduction of the overdraft, and, as the sugar had not been purchased out of the Loan Account, no question of making a refund .to that account arose. representing the Minister for Home and Territories, upon notice1.

It is pointed will he take the earliest opportunity of having out that this service is one which has hitherto becm confined to New South Wales and has not been enjoyed by the other States. 2.

58,Upon Which Mr Scullin Had Moved,"in the Ministerial party, and who made a direct attack upon the sugar agreement, and one of them upon the sugar-growing iudustry. member made a deliberate. attack upon me. Whatf o r i Not in the interests of the sugar industry, but in the interests of his own candidature at the forthcoming election. He knows very well that he will have to fight the Country party in his electorate, and, therefore, he passed it. by the attack made on the sugar agreement and the sugar-growing industry by members of his own party, and tried to score a point against the Country party by referring to something that happened two or three years ago. I have said sufficient in regard to that incident. One cannot help asking himself what was the object of the vicious and personal attack which the Acting Leader of the House( Mr Greene) made upon certain members of the Country party yesterday. He lashed himself into a fine state of hysterics until he became a veritable Bombastes Fwiioso, and with his tongue in his cheek, and tears in his voice, said that the Country party was preserving its political life by defaming the country and the agricultural industry. The Minister and every honourable member of the House knows that he was not serious when he made that statement; it was only electioneering propaganda. A few minutes after the Acting Leader of the House had decried the Country party for defaming rural industries, he quoted from the Tear-Book most dismal statistics regarding the present state of the mining industry, and later, in order to make an attack on the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Wienholt), he painted a most doleful picture of the cattle industry. A more dastardly attack was never made upon any member of this House. If the Minister meant anything by his statement, he meant that the honourable member for Moreton was using his position as a member of Parliament to condemn the subsidy to the cattle industry in order that the smaller men might be crushed out, and he and other large cattle-owners might batten on their ruins. been done by a man of the type of the honourable, member for Moretona man who quite recently received distinguished honours from hig King for services rendered in the field, and who for clean politics, and as a man and' a gentleman, has no superior in Australia, and very few equals. think otherwise. the meaning of the dirty insinuation which the Acting Leader of the House made yesterday? member may not; bnt if the Minister did not mean to make a dirty insinuation member for Franklin to find any insinuation of a personal character against the honourable member for Moreton. I made none. able member for Franklin would think of such a thing. very good at hard hitting, and he must expect blows in return. I ask him now what he did mean by his insinuations? member how some of us regarded it . not how the honourable member regarded the attack, but whab was intended by the Minister. I know how it has been regarded in other quarters outside this House. A personal attack was made also upon the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page) in his private and professional capacity. Those who know the Acting Leader of the House, and those who know the Leader. of the Country party can judge between the two men. I say that the insinuation made by the Minister reflects upon him rather than upon the honourable member for Cowper. What was the meaning of the personal attack made upon members of this party? Wasi t deliberate? The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) made a tour of Australia, and in most of the States he visited he made a premeditated onset upon the Country party, especially upon its leaders. member's leader been doing to our leader?

86,Mr Mcwilliams,"No, I am takinghonorable member has just said that I used "" faked figures "" in this House yesterday. I say that that is a misstatement of fact; I quoted actual figures as supplied to me hy the Oommonwealth Statistician. draw the word "" faked,"" and say that very carefully selected figures were used yesterday with the same intention. There are one or two other matters with which T should like to deal, and I now come back to the statement from which I have been diverted by the unwarranted* attack of the Minister now in charge of the House. If that honorahle gentleman is to continue to lead the House, I hope he will seek for some better example than that of his leader whose footsteps. he seems in this particular line, to be anxious to follow. I am one of those who think that the Government have seriously failed to realize the seriousness of the financial position. We have a war debt of £400,000,000, and a peace debt of practically the same amount, invested largely in railway systems that show annual deficits. With taxation three times what it was ten years ago, industries thereby strangled, with State after State budgeting for deficits, with an expenditure; apart from war services, increased from £50,000,000 to £100,000,000, with a declining national income if prices slump further, one would have looked in the Governor General's Speech for some indication that the financial problem was to be attacked. looked for some effort to prevent the depopulation of the country districts and to secure a proper distribution of population, with decentralization by the encouragement of manufacturing towns, which alone can make the country sufficiently attractive. But we find the same old cures that have been tried, and have failed over and over again. for an overgrown Public Service is the appointment of more Boards; the cure for trade and commerce hampered by too much Government interference is „more Government appointments; the cure for a disorganized postal and telephone' service is not proper decentralization, with business control and management, and the retention of postal profits for the The development of the Postal Department, but the appointment of another Gommission. I agree with the more intelligent members of the Labour party who declare that despite the enhanced wages that the workers receive, their position owing to the increase in the cost of living is no better than it was before. I propose to put before the House an interesting statement showing the position of the workers in New South Wales. I have accepted the figures for that State, since they are more complete than are those which are available in respect of any of the other States. They are certainly surprising, and must cause every thoughtful man to recognise that there is ground for some of the discontent displayed in the industrial lifeof Australia. The return, which gives the average nominal wage, the index numbers of the prices of groceries and foods, and of the average effective wage in New South Wales from 1911 to 1920 is* as follows: FOOD AND GROCERIES ONLY. Index numbers Average Year. Nominal Average Wage. ofand Price of Food Effective Groceries. Wage. 1911 117 103 113 1912 123 118 105 1913 126 118 107 1914 127 120 105 1915 129 146 88 1916 134 159 85 1917 143 161 89 We would also have 1918 147 162 91 1919 158 186 85 192b 188 230 82 Prom this return ib will be seen that whilst the index number of the average nominal wages rose from 117 in 1911 to 188 in 1920, the index number of the price of food and. groceries The cure rose from 103 to 230, while the index number of the average effective wage of the workers in town and country fell from 113 to 82. When a public man, in the course of his study of the economic situation, comes across figures like these it is his duty to the House and the country to makethem public, regardless of any consideration as to whether they tell in favour of one party or the other.",20,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

88,Mr Mcwilliams,"I shall with the honourable member's party would reduce wages. that whilst the cost of living remains as at present, it is idle to talk of a general reduction of wages. it fair that the workers should receive no benefit from the enhanced wages which the primary producers, in common with all employers of labour, are paying, and that the advantage should go wholly to the profiteer? It is time that we set ourselves to the task of solving the industrial problems that confront us. We cannot hope to have them dealt with effectively merely by one political party charging the other with all sorts of political impropriety. The best minds in the publio life of Australia should be directed to the task of finding a solution. Another interesting fact is that whilst the population of Australia since 1911 has increased by 900,000, that increase is confined almost wholly to the capital cities, while few provincial towns have retained their natural increase. In dealing with the primary industries of Australia last night, the Minister for Defence( Mr Greene) did not mention that we nave in the Commonwealth to-day 15,000,000 less sheep than we' had ten years ago, and that our production of wool in 1920 was 164,000,000 lbs. less than it was in 1911. Notwithstanding these enormous decreases, we are told by the Minister that the primary industries are progressing and flourishing. Those of us who care to go into these matters realize to the full that"", the primary producing interests of Australia constitute the very"" life's blood of the country. We know that it is only by means of the returns from the sale of our wool, meat, wheat, fruit, and minerals abroad that we are able to maintain our financial equilibrium. that we are able to pay the interest on 'our loans and keep the wheeb of industry in motion, and when we find a decline in our output of minerals as well as in our agricultural and pastoral products, while at the same time we have an ever increasing State and Federal taxation pressing on our primary producers, despite their inability, owing to this reduced output, feu bear ib, we must recognise that it is time ta call a halt in the expenditure of the Commonwealth. Despite the decreased output of some of our great primary industries which go to make up the real stable wealth of Australia, our expenditure continues to increase. I was one of those who thought that the appointment of the honourable memIs ber for Flinders( Mr Bruce) as Treasurer would have a very beneficial effect on the financial position of the Commonwealth . I believed that his advent to the Treasury would have a stabilizing influence. The publdc statements which the honourable gentleman has made from time to time, however, have been not only disappointing, but disquieting, from the point of view of those who thought that he would promptly bring about a financial reform. He seems to have fallen into the rut of his predecessors. It is extremely disquieting to find that no Minister can be held responsible for anything that has been done in any of the Commonwealth Departments during the last four or five years. As soon as a Minister gets a Department into a muddle he is transferred to another Department. His successor promptly disclaims any responsibility for the condition of affairs in the Department which he has taken over, asks the House to give him a chance, and declares that he will soon put matters on a good footing. But as soon as he also gets into trouble he is transferred, and another honourable gentleman takes his place. No one can fairly hold the Treasurer responsible for anything that' took place in his Department prior to his joining the Ministry, but I disagree with those who say that since the Estimates had been passed before he took office he had to accept them as he found them, and could not effect any reforms. A man who was out to secure reform! would not have allowed the enormous increase i u the expenditure of the Commonwealth which has occurred. The statement subI t is by this means alone mitted to us a few days ago by the Treasurer, shows the following revenue receipts over and above the estimated return for the year 1921-22: Land and inconie tax ... £1,824,000 Customs and Excise ... ... 1,499,000 Defence (Trust Accounts) ... 108,000 Army of Occupation ... ... 835,000 Total £4,266,000 But for these wholly unexpected windfalls, which cannot be regarded as ordinary current revenue, the deficit in respect of transactions of the last financial",21,Index Numbers Of Average Effective Wages Innew South Wales Based On The Prices Of

And, thereafter, when a bad year is experienced, back goes the country further than ever into debt."" When in Brisbane recently the Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) said there was only about £4,250,000 from which savings could be effected. I assure the Treasurer that the statement waa intensely disappointing to the country. Aa for the party to which I belong, we say that the pruning knife will have to go very much deeper. many ways in which savings may be effected. I cite again the duplication of electoral l-olls. On© of the gravest blunders which this Parliament ever made was toi establish a Commonwealth savings bank institution in direct competition with the State Savings Banks, which are doing such good work throughout the land. The time is rotten ripe when tfie whole of the land and income taxes and electoral and Savings Bank duplications should be done away with. When the Treasurer publicly states that there are less than four and a half millions of money out off which savings oan be effected, I oan only reply that he should now go far more deeply and closely into the matter. He should refuse to adopt the course steered by his predecessors. He should out out the old advice of "" tax all you can, collect all you can, create Departments, create Commissions."" In the course off the Governor General's Speech, there are proposals for the creation of five different Commissions and Departments, in addition to those already at work. I trust that I shall be spared to vote against every one of those propositions, for not one of them can be justified. One of the greatest evils which this Parliament has done has been to rout upon the backs pf Commissions the responsibilities and duties which should rightly devolve on Ministers. A great mistake was made when Parliament appointed a Commission to control War Service Homes activities. It mattered not what blunder, or what extravagance, and worse, may have oc---But while New curred, Ministers would wipe their hands of all responsibility, and repeat that Parliament had appointed a Commission to do the work,thus taking the duty directly out of their hands. The question of real and proper economy should not be a party matter. I do not think that we can mend the financial position of Australia by dismissing a few lowly paid officers here and there, or by taking a few pounds off the t wages of a few struggling public servants. When I perceive the circumstances of some of those in the lower paid grades, I wonder how they continue to live and support their families. There are Departments which could be done away with altogether. A start should be made with a 20 or 25 per cent, reduction in the salaries of the Service, beginning at the very There are highest grade, and working' downward upon a diminishing scale until one has reached the £300 salary mark. All officers drawing that sum and under should remain untouched. No man upon the £300 mark, or below should be called upon to sacrifice any part of hi9 salary. It is in the highest paid realms that the pruning knife can be most severely employed. Before we begin to cut down Departments, there must be a comprehensive and scientific percentage reduction beginning from the top. Parliament. tioned-throughou t the whole Service.

However, the Cabinet has refused to allow these goods to be manufactured. It will uot permit the employees of the Factory to compete against private enterprise in the manufacture of telephone parts, tools of all descriptions, motor car parts, motor cycles, water meters, and bicycles, which are largely used by the Department of th© Postmaster-General. time ago, in answer to a deputation wljich waited upon him, the Prime Minister expressed sympathy towards the request of the members of the deputation .that the Factory should be used for the manufacture of these goods. whether there was machinery installed at Lithgow suitable for their manufacture, and when assured on 'that point, he said, "" All r i g h t ; appoint members of your association as commercial travellers to go out and arrange for the sale of the goods, and I promise to render them every assistance."" assurance the great bulk of the men engaged in the Small Arms Factory lived in the hope that they would continue to be employed in the establishment, manufacturing goods totally different from rifles, b u t as time wenb by two or three hundred of them were dismissed. ever, still expecting to be re-empioyed in the Factory, they did not leave L it h gow, and a further deputation consisting of representatives of Ithe 'Small Arms Factory unions, the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, and citizens of Lithgow, waited on the Minister for Defence and suggested that the Factory should be kept going manufacturing almost any class of instrument, particularly those used in the Post and Telegraph Office. In reply, the Minister said that he saw no reason why these articles should not be manufactured. He asked whether the necessary machinery was installed in the Factory, The Minister for Deand was assured by experts that such was the case. He was told that everything was in readiness if he would only give the word to make a start. It would depriving fellows outside of the same work ? mean interference with private' enterprise, because the Small Arms Factory could tur n out these articles more cheaply. machinery is not at the Factory. of the reasons why these goods are not being manufactured at the Small Arms Factory at the present time. These reasons are contained in a report by experts forwarded by the Postmaster General to the Minister for Defence. Some they give. report is as follows: > A committee was appointed to investigate the practicability of the manufacture of telephones, especially with a view to the employment of returned soldiers on the work. TheH e asked committee consisted of representatives of the Melbourne University, the Postal Department, the Chamber of Manufactures, the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, the Victorian. .Railways, and the Department of Repatriation, and upon receipt of its report the whole question was considered by the Minister for Repatriation, but it is understood that, in view of all the facts of the case, thc Repatriation Department did not wish to proceed with the matter. As the result of that This Department's view is that the manufacture by it of telephone instruments would not be a sound undertaking. The establishment of a factory to carry out the work would necessitate the purchase of a large amount of specialized machinery, such as dies, jigs, &c, which have to bo specially made for a particular type of telephone, and this would unHowdoubtedly be an obstacle to the Department's keeping abreast of the advancements -which are, continually being made in the design of telephone instruments, for, as the quantity ot telephones the Department would make would be small compared with the output of the large factories in England and America, the Department would not be justified in scrapping all its dies, jigs,. &c, whenever an improvement was 'developed.

I cannot imagine an Australian Government proposing an enactment by which the patents of Allied nations could be exploited. In any case, if a factory were established in Australia, and were to be run on anything approaching commercial lines, it could employ only thirty to forty returned soldiers. Those who would get tlie greatest benefit as regards employment would be scientific and skilled men, such as the manager, engineers, chemist, foremen, and skilled mechanics, whom the Department would have to import in order to establish a factory on proper lines. America and Europe the Ohief Electrical Engineer consulted various manufacturers of telephone apparatus with a view to ascertaining whether they would be prepared to establish factories here for the purpose, and in only one case was ho able to obtain .a favorable response. The conditions stipulated, however, in that case were that, in addition to certain duties and other concessions, the Commonwealth should discontinue the present manufacture and assembling of telephone apparatus and guarantee to the company a return of 10 per cent, on its average yearly investment. The representative of oue company stated that in order to justify the expense that Would be required for plant, &c, an annual output equivalent to the requirements of this Department for three years would be necessary. are pretty solid. that the necessary jigs aud dies are not available; but let me inform the Postmaster-General that the whole of the machinery necessary for the manufacture of telephone parts is already installed at Lithgow. that is not so. which may be very costly are not available, but they can be bought.

We have no trouble about the instruments.

There were about 500 returned men employed in the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow, but practically the whole of them have been dismissed. On ANZAC Day they were asked to parade the streets to show their loyalty. On that same day there were in the office of the manager of the Factory notices of dismissal for 300 men. Scores of these returned soldiers are married. Some of them have partially bought their homes. Some of them have five, six, or seven children to maintain. Yet the Government throw these men out of employment because it is not proposed, to manufacture goods in competition with private enterprise. Never mind the assurances given"" to the soldiers on their enlistment! Private enterprise must be protected! Telephone parts are not the only articles that could be manufactured at the Lithgow Small Arms Factory. The stamps employees were given permission to manufacture hammers. They did so. The hammers were sold at 2s. 6d. each, which returned' a profit of 10 per cent, to the Factory. They were sold by the various As firms at l is . 6d. each.

The Governthirty or forty returned soldiers could be employed, be accepted as correct, it would be better to have that number employed there than to have them roaming about the streets in search of employment, with their wives and children practically on the verge of starvation. If the Postmaster-* General would consider the matter from a humane view-point, he would not bother so much about private enterprise, but would permit the Pactory to engage in the manufacture of goods it is capable of turning out. ment for 1,600 soldiers during the last six months. gow. It is all very well for the Minister to find employment for soldiers in his own electorate, but there are other people to be considered. The Government have asked that a system of strict economy should be brought into operation. Is the Minister for Defence economizing when he practically closes down the whole of the machinery in a factory that was in full working order .a few months ago? Are not the overhead charges still going on, whether there are 250 or 500 men employed ? Every possible appeal has been made to the Government to allow the industry to carry on and to compete with private enterprise, but despite the assurances that have been given, it is practically at a stand-still, only about 250 men being .employed in manufacturing a few rifles that are not required at the present time. The reply which the Minister gave to a question which I asked yesterday leads me to the conclusion that the Government do not intend to allow that establishment to produce anything but rifles. If the Minister would say definitely what his intentions are, those men who have been waiting for months in the expectation of re-employment at the Factory would know whether it was worth their while to continue there, or whether it would be better for them to seek fresh fields and pastures green. It appears to me that the Government have no intention of employing any more men at the Factory, and they care not what becomes of the soldiers whose interests, beforo they left Australia, they promised to safeguard on 'their return. ton) spoke of bringing experts from other parts of the world to investigate the possibilities of this establishment. Experts are already employed--me n who have had considerable .experience in the manufacture of machinery. They have been schooled in the industry for thirteen or fourteen years, and are experts at that class of work. One of them assured the Minister for Defence that the Factory could make a success of whatever it undertook to produce, and the only stipulation which the Minister made was that the Factory must not compete with private enterprise! If the interests of the workers are to be preserved and employment is to be found for them-the Government claim that that is their policy, and the Acting Leader of the House spoke yesterday oi building railways and developing land-Jet the Governmenb find work for the men at Lithgow who are searching for it . If they do not desire them to be re-employed at the Small Arms Factory, they might make some provision for their keep until fresh employment can be found for them. I know that some of the men are in distress, and the Minister said that if they were in positive need of assistance the Government would not mind helping them. I should like to know howmany applications for assistance have been received, and how many have been granted. If the Factory is used only for the manufacture of rifles it will-operate at a. huge loss, which could be avoided if employees were allowed to carry on as I have suggested. The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) stated definitely to a deputation that he was prepared to assist the Factory to manufacture articles used in the Postal Department, such as hammers, spanners, picks, and bicycle parts, and I hope that the Minister will honour that promise!. A great many bicycle parts are manufactured by private enterprise for the Postal Department, and if the Lithgow Factory can compete with private enterprise there should be no objection on the part of the Postmaster-General to its producing goods of that character.

For the most part, honourable members are content to discuss subjects which they consider of immediate and vital importance to Australia. .That is the line I intend to follow in the few remarks I have to make. members, I recognise that Australia is carrying on its affairs in very critical world conditions, which are reflected to some extent within the Commonwealth. Ib seems to me that of late years we have gradually learned the i m portance of giving serious consideration to affairs outsidei Australia, because of the direct bearing they must have on internal conditions. I desire to discuss briefly a matter of some importance to Australia, the Washington Conference. That Conference was undoubtedly a very great event in the affairs of the world generally, and it thoroughly justified the attendance of an Australian delegate, even though he was, to a large extent, an onlooker rather than a direct participant in the negotiaIn tions. ' Onr delegate, having returned fro m the Conference, has presented to the Government a very exhaustive report, perhaps as exhaustive as any I have seen presented on any subject in similar cir'Oumstanoes. It contains a great deal which has been the subject of discussion in the magazines for some time past. Very littl e of it , indeed, can be regarded as new, and what is new is not altogether admirable. The new material is contained largely in the conclusion, and I do not remember seeing in any other official documents as many personal pronouns as there are in that report by SenaBut tor the Right Honourable George Foster Pearoe. There is one expression to which I take serious objection. Senator Pearce says, "" I wish to place on record the mag1 nificent services to the Empire rendered It is not that he hates by Mr Balfour at the Conference."" I , George Fosten Pearce, wish to place on record the magnificent services to the Empire rendered by Mr Balfour at the Conference ! That is a piece of impertinent and unoalled for patronage which I am sorry to see in that official document. and speaks on its behalf. 1 to be taken for granted that the services of Mr Balfour were of inestimable value to Australia, and appreciation of them could bave been expressed in some less offensive way than by the introduction of Senator Pearce's own personality. I was surprised to learn from the Treasurer that the cost to the Commonwealth of the delegation was £8,500. I have been trying to discover how W it h other honourable that sum could possibly have been expended, and I cannot arrive at any estimate within thousands of it , so I ask the Treasurer if he can help me with the details. The delegation consisted of Senator Pearce and three officers. The return boat fare would amount to something less than £ 5 0 0 ; I have allowed £480. There would, of course, be some railway travelling,, though not a great deal, from Vancouver to Washington, and I am allowing £100 to each of those gentlemen on that account. This, makes a total of £880 for travelling expenses. The delegation was about thirteen weeks in ""Washington, and, of course, their stay would cost something. For this I allow the principal member of the",27,Uxited Kixgdosi Australia

I am now merely suggesting my inability to discover how this money was spent; and the Treasurer will probably be able to satisfy me and other honourable members in this connection now that his attention has been drawn to the matter. As to the other three gentlemen, I allow each of them only £25 per week, on which they would probably manage to struggle along. The total for these would like t'o see a detailed statement of three gentlemen is £975, and that with the amount I have allotted to the principal delegate, added to the travelling exreached a stage when, in view of the penses, amounts to £2,505. snppose that the delegation would require a typist to type letters to their families as to the good times they were having, and so forth, and I have allowed £200 under this head for the thirteen weeks. I hope that honourable members will not in tuni accuse me of extravagance, because I am merely trying to arrive at some method by which the total of the expenses paid was reached. The payment to the typist bring3 us to a total of £2,705 on the someorder. I , therefore, do not wish to make what luxurious scale I have indicated. I am still, However, a tremendously long way from £8,500, and I have to think hard how to make that amount up. recall that Ministers when travelling are allowed £2 or £2 2s. per day. not count in a transaction of this sort; but allowing the Minister to draw hi3 daily allowance of £2, even while travelling on a ship where he is free from daily expenses of the kind contemplated, we have another sum of £325. If we allow each of the staff half the Ministerial allowance we get another £675, making altogether exactly £1,000. In my opinion, the allowance of £2 pei* day ought'to be included in the £50 I have allowed for expenses when resident in Washington; but putting that aside, and allowing the party the f u l l benefit of this £1,000, we member can assist me further in making up the amount I shall be glad of any suggestion. There were some wreaths purchased to place on tombsa very proper expenditure under the circumstances-and there might be cigars, shaves, and even drinks. ""dry!"" the drinks out. With this £1,000 for odds and ends, the total amount is only £4,700, or about half the amount of the alleged cost. the expenditure.

142,Mr Fowler,"I wish to know, andto speak of the relationship which Australia has to this Washington Conference. claimed for the Conference from the Australian point of view than should have been, largely because of an attempt to create a nimbus of glory for the ex-Minister for Defence and his chief. We are told that the Conference has secured our safety from foreign aggression. But if we were in danger of foreign aggression before the Washington Conference, then I say without hesitation that the result of the Conference has been to make us more open than ever to the same aggression. That, I know, sounds somewhat absurd on the face of it, and I desire to make myself perfectly clear. The Washington Conference has reduced the navies of at least the great Powers of the world to a point where they can hardly wage an offensive war anywhere. At that Conference the Britisli Government abandoned their old supremacy of the seait is completely ""gone by the board."" There is no doubt that in the past we have owed our peace and our freedom from all foreign menace whatever to the fact that the Union Jack flew supreme over all the seas of the globe. To-day that safeguard no longer exists ; no portion of the British Fleet, of any consequence or sufficient fighting power, caii be detached in order to safeguard Australia from possible danger. So that, if the' view is correct, as expressed before the war, that Australia was in danger of foreign aggression of any kind, the Washington Conference has undoubtedly made us more open than ever to that aggression. But I welcome the Washington Conference, even with its reduction of the Navy of Great Britain, because I am not one of those who regarded aggression against Australia as possible, except from one quarter, and that was Germany. For years, and before the war broke out, I urged in this chamber the necessity for preparing for what I saw was ahead-the attack of Germany on civilization. But as regards any other Power, we are absolutely safe, and may sleep in our beds without any fear or apprehension j. there is no danger threatening us now in that way. there is another danger that menaces us. The pressure, when it comes, against our White Australia principles will not be, in my opinion, by war. but will be an Mr Foteler. economic pressure; and I believe it will come from within our own Empire. WA great deal more has heen have had as a result of the Washington Conference a recent visit from an eminent Hindu gentleman. He was boomed by the press to a very remarkable extent, indeed, and lauded in many quarters because he stood as a great champion in India for the self-government of that country. He was welcomed everywhere in Australia as a champion of the principle of Democracy generally. The people who acclaimed this gentleman in that way did not know what they were talking about. There is a story that a few years ago, during a movement for Indian independence and self-government, there was a gathering in the city of Bengal of a number of eminent persons. Some of them were chiefs of the warlike tribes that have their homes in the north-west and northern frontiers of India. Listening to the boasts of the Bengalese babus, that by-and-iby they were going to eradicate the English from India, one of the .chiefs of these warlike clans said, "" And six months after the British evacuate India there will not be a rupee or a virgin left in the whole of Bengal."" He might have amplified that statement by saying that within twelve months of the evacuation of India by the Britishi t would have applied to the whole of India. As a matter of fact, the peace and prosperity of India have been preserved under British rule to a degree which that country never before enjoyed. So far from the agitation for self-government for India being an Indian movement, it represents only the demand of a very narrow, bigoted, and arrogant section of the community. "" Self-government for India,"" in the mouths of those people, means government of the people by the Brahmins-the royal caste of India. And so much is this apprehended by the lower castes and the people who are lower than any caste at all-the outcasts-that they have formed a very powerful organization, the Nama Sudra, an organization having for its object the counter-acting of this agitation of the Brahmins for the control of India. These outcasts recognise that they are safer, more prosperous, But and happier under the rule of the British raj than they would be under the control of the Bengalese babus and others of their kind. This reference brings me to the object of the visit of this enrnent Hindu gentleman to Australia. All that he asked was that the handful of Indians resident in Australia should be given the franchise. That, on the face of it, does not seem to be a great deal to ask of us, since there are only a few hundred of these people in the Commonwealth. But those who know anything about the Indian immigrants know that they live, to a large extent, a life altogether apart from the rest of the community. They are foreign in language, in religion, and, above all, in their social conditions and habits. They will not sit to eat with Europeans. I have known travelling Indian hawkers refuse food from those who have allowed them to camp at their homesteads for the night, and have seen them set to work to bake a chupatti on their little iron plates. It is a duty that we owe to ourselves to refuse the franchise to immigrants who are not assimilating with the community. I do'not think I am narrow-minded, but I hold"" that such people, living a life entirely apart from the general community, have no claim to citizenship. To my mind, this request for an extension of the franchise to a few Indians here is really the thin end of a very insidious wedge. India, we know, has 0 sweltering millions struggling with one another for what, from our point of view, is the most miserable kind of existence. To those who contend that the control of India by Great Britain has been one of unexampled tyranny-ther e are within the British Empire people who are always magnanimous in their criticism of every country except their own, and who always take the worse view of their own country's actionsI would say that under British rule the population of India has increased by leaps and bounds. That is a very significant fact, suggesting the beneficial nature of the British rule. Previously the Indian population, from time immemorial, had been kept down by war, plague, and famine, each in turn desolating the entire continent. That, however, was put an end to by British rule. While at the beginning of the nineteenth century the population of India was estimated at about 100,000,000, we find that in 1911 -the date of the latest census-the population had increased to 315,000,000. That [17] process is likely to go on, and we shall reach a point at which there will be an irresistible clamour that India shall have other parts of the world offered for her surplus population, for whose subsistence she cannot provide. Where is it likely to be suggested that the surplus population of India can be thrust if not into the northern part of Australia? A very grave danger to our White Australia policy is to be apprehended from this source, and it is well that responsible men throughout Australia should not lose sight of it. It is idle to shut our eyes to the danger before us. It is absurd that we should bury our heads, ostrichlike in the sand and say, "" All is well."" All is not well. All may be well for us, but all will certainly not be well for our children unless we seize upon the one thing that is vital to the continuance of a White Australia, and that is the introduction of immigrants of our own race. It is no use saying that there are reasons why we cannot take them in. There is one overwhelming reason why we must receive them, and that is the existence of Australia as a white community. when they land here? our population by bringing people here to starve, but with the hearty co-operation of all classes of the community a sane policy can be evolved and carried out that will'bring here the right class of immigrants and settle them comfortably on the soil where their labours can be utilized to their own advantage and that of the community generally. It is useless to bring them into the already overcrowded avenues of employment in our cities. But we have millions of acres of open country that can be utilized for the settlement of immigrants of our own race. I regret, however, that, with the exception of the efforts made by the Premier of Western Australia there has heen no' concerted movement to bring in these people, and to put them on the land in numbers that will make any material difference to the population. member think that we should first settle our own people on the land? settle our own people on the land, but",29,Uxited Kixgdosi Australia

In some instances, honourable members opposite have not made their position clear. clear. ' ber has a clear and emphatic style of speech, and probably has made his position quite clear; but that cannot be said of all his 'colleagues. I desire to go back to the point made yesterday by the Minister for Defence that there is not, in certain, parts of Australia, the development of roads and railways which would give us the settlement we require. The difficulty is that the States have not the means to carry out these works. Their recognised sources of -taxation, up to the outbreak of the war, have been and are now being exploited by the Commonwealth. Speaking as an old Federalist, I suggest that it should-be the aim of all Federalists to get back to what was clearly understood when Australia entered into the Federation, and that was that direct taxation should be left to the States. I agree that that is not within the possibility of realization just at present, but it is an aim that ought to be kept before every Federalist. Unless we do get back to the old position it seems to me that the States will continue to be hopelessly crippled in so far as theo provision of money for their proper development is concerned. At the present time one source of revenue after another is being taken from them. Unification v/as once, to a .large extent, the avowed policy of the Labour party. That, with them, was a straight-out policy, but, at the present time, the Government axe bringing about Unification by the strangulation of the States. I , as a Federalist, protest emphatically against that line of action, and will do my best to bring it to an end. I desire to see a better understanding between the Commonwealth and the States than that for which the present Government is responsible. I want to see every possible attempt made to reduce our expenditure, in order to enable the States to carry on their work of development. I know that a good deal has been done in the way of economy in the Department controlled by the Minister for Defence. The Minister has, indeed, done good-work, but there is a great deal more to be accomplished. We still have a toy fleet, absolutely obsolete. We still have a huge",31,Uxited Kixgdosi Australia

This business was oue of the brilliant ideas of the Prime Minister( Mr reckless manner in which they are throwHughes). Cadet training has been tried and found wanting.

There are very many who, like myself, are proud rather tlian sorry to have experienced a share of military training, but not as boys. I intend to move at the earliest opportunity for the abolition of cadet training, on the ground that it is utterly useless, and that the money spent on it , therefore, is Defence one finds waste and completely wasted. The time now given There is radical necesby trainees to such exercises as' they get could be better employed in receiving a proper course of physical training under the responsibility and control of school authorities. To-day we are merely throwing away money and demoralizing our youth by this so-called military training, which is a farce, a delusion, and a snare. There are many other directions in which economy might be achieved, but I I have not the time to point to them at this stage. The Government are setting a very bad example to the people by the ing money about. The appointment of Trade Commissioners, for example, has been deprecated by the whole of the business people of Australia.

The Government, however, are evidently determined that the farmer shall not grumble until he actually gets the rain, for it is now proposed to cut downthe daily weather reports, which are so essential to the primary producer.

Members of the Government, and numbers of those behind the Government, have been touring Australia through the recesa telling the people that the Couutry party is a party of six and that they do not count. We are, as before, still a party of thirteen. If we do not count, what is the reason for the press editorials upon the subject?

I have been sorry to note the remarks of certain Nationalist members of this Parliament who represent city electorates, who have said that we constitute a menace to the country, and who avow that the existence of three parties in the Legislature is the greatest curse imaginable. It is a pity that there are not seventy-five parties in£2,000,000. Anyhow, if a saving of stead .of only three in this House.

They will not deal with isolated years in order to bolster up a false case. They will not be so selected as to incorrectly influence facts. The Minister for Defence was unfortunate in his references and in his statistics yesterday. I am sure he did not willingly misrepresent the true po3it on. He is the last member of this House who would attempt wilfully to mislead the people. The Minister pointed to Australia's alleged flourishing condition. He spoke of its increased production and the like. If the situation is as the Minister painted it, if Australia is enjoying such great times, then the financial statement furnished by the Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) a few days ago did not reveal the true position, and we must be in a very serious plight. According to the Minister iu charge of the House, we are enjoying a very favorable period at present, and these are the best years we have ever known. Yet, according to the Treasurer's own figures, we have gone back to the extent of £5,540,000 in one year. Our deficit is not £205,000, as the Treasurer has put it. When one considers the arrears of income tax, amounting to £4,500,000, and adds the item of £835,000 in respect of payments connected with the Army of Occupation in Europe-neithe r of which Why all this items represents revenue, but both of which are being counted as revenuethen one sees that Australia has receded in this, her best year, to the extent of t says we have certain fixed commitments, and that we cannot possibly economize to the extent of £2,000,000. But, upon that point,' and on another occasion, the Minister when replying to a question by the honorable member for Moreton( Mr Wienholt), stated that he could not say that the Government could not possibly economize to the extent of that £2,000,000 can be made, and is made, this country under the present Government will have gone back £3,540,000 during the best period which we have ever known. honourable member to study what the Treasurer said. have the greatest respect for and the highest opinion of the Treasurer.

The reason for that was probably because 18,000,000 lbs. less was produced in 1910 than in 1911. That is not a fair way in which to provide statistics. member is mistaken. The Minister for Defence dealt with the whole decade from' the financial year 1910-11 to 1920-21. House with particulars dealing with the. acreage of wheat -aver a given period of years. In 1911-12, the total wheat acreage of the Commonwealth was 7,427,000. In 1912-13, 7,000,000 acres were^put under wheat; in 1913-14, 9,000,000 were sown; and in 1914-15, 9,000,000 acres. Then we come to that period in 1915-16 when the Prime Minister and the Premiers of the various States appealed to the men on the land to produce more wheat, and they responded, with the result that we had the record cultivation of 12,484,512 acres. That was certainly one of the five years in which the present Government have been in office; but the cultivation of wheat since then has steadily declined. In 1916-17 it fell to 11,532,828 acres; in increased price of land. What has occa1917-18 it fell still further, to 9,774,658 acres; in 1918-19 there was a still greater fall to 7,990,165 acres; and, again, the year 1919-20 showed another fall to 6,379,560 acres.

Talk about the Repudiation Act of Queensland! The owners of this estate were asked to pay an additional £923 per annum for three years, practically £3,000 over and above what they expected to pay on a valuation previously made by the Government's own valuers.

That is the position facing us at the present time. We are not satisfied with what the present Government are doing, *» but we hope they will see the necessity for some system of economizing. It is certainly the duty of the States to settle people on the land. Although for the last three or four years the Commonwealth Government have been supposed to be giving assistance to the States to help them, in this direction, the Minister for Defence, yesterday, informed the House that not a single shilling had been advanced to the States for this purpose. It is time something was done. it that nothing has been done? fault of the Commonwealth. Government. lies with the States: 0 Government have offered a sop of £100,000 to the meat-growers of Northern Queensland, but as the primary producers are responsible for three-fourths' of the taxable wealth of the Commonwealtli, naturally they contribute three-fourths of the taxation, so that the net actual assist62 per cent, of the output. . ance they get from this subsidy is one farthing out of every penny they are supposed to receive. Mr ErcHAKD EOSTEK -D o yon object to the assistance given to the meatgrowers ? wrong principle has been followed. The Government could have managed to get cheaper freights and lower wages without giving a sop of one farthing, that actually means nothing to the cattle men. It certainly reflects no credit on the Government if they could not succeed in getting these cost reductions in another way. But whilethe Government give £100,000' bonus on the export of meat, they are imposing an extra burden of £100,000 on the man who is growing whqat, that brings a return of £2 8s. per acre from overseas. I refer to the deferred duty on sulphur, which the mining interests and the manure manufacturers now candidly admit will mean an extra 5s. or 7s.per ton on all superphosphate manufactured in Australia. Before the war the farmers were getting their superphosphates,, without which they cannot grow wheat, at £4 6s. per ton. The price is now £6 3s. per ton on rail, or £5 10s. on boat, at Yarraville. £9 10s. with the question. We were told that the farmers would receive great benefit from the deposits on Nauru Island. The Government, which have taken, credit for everything, including the good seasons and the great prosperity that the country has enjoyed, have told us that their action in regard $o securing for Australia a percentage of the phosphatic rock deposits on Nauru Island, would mean cheap superphosphates for the farmers of Australia. The island was actually captured by Australians and the. Australian flag was flown there. In fact, the position in regard to Nauru was exactly identical with that of German New Guinea, over which we have a mandate. But Nauru was immediately handed over to the Imperial Government, and instead of our having the whole of the rights to the deposits on the island, we have only been able to retain 42 per cent, of them. the position as to the proportion we are entitled to get. It has been found necessary to work Ocean Island in conjunction with Nauru. A British company was working Nauru and paying Germany a royalty of ls. per ton on a ninety-nine years' lease.

As soon as any of the primary producers' organizations The Government in that State ask for assistance the Government say, and rightly, that the proposition must stand on a commercial basis.

The Victorian Wheat Corporation, which has done its best to get charters from the Commonwealth Line, has succeeded in getting only three charters from it, because in respect of nearly every application, the price quoted was 5s. to 7s. 6d. more than was quoted by private firms. Whenever the Victorian Wheat Corporation approached the Commonwealth Line for charters it was told that it could not carry at the price quoted by private firms, and that fact was used as a lever by the privatefirms to keep up freights. The Commonwealth Line instead of saving the Victorian wheat producers 2d. per bushel as some of the Ministers have claimed, has actually kept up the freights on wheat. It is responsible for an increase rather than a reduction.

The speech made by the honourable member for Yarra is worthy of reply from a Minister, for there never has been a better case made out in this House since 1 I . became a member. member for Yarra showed clearly that tiie Geelong Woollen Mills had been run in ,the interests of the country, and that, has the Country party the numbers; and up to the present, the Government had given to the House no reasons for disposing of them. This factory was created, not by the Government in power at the. time, but .by Parliament itself. I satbehind the Government which was in power from 191Q to 1913, and the Bill establishing tihe mills was introduced and passed. Now we find the Governmlent, on its own initiative, without consulting Parliament, pursuing a policy which has become rampant-proposin g to dispose of The fact is that both the business, although, as I have pointed I hope that out, it w.as the creation of Parliament. This shows wherie we are drifting. I have often had to say that responsible government is almost a thing of the past so far as the Commonwealth Parliament is concerned. One hears honourable members, especially those of the Country Honourable members party, condemning the Government day after day, and declaring outside what they intend to do in this Parliament in. view of the Government maladministration, and then, whenever an amendment or motion is moved from this side of the chamber' indicting the Government, voting to keep it in power.

Every honourable member opposite has been careful to avoid the amendment, and to discuss general questions, although he knows that he has ample opportunities to discuss the latter on the main issue. We are now dealing with an amendment censuring the Government, and we find the honourable members to whom I am referring saying not one word in regard to it, although, both inside and outside the House, they lose no opportunity to condemn, the Administration. The question really is-wha t is to be done to oust the Government ?

T leave members of the Country party to answer that question. ber assist us in doing away with the Commonwealth Shipping Line? that matter later, and the honourable member will then know my intentions. The Woollen Mills at Geelong have been of great service to this country, inasmuch as they are a paying proposition, and have been the means of saving the Government hundreds of pounds. Returns presented to Parliament in regard to this and other enterprises show that they are paying concerns. If honourable members opposite, more particularly members oi the Country party, are so anxious about the finances of the country, why do they not support the amendment? Early able member for Yarra that cloth can be bought at the Geelong Mills at from 8s. 6d. to 10s. 6d. per yard, while similar material elsewhere costs up to 19s. He also informed us that police uniforms can be made in this .factory at £4, as against a charge of-£17 before it was created A further fact is that the factory has made a profit of £250,000. The figures show that this factory has resulted in reducing the cost of clothing to a large section of the community, and I do not see how any honourable member in this Chamber, who condemns the administration in regard to finance, can justify a vote against the amendment, especially in view of the general desire to reduce the cost of living. The honourable member for Eranklin( Mr Mcwilliams) has expressed the opinion that the cost of living is out of all proportion to the increases in wages resliould be done 'to rectify that position. The amendment presents an opportunity to, reduce the cost of living so far as clothing is concerned; and why do the Government desire to abandon this particular enterprise? Is it because its existence reduces the cost of material to the people who are fortunate enough to get supplies from the factory? We can get no satisfactory answer to the question. opposite will vote to wipe out this factory. why? Because the Government always put private enterprise before the welfare of the people. Private interests must remain intact in the interests of Plinderslane, which will be permitted to regulate prices as before. When we recently, on tlie motion of the honourable member for were fortunate enough to get sufficient support, decided to compel manufacturers of such goods to supply orders of £50 worth, the Government whipped up their friends in the Senate and rejected the idea.

If manufacturers could bit compelled to supply such orders to the small storekeepers, living would certainly be made cheaper, because the stxiff would gp from the factory to the consumer through those storekeepers. That, however, must not be tolerated; the -idea of the Government is that woollen -goods must be taken from the factory to -Flinders-lane, and that travellers from ""the Lane must go for orders from storekeepers in the very town where .the goods were manufactured. The wholesale firms will make what charges they like, and the consumer will pay, providing the high profits. you speaking of? and clothing principally. Why is it that when we are so anxious to reduce the cost of living honourable members are prepared to support an action by the Government which means an increase? I The sale of' these mills will assist those who control to-day the prices of various commodities. Every one knows that prior to the establishment of Commonwealth factories there was an understanding between the producers of many goods as to the prices at which they should be sold. We all know of the effect which the establishment of State brickworks in New South Wales had on the local price of bricks. In 1919 a Commission was appointed to inquire into the operations of rhe works. The then Liberal party, now known as the National party, had opposed their .establishment, and various charges were made in regard to their management. The inquiry showed, however, that the State brickworks had been able to sell bricks at 36s. 6d. per 1,000, whereas the private brickmakers were asking 50s. per 1,000 for them. If private enterprise can only get rid of the competition of Government-owned industries, it will be able to fix its own prices. It appears to me that an understanding has been arrived at ibetween the Government and certain outside interests in regard to the disposal of the Commonwealth Woollen Mill, at Geelong, and the closing down of other Commonwealth activities. Sir Thomas Henley, soon after joining the Fuller Government, stated definitely that it was the policy of that Administration to abolish all State enterprises, and that if any one of its industries was allowed to carry on, care would be taken to prevent it from competing with private enterprise. What has been the result of that policy? Under the Labour Government the State factory supplied bread at £d. per 4-lb. loaf below the price charged by the ordinary retailer. It is no longer allowed to do so. And so with the State meat works. The dosing down of the State brickworks is threatened, and the Government is talking of selling, the State timber yards. The manager of the State saw-mills said recently in Newcastle that the cost of a wooden cottage, which in ordinary circumstances would amount to £1,200, had been reduced by £150 as the result of timber being supplied by the State mills. Those mills are to be shut down. Apparently the influences that are at work in New South Wales are operating throughout Australia, and, I have no doubt, are being .brought to bear on the Commonwealth, Government. What a change has taken place in the composition of the Ministry now led by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes). The majority of the members of the Government which he formed shortly after he left the Labour party had served with him in the ranks of Labour.

This is but the thin edge of the wedge. The Prime Minister, if he succeeds in this proposal, will follow it up with others of a similar kind.

I shall stand by my principles as I have always done. I have nothing to fear, and those who know me give me credit for having the courage of my opinions. The Postmaster-General( Mr Poynton) is endeavouring to camouflage the real position, but he cannot. The facts have to be faced. Surely the Government is not entitled to dispose of a , State enterprise, which is paying its way, -without first obtaining the approval of Parliament! There is too much of this sort of thing going on. Honourable members of the Country party, who constantly complain of the failure of the Government to consult Parliament in regard to various matters, have not condemned them for their attitude in this connection. They remain silent in this case, because the action contemfjlated by the Government will give private enterprise, for which they stand, a further opportunity to exploit the people. We hear them deploring from about sugar time to time the high cost of living and urging also that wages should be reduced. We hear the Prime Minister calling on the workers to "" Produce, produce, produce!"" so that we may be able to balance the national accounts. 'Yet not a word is said by him or the Country party in regard to the sale of a Commonwealth factory which is not only paying its way, but saving the people's money.

They speak of practically everything else except this all-important question. knew of the hollow criticism of the Government in which the Country party indulges. Members of it say that the administration of the Government is not in the best interests of the country, and from time to time they publish in the press statements as to what they are going to do; but, after all, actions speak louder than words. When this amendment is put we shall find them voting with the Government, as they did in connection with the last two censure amendments. Their attitude last session was the same, and their only justification for not voting against the Government is that they cannot see their way to support Labour. Every one knows that if the Country party supported this amendment, with the result that the Government were defeated, the Labour party could not form a new Administration with any hope of carrying on, and that there would have to be an appeal to the people. Are we afraid to go before the people? affairs of the country are being administered in a slipshod way, why are not honourable members of the Country party prepared to support this amendment? opposite are very anxious for a general election! appeal to the people next week. honourable member's party to "" count noses "" before such an event takes place. that, as the result of a general election, Labour would be the strongest party in this House. What are tlie signs of the times? Five or six of the Victorian supporters of the Government are likely to come back after the next general election as a separate party. One or two of tlie Government supporters from Tasmania are likely to join 'the Country party, and another seat is likely to come to us. Then, again, South Australia will probably return a couple of members of -the old Liberal party and two more members of the Labour party. In Queensland the Prime Minister recently put up a "" stunt "" to try to destroy the influence of the Country party in that State, knowing that it has there a chance of winning It is time that the public a couple of seats now held by Nationalists. There, again, the Government will -lose support. In face of all these facts,-why should the Postmaster-General suggest that we are 'afraid to go to the people ? As a matter of fact, we have everything to gain from an appeal to the people. In any event, we have a right to put before the people who send us here what is oroposed to be done in regard to the Commonwealth factories. The Woollen Mills at Geelong have, shown good returns, and if, as the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) has said, they have saved the Oommonwealth some £250,000 during the past two years, what justification can there be for disposing of it . What influence is at work? There is in Victoria and New South. Wales an organization which has for its object the abolition of all "" State enterprises. It is out to see that private enterprise shall regain complete control of all industry. There is no reason why a factory of this kind should not be permitted to supply the public. Some people, of course, might raise the constitutional aspect, but that would not count for anything. What is there to prevent the Government from permitting the employees and their manager to work the Factory on a cooperative basis, or in any other manner so long as the mill fulfils the purpose for which it was established ?. There could still be Government control and responsibility. If the Factory is disposed of, other public activities will no doubt be treated similarly. I suppose that the next interest to be sacrificed will be the Commonwealth Line. The Government would seek to justify the sale of the Commonwealth fleet, no doubt, on the basis of some trivial laboxr dispute. Everybody knows that Lord Inchcape wants to get hold of the Line, for then there would be brought about increased freights.

Yet, when they are given an opportunity of suiting action to their words, they shrink from doing anything. This afternoon those honourable members of the Country partu who have spoken have ignored the amendment. They have chosen once more to verbally attack the Government, at the same time assisting them to remain in office, however, by talking upon everything else but the issue before the Chair. In one breath they say that the Government are not fit to retain office; in..the next moment they voteto support the' Government in the-, retention -of the Treasury-bench. ber of the Country party will vote for the amendment.

The case established by its mover, the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) calls, at any rate, for a reply from the Government. A better case was never put and clinched in this House. The honourable member marshalled his facts most ably and put his points clearly and forcibly; they canin the' corner have avoided all reference to the amendment, merely demonstrating, as I have already mentioned, that niltheir criticism' of the Government goes for nothing-.

It cropped up only a few days ago, when the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Cunningham) asked me if , in speaking then, he forfeited his right to speak on a further amendment. I then made the position clear. It was that, after an amendment had been moved, any honourable 'member who speaks is taken to have spoken both to the original motion and to that amendment. ber has his opportunity to speak to both the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply and to any amendment that may have been moved thereto; and if he fails to avail himself of that opportunity to speak to the main question, he cannot at any later stage speak to it ; but he does not lose his right to speak to any amendment moved subsequently, so long as he confines his remarks strictly to that amendment. It has been laid down that, once an amendment has been moved, any honourable member speaking thereto will be taken to have spoken both to the amend| ment and to the original motion. I would only now remind honourable members again that those who have not previously spoken still have the right to address themselves to the amendment and to the original motion. The honourable member for Cowper has previously spoken, in connection with a prior ameudment. At this stage, therefore, he must confine his remarks strictly to the present amendment. Country party repel the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) that they have any desire to burke the issue raised in connection with the woollen cloth mill at Geelong. We regard the amendment as one which raises a very important principle-on e of the most significant, indeed, that can come under the attention of the Federal Parliament. The question is really whether the money of the taxpayers shall be used for the proper function of government-that is, for governing-o r whether public funds shall be employed in the direction of trade has come under discussion this afternoon^ competition with the citizens of whom the State is composed. Though there is much to be said, from the ideal point of view, of State ownership, the lesson which Australia has learned during the past seven or eight years has cured any tendency to enlarge the scope of Government activities, or any leaning, indeed, towards the continuance of those in existence. I was gratified to note that the New South Wales elections turned very largely upon this issue, namely, whether there should be a continuous extension of Government trading, or whether private enterprise should be allowed to control commercial activities. Various difficulties have stood in the way of the disposal of the GovernThus au honourable memment undertakings in New South Wales. I am glad that the Commonwealth Government have determined at last ""to take a definite stand. There will now need to be a change, however, in the name of the Government party.

The public has never yet been vouchsafed an adequate reason why the Colonial Ammunition Company's works should be taken over and conducted as a Government project.

Last November we were told that it was imperative we should keep £45,000 on the Estimates for the purpose of enlarging, these mills, and the Government fought for week after week against any reduction of the whole of their Estimates as presented, yet a few months afterwards they discovered that in three months of each year tlie Geelong Woollen Mills could turn out the whole of the woollen cloth requirements of the Commonwealth Departments. ' vernment has changed since the last Estimates were under consideration. sonnel of the Civil Service has not changed to any extent in the same period. We have approximately the same number of civil servants to-day that there were in the Commonwealtli Service at the time the Government proposed not to sell, but to extend, these mills. We should not treat this proposed sale as a separate matter. It is time this Parliament decided by its vote whether it is in favour of Government ownership or Government enterprise as a general principle, or whether it is disposed to give private enterprise a chance of developing those concerns which are now under Government ownership. Nothing has done more in Australia to bring about the centralization and the decreased production we all deplore than has the invasion by various Governments, State and Federal, of all those functions and activimiles of Melbourne. Here was a Proties which in nearly every otlier country are carried out more effectively and satisboundary. Duties are usually, and ought factorily by private agencies. Take the instance of the railways. Honourable ' members opposite suggest that the Geelong Woollen Mills should be kept going competing in the open market. If that were done, the Commonwealth Government would be obliged to fight, because it would have no monopoly; but, in regard to railways in Australia, which are but an extension of the same principle that honourable members opposite advocate, the Governments of Australia enjoy a monopoly. Nothing has been more damaging is the Governor destructive to the national life of Australia than the tyranny brought about by the Government ownership of railways. member sell the railways? them dealt with in a different way. I would like to point out in this connection what has happened to country district enterprises. The Deputy Leader of the Country party ( Mr Fleming) mentioned last week the treatment of the produce of works at Aberdeen, in New South Wales. The freight for meat products from that town to Sydney is 63s. per ton. The freight from Sydney to Aberdeen is 31s. 6d. per ton. The money of the whole of the taxpayers of any particular State is used in a way which is exceedingly detrimental to the activities of people who have invested their capital in country districts. This has also happened in Victoria. Complaint has been heard in this House of the loss of mining population from country districts. I shall show how the influence of the cities over Government-owned railway freights has brought this about. In places like Bendigo and Castlemaine, fairly large engineering establishments existed before mining declined, and they were in aposition to compete with city establishments. But, in order to prevent this, the city influence on the Government was such that the railway freight on machinery from these outlying industrial centres was increased from 3d. to 7d. per ton per mile. Finally a compromise was arrived at, and the railway authorities agreed to carry the output of these country engineering establishments at 5d. per ton so long as it was not sold within 50 tective Tariff applied within a State to be only, fixed at the border, and are not applied to one particular area of a country. I have given one instance of where the Government invasion of industrial activities has led us.

308,Dr. Earle Page,"I would havethat the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) deserves the thanks of the House for having raised, at this time, the issue of whether the Government -are to not merely dispose of the Geelong Woollen Mills, but also encourage, deliberately, initiative, enterprise, and individuality, without which this sparsely-settled continent of 3,000,000 square miles will never be developed. The issue involves also the question of whether the Government are to discourage those qualities by a policy of interfering with trade and commerce and entering into business competition, with advantages that are obviously unfair to private competitors. Most of the Government trading concerns, whilst they may, perhaps, be debited with certain charges for interest, sinking fund, stimulates country development, makes and so on, do not pay taxation as private concerns are required to do. It seems to me that we have to decide much more than the future of the. Geelong Woollen Mills. We have to settle the question as to whether there is to be an outlook different from what we have had during the last few years, and whether the money raised by the taxpayers should be diverted to manufacturing purposes for Government material, or used in productive development. member mean by productive development? sently the manner in which I think the business of Government should be handled, and the effect that our use of so much of the public credit and funds as has beeu used for Government trading concerns has on rural and national development. to the question as to what we are to do in regard to these trading concerns will depend, to a large extent, the future cost of government in the first place, and, tive systems in rural districts. Morein the second place, the distribution of population. ( Mr Greene), speaking yesterday in regard to the distribution of population, said that the causes of the drift to the cities were economic. extent they are, , but they are also political. This drift has been caused largely by the way in which industries have been built up about the cities, and especially by the manner in which certain Government Departments have been expanded and administered. If one studies .conditions abroad, he does not find in the United States of America, Canada, or the Argentine-al l new countries with problems similar to our ownone city in a State practically monopolizing half the population. That is a condition that exists only in Australia. In those countries there are many cities and large towns, each with its own local secondary industries, and the reason why those cities and large towns have been developed is that the functions of Government have been restricted to governing, and have not extended to trading. Each of these many towns scattered throughout the territory functions as a centre of refinement,, education, and industry, the people, more contented with their lot, and provides them with a local market. It is remarkable that during the last five or' six years in which there has been a continual expansion of the spheres of governmental activity, and a continual invasion by the Government of avenues which hitherto were left entirely to private enterprise, with a resultant increase of population about the capital cities, i there has 'been a steady decrease in productiou and in the area under cultivation. In 1915-16, the second^ year of the war, when we had scarcely reached the stage at whicli we arrived in. the last'year of. the war, there was under crop 18,500,000 acres, whilst in 1921 the area under crop was only 15,069,000, or a diminution of something like 3,500,000 acres. with the Woollen Mills? On the answer because the money, extracted from, its proper channels in order to finance Government trading enterprises, should have been devoted fo the development of the country and the financing of co-operaover, the fact that soi niaDy emThe Minister for Defence ployees naturally congregate about these Government enterprises has led to an increase in the total number of non-producers..

They are almost on all-fours with the Geelong Woollen Mills. They were taken over as a going concern at a cost of, approximately, £450,000. They were worked for a few weeks,' and now they are practically idle, and the money expended on them represents a dead loss which will have to be made good by the taxpayer. Though we may occasionally see instances in which, for a short time only, these enterprises are successfully and satisfactorily conducted, they ultimately, when political influence gets control, become a dumping ground for friends. Like other similar activities, they become a drag on the whole community; and, instead of being profitable, as this mill apparently is now, they simply form a sink for public money. For those reasons I am. totally opposed to the carrying on of such enterprises. I do not think an industry like this should be sacrificed; it ought to be sold to good advantage. I should like very much to see the returned soldiers have an opportunity to purchase the mill on a cooperative basis. any ""get-away""; my views have been very plainly stated on the question of private enterprise versus Government enterprise.

( for Defence and Health) [8.19] I desire to say a few words about the amendment moved by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin). I do not propose to follow that honourable member through the wild whirl of words to which he treated us last night. The issue is a very simple one; it is simply the issue between those who believe in nationalization and those who believe in individualism. The gulf between honourable members opposite and those who sit on this side is a very wide one. The amendment of the honourable member for Yarra is one we would naturally expect from the Opposition, and 1 do not quarrel in the slightest with the presentment of their view. After all is said and done, they are simply, in this amendment, giving effect to the policy to which they are pledged and bound.

348,Mr Greene,"I repeat that, rather-As to the returned soldiers, we made a contract with them last year .to supply them with, I think, 198,000 yards. The soldiers did not take all of that quantity by a good deal, and the deliveries to the Returned Soldiers Associations became unsatisfactory. In view of the fact that they had their own mill at Geelong which would shortly be turning out cloth, and would presumably be supported by them, it seemed to us unlikely, in view of memory, I cannot say what capital they the deliveries during recent months, that their requirements would amount to very much. The deliveries, to the returned soldiers, so far as I have been able to ascertain tliem, for the first nine months of the last financial year were-July, 21,382 yards; August, 9,791 yards; September, 1S,726 yards; October, 11,050 yards; November, 6,751 yards; and December, 1,085 yards. In . the following month they took 3,S40 ya&ds; in February, 7,894 yards; and Starch. 10,962 yards. This was not anything like the quantity they had contracted to take, and these irregularities of deliveries were one of the greatest sources of trouble to the mill. If a man has a customer who is -taking 25,000 or 30,000 yards a month, and accepting regular delivery, he knows what to do in running a mill, but with' a consumer who takes 21,000 yards of material in one month-and even that may not be up to the requirements of the contract-whil e in the following month he cuts down his order to 1,085 yards, he finds it almost impossible to carry on. prevent the Government from running the honourable members opposite advocate. mill to its full capacity and selling to the public? togethpr with the knowledge we possessed socialization of industry by Governments that the returned soldiers' factory at ir: Australia.

Surely the Governmenit might have offered them the Commonwealth factory on terms. inaccurate figures, and, speaking from had. pared with the Commonwealth mill the returned soldiers' factory is only a small one. The Leader of the Opposition asked why we did not sell to the public. I presume he means that we should sell to tlie public, not through Flinders-lane, but by means of a distributing organization of our own. If we did, I venture to say that all the profits from the mill would immediately disappear. Are the comparatively few people living in the neighbourhood of the mill only to benefit from such sales to ""the public? Are not the people outback, and indeed throughout the country, entitled to benefit? If we had to set up an organization, spreading over the whole community, to sell the products of the mill, the overhead charges would more than have swallowed up any profits obtained from it. Apart altogether from that question, it is here that we come to the dividing line between the policy of the party and that for whioh we stand.

He, at all events, is aware that they are going to make a big loss. I do not propose to take up any more of the time of the House. I want only to refer to one remark made by the honourable member for Oowper (Dr. Earle Page) in the course of his speech. I do not know how he connected it with the amendment before the Chair; but, since he was permitted to make it, I presume I shall be allowed to reply. The honourable member referred to the area under cultivation in the years 1915, 1916, and 1917. If . he knew -anything about the subject he would be aware that the Government of that day made a special appeal to the farmers of Australia to put undercrop every foot of their land, if possible; and what happened was that in many instances; instead of fallowing their land, they rushed in a crop. said this afternoon. honourable member's speech; but that is the explanation of the extra area xinder wheat in the years mentioned. The fact that that additional area was under wheat, however, does not affect by one iota the figures I gave the House yesterday, since, instead. of having that extra area under wheat to-day, we have it in fallow. With that I have done. The Government cannot, accept this amendment. For the. abundant reasons I have given, we propose to goon with the sale of the mill's,because we do not stand for the socialization, of industry in. this country. I should like to. start, exactly at. the Trust Fund, point where the Minister for Defence 1921. ( Mr Greene) stopped in his references 1,323,274 9 1 405,891 0 8 to iState enterprises in Queensland, by 39,740 Cr. 6,383 17 6 3 6 reminding the House that the present 1,842 2 0 45,390 1 4 Federal Government^ was responsible for 42,004 3 ' 5 23,046 11 9 50,126 6 0 84,103 10 0 the purchase, of timber mills in Queens£86 13 3 land-the biggest blunder ever made 5,948 7 11 Or. 5,215 13 10 by any Administration-a t a cost of 587,654 14 5 £500,000, and then closed them down.

The Minister( Mr Greene) says that they do not stand for State socialization of -industry, or for the Government entering into partnership with private individuals to carry on any business. What have they to say in regard to the £250,000 which they have put into the business of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company? What do they say as to the £500,000 which they have put into the Australasian Wireless Oompany?

358,Mr Fenton (Maribyrnong) [S.42]'.,"The head of the Disposals Board, which is now the real Government of Australia, is the Minister who has just attempted to reply to the splendid speech made last night by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin). He is the chairman of the Board which is proceeding to dispose of tbe Commonwealth factories set up by the Labour Government between 1910 and 1913, and which, I think, I can safely say during the war saved the taxpayers millions.of pounds. Speaking at the opening of these mills, on 22nd December, 1915, Senator Pearce saidHe took special pride in the ceremony, hecause lie had proposed the factory. The object in building this and other factories had been to eliminate, as far as possible, private profits all costs, and clear its field of competifrom the war. . . . Whatever profit was made from these factories would be a profit to the people of Australia,. The mill was intended to provide the soldier and sailor with uniforms and clothing during thc war, and wlien the war was over it was to provide uniforms for the Citizen Forces and the Naval Forces, and, lie ihopcd, for the postal employees. If the recent decision of the High Court had been given at that time, Senator Pearce would have been able to say that there was no constitutional barrier in the way of this Government factory proceeding to sell to the general public. The Minister has referred to what has happened in connection with State-owned industries in Queensland. There is another side to the coin. After hearing a lecture by Ingersoll upon "" The mistakes of Moses,"" a certain gentleman said, "" We have heard Ingersoll on the mistakes of Moses. I should like to hear Moses on the mistakes of Ingersoll."" heard the Minister's attack on the State industries of Queensland. I should like to hear a reply by Mr Theodore, who knows all about them. I am not concerned as to the exact profits made by some of these institutions; but I say that since the effectQof their operations has been to prevent exploitation, the people have gained immeasurably. If the Disposals Board next proceeds to get rid of the Commonwealth Line of steamers, I believe that even the Country party will rise in protest. Surely they will say, in behalf of the people whom they are presumed to represent, that it is better by far for the Commonwealth to maintain ownership than that the ships should be turned over to the private profiteers. For Mr Fenton. have they not been an insurance to producers against Lord Inchcape and his Combine, which would very rapidly raise freights but for the steadying, influence of the Commonwealth Line? The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) quoted last night from the reports of the Inter-State Commission. He demonstrated what private enterprise did during the war, and how it fleeced not only the Government, but the soldier, the soldier's widow, the soldier's wife and children, and the public at large. Apparently because private enterprise is possessed of such magnificent virtues as these, the Government would retain it at tion. With such a heartless individual presiding over the Defence Department as the present Minister( Mr Greene), one can understand why men and women have been unceremoniously turned out of employment, and their families'left to face the pinch of hardship. Speaker, I take serious exception to the honourable member saying that I have heartlessly sacked men from the Defence Department without regard to their women and children. The allegation is incorrect and is objectionable.

I desire to turn attention now to the doings of Governments which would claim that they are anything but socialistic. I rejoice in the fact that, under the auspices of the Victorian Government, and by special Act of Parliament, we are on the eve of witnessing the institution of what w ill amount almost to a monopoly of the supply of electricity for power and light.

I am confident that Victoria w ill enjoy superb revenues as an outcome of the electricity scheme, and that the State Government, as a result, w ill be able to reduce the burden of taxation. Government which is anything but Socialistic, we have a most promising example of Socialism, pure and simple. Considerable profits have been made by the Queensland railway refreshment rooms branch, maintained as a publio Socialistic aotivity. The same can be said in respect of the railway refreshment rooms in this State, for thousands of pounds are flowing from them into the coffers of the Victorian Treasury where previously, these revenues helped to build private fortunes. vernment in Western Australia. that Government abolished the State implement works? Wouldi t dare to? Rather, I understand, it is extending them. Western Australian farmers have had bitter experience of private exploitation. They have made up their minds that they will have no more of it ; and, the Government of that State, no matter how it might be composed, would not dare to close down the State works, or turn them over to the profiteers. The Commonwealth has its own railway systems, and postal services. stand for handing over those activities to the tender mercies of private exploiters? Some of the States have their own insurance schemes. The Minister for Defence cunningly avoided all reference to the marked National Insurance concern, which has reduced the cost of insurance throughout that State. Can any man estimate the benefit which has accrued to the people of Queensland as the outcome of that establishment alone? Whati f the Queensland Government has lost on its stations and its butcher shops ? I do not say thati t has; but what if such were the case? The Government insurance scheme more than makes up for everything. Why is the Commonwealth Government seeking to dispose of the Factory at Geelong? Isi t not in order to give private enterprise a "" show "" ? As soon as Government competition is wiped out the manufacturers of woollen goods will have a clear .field, and up will go the prices. What w i ll the Government be called upon then to pay for the uniforms of its postal employees, and of the military, naval, and aerial personnel^ Even the Victorian Government has been influenced by those same Here, under the regime of a unseen forces which are now forcing the hands of the Commonwealth Government. Private exploiters said, "" Do not give your orders for the uniforms of your police, and firemen, and railway officials to the Commonwealth Clothing Factory."" Why did private enterprise so speak to the State Government? It was because the oflicial uniforms were being provided more cheaply, and of better quality, than the private exploiters could t u r n them out. But what of the people? W h a t of their interests? W ill they stand for the There is a Coalitionist GoGovernment wiping out the only element Has of insurance agaiust profiteering ? In Viotoria, we once had a number of contractors whom we allowed to grow f a t at the expense of the taxpayers. But have any contractors built a mile of Victorian railway during the past twenty years ? W l i y has the Victorian Government been pursuing its "" iniquitous "" policy of building -its own railways? It is because it has .found that it can cut out the profits of the contractors, and avoid costly Would the people litigation, and that it can save considerable sums in the building of lines of better material, and lines which w ill last longer than those constructed by private individuals. What is being done at the Newport success of the Queensland workshops? Once the crv was heard that i*"" was iniquitous for the State Railways Department to compete against private factories.

The workers in this country, as in other countries, know f u l l well that ownership by the .State of any particular industry or industries is no more Socialism than is private ownership by, say, the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company, or any other group of capitalists who combine for the monopoly of an industry. Control by the Commonwealth of the shipping line is no more Socialism than would be control by the Shipping Ring. That is proved by the fact that the Commonwealth Government, who are in control of the shipping line, have entered into an arrangement with the Inchcape Combine. So this attempt to make it appear that these Govermnent enterprises are Socialism is merely throwing dust in the eyes of the workers. Honourable members opposite, for electioneering purposes, wish to make out that "" nationalization "" is a terribly revolutionary measure. The audacity of members on this side desiring to nat'onalize various industries! The Minister for Defence( Mr Greene) read out the programme adopted at the Labour Conference in Brisbane as an indication of the revolution that is said to have been planned by honourable members on tlrs side for the purpose of socializing Australian industry. I am one of those who believe that honourable members opposite will prove, in the future, as they have done in the past, that in certain circumstances they will outdo honourable members on this side of the House in regard to nationalization. able member is supporting them.. Every time the Government are in danger he votes for them. voted on the honourable member's side at times. member return to the amendment? reasons why I am supporting the amendment Those reasons are very different from those advanced by the mover. The' honourable member for Echuca and his party are opposed to the amendment because they wish to convey to the, people who sent them to the House the impression that the nationalization of the Woollen Mills or any other industry is something to be deprecated; but we heard an admission by the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page) , that in regard to 1 finance they support nationalization, because it would give rural credits to the people whom they represent. get those rural credits. bers in the corner are keeping the Government in power, and it is their own fault if they do not get their price. It is quite apparent that the honourable member and his party would support the nationalization of the Woollen Mills and the Shipping Line provided they could get better prices for their wool or cheaper freights than they are able to get from the private companies. The whole burden of their complaint to-night was that the Commonwealth Shipping Line charges are dearer than those of private companies. 1 able members in the corner do not believe in the nationalization of shipping because it costs them more. yantage in nationalization of shipping if we got cheaper freights meau that some one else would be paying for what the honourable member' and his friends were getting cheaply. Honourable members will recognise the fact that nationalized railways have been found to be better, not for the workers employed in connection with them, but for those people who exploit the workers. That is the only benefit of nationalization, because, whenever there is a desire on the part of the workers engaged in these instrumentalities to improve their positions honourable members opposite, who represent varied vested interests, combine against I should be sorry if I them. Any party which obtains control of the Treasury Bench in this or any other country under the present economic system must administer the existing "" State,"" which is a "" capitalist State.'' Therefore, it is futile for the workers to believe that they can obtain any lasting benefit from any political party which comes into office to carry on the existing order.

It has been my lot to contend with things as they are, and not as I should like them to be.

404,Mr Listee,"I was given to underGovernment to install the necessary machinery for the manufacture of worsteds. I agree most heartily with the honorahle member for Yarra in his remarks as to the excellent manner in which the Geelong Woollen Mill has been managed. I I do not know that there could have been secured'two .better men anywhere in the world than those who have managed this establishment up to the present time. They know their business from A to Z. They have made a success of the Factory, and I regret very much that the Government have not seen fit to show in some practical, tangible way their appreciation of their work. this enterprise has been managed cannot be advanced as a reason for its disposal. agement has been excellent,, and the same may be said of the work of the whole mills staff. I look, however, beyond the mills as they stand to-day. I recognise that if they are sold, in all probability there will be a rapid development of the industry. Such an extension, I know, will work against my personal political interests, but to that I pay no attention. When the mills are sold, and their maohinery is duplicated, or machinery for the manufacture of worsted is installed, they will probably work two or three shifts a day, and so give employment to two or three times the number now working in them. I recognise that if that happens my -political interests will be affected to a considerable degree. ber recognises that he does not represent the workers ? thing of the kind. I believe, however, that the majority of the employees in the Factory hold political views different from my own, and naturally desire to secure the return of one who represents the particular policy they advocate. accrue to tbe public from the sale of these mills? mills by a large company or firm would increase competition, which, at present, is very limited, and so benefit the public. I have been looking up Hansard lately, and am surprised that it has not occurred to others who have been similarly occupied during the last' few days, that if we sell these mills, and La'bour comes 'into power again, every member of that party will have another opportunity to advocate tlie erection of Commonwealth mills i u his own electorate. We shall then have probably a repetition of the fight which took place between honourable members of the Labour party as to the location of these mills. in our outlook. members, of the honourable member's party opposed the erection of these mills at Geelong, and wanted tliem to be established in New South Wales. State jealousies displayed in connection with the erection of these mills were almost as pronounced as those engendered in connection with the bush capital. The Minister for Defence( Mr Greene) has put before the House certain reasons why, in the opinion of the Government, the mills fJiould be sold. Attempts have been made by the Opposition to show that ""Flinders-lane"" has been bringing influence to bear on the Government to induce them to dispose of them. It is all very well for honourable members to infer that undue influences have been operating, but when an honourable member says, as the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) did, a few minutes ago, that he knows that certain influences have been brought to bear on honourable members on this side of the House to induce them to support the sale of the mills, he should say straight out by whom, and upon whom, those influences have been operating. vote will largely show the extent to which he has been influenced. are as clean as those of the honourable member, and I hope they always will be.

One of my objections to the State control of these mills is that, with the extension of their operations, the cost of distributing their products would be infinitely greater than is the cost of distribution in the case of privately-owned mills. ""With few exceptions, the commercial travellers Avho are to be found in thousands in Australia do not travel with one particular line of goods. They are employed by firms who handle many lines, and the cost of distribution is proportionately reduced. If the Government had to establish retail houses for the sale of the products of these mills, which'are very limited in number, and had, in addition, to provide for the usual hangers-on of such establishments in the shape of an expensive staff of inspectors and so forth, the costs would accumulate to such an extent that I do not think it would be possible to place the output of the mills on the market at the prices quoted by private firms who distribute their lines through Elinders-lane. Nothing is to be gained by labouring this question. I had intended to refer to other matters mentioned in the Governor General's Speech, but as the hour is getting late, and no doubt many honourable members are very tired, I shall refrain from further occupying the attention of the House. I felt, however, that it was my duty to give expression to my views on this question before we proceeded to a division. I have done so, and am conscious of the fact that the stand I take spect has been considered. The honourable in this matter will probably operate against me politically, but that considerahe would be injured politically by the sale tion will not in any way influence me in the vote I shall give. regret that the Acting Leader of the House( Mr Greene) is absent, since I desire to compliment him on the fact that his speech to-night shows that he is just as Conservative as he was when the Fisher Government was in power and brought down the Bill providing for the establishin. private enterprise. Once we dispose ment of the Commonwealth Bank. The honourable gentleman, who was then in Opposition, declared that all efforts to establish the Commonwealth Bank would fail dismally; and that if we started to compete with the private banking institutions ruin would stare us in the face. Much bad feeling was created by the speeches made by members of the Liberal party in the course of the debate on that measure. speeches in condemnation of the Labour party's proposal were made during the debate, and the honourable member was amongst those who did all they could to prevent the passing of the Bill. What has been the result of the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank? The predictions of failure in which the then Opposition indulged have not been, verified. No doubt, they would have liked the Commonwealth Bank to be a failure, but it has saved this country hundreds of thousands of pounds. It has, in addition, been of enormous advantage to the commercial community, because during the war it kept down interest rates. It has also floated our loans at a very reasonable rate, and saved the Commonwealth much -in the way of commission that it had formerly to pay. The establishment of the Comntonwealth Bank stands to the credit of the Labour party; and the Government are seeking now to detract from our credit by selling the woollen mills which we also established, and which have rendered such good service to the people. The Government have not been able to point the finger of scorn at the mills, or the work turned out by them. They are a magnificent factory, splendidly situated, and the comfort of the employees in every remember for Corio( Mr Lister) said that of the factory. If the Commonwealth disposes of it, not only the honourable member, but the employees, as well as those engaged, in other mills, will suffer. The conditions of the workers in the Commonwealth Woollen Mills are better than those of the men and women employed in private factories. The high standard set up by us has led to improved conditions of the mills, the labour conditions, in privately-owned factories will go down.

The mere fact that this woollen cloth factory at Geelong has been in existence has had the effect of keeping prices down wherever the product has been sold throughout the Commonwealth.

There is a private firm in New South Wales known as the Clyde Engineering T h a t is due to restricCompany, which has been building locomotives by contract. The Government railway workshops have turned out engines, constructed by day labour, which are of a better type, and are cheaper, and more satisfactory altogether.

I do not object, but I emphasize the fact that the Government shops are doing better and cheaper work. What of the future of the employees in the Geelong factory ?

This is a great, new land, with huge, undeveloped areas, which must be thrown open hy State enterprise. If , then, the Government are going to settle new immigrants they must extend their State instrumentalities. Could private enterprise conceivably handle so huge a proposition? The present control is Socialism to a certain extent.

The honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister), in May, 1920, asked the then Assistant Minister for Defence( Sir Granville Ryrie) some questions about the proposed extension of the Woollen Mills at Geelong, and in reply the Assistant Minister said the Government were prepared to extend the mills and allow the material to be sold to, private people. What is the reason for the change now? And what is the policy of the Government with regard to the Wireless Agreement? Are they not going into partnership with private enterprise, and are they not providing the largest -share of the capital? favour of private enterprise why not allow the Amalgamated Wireless Company a free field? And what about' the oil? Why not leave the discovery and development of our oil. resources to private enterprise. At present we are spending thousands of pounds in the search for oil.

Mr Deputy Speaker, I should like to inform the honourable member that I . have not been connected, directly or indirectly, with the industry he mentions for many years. the honourable member' is engaged in the business now, but, at all events, he was connected with the jam industry at one time. Coming back to the amendment submitted by the honourable member for the matter Yarra, I should like to remind honourable members that on 12th May, 1920, the honourable member for Corio asked the following questions of the Minister representing the Minister for Defence:1. In order to cope with the ever-increasing demand of the publio for Australian-manufactured cloth, whether the Government has made any move in the direction of duplicating the existing plant at the Commonwealth Woollen Mills at North Geelong? 2. If so, when is the work to be commenced, and, when completed, what is estimated will be the increased capacity? The Minister( Sir Granville Ryrie) replied as follows:1. The Government has approved of additions to existing plant and machinery, which will enable the present output to be doubled, to be placed on next Estimates for Parliamentary approval. 2. Det ail a of the additional plant required are incourse of preparation with a view to orders being placed as soon as possible. When the additional plant is installed, it is expected that the capacity of the mill will be an output of about 1,200,000 yards per annum.

As members of the Labour party, we stand for the developmjent of all industries designed for the benefit of the people, and it is to our credit that these woollen mills, established by a Labour Government, have proved entirely satisfactory. We want to see similar establishments all over the Commonwealth in order that we may utilize our own. raw materials and insure remunerative employment and good working conditions for our people. All this has been done by the Geelong Mills, so why make a change now? The Government did not go to the country at -the last election on this issue. They did not say that if they were returned to power they would destroy any of the planks of the Labour party that had been put into operation. They did not say that they would sell the woollen mills at Geelong. The Government have no mandate from the people to sell these mills, though they may have received a mandate from certain people interested in a scheme to make money, out of the people. Therefore the amendment is one which we are prepared to place before the country as a vital issue. We stand for purity of government, and the continuation of a policy that has proved to be in the best , interests of the people. To be logical, the Government should also sell the Post Office, telegraph and telephone systems, get rid of our ships, o.ur banking institutions, and every other Government activity. private enterprise, let them, go to China, India, or Japan, or any of those countries where cheap and sweated labour is available. has directed my attention to himself, let me remind him of the pledges he gave when he went out of the ranks of Labour with Mr Hughes, declaring that "" not one stone in the temple of Labour would be displaced.""

447,Be Added Be So Added ( Mr Scullin's,"MT. BRENNAN (Batman) [10.28] Will the Leader of the House consent to the adjournment of the debate ? Minister could not consent to an adjournment. We have laboured hard', and so far the Government have garnered nothing, although the Opposition can safely lay claim to having, during the course of this debate, done something in the interests of the country we are trying to serve. I do not propose to traverse the Ministerial manifesto, known as the Governor General's Speech. It is more fitting that we should wait to see whether the generalities contained in that address will later on he crystallized into some serious shape in the form of Bills or other propositions. We have taken occasion during this debate to pillory the Government for various serious omissions and proposals. It is hard to tell which have been the more' significantly badtheir positive proposals or their omissions. As other honourable members have devoted themselves to particular subjects, I ask leave to direct attention to a matter about which I have acquired recently some little purely non-technical knowledge, namely, the question of wireless telegraphy and an agreement which the Commonwealth Government, so we are told, have entered into with the company known as "" Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited."" If we turn to the gospel of the Governor General's Speech, at page 2, clause 12, we find it stated thatTlie agreement will provide adequate and satisfactory means of communication invaluable to the commerce of Australia. I venture to say there is not a tittle of evidence before this House, and there was not a vestige of evidence before the Goment was put before the House and agreed to. vernment, to justify them in making that These are the Prime Minister's words, and statement, or in putting it into the GoI am quoting the motion he quoted. He' vernor-General's . Speech. On the conwent on to saytrary, the only evidence before the Government was that it was a matter of the very gravest and most serious doubt whether a scheme of the kind to which they would lend themselves is in any circumstances practicable or possible. Therefore, to say, as they have said, that this scheme provides an adequate and satisfactory means of communication, is to say something which they know is misleading. It is a very good illustration of the light-hearted and careless manner in which the Government pledge the country to the expenditure of large sums of money. In loose and inaccurate generalities the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) introduced this proposal to the House in December of last year. The matter has been investigated, and in the very teeth of the facts before him, as the result of that investigation, he repeats in the Governor General's Speech the same class of misleading generality which characterized the speech in which he introduced the matter to this Parliament. There is no evidence in the agreement itself that it will provide an adequate and satisfactory means of communication. There has been no evidence of that kind adduced since, and there was no evidence of it adduced before the Committee that sat to consider the merits. When the matter was discussed in the latter part of last year it was upon a motion then moved by the Prime Minister for the adoption of a specific agreement, the terms of which were before the House. My honourable leader then claimed that this was a subject-matter that called for very close investigation and consideration. When he spoke on the Address-in-Reply he claimed that the members of this party were to be congratulated in so far as they had been instrumental in making the agreement a better agreement, and in having an investigation made into the matter at all. The Prime Minister disposed of my leader's claim in these terms: He is reported, at page 185 of Hansard for 6th July, 1922, to have saidA niotion covering the draft wireless agreeThe motion readThat the House approves of the execution by the Prime Minister of the agreement -proposed to be made between the Commonwealth and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, a draft of which has been laid upon the table of the House; subject to investigation and approval, with such alteration as they may deem necessary, by a Committee, to consist of six members of the House of Representatives;",65,Paibs
448,Mr Gkeene,Not at this stage.,66,Paibs
449,Mr Brennan,"I am sorry that thetwo nominated by tbe Prime Minister, two by the Leader of the: Opposition, two by the Leader of the Country party, and tfiree members of the Senate^ such senators to be Senators Drake-Brobkman, J. D. Millen, and Wilson. The Prime Minister added-When this motion wa-s submitted, debate ensued, the honourable memberreferring to my honourable leaderand his party opposed the motion, a division was taken and the Leader of the Opposition and his party voted against it. Then the honourable gentleman went on to say that the motion was carried, and that whatever was done was done, not because of the Opposition, but in spite of us; that is to say, that this agreement was perfected and the investigation made, not because of my leader and his party, but in spite of us. Belying on the short memory of the average citizen, and possibly upon the fact that not everybody is a constant reader of the columns of Hansard, the right honourable gentleman has made that audacious misstatement. Now the facts are something entirely different. The facts are that the motion submitted by the Prime Minister was that submitted by him on 7th December, 1921, in these terms:That this House approves of the execution by the Prime Minister of the agreement proposed to be made between the Commonwealth and Amalgamated Wireless! (Australasia) Limited, a draft of which has been laid upon the table of the House. When that motion was mover}, the Leader of the Opposition said, in the course of his speech upon itI say that the strictest inquiry is needed. We axe not justified in voting for its acceptance until the House has been able to investigate it. . There was no suggestion in the proposal of the Prime Minister in the first place for an investigation by a committee or anybody else. It was a bald proposition that we should affirm a draft agreement which was there and then laid upon the table of the House. There was no suggestion that anybody should investigate it ; but, on the contrary, by special pleading, by all the arts and devices of the company promoter, by judicious concealment, and by an unscrupulous misstatement of the facts, the right honourable gentleman tried to induce us to accept the agreement as it stood. There was no pro[19] posal for any inquiry until and after my . honourable leader had addressed himself to the question. bers of other parties objected to the agreement. members who thought it should be investigated; there was a sufficient number of members, including ourselves, to put a very different face on the matter before it had gone far. A Committee was appointed, consisting of two Nationalists, two members of the Country party, and two members of the Labour party, one of whom has since ceased to be a member of that party, and who, I may say, took very little part in the consideration of this question. Leaving out the honourable member for Cook( Mr J. H . Gatts), who found himself otherwise engaged and unable to take a prominent part in the deliberations, the Oommittee unanimously condemned the agreement which the Prime Minister had"" asked us to accept. Still, he says confidently that we deserve no credit; and that he deserves all the credit, for he tells us Jhat what he, as head of the Government, said went, and we were mere obstructionists. That is the historical record of the proposal up to that point. The Committee condemned the agreement as improper, and one that could not be recommended, and found it vitally defective in many particulars. So much for the original proposal of the Government, for the Government must take responsibility in this matter. The Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) was a member of the Committee, and invaluable as his services were, I think it would have been more fitting if he, being Treasurer, had not sat with the Committee. when he was appointed to the Committee. that, no doubt, was the reason why he sat as a member of the Committee, flowever, I raised no objection to his presence during the sittings of the Committee, and I do not stress the point now beyond saying that it would have been preferable if he, as a member of the Government, had not sat with the Committee. I need not state in detail the grounds upon which we condemned the agreement proposed by the Government. One of them was well",66,Paibs

453,Mr Beennan,"He was not; andcanvassed in this House, namely, that there was no provision for giving the Oommonwealth equal power with the company on the directorate. That, in itself, was a fatal objection. There was the further objection which still remains, that the proposal was not proved to be practicable or feasible in any circumstances, and there was no provision in the agree 1 ment for taking over the Commonwealth's existing wireless plant at a valuation or on any terms which recognised the' Commonwealth's claim to consideration in that regard. The truth is, then, that when the Prime Minister says, as he does without qualification, that we were opposed to his proposal, he is saying half the truth, which, as honourable members know, is worse than a whole statement of another kind. Why were we opposed to the agreement, and why did we condemn the proposal brought down by the Government in regard to an agreement under which the Committee was pledged to expend £500,000? The papers, the agreement signed by the representative of the Commonwealth, the Committee's report, my own humble report upon the subject, and the notes of evidence taken by the Committee are before the House. And, in regard to my own report, let me be permitted to say this: A statement was published in the press that I had recommended the acceptance of this agreemeut by the Government, and the Prime Minister, following up that unauthorized publication of something which was quite wide of the mark, has referred to my position as being somewhat mysterious. Later he said, by inference, that my submission of a report at all was a mere act of party propaganda. that Committee, if they have a fair recollection of what took place, will be aware that at a very early stage I intimated to them that in no circumstances would I favour the handing over of the rights of the Commonwealth in wireless telegraphy, either in whole or in part, to any corporation. We rejected the Government's very rightly and naturally, because the majority was evidently me on the question wealth control of wireless, proceeded to make that agreement as good as it could be made, or, at all events, much better than we found it. Mr Brennan. admit that I took my little part in so improving the terms of the proposed agreement after having made the declaration that I personally did not propose to recommend its acceptance. There is nothing mysterious at all about my position; but it is mysterious how my name became attached to the report, and I think it would have been graceful and proper for the Chairman of the Committee to have told the country, and to now tell the Honse, that he had no authority to attach my name'to the report. against it in the first place? absolutely opposed to the original agreement as placed upon the table of the House. They condemned it unanimously. But they proceeded to amend it in many vital particulars, and eventually by a majority decided in favour of it as it now appears before us. I took some part in amending it , but before doing so, I told the Committee that I would not recommend the acceptance of any such agreement, because I was in favour of the Commonwealth controlling its own wireless scheme. The notes of evidence are before the House, for which we are indebted"" to Senator John D. Millen. The honourable senator is a Nationalist, and is, therefore, not associated with the party to which I belong, or with the Country' party. I must say 1 that he was of great assistance to the Committee, and brought a good deal of knowledge into ouri deliberations. He took careful notes of the evidence adduced, and prepared the summary which I have read, and which is available to honourable memThe members of bers. As far as it goes, I think it is accurate, and when my right honourable friend tells us that everything is well, and that we have secured an adequate and satisfactory form of commercial communication with the Old World by direct wireless, he seems to entirely overlook the fact that he is expressing an opinion in direct contradiction of the evidence recorded at the agreement, and afterwards inquiry by a member of bis own party. We had the advantage of having before against the Committee many eminent personsof Commonsome experts, some interested, and some disinterested; but interested and disinterested parties alike assured us that there was no just basis for concluding even with I candidly fair certainty that this proposal was",67,Paibs
