7,Our Security And Intelligence Arrangements. Mr Howard (Bennelong,"Prime MinThe following answers to questions were circulated: Taxation: Family Payments (Question No. 359) Ms Jackson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 15 May 2002: (1) How many families and individuals in the electoral division of Hasluck have received a (a) Family Tax Benefit debt notice and (b) Child Care Benefit debt notice. (2) How many child care centres in the electoral division of Hasluck have received a debt notice arising from the old Child Care Assistance Scheme. (3) What steps is the Government taking to guarantee that families will not be penalised by the current income self assessment regime where their incomes fluctuate through no fault of their own, because they carry out varying amounts of overtime in their employment, or their employment is commission based, or where one of the partners returns to the workforce after raising children. (4) Is the Minister aware that on pages 3 and 4 of the Estimating your Income booklet produced by the Family Assistance Office, the suggestions for estimating income for the year ahead include (a) knowing whether the recipient or his or her partner will receive termination or insurance payments or (b) predicting whether a partner will recommence work; if so, should individuals be expected to know whether they will lose their jobs, have to make an insurance claim or take up new employment in the forthcoming year. lowing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) (a) As at 24 May 2002, 4,688 customers in the electoral division of Hasluck have received notification that they incurred a Family Tax Benefit debt as a result of the income reconciliation process. (b) As at 24 May 2002, 931 customers in the electoral division of Hasluck have received notification that they incurred a Child Care Benefit debt as a result of the income reconciliation process. Note: only customers who incurred a debt over $1,000 would have a recoverable debt. (2) The number of child care centres in the electoral division of Hasluck that have received a debt notice arising from the old Child Care Assistance Scheme is 23. (3) The Family Assistance Office actively helps families to avoid or minimise family assistance overpayments resulting from underestimates of income through a range of communications with customers explaining the income estimation process and encouraging customers to keep their estimates up-to-date. Families are encouraged to estimate at the top of the range of their possible income for the year and can change their estimate as often as they wish during the year. The reconciliation process ensures that families receive their correct entitlement based on their actual taxable income. Families also have the option of claiming their family assistance as a lump sum after the end of the financial year when their taxable income has been assessed and thereby avoid any chance of overpayment. (4) The Estimating your Income booklet is provided to assist customers in providing an accurate estimate of their income for the coming financial year. This minimises the possibility of families incurring an FTB debt. Pages 3-4 of the booklet list “some questions you might have to think about when working out your estimated family income”. This list includes: commencing work, termination payments, child support and compensation or insurance payments. Customers can use this checklist when providing their initial income estimate and/or when updating their estimate. The provision of the checklist does not imply that families must be able to anticipate all changes to their income in advance. On the contrary, the booklet emphasises (on page 8) that if customers think the estimate they gave is wrong or might have changed, they should tell the Family Assistance Office as soon as possible, and that they can change their estimate as often as they need to.",14,Indonesia Terrorist Attacks Millions Of Australians Are With Those Of

(2) How many phone calls are received by the Family Assistance Office each week. (3) How many phone operators are available to answer calls to the Family Assistance Office on 13 6150. (4) What is the longest period callers to the Family Assistance Office on the 13 61 50 number will have to wait to have their calls answered. (5) In introducing a system where families and individuals receiving Family Tax Benefit or Child Care Benefit have to report any changes in their family income to the Family Assistance Office, was it envisaged that these people would have their calls answered promptly. (6) Is the Minister aware (a) that many Australians work in several part time or casual jobs without set hours or incomes each fortnight and must report changed circumstances regularly to the Family Assistance Office and (b) of the frustration many Australians experience in trying to call the 13 61 50 phone number to report their changed circumstances. (7) Is the Minister also aware that it was not possible to get through to the 13 61 50 phone number on 10 and 11 June 2002, and that on phoning the number, there was an engaged signal only. lowing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) (a) Centrelink records show that 1,940,000 customers successfully claimed Family Tax Benefit PartA and 1,360,000 customers successfully claimed Family Tax Benefit PartB as fortnightly payments in 2000-2001. (b) There were 592,000 families and individuals who received Child Care Benefit as a fee reduction during the 2000-2001 financial year. (2) During a three week period in June 2002, the Family Assistance Office averaged 144,106 successful calls per week. (3) For the month of June there were 1353 operators available in the FAO. (4) Centrelink Call aims to minimise the average wait time. For the month of June the Average Speed of Answer (ASA) was 297 seconds. The longest delay experienced by a customer in the three week period ending 21 June 2002 was 1700 seconds. (5) The Family Assistance Office was designed to give customers a choice in both delivery method and contact points. Customers can contact over the phone, via the Internet or in person at any Centrelink Office, Medicare Office or ATOaccess sites. Centrelink anticipates workload demand and allocates staff to meet expected demand, however, on occasions demand exceeds expectation. (6) (a) Customers who choose to receive their Family Tax Benefit by fortnightly instalments through Centrelink need to advise an estimate of income for the whole financial year. Families can earn up to $30,806 before it will affect Family Tax Benefit part A. PartB is affected by the income of the secondary income earner. It is not a requirement to advise the Family Assistance Office of fortnightly earnings. (b) In the twelve months to 30 August 2002 there were 8,145,908 successful calls to the FAO with an average speed of answer (ASA) of 115 seconds. (7) The 10th of June was a Public Holiday, in all States and Territories except for Western Australia, therefore Centrelink was closed in all sites except for Western Australia. On 10 June 2002, 3652 calls were answered in the FAO, with an Average Speed of Answer of 265 seconds. On 11 June 2002, 31,864 calls were answered in the FAO with an Average Speed of Answer of 328 seconds.",18,Questions On Notice
14,Mr Anthony,"The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the folEmployment: Mature Age Workers (Question No. 627) Ms Plibersek asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 26 June 2002: (1) What substantive measures is the Minister taking to facilitate the re-entry into the workforce of those mature age workers who have had career breaks or who find themselves between jobs and unable to regain a foothold in the employment market. (2) How many older Australian workers have re-entered the workforce as a result of the measures. lowing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Several new measures were announced under the “Australians Working Together” package. The Government will spend $146 million over four years to help working-age people from 50 years to Age Pension age who receive income support payments to improve their job prospects this includes extra Centrelink services and more places in services such as rehabilitation and disability employment services, English as a second language courses, literacy and numeracy training and other education and training opportunities. From September 2002, people on Mature Age Allowance, Widow Allowance and Partner Allowance – who, because they are not activity tested, currently receive little employment assistance will be invited to attend voluntary interviews with a Centrelink Personal Adviser. Centrelink Personal Advisers will help identify people’s needs and the obstacles they may face and refer them to appropriate services. From July 2003, a simpler income support structure will be introduced for older working-age people, with no new entrants to the non-activity tested Mature Age Allowance and Partner Allowance. People over 50 will claim Newstart Allowance instead, but with much more flexible requirements than currently apply to Newstart Allowance, together with individually focussed support. All new Widow Allowees will have an annual interview with a Centrelink Personal Adviser to help them plan for the future. They will also be able to access Personal Advisers on a more regular basis if they wish. In addition, mature age people will be able to access: Job Search Training places without having to wait until they have been unemployed for three months (commenced 1 July 2002); Training Credits of up to $800 and personal training that covers resumé development, written references and updating job seekers’ skills, for people participating in Work for the Dole or community work monitored by Community Work Coordinators (commenced 1 July 2002); Training Accounts of up to $800 for people participating in Job Search Training and Intensive Assistance (commenced 1 July 2002); the new Transition to Work Programme, which helps people return to paid work after long absences (commenced 1 July 2002); specialist information for people who are facing retrenchment or who have been retrenched; information on how best to establish a small business; Intensive Assistance assessments resulting in referrals to complementary programmes; a Working Credit under which people of working age on income support may be able to keep some or all of their payment when they first start work or have intermittent work; and the new Personal Support Programme, which assists people with severe or multiple obstacles to getting a job (commenced 1 July 2002). (2) The majority of these measures have yet to commence, or have only recently commenced, and so I am unable to answer this question.",38,Questions On Notice

This function forms part of the overall protective security measures as performed by the APS for the Parliament of Australia. A select committee, made up the Board of Management Security Parliament House, chaired by Joint House, is in the process of reviewing the security measures at Parliament House. The review action will determine the appropriate level of security required within the parliamentary precincts and will also take into account services as provided by the APS. Accordingly, no decision has been taken at this time to change this arrangement.

Mrs Vale-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: Australian national airports are strategic assets as they are available for use to support Australian Defence Force activities. This will only occur when a suitable Defence or a designated joint military/civilian airport is not available. Designated joint military/civilian airports are located at Darwin, Townsville, Newcastle, Katherine, Exmouth, Nowra and Oakey. All other national airports are used by Defence under standard commercial arrangements. Immigration: Migrant Resource Centres (Question No. 697) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 117 (Hansard, 14 May 2002, page 2040) concerning Migrant Resource Centres, what client statistics exist to show how many clients of each service have been assisted by each Migrant Resource Centre (MRC) and what funding did each centre receive during the period for which the statistics are available. (2) When was the Department Statistical Clients Information system for recording clients established. (3) When were MRCs and Migrant Service Agencies (MSAs) expected to use such facilities. (4) Which MRCs and MSAs failed to meet the commencement date for recording client statistics and what was the reason for the failure. (1) I am unable to provide all the information requested. There have been ongoing problems with the client statistical reporting system in terms of the reliability and completeness of the data. In view of this, the provision of the limited information that is available could be misleading. The statistical reporting system is one element of the MRC/MSA accountability and performance framework that is being reviewed in the context of the broader Review of Settlement Services currently being conducted by the Department.

(3) The MRCs and MSAs were expected to begin using the Settlement Client Information System from 1 July 1999. (4) The MRCs and MSAs that did not meet the commencement date for recording client statistics, and the reasons given by the organisations for not meeting the commencement date were: Baulkham Hills/ Holroyd/Parramatta (Parramatta) Technical problems with installation Blacktown Technical problems with installation Canterbury Computer network upgrade delayed installation Fairfield (Cabramatta) Lack of IT proficiency within MRC Macarthur (Campbelltown) Ongoing database corruptions Newcastle and Hunter Region (Hamilton) Technical problems with installation Migrant Network Services (Northern Sydney) Concerns about transferring information over the internet North West (St Albans) Incompatibility with Office 2000 software already installed South Eastern (Dandenong) Delay in getting technical assistance to help with installation Logan& Beenleigh (Woodridge) Technical problems with installation Townsville MRC Technical problems with installation South Metro (Fremantle) Technical problems with installation Northern Suburbs (Mirrabooka) Technical problems with installation Northern Tasmania (Launceston) Computer network installation delayed SCIS implementation Transport: Shipping (Question No. 699) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: Why did the Government take over 10 months to respond to the report into the safety of shipping on the Great Barrier Reef. The Steering Committee’s report into the Review of Great Barrier Reef Ship Safety and Pollution Prevention Measures was released in September 2001. When the Federal election was called in October 2001, the Government went into Caretaker mode. This delayed consideration of the Review. The Commonwealth’s response was made on 25 July 2002 after appropriate consultations. Bureau of Meteorology (Question No. 703) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) Does the Bureau of Meteorology keep records that compare its forecast temperatures and conditions with the actual temperatures and conditions; if so, on a yearly basis, what is its accuracy in each State capital. (2) Has the accuracy improved; if so, why. (3) Are there parts of Australia where that accuracy is worse than others. (4) What has been the budget allocation for the Bureau of Meteorology in each year since 1995. (1) The Bureau of Meteorology has been keeping records on its forecasting performance for over 30 years. The two major weather elements that have been verified are temperature and rainfall. The verification statistics are summarised in the tables below. The comparisons shown are of the number of significant forecast temperature errors (greater than 3o Celsius), the mean magnitude of the forecast temperature errors, the accuracy of rainfall forecasts, and the skill in predicting mean sealevel pressure which strongly influences the forecasts of many weather elements. These temperature and rainfall verification results are listed for each State and Territory capital city. The forecasts being evaluated are those that are issued in the afternoon for the following day i.e. what is seen on the news at 6pm or 7pm. The skill in predicting mean sea-level pressure is evaluated over the whole Australian region.

Australian region. The values shown are 12-month running means. (2) The long-term trends show an improvement in both temperature and rainfall forecasting. The percentage of accurate rainfall forecasts has increased from about 70% to 75%. The temperature statistics are presented in terms of significant errors and mean absolute errors. There is a long-term improvement in both the maximum and minimum temperature forecast performance as well as a substantial reduction in the number of large errors in temperature forecasts, particularly for maximum temperature. The downward trend over time in the S1 skill scores suggests that the operational predictions from the Australian region analysis and prediction system have contributed to the general improvement in forecasting of weather elements. Improvements in forecast performance can be explained by a number of factors including: (a) Improved skill of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models (cf. The S1 skill scores); (b) Introduction and updating of automated guidance to forecasters based on algorithms and NWP output; (c) Introduction of strategically-located automatic weather stations to provide an improved observations network; (d) Improved observing systems (particularly weather watch radar and radiosondes); (e) Improved satellite data; (f) Continuing research leading to improved understanding of the science of meteorology and the development of automated guidance tools, along with more detailed case studies allowing better understanding of specific events; (g) Computerised systems allowing for more effective and timely presentation of data to forecasters; and (h) Improvements in training, particularly in ongoing training for operational forecasters. (3) While it is reasonable to look at trends in accuracy at a particular location, care must be exercised in comparing accuracy between locations. This is because there are significant differences in the variability in weather elements from one part of Australia to the next. In cities where the weather is naturally more variable, the forecasting of temperatures and rainfall will be more difficult. For example, it is easier to forecast the maximum temperature at, say, Darwin where the maximum temperature might be consistently around 31 to 33 degrees for most of the year, than in Canberra where there is a significant variation in maximum temperature from day to day. Establishing measures of forecasting skill that are independent of location is a problem that has yet to be effectively solved. It is probably true to say that every location has its own forecasting challenges and while temperature forecasts are problematic at one location, forecasting rainfall or wind or thunderstorms might be a particular problem at another. (4) The following table lists the Budget appropriations in all financial years since 1995 to enable the Bureau of Meteorology to carry out its full range of functions, including observations and data collection; research and development; the provision of weather, climate, hydrological and oceanographic data, information, forecast, warning, investigation and advisory services; and international coordination. These figures do not include annotated appropriations nor variations through Additional Estimates. Because of changes in accounting with the introduction of Accrual Budgeting, the figures are not completely comparable from year to year.

The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has prepared two impact assessment reports, one in respect of the physical damage to the reef and one relating to the pollutant damage to the reef. Both reports form part of the evidentiary material for the prosecutions under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975. The reports would be expected to be publicly available following the completion of the prosecution proceedings.

(2) Are these flats currently managed for his Department by a contractor or contractors under the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy (IHSS); if so, which contractors manage the flats and what is the duration of the relevant funding contracts under which they do so. (3) Is the Government considering changes to the provision of accommodation support under the IHSS; if so, what problems with the existing arrangements have prompted it to do so. (1) Yes, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs holds leases for flats in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane for use by eligible humanitarian entrants for their first 4 weeks upon arrival. The distribution of the flats based on local government areas is shown in the table below. Maribyrnong Auburn Brisbane 24 flats in Maribyrnong 16 flats in Auburn6 flats in Hawthorne 6 flats in Greenslopes Darebin Blacktown 6 flats in Moorooka 14 flats in Reservoir 18 flats in Blacktown Moreland Liverpool 6 flats in Coburg 13 flats in Liverpool 2 flats in Glenroy Parramatta Greater Dandenong City6 flats in Harris Park 19 flats in Springvale 9 flats in Dandenong (2) Under the IHSS Accommodation Support arrangements, these flats are currently managed by Resolve FM Pty Ltd, formerly known as Haden FM Pty Ltd. The contract is due to expire in September 2002 but will be extended to allow consideration of the preliminary results of the IHSS evaluation which will be made available in December 2002. (3) The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs is currently evaluating all aspects of IHSS to assess the extent to which the current model is meeting the clients needs. The results of the IHSS evaluation will determine whether the Government will consider changes to the provision of accommodation support. Employment: Job Network (Question No. 868) Ms Vamvakinou asked the Minister for Employment Services, upon notice on, 27 August 2002: What were the (a) names, (b) addresses and (c) hours of operations of organisations that are part of the Job Network in the postcode areas of (i) 3036, (ii) 3037, (iii) 3038, (iv) 3043, (v) 3046, (vi) 3047, (vii) 3048, (viii) 3049, (ix) 3059, (x) 3060, (xi) 3061, (xii) 3064, (xiii) 3427 and (xiv) 3428. My department advises that in the postcode areas of 3036 through to 3428 in Victoria, there are currently 11 Job Network sites operating across the localities of Glenroy, Broadmeadows and Craigieburn. In terms of demand for job seeker services, Broadmeadows, in the Electorate of Calwell, has over 60% of Job Network sites.

(2) How many meetings did each committee hold in the latest year for which data is available. (3) Are the committees expected to consult formally with the community and interested stakeholders; If so, what mechanisms exist for them to actually do so. (4) What specific roles, if any, do the committees have in (a) planning and (b) funding processes under (i) the Community Settlement Services Scheme, (ii) the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy and (iii) the Migrant Resource Centre program. (5) Is each committee required to produce an annual report on its activities; If so, to whom are these reports provided; If not, why not. (1) The settlement planning committees comprise representatives of government agencies at the Commonwealth, State/Territory and local government levels, and representatives of nongovernment agencies that provide settlement services such as health, housing, education, training, employment and other social services to migrants and refugees. There are 10 settlement planning committees, one in each State and Territory, and two regional committees. (2) In the calendar year, January 2001 to December 2001, the following settlement planning committee meetings were held in each State/Territory: Victoria 4; NSW 4; Queensland 4; Western Australia 4; South Australia – 4; Northern Territory – 4; Tasmania– 6; and, ACT – 3. (In addition, 3 meetings were held in each of the two rural settlement planning committees: Riverina Region and Albury-Wodonga). (3) All settlement planning committees use community and stakeholder input to help identify and prioritise the needs of migrants and refugees, particularly in designing their State/Territory settlement plans. The form of consultation is a matter for each individual committee. However, the methods adopted by committees include: community representation on the settlement planning committee itself; community consultation workshops to identify annual planning priorities; community participation through established working parties that feed into the work of the larger settlement planning committee; and/or the use of proformas to gather information from community representatives (eg. via Community Project officers in the local Migrant Resource Centre or Migrant Service Agency). (4) (a) Settlement planning committees have a broad planning function which involves ascertaining the priority settlement needs of migrants and refugees, who is responsible for meeting those needs, developing strategies accordingly and monitoring outcomes of the strategies put in place. Settlement planning committees identify gaps and needs in service delivery. Those areas of need are taken into consideration by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) in assessing applications for DIMIA funding, and in the general planning on which services are required. (b) In addition, each State/Territory has specifically convened Funding Advisory Committees, comprising Commonwealth and State/Territory representatives (of which some are also members of settlement planning committees). Funding Advisory Committees determine: whether an application for the Community Settlement Services Scheme would be more appropriately funded by an agency other than DIMIA; and whether an application for the Community Settlement Services Scheme duplicates existing services. Funding Advisory Committees have no role in the assessment of tenders for contracts under the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy or the provision of core funding to Migrant Resource Centres/Migrant Service Agencies. (5) Each settlement planning committee is required to report to the Ministerial Council on Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (McIMA) on achievements against settlement plans and in particular against the National Settlement Priorities, local priorities and the annual National Settlement Project. Each settlement planning committee also reports biannually to the Standing Committee on Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (SCIMA) on the development of, and outcomes from, the",75,Melbourne Sydney Brisbane
37,Mr Hardgrave,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:National Settlement Project. The National Settlement Project for 2002 is, ‘Promoting awareness of the needs of newly arrived young people, particularly refugees’. Trade: Chrysotile Asbestos (Question No. 885) Ms George asked the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, upon notice on, 29 August 2002: What steps are being undertaken by the Government to implement the proposed ban on the use and importation of chrysotile asbestos? The May 2001 meeting of the Workplace Relations Ministers’ Council (WRMC) agreed to the imposition of a ban on the import and use of chrysotile asbestos no later than 31 December 2003. WRMC also asked the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (NOHSC) to undertake essential consultation to facilitate imposing bans on all other forms of asbestos. Since that time the following steps have been taken on a national basis to prohibit the use and importation of chrysotile asbestos: At the WRMC meeting in September 2001, Ministers endorsed proposed amendments to Schedule2 (Substances prohibited for specific uses) of the NOHSC National Model Regulations for the Control of Workplace Hazardous Substances (Model Regulations), to prohibit the use of chrysotile, crocidolite and amosite asbestos. This meeting also endorsed implementation arrangements to effect the ban on chrysotile asbestos, including developing a nationally consistent approach to exemptions and a proposal to develop recommendations for prohibiting all other forms of asbestos. Prohibition on the import of asbestos and any exemptions is to be effected through regulations to be made under the Customs Act 1901 following completion of public consultation by NOHSC. The World Trade Organisation was duly notified in September 2001 of Australia’s intention to prohibit chrysotile asbestos. Consistent with WRMC’s approval NOHSC declared the amendments to the Model Regulations on 17 October 2001 listing the uses prohibited. The States and Territories will make appropriate regulations or legislate to bring the prohibition on the use of chrysotile and other forms of asbestos into effect. Following the implementation of the prohibition, Australian Design Rules are to be revised in 2004 prohibiting the use of asbestos in brake linings in motor vehicles. In May 2002 NOHSC reported to WRMC that all jurisdictions were on track to implement the prohibition from 31 December 2003. WRMC also agreed to nationally consistent arrangements for exemptions to the prohibition through the development of a National List of Exemptions. In June 2002, NOHSC released a public consultation discussion paper on the proposed National List of Exemptions. Comments on the discussion paper closed on 13 September 2002. In the same month NOHSC also initiated a review of the exposure standard for chrysotile asbestos. NOHSC is to report to WRMC in November 2002 on further progress towards implementation of the prohibition, including all forms of asbestos, arising from its public consultations and consideration of proposed exemption arrangements. The Government’s responsibilities in relation to the prohibition of the use of chrysotile include Commonwealth employment and the shipping industry. In relation to Commonwealth employment: On 26 September 2001, the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission (the Commission) endorsed that the prohibition of use of chrysotile and other forms of asbestos is to be as consistent as possible with the NOHSC model regulations which prohibit the use of chrysotile and other forms of asbestos. Changes to Schedule 1A (Scheduled carcinogenic substances) and the listing of chrysotile in Part2 (Permitted circumstances for handling of certain hazardous substances with carcinogenic properties) Schedule1 (Hazardous substances) of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) (National Standards) Regulations 1994 are currently being developed to enable the prohibition to be in place in Commonwealth employment by 31 December 2003.",77,Gramets Emp Tng Services Calwell Broadmeadows Vic 3047 F T
38,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Comcare has undertaken consultation with Commonwealth employers about the phase out of asbestos to ensure all can comply with the prohibition from 31 December 2003. All Commonwealth employers have received information from Comcare alerting them to the health effects of exposure to asbestos and informing them of the impending prohibition. Comcare is working closely with various Commonwealth employers to assist compliance with the prohibition. This consultation and general discussion has increased awareness of the pending prohibitions. Comcare will develop explanatory material for approval and release by the Commission to accompany the implementation of the ban. The information will be distributed to all employers in the jurisdiction and is accessible from the Comcare website. In relation to the shipping industry, the Seacare Authority is to consider in November 2002 proposals for a regulation under the Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) 1993 Act to prohibit the use of chrysotile and other forms of asbestos with effect from 31 December 2003. The Authority’s considerations will be informed by the work which has been undertaken for the prohibition in Commonwealth employment. Defence: National Service Medal (Question No. 898) Ms Jann McFarlane asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 29 August 2002: (1) How many National Service Medal applications have been received by the Medals Directorate of the Minister’s Department. (2) How many National Service Medals have been awarded to applicants in (a) January, (b) February, (c) March, (d) April, (e) May, (f) June and (g) July 2002. (3) What is the average time taken to process applications for the National Service Medal. (4) How large is the backlog of National Service Medal applications. (5) Did the Minister’s Department employ any extra staff to cope with the workload caused by the National Service Medal; if so, how many extra full time equivalent positions were created; if not, why not. (6) Does the Minister have any plans in the short term to increase resources to the Medals Directorate to reduce the backlog of National Service Medal applications and to reduce stress on the existing staff. Mrs Vale-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) As of 3 September 2002, approximately 100,000 applications for the Anniversary of National Service 1951-1972 Medal (ANSM) have been received. (2) (a) As the initial presentation of medals took place on 10 February 2002 to the next of kin of those that were killed in action in Vietnam, no medals were issued in January. (b) February 3,557 (c) March 10,043 (d) April 5,868 (e) May 7,717 (f) June 3,707 (g) July 5,030 (3) On average, it takes 6 months to process applications for the ANSM from the time they are received to the time they are dispatched. (4) 50,000. (5) Yes, four. (6) Yes, two. China: Blood Collection Agencies (Question No. 913) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 16 May 2002: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the practice of government affiliated blood collection agencies in China pooling blood to extract plasma and then returning the pooled blood to donors to prevent anaemia. (2) Is he able to say whether this practice has led to infection of blood donor supplies by individuals with HIV and AIDS. (3) Is he able to say whether, despite a recent Chinese central government crackdown, local officials persist in selling tainted blood. (4) Are Australian authorities aware that Henan province was the epicentre of this blood selling business and in some villages over 60% of residents are now HIV positive; if so, is his Department able to confirm whether in that province, in a majority of families, a majority of adults have died and only youth or elderly remain. (5) Is it expected that at the forthcoming 16th Party Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), Li Chang Chun, the Henan CCP Chief and protégé of Premier Jiang Zemin, will be elevated as Vice Premier. (6) Has the Australian Government offered to provide Australian public education programs on the prevention of the spread of HIV and AIDS to national and regional governments in China. (7) What steps, if any, has the Australian Government taken to warn Australian tourists to China of the danger of accessing local blood supplies in the event of being involved in accidents. (1) and (2) The Government is aware of credible reports that in a number of Chinese provinces, predominantly in central China, there has been a practice of people selling their blood and plasma to commercial blood processing companies. The practice of pooling the blood, separating the plasma and then re-injecting red blood cells back into donors has led to the rapid spread of HIV in these areas. (3) In 1998 China passed a blood donation law prohibiting commercial blood donations and stipulating that all blood collected for medical transfusions should be from voluntary donations. The Government is aware of reports that some blood-collecting companies continue to operate illegally, particularly in remote, impoverished areas where authorities find it harder to prevent the practice. (4) The Government is aware that the practice of commercial blood collection existed in Henan Province, though the practice was prevalent in a number of central Chinese provinces in the 1990s. Figures vary on the current extent of HIV infection in Henan province; estimates range from the Chinese Ministry of Health’s figure of 150,000 to above 1 million HIV-infected people. The UN theme group on HIV/AIDS in China quotes reports from local residents that in some villages in the province more than 80% of adults are HIV positive. (5) The Government cannot speculate on this. (6) Australia is funding projects to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS in nine provinces in China. All projects include the provision of health education programs to improve knowledge of HIV/AIDS prevention and control among the general population and special programs for high-risk groups. Several of these projects also include components supporting the national government’s agenda for the implementation of safe blood supply and reducing risk of transfusing infected blood. (7) The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade reviewed the travel advice for China at the end of September 2002. It advises that the availability of reliable medical care in China is limited, particularly outside of major cities. Travellers are strongly advised to have the appropriate health insurance in the event they need to reach a reliable medical centre. Social Welfare: Age Pensions (Question No. 920) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 17 September 2002:",78,Gramets Emp Tng Services Calwell Broadmeadows Vic 3047 F T
39,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:In view of the very significant increases in property values in Australia since 1996, will the Howard Government undertake a review of the assets test with a view to increasing the threshold as it currently applies in the calculation of age pensions; if so, when; if not, why not. lowing answer to the honourable member’s question: The Honourable Member may not be aware, but the Hawke Labor Government introduced the assets means test on age pensions in 1985. The assets test threshold is adjusted in line with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and normally adjustments are made in July of each year. Also, the asset amount at which no pension is payable increases in line with pension increases. Further, the Honourable Member may not be aware that as the principal home is exempt from the assets test, pensioners are not affected by increases in the value of their home. Resources: Greater Sunrise Gas Project (Question No. 922) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, upon notice, on 17 September 2002: (1) Is he aware that the Shell Company is considering withdrawing from the Greater Sunrise Gas Project. (2) If Shell does withdraw, what are the implications for (a) the remaining venture partners and their capacity to exploit the resource, (b) the campaign to bring Sunrise gas on-shore for both industrial development in northern Australia and to provide a new source of gas for the south east market and (c) the retention lease of the venture partners. (3) Will the Government act to ensure “use it or lose it” principles are appropriately applied to the field. (4) Will the Government use the period in which ownership arrangements are being negotiated to aggressively pursue the on-shore option. Mr Ian Macfarlane-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) I am aware of newspaper articles that assert Shell is considering to quit the Sunrise gas project. Such assertions have been rejected by Shell.
