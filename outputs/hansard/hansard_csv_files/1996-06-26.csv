265,Is That Under The Former Alp Government Mr Mcmullan,"Apart from the fact thatsay, 'Why don't you all just wander out and as an opening for them to set regulations come to agreements. It'll be fine.' It is beconcerning what constitutes regular part-time cause we do not accept that view-and the employment. All that is quite fine. We do not government does not accept that view; it does think we should have this limitation on what not advocate that view-that we have this the Industrial Relations Commission can deal minimum standard, this array of minima. Our with, and we will come back to that in anconcern is: are they sufficient and are they other debate at another time. The problem is adequately spelt out? Our view is: no. that we have subsection (4), which aims to There seem to me to be some very strange constrain the commission's capacity. things in the way· this part-time employment Subsection (2) says the Industrial Relations issue is addressed in the workplace relations Commission should have the capacity to set bill. I want to ask a couple of questions about minimum standards about what constitutes it, although it may not be appropriate, given regular part-time employment, but subsection the time, for the Minister for Industrial Rela(4) says, 'We think they might come to some tions ( Mr Reith) to respond now. I am not conclusions we don't like, so the parliament going to be pursuing it in that way at this should give a direction to the Industrial moment-although if he wishes to I am happy Relations Commission to limit its capacity to to pursue it-as there will be plenty more deal with it.' If you listen to the argument not opportunities for it to be debated. from the minister but from those who purport We have suddenly had this enthusiasm that to support him-I think it is support he could we have had for many years in awards and do without on some occasions-you would industrial relations law for the concept of think that there is nothing in the bill that says part-time employment. We have suddenly put the Industrial Relations Commission can set the word 'regular' in front of the phrase 'partcriteria. It is stated quite explicitly here. The time employment'. And this is supposed to be problem is not that it is not here, which seems a breathtaking change. It is not 'part-time to be the import of your argument, but rather employment' anymore; it is 'regular part-time that subsection (4) limits it for reasons that employment'. I am assuming we now do not have not been effectively established. have three streams-regular part-time, other part-time and casual. I assume that what we I appreciate that sometimes that is what you have always called 'part-time employment' is would want to argue-and the conclusion the now, for the want of better presentation of the Industrial Relations Commission might come argument, called 'regular part-time employto-and the government might, on many ment'. Beyond that, the word 'regular' has occasions, when debating the question of absolutely no meaning in there. minimum standards, want to appear before the I want to refer to subsection (2) of 89A, commission and say, 'You should not deal which is not what we are dealing with but it with these matters.' But that is not the same is the only chance we are going to get to as this parliament saying, 'You can consider speak about it, and it is what we have been it on the merits but if you come to a conclutalking about so I am not straying any further sion about matters covered by 4(a) or 4(b), than anybody else-and I appreciate you, Mr you may not settle an industrial dispute, you Deputy Speaker, letting us all do it. may not come to a conclusion that this parliament, this government, doesn't agree with.' Subsection (2) of proposed new section 89A That is our concern-not the concern that has says that the Industrial Relations Commission been manufactured by the backbench of the can set minimum standards for regular partgovernment that in some way we are trying time employment. It is not absolutely clear to introduce the capacity of the Industrial how they will do that, but it is open to them, Relations Commission to regulate that. ThatI assume, to interpret that. And it is not is already there.

I ask you, Sir, speakers before and that, for that reason, they to give me the call as is the convention of the should now have two speakers. I have been House. here for the debate since 7 0' clock this evening. The reason why the government had listened to the honourable member's point of two consecutive speakers before on one of order. As I originally ruled, I had called the these amendments was that nobody from the member for Jagajaga. It is the convention that opposition was quick enough to jump to their members are allowed to speak more than once feet. That is why they missed out on getting in dealing with this particular debate. I call the call when it was their turn. the member for Jagajaga. As is well known, it is the convention that either side of the House.

I do not intend to vote against it; I just want to record my concerns. I congratulate the Attorney-General, Daryl Williams. I think that this bilI is an improvement on the one that was put forward by the Australian Labor Party. But it is simply naive if the Attorney-General believes that he has put in safeguards that are not going to see the Commonwealth police become very large-scale drug dealers in this country. The all-pervading power of drugs and the money that is involved have had a very corrosive effect on public confidence. I believe that it has to be tackled as a whole issue, not in this piecemeal way of giving the police ever-increasing powers. It is quite clear to me that the power the police will obtain will be abused. Why do I say that? Because the power of the police is always abused. All power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. The West Australian a few days ago had as a headline that Western Australian police are the most corrupt in Australia. I do not believe that. I do not think it is true at all. I think there are elements of corruption which pervade the whole police system and the whole judicial system in Australia. What we need in Australia is not a royal commission-I think the royal commissioners themselves are, sadly, tainted-but a public inquiry into all aspects of the administration of justice. When I look at the justice system in Western Australia, which I know weII, I find it is quite clear that there has been collusion between the prosecution and the police to hide evidence, to falsify evidence, to put forward stuff that they know to be untrue. That, of course, is in total breach of the duty of the prosecution, whose responsibility is to put forward all the evidence and only the evidence. As the High Court has observed, if a prosecutor deviates from this course, he becomes a very powerful unsworn witness for the prosecution. This has happened, sadly, all too often in Western Australia and, I suspect, throughout Australia. I have here a paper entitled, 'Peeling the onion of Long Bay', written by a friend of mine who was actually on remand in Long Bay at the time, under outrageous circumstances. I believe that half a million dollars-his dollars-later, he has been justified. But it is quite clear that there are people in Long Bay because they were set up by the police. The police have awesome powers to fabricate evidence; to set up people. The thing which is driving this, of course, is the corrupting money of drugs. If we are going to do something about this, we have to look at the thing as a whole. I believe that if we were serious about it-and I do not believe for one moment that we are-what we would be doing is legalising and controlling the distribution of these drugs to take the money out. The only way to deal with the big operators, at the big end of town-which this bilI is supposed to attack and simply will not-is to take away the profit margin. If you raise the risk, you raise the margins, and the big operators enhance their profits. I believe that it is",191,Pairs Expelled By The Turks In The 1970s When The

After all, most of these drugs are very cheap to produce. It would take away the profit motive. In my view, in that way that industry could be killed stone dead. If there are a few people whose addiction is enhanced by this greater availability, that is a price I would be very happy to pay to do away with the all-corroding effect of drugs on the legal system in Australia. I think it is something that is going to have to be faced up to. I do not see either the government or the opposition facing up to it. It does not just stop at drugs. It pervades the whole legal system. I believe there is evidence of this in the Family Court which, in my view, is an abomination that seeks to be legal. I have a case in Western Australia of a woman who is being unmercifully hounded and harassed by the Family Court. She has lost a fortune, which was a fortune that she brought to the marriage. There is also the matter of the behaviour of the judge in this case. I go through the transcripts, and I get briefings from the civil liberties people, and the behaviour of the judge is beyond belief. The woman has been bashed up in the car park on a couple of occasions, obviously by people who have a vested interest in making sure she does not succeed in her case. One wonders where these things are going to end. I will not be voting against this bill; my vote will be pointless. I want it on the record that I think this bill is dangerous and it sets a dangerous precedent. It will give powers to the Federal Police that will be abused. If anyone thinks that the Federal Police are any different from the state police, I think they are very sadly mistaken. I want it on the record that this bill will not achieve what it sets out to do. There is a possibility that it will in fact do very little, or nothing. There is a risk, in my view, that it will lead to even greater corruption of the police forces, and the judiciary, I might add, than already exists today. Campbell) commented on matters that all of us in this place need to take very seriously. WhilstI do not concur with the conclusions he reaches at this stage, nonetheless, the matters he raises are sufficiently serious, I think, for the parliament to continue to keep this particular item of legislation, and other similar items of legislation, under review to ensure that the abuses that he envisages arising from it are nipped in the bud at the earliest possible opportunity. Later, in what will be a fairly short speech on this matter, I will talk more about that. I think it might be useful to go back over some of the background to how this particular bill arises. It arises out of a case in the High Court known as the Ridgeway case. As I understand it, the circumstances of that particular case are that a man named Ridgeway formed an association in prison, in South Australia in the 1980s, with another prisoner called Lee. When Lee was released, he became an informer for the police in Malaysia. Subsequent to that, Ridgeway established contact with Lee, with the intention of importing heroin into Australia. In that context, with Lee as an informer for the Malaysian police, the Malaysian police and Australian Federal Police cooperated in what was called a controlled operation where the police were involved in the importation of heroin in order to obtain convictions, presumably not just of Ridgeway but further up the food chain in relation to drug distribution. Of course, the problem for the police was the relevant section of the Customs Act that provides that any person who imports or attempts to import into Australia any prohibited import to which the section applies shall be guilty of an offence. Ridgeway was convicted but the High Court, on appeal, ultimately upheld his appeal on the basis that evidence associated with the controlled operation should have been excluded under the discretion of the court to",193,Representatives Main Committee
295,Mr Sercombe (Maribyrnong) (10.07 A.m.),"The honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( MrWednesday, 26 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2915 exclude evidence on public policy grounds-that is, the court could exclude evidence obtained by unlawful means. The justices of the High Court stated that if law enforcement officials were to be exempted from the law that would be a matter for the parliament and not for the courts. The High Court also made the finding that police have no special immunity from the criminal law and that if criminal offences are committed during an investigation that could taint evidence to the extent that a judge could exclude that evidence. The bill arises from the quite reasonable desire of the former government and this current government to clarify the position and the protections available to law enforcement officers in the sorts of circumstances they found themselves in in the Ridgeway matter. The nature of drug offences and the corrosive influences of that particular sort of activity which the member for Kalgoorlie referred to are well known and the involvement of organised crime in those sorts of activities does require perhaps more novel, innovative ways, including controlled operations, of addressing that sort of crime. So the essential issue before the parliament, as the member for Kalgoorlie indicated, is the nature of the protections that are available if police are to be conferred with some sort of immunity from the criminal law in relation to what would perhaps be, in other circumstances, slightly unconventional actions they may take with respect to investigations in this area. There are three substantial protections in the legislation. One is a protection substantially from police entrapping individuals. Clause 151(2) of the bill, for example, provides that the exemption of law enforcement officers from certain offences does not apply if the conduct of the officer involves intentionally inducing the person targeted to commit an offence and the person would not otherwise have had the intent to commit the offence. Therefore, there is protection against the quite legitimate concern about entrapment that could arise. A further fundamental provision is that the bill makes it quite clear that the discretion of courts to exclude evidence in criminal proceedings or to stay criminal proceedings in the interests of justice is not limited by the operation of this bill. I suppose the other very significant protection that exists for civil liberties and for ensuring that there are some barriers to the sort of police conduct that the member for Kalgoorlie was concerned about is in section ISS of the bill, where the authorising officer, whether that be an AFP officer or a customs officer, needs to report to the minister in question about the action taken; that is, there is a provision that, within three months after a certificate authorising a controlled operation ceases to be in force, the officer must give to the minister a written report stating whether or not the controlled operation authorised by the certificate was carried out. If the operation was carried out, the report must provide considerable detail about the operation, which I do not propose, in the interests of brevity, to go into. Finally, there is a provision in the bill for the minister to table the report before parliament with respect to the controlled operations and some of the circumstances surrounding it. It seems to me on balance that those protections are not only desirable but, I hope, adequate. But they need, as I started off by saying, to be continually reviewed by this parliament to ensure that undesirable consequences do not arise in conferring these sorts of powers on police officers. One of the issues that did arise in debate last year was that the present Attorney-General( Mr Williams) argued, as I understand it, in the House of Representatives that there should be a judicial officer, a judge, involved in the issuing of a certificate to authorise police to carry out controlled operations with immunity from liability. It is interesting that last year the Attorney-General did argue for that particular additional protection. I notice that in the Senate MC 2916 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 26 June 1996 at the end of last month, when this bill was dealt with, Senator Vanstone, on behalf of the government, indicated her understanding that judges being involved in the criminal investigation process could well invalidate court proceedings at a later date in relation to the matters that the judges had been involved in. That is clearly a very serious matter that the parliament needs to ensure it does not transgress on. In relation to the question of judicial involvement in the issue of certificates, I notice also that Mr Rozenes, of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, in giving evidence to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on this matter last year, had the following things to say: There is no comparison, in my view, between the role that is required to be performed by the grantor of the certificate in this investigative exercise with that which is reposed in the federal court judge, or the magistrate, or whatever it is who gives a warrant for either listening devices, or search warrants, or anything else, where there is a clear requirement that there be balanced the interests of the citizen who is about to have his property turned upside down, his premises invaded, his body samples taken, or his voice listened to, monitored, reported and recorded, on the one hand, and law enforcement requirements on the other. There, there is genuine balancing of competing public interest which requires additional involvement. But even that is currently the subject matter of challenge in the High Court and may, or may not, survive that case. In these situations, there is no competing private right or interest that needs to be balanced against the law enforcement requirement. These are matters of very great constitutional substance which I do not propose to go into in this particular debate, except to say that, because they are of such substance and because the powers that are being conferred on law enforcement officers in these matters are so substantial, I believe there is an obligation on this parliament at some time-and I am not sure whether it is appropriate at this stage to specify the time, but at some reasonable time in the future-to have a look at the way in which these particular provisions have operated to ensure that they are operating satisfactorily, the appropriate balances are in place and there is not abuse by our law enforcement organisations of the trust that has been placed in them. In that context, the question of judicial review ought to be revisited, in my opinion, and that ought to form a basifor a further report to parliament. On balance, this is a bill that, for the reasons I mentioned before-the nature of drug offences, the nature of organised crime involvement in drug offences-does require measures that perhaps some of us would be uncomfortable with in other circumstances. However, it is not a matter that the parliament ought to confer and then forget about. These are powers that the parliament ought to review in the not too distant future to ensure that all the appropriate protections are in place. appearance before the Main Committee. I was chairing the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. One of the problems of the parliament at the moment is that one seems to be required to be in so many places at the same time. I thank the former minister opposite for his courtesy. It is always refreshing in the parliament when we find pieces of legislation which are supported by all parties. It is not widely recognised in the Australian community just how often the political parties and both sides of parliament agree when changes to the law are necessary. Quite often in the area of the attorney-general and justice portfolio this is the case. The honourable member for Denison( Mr Kerr) was the minister who was originally responsible for the legislative response to the Ridgeway case. The Ridgeway case was one",194,Representatives Main Committee
296,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (10.19 A.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I apologise for my delayedWednesday, 26 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2917 of those High Court decisions where the court threw back to the parliament a problem which had to be solved through legislative amendment. It ought to be recognised that this bill is a considered response, having been introduced by the previous government and referred to a Senate committee. Suggested amendments were made by that committee and accepted by the new government. We now find ourselves debating the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1996. The facts in Ridgeway are actually quite interesting. The case R. v. Ridgeway concerned an operation in which officers of the Australian Federal Police were involved in the importation of a trafficable quantity of heroin. In the High Court, Justice McHugh recited the facts of Ridgeway as follows: [Ridgeway] was released from prison in February 1989. In September and October 1989, he travelled to Singapore under a false name and in breach of his parole conditions. In Singapore, he met Lee and solicited him to import heroin into Australia. Unbeknown to ... [Ridgeway], Lee had become an informer for the Royal Malaysian Police Force. The officer who 'ran' Lee was Thian Soo Chong, an Assistant Superintendent of Police. Lee kept Superintendent Chong informed of his dealings with Ridgeway. In tum, Superintendent Chong alerted Superintendent Butler, an Australian Federal Police Officer stationed in Kuala Lumpur, as to the plans of ... [Ridgeway]. With the knowledge, if not the encouragement of the Australian Federal Police, Superintendent Chong and Lee purchased heroin in north Malaysia for about $4000 on 18 December 1989 for the purposes of delivering it to ... [Ridgeway] in Australia. . . . Arrangements were made by members of the Australian Federal Police and the Royal Malaysian Police Force for Superintendent Chong and Lee to travel to Australia carrying the heroin in a plastic bag inside a tissue box which was in a camera bag. Australian Federal Police officers took steps to ensure that Superintendent Chong-who was carrying the heroin-was not searched or detained by Australian Customs officers. History records that Ridgeway was later arrested by the Australian Federal Police, after having purchased the heroin. Over the years, Mr Deputy Speaker, law enforcement officers in this country have used covert operations to monitor illegal narcotics dealings, to track them through customs and then to apprehend those involved in importation, possession and other offences. The circumstances in this case are, however, quite different. Law enforcement officers themselves were involved in importing heroin for the purposes of apprehending Ridgeway. The Bills Digest has a very effective dissection of the provisions of the bill. When one looks at what is proposed, one has to accept that the legislation we are debating contains an appropriate balance. The High Court decision, therefore, was to the effect that, where law enforcement officials themselves committed an element of the offence for which a defendant is subsequently prosecuted, then as a general rule a court should exercise its discretion to refuse to allow evidence of that element of the offence to be admitted against the defendant. A certain number of the judgesSir Anthony Mason, Mr Justice Deane and Mr Justice Dawson-indicated that, if law enforcement officers are to engage in unlawful conduct in the course of investigations, then a legislative scheme authorising this conduct would need to be established. The genesis of the original bill was, no doubt, the suggestions by those three learned High Court judges that this parliament needed to plug what was obviously an unintended consequence of the law as it existed at the time the Ridgeway facts occurred. The main elements of the bill allow the commissioner, the deputy commissioners and the assistant commissioners of the Australian Federal Police and members of the National Crime Authority to issue certificates authorising a controlled law enforcement operation involving the import, export and/or possession of narcotic drugs. The bill also provides that certain law MC 2918 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 26 June 1996 enforcement officers, acting in good faith and in the course of duty in relation to an authorised controlled operation, are not criminally liable for certain offences against section 233B of the Customs Act 1901 or offences against sections 10 to 14 of the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act 1990-that relate to the possession, importation or exportation of narcotics-and associated offences, such as conspiracy, aiding and abetting, and in some cases state and territory offences relating to the possession of narcotic substances and associated offences. The bill also provides that the fact that law enforcement officials took part in, or facilitated, the importation of narcotics prior to the commencement of the bill is not to render evidence of that importation inadmissible, where the importation was made pursuant to a request from the Australian Federal Police to the Australian Customs Service for an exemption from detailed customs scrutiny. The bill also includes procedures which will contain the usage of controlled operations to instances involving the investigation or detection of, or the prosecution of persons for, serious criminal activity. The bill seeks to, in fact, bring in a balanced regime to enable the law enforcement officers of the Commonwealth to carry out their duties. Clearly, one of the great tragedies in Australia is the level of importation of drugs and the devastating effect that drugs have on our youth and on others who have become addicted to them. Consequently, the parliament must always consider community benefit. At times, I am concerned when there are elements of retrospectivity in relation to legislation. Civil liberties should be preserved. It ought to be noted, though, that this particular bill provides a number of very important protections. So the balance has been maintained. Some in the community may criticise the government for not having got the balance exactly right, but I believe that the government is entitled to be praised not only for continuing with this particular piece of legislation but also for incorporating the amendments suggested by the Senate. It ought to be recognised that a person cannot be convicted if, in fact, the person only committed the offence because of the actions of the federal law enforcement officers. So, to be found guilty a person must have been a person who was going to commit an offence anyway. I commend the government and I commend the opposition for continuing to support the government on this issue. As I have said, this is a bill which is supported by both sides of the parliament. It is a bill which, I believe, is in the interests of the Australian community. It is a bill that sends a message to drug traffickers that this country is not going to be soft on drugs or crime. The parliament is seeking to protect Australians from the evil of drugs while ensuring that safeguards are maintained in our law so that people are treated fairly, properly and equitably. I commend the bill to the Main Committee. has existed not so much within the parliament as within the community of those concerned about the way in which we deal with our response to the balance between the right of law enforcement and the protection of civil liberties within our community. As the member for Fisher( Mr Slipper) has rightly indicated, I was minister at the time the High Court brought down its decision in the Ridgeway case. The member for Fisher has set out the background to that litigation, so there is no need to canvass it again. In short, the parliament was then faced with a choice as to whether or not it would facilitate what had been a traditional policing practice of being involved in controlled operations in the area of drug",196,Representatives Main Commitiee
297,Mr Kerr (Denison) (10.29 A.m.),"This concludes one of the most passionate debates thatWednesday, 26 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2919 importations or to, in a sense, do nothing and thereby end what was our advice at the time as to what was the most effective way of dealing not against the small players in the international drug trade but rather against the Mr Bigs, the people who were the principal sponsors of the drug trade. Briefly, that dilemma arises because a capacity to involve law enforcement in controlled operations is absent. Whenever the police found a courier with a small amount of some drugor with a large amount of drug-they would be limited in what they could do. In a controlled operation, they seek to enlist the aid of that courier-to 'turn' that courier-to follow those drugs and create an operation designed to sting the principal organiser of the scheme, and to follow the drug trail as far up the line as possible. All the advice I received as minister at the time was that, without the capacity to undertake controlled operations, we would in a sense be limited to arresting the small players in the game. Often they were individuals who were driven to extremity, perhaps by their own addiction or by their own greed, but they were essentially small players in the game against those who are really the professionals, the Mr Bigs of the system. I believed it was important for us to deal with the High Court decision in a way which enabled that law enforcement obligation to be continued. I said at the time, in introducing the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill, that good law enforcement is a citizen's entitlement. I made the point that loss of confidence in law enforcement would lead governments to measures destructive of civil liberties. I indicated that I did not believe that this bill was such a measure and I said that the choice, in my view, was between a society prepared to accept balanced legislation to counter criminals and a society poisoned by the conditions created by those criminals and their activities. I made the point that the bill set out a full and open system of accountability which required reports to the responsible minister and, in turn, reports to the parliament. It is fair to say that those views were certainly not universally accepted by a significant component of those practising at the criminal bar. From their ranks was organised a coalitionI think it was called the Ridgeway coalition-which sought to influence members of this House to oppose the measures which I introduced. There has been within the House, on both sides of the parliament-the coalition parties and our own side-a very heightened awareness of the need to ensure that, in considering this bill, all the civil liberties issues that were raised by the Ridgeway coalition were properly taken into account and included, in so far as they could be, in the considerations that have occurred to date in the construction of this legislation. It pleases me that, after the process of parliamentary scrutiny, a Senate inquiry and a change of government, the bill finds its way back into the House in substantially the same form as I introduced it. It pleases me because it vindicates what I took to be the proper balance at the time; a balance which was then in some contention but which has survived one of the most rigorous processes of examination of any legislation in the parliamentary system. In these remarks, I place on record my particular thanks to Senator Barney Cooney for his work as chair, not only of the Senate committee which examined this legislation but also of the caucus committee on legal and constitutional affairs for many years. He is a person with whom I have had some fierce arguments. He is a person given to strong views, particularly on the subject of civil liberties. In the role that I had to fulfil as Minister for Justice, it was inevitable that, from time to time, we would have a contest of ideas which would require us MC2920 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 26 June 1996 to test each other's assumptions and test the propositions that we were each making in terms of our advocacies to each other. I want to record my very sincere and deep gratitude to Senator Cooney for the work he put into his consideration of government legislation coming before him, both in the caucus committee and in his role as chair of the Senate committee. I believe that the work of this parliament is immeasurably enhanced by parliamentarians of the calibre of Senator Cooney, who have not risen to ministerial rank-and now, with the change of government, are not likely to do so-but whose contribution to this parliament and to Australia generally needs to be recognised on occasions like this. MightI also, because he is sitting next to me at the moment, mention my colleague the member for Banks( Mr Melham), with whom I have also had some fierce contests. It would be no surprise to members of this House to know that the member for Banks took a view contrary to that which I proposed at the time and contested that view fiercely. I believe, also, that this is the place where those arguments can be tested and where the willingness of members to run against the grain of what their own government is doing from time to time is to be valued. There have also been occasions where the member for Banks and I have very much been on the same side. In pulling out materials today for this debate, I inadvertently pulled out a copy of the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Bill 1990, which has a similar title to the one we are debating today. I thought I was getting a transcript of what I had said on this legislation earlier, but I pulled this from the computer. That was legislation about which the member for Banks and I had a dialogue with the then Attorney-General, Mr Duffy, which resulted in very substantial improvements to the way in which records of interview were conducted-the videotaping of them and the limiting of time. These were measures which many then involved in law enforcement said would result in a limitation on the ability of law enforcement to do its task, but which, as events have transpired, have not had that effect at all. In fact, they are now universally seen as measures which have improved the accountability of the way the police operate and the effectiveness of policing. Certainly, they have meant that there is far less challenge to the admissibility of confessional evidence, and very much less contest about the way in which police are alleged to have extorted that evidence from people, in improper circumstances. So the member for Banks and I do find common ground on some issues. IfI want to flatter myself, I would say that I took a firmer civil liberties position with respect to that, although we were both on the same side. We succeeded in persuading the then Attorney-General to our point of view, to the benefit, I think, of the Australian community generally. I record my thanks to Barney Cooney and admit my respect for the fierce opposition that was provided to me and to the member for Banks, who managed to hedge me in and cause me enormous frustration and delay, and from time to time some little annoyance at the way in which he was able to contest this field of ideas at the time. I do think it is a little bit of a pity that we were not able to pass this legislation before the expiry of the last term of parliament. We did give it a T category status, which meant the highest priority for legislation, but the then opposition in the Senate declined to avail us of the opportunity of passage of that legislation. The consequence of that is that, although we are now rectifying a situation which needed to be rectified, a number of then pending Wednesday, 26 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2921 prosecutions have failed; a number of major drug importation prosecutions failed in that interim period when this legislation was not in place. I wish to put on record my regret that the then shadow minister, Senator Vanstone, did not grasp the seriousness of this issue and that the coalition was not in a position to support legislation which it now brings again before the House. That delay has led to some unfortunate miscarriages of justice, not in a technical legal sense but in a practical sense, where the evidence against persons alleged to be guilty of crimes could not be brought before the court because of the Ridgeway decision-a matter we are now correcting with respect to future and still pending prosecutions. So that delay has had some serious consequences from the point of view of the community at large. That said, I do join with the member for Fisher to say that I am pleased with the bipartisanship that was ultimately shown. I record that the now Attorney-General, the member for Tangney( Mr Williams), did indicate when this bilI first came before the House his support for it in general terms, a position which is now endorsed by his carriage of this legislation back into the parliament. I think I need say no more. In debates in 1995 I set out my reasons for support of this legislation in some detail and also contested some of the arguments that were then made about the appropriateness of approvals being given by judges, a view I still adhere to in principle, in the sense that I do not believe that with a separation of powers this is an appropriate task to designate to judges, and also in technical legal black-letter law a task which I believe it is incompetent to devolve upon judges, given the decisions of the High Court in recent litigation. This is one of these rare occasions where one can say that after fierce contest one feels vindicated. I am delighted that I am able to stand here and say that I initiated this legislation. It has undergone an ordeal of fire. It has passed that ordeal and I believe that it has passed it to the benefit of the Australian community. (Controlled Operations) Bill 1996 and also to indicate that a number of members have some concerns about the procedures that are being used by the government in relation to the introduction of bills or their second reading speeches in the Main Committee rather than in the House of Representatives chamber. It is a matter we will be endeavouring to change, to reform, because we consider that not to be in the best interests of a democratic and properly functioning House of Representatives. As a former member of the Procedure Committee, I have some serious concerns about it, having spent some time considering it when the Main Committee was being debated as a proposal of the Procedure Committee-in other words, during its formative debates. The role of the Main Committee was something that was in a sense quite distinctly different from what has evolved in more recent times as a result of the use of the Main Committee for second reading speeches in the first instance with subsequent debate more or less occurring simultaneously. I would agree with other speakers that the bill is a useful bill and it is an important adjunct to the role and the functions of modem police and narcotics detection. It is something that is absolutely critical at a time when the Economist magazine, in its edition of 8 June this year, made some quite interesting comments in relation to offences in Australia that are, in my view, directly related to the growth of drug trafficking within our community. It made the comments in relation to what are perceived to be the criminal trends in the United States of America,",198,Representatives Main Commitiee
298,Mr Filing (Moore) (L0.43 A.m.),"I rise to speak briefly to the Crimes AmendmentMC2922 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 26 June 1996 which is often portrayed by the media as being the crime capital of the Western world. It made some interesting comments on a survey that was conducted by the ministry of justice in the Netherlands in 1992. It says: America is no more criminal than other countries. According to an international crime survey carried out by the Ministry of Justice in the Netherlands in 1992, America is not obviously more criminal than anywhere else. You are more likely to be burgled in Australia or New Zealand; you are more likely to be robbed with violence in Spain; you are more likely to be robbed without violence in Spain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Perhaps this next part is not strictly related to drug trafficking, but it adds: You are more likely to be raped or indecently assaulted in Canada, Australia or Western Germany. I make these comments because Australia's crime statistics are becoming a matter of serious concern. It is quite clear that the community is now demanding greater concentration on the part not only of their state governments, who have the immediate jurisdiction for criminal investigations, but also-in relation to drug trafficking and all of its 'subsidiary industries'-on the part of the Australian federal government. This is because, in the first instance, the Australian federal government has responsibilities in relation to the importation and subsequent trafficking of narcotics across state jurisdictions and the like. As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority for six years-and I note that the member for Banks( Mr Melham) was a former colleague of mine on that committee-I can say that we have spent inordinate amounts of time looking at the way in which the National Crime Authority has been somewhat confounded in the past, due to operational requirements relating to joint operations with state police forces and the Australian Federal Police. We have also looked at, for instance, the very important report that was tabled a couple of years ago on Commonwealth law enforcement agencies and future criminal trends, and at the resourcing of Commonwealth law enforcement agencies in the future as a consequence. As a continuing member of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority, it is my view that some of the cuts foreshadowed in recent times for the forthcoming federal budget are a matter of some concern, whereas there is no doubt that, owing to the fiscal irresponsibility of the previous Labor administration, there is a substantial requirement for cost cutting on the part of the federal government-a matter that a vast majority of the community would no doubt agree with. The overwhelming victory by the coalition government bears testimony to the fact that there is a perception and a belief that the spending of the Commonwealth government was out of hand. Nonetheless, across-the-board spending cuts are dangerous in that they are often blind to the more important necessities, particularly in areas such as this, where we have national criminal investigation agencies-the AFP and the NCA-which are facing, and are already undertaking, cuts to their administrative operations that are going to impinge on the fight against crime, drug trafficking and the insidious influence of organised crime within our community generally. These are matters of concern, and I have indicated them already to the Attorney-General( Mr Williams). This is something that I feel very strongly about. In particular, coming as I do from the state of Western Australia-as does the Attorney-General-I am conscious that we are faced with particular problems that are, let us say, a consequence of our geography, the most notable feature of which is the large coastline of Western Australia. Wednesday, 26 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC2923 There is believed to be, through Western Australia's frontier-our international frontier-a regular annual importation into the country of drugs of some $1 billion in value. For instance, it was calculated in recent times that in a 100-kilometre radius of Geraldton some $300 million worth of drugs were smuggled into Australia in the past few years. I might add that, at the same time, the Comptroller-General of Customs at the Geraldton wharves was complaining that he had no video surveillance of activity on the wharves; a surveillance which I would have thought would have been absolutely critical to any law enforcement operation that was really going to have an effect on the importation of drugs into our community. I made those comments at the beginning because a lot of offences that are occurring within our community today-particularly break and enter, stealing and robbery-are mostly drug related. Often, addicts are stealing property from ordinary citizens to feed their habits. Our state police forces are under extraordinary stress as a consequence. We know that in recent years the various state governments, particularly when they have been coalition governments, have had their own budgetary requirements to cut costs. We have seen reductions in real terms of budgets for the various state police forces, and in particular this impinges on the opportunities for full-scale joint operations with Commonwealth law enforcement agencies. So there is a compounding effect of the cuts on the federal scene, the cuts on the state scene and the fact that we are witnessing an explosion of drug trafficking within our community, stimulated to some extent by our proximity to the South-East Asian region. I was privileged to be able to attend a recent conference in Sydney, organised jointly by the National Crime Authority and the Australian Federal Police, on organised crime within the South-East Asian and Asian region. I was fascinated to hear some of the comments of law enforcement officers from our neighbouring countries. The former minister would know that I have been a critic at times because there were some restrictions placed on exchange of information between our national law enforcement agencies and some of their counterparts overseas as a consequence of policy decisions by the Australian federal government which I believed were quite extraordinary under the circumstances. One of those was that, where a jurisdiction overseas had, for instance, capital punishment on its statute books for a particular offence and where a person had been apprehended and interviewed and charged over an offence that involved a capital offence, Australia would restrict the information that would be passed on about this person's antecedents and possible connections, as a consequence of an Australian point of view on the relative severity of that penalty. In my view, that is a reverse form of chauvinism which implies that Australia's criminal code and its criminal justice system are somehow superior to those of other jurisdictions in our region. But it was in fact an impediment to the free exchange of information that would help the fight against organised crime and in particular against organised drug trafficking, in my view the greatest criminal evil facing our nation at present. I am sure that anyone who is a parent of children in today's community knows only too well the incipient fear at all times of the threat that their child may one day indulge in or experiment in drug consumption. In recent times we have seen some quite horrific stories where younger children-younger juveniles, let us say-are becoming involved in drug consumption at an earlier age. In fact, I recollect that when I was a police officer in Western Australia between 1979 and 1987 I came across one instance of amphetamine consumption by a Western Australian offender in my contacts. But, not that many years later, we were MC 2924 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 26 June 1996 seeing instances where high school students were consuming amphetamines by injection on school premises. This is a quite extraordinary development; a trend that has to be reversed and a trend that requires not only sustained funding for our federal law enforcement agencies but also an increase which recognises the compounding, cascading effect throughout the community of this great evil that drug trafficking represents. At the beginning I mentioned some of my concerns and those of some of my Independent colleagues in relation to the processes of the House of Representatives. We have seen at the beginning of the parliamentary session a statement, following on from statements made during the election campaign, regarding the changes to our processes to make the House of Representatives a better functioning, more relevant and more democratic place in which the members can represent their constituents to the best effect. I took these statements in good faith, as I am sure many others did, and I believe that these changes are absolutely critical. We must ensure at all times that, where the executive is misusing the processes of the House of Representatives, they must be resisted by all members-not just Independent members but all members-who value the hard-fought rights of the representatives in the chamber as representatives for their constituents. We can do no more for our constituents than ensure their rights are preserved. We know that, in recent years, there has been a very strong perception that not only is the debate in the House of Representatives largely irrelevant to the processes of government but also the government regards it in that vein and treats it accordingly. In relation to this bill, in relation to other bills, in relation to the processes of the House of Representatives and in relation to the processes of the Main Committee, the House must assert the rights of its members over the rights of the executive to ensure that it is more relevant and answerable to the people. I can recollect sitting as a member of the coalition opposition and saying the same things. Unfortunately, as an Independent member, I am now seeing some of the traits of executive superiority being asserted over the rights of the members of the House of Representatives yet again. I hope that we can hold or push that back, because, at the end of the day, it suits everybody that that should take place. We must see the rights of members of the House of Representatives restored to their rightful place. As a consequence, last sitting week, my colleague the member for Curtin( Mr Rocher) moved that a number of the bills be proceeded with further in the House of Representatives chamber. I will be making a similar move shortly, in relation to the next bill. But I wanted to emphasise those points in the first instance, just to demonstrate why we are taking on this particular responsibility in the House of Representatives and in the Main Committee and why we believe that the reforms that were proposed by the Prime Minister( Mr Howard), in good faith, should be undertaken all the way through to the end of their meaning. Of course, one of those reforms related to the independent status of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, something that I am sure the member for Calare( Mr Andren), other members and I view as being extremely important. As a consequence, we are anxious to ensure that the House of Representatives supports that role and ensures that it is enhanced in all of its activities. Finally, I think the bill is one, as the member for Fisher( Mr Slipper) indicated, which is deserving of bipartisan support. But I want to repeat those words of caution I said at the beginning. These amendments are all very well. But, at the end of the day, when our national law enforcement agencies are suffering substantial cuts in their operational ability, a lot of Wednesday, 26 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2925 these sorts of changes-as noteworthy and as appropriate as they are-are less significant, because the agencies are less able to use the tools, the abilities and the resources, because of the infringements forced on them by the cuts to their budgets. I commend the bill to the Main Committee. who have taken part in this debate today. In summing up, there are a couple of responses I would like to make. The honourable member for Banks( Mr Melham) referred to the possible dangers involved when police are empowered to authorise otherwise unlawful conduct by police. The accountability package in the bill will prevent abuse of the process. Frankly, if we are to have any hope of bringing major narcotics traffickers to justice, we must give police adequate powers. Narcotics trafficking is big money. It is a high risk industry. In such an environment, the possibility for attempts to corrupt police will always exist. But the way to prevent corruption is not to deny police the powers contained in this bill. It is to build in effective accountability mechanisms and safeguards against the abuses of power. The power to authorise controlled operations will lie with 12 senior experienced law enforcement officers: nine in the AFP and three in the NCA. These officers will be responsible to the parliament and the public for the conduct of these operations. Openness and accountability are central to the framework established by the bill. The bill requires a detailed report to be made to the minister at the time of the decision to authorise an operation. That is, of course, contained in the proposed section I5R. The bill will also require a detailed report to be made about what happened during and after the operation; that is contained in section I5S. In addition, the Australian Federal Police are subject to a strict disciplinary regime and are subject to disciplinary and criminal penalties for misconduct under both the AFP Act and the AFP (Discipline) Regulations. I turn now to the comments made by the member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Campbell). He said that the proposed power will encourage corruption. Frankly, if we are to have any hope of bringing narcotics traffickers to justice, we must give police the adequate powers. The way to prevent corruption is not to deny the police these powers. Commissioner Fitzgerald, in the report of the Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct, concluded that: The true choice may be between the society altered by legislative or executive action to the extent which is necessary to hamper the misuse of civil privileges by criminals, or a society altered by those criminals and their activities ... It might be preferable to have a limited qualification of rights so that they can be enjoyed in the freer atmosphere of a fairer more honest and honourable society. I should also add that an officer who sought to deal in narcotics outside the course of duty would face the normal penalties for narcotics trafficking. Federal law enforcement officers are already subject to a strict disciplinary regime. Australian Federal Police officers, who will play the leading role in most operations, are subject to disciplinary and criminal penalties for misconduct under both the AFP Act and the AFP (Discipline) Regulations. AFP officers are employed on contract and can be summarily dismissed in cases of misconduct. The honourable member for Maribymong ( Mr Sercombe) proposed that judges authorise the controlled operations. This question was in fact addressed at length during the debate in",201,Representatives Main Committee
299,Mr Jull (Fadden,"Minister for Administrative Services) (10.58 a.m.)-I thank all thoseMC 2926 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 26 June 1996 the Senate. The outcome of the debate was that the Democrats, who had pressed amendments to require judicial authorisation, were persuaded that the proposal was unwise and withdrew the amendments. The difficulties with the proposal were well expressed by Senator Cooney in the debate on 29 May when he said: I think no judge should be brought before a court and cross-examined as to why he or she believes that a person is likely to commit an offence. The honourable member for Maribyrnong also proposed that a parliamentary committee should review the provisions after some years. The legislation will be reviewed by the courts very soon after it commences operations. There are prosecutions on foot at the moment that will almost certainly result in the testing of provisions. This is a more effective and more immediate form of scrutiny than that which is proposed by the honourable member. The honourable member is also most likely aware that the High Court is at present considering a case which involves debate about the propriety of judges performing non-judicial functions. I refer to the case involving argument about the appointment of Judge Jane Mathews to conduct the Hindmarsh Bridge inquiry. This is an emerging issue and it would be premature to establish a review mechanism now. It is possible that some kind of major review, possibly by the ALRC or by a parliamentary committee, will be needed once the issues have fully emerged. The honourable member for Moore( Mr Filing) made great play of the possible budget cuts to the NCA. He would know that I can provide no details of any budget proposals involving the NCA or any other agency. Obviously, we must wait for details of the budget which will be delivered on 20 August. However, any cuts to the NCA will in any event be considered in the light of the functions which are performed by the range of Commonwealth and state law enforcement agencies which have a role in the struggle against the importation of illicit narcotics. The previous government's report, the Review of Commonwealth Law Enforcement Arrangements, identified the need to 'eliminate perceived duplications of roles that existed between the NCA and the AFP.' This would offer the opportunity to make savings without an effect upon the performance of functions. The honourable member must not assume that any cuts to the funding of the NCA, if in fact there are any, will necessarily have a negative effect upon the efficiency of the struggle against crime and the importation of illicit narcotics in particular. Proposed section 15U will require the tendering of the certificate. During the debate in the Senate an amendment to insert a new section 15U, which deals with the tendering of evidentiary certificates, was carried. Such a provision was not included in the bill presented by the government because it was felt to be unnecessary. It is inevitable that the fact of a controlled operation will be apparent to the defence in any trial depending upon such evidence. The defence will then have the right to oppose the admissibility of the evidence by challenging the authorisation procedure. This would be done in most cases by way of a voir dire. However it does not damage the bill to include specific requirements that the prosecution tender the certificate thus putting the defence on notice that evidence resulting from a controlled operation will be adduced. Section 15U is somewhat imperfect in that the section, on its face, requires that a certificate authorising a controlled operation is to be tendered in evidence in 'a prosecution for an offence against section 233B of the Customs Act 1901'. Needless to say, many prosecutions for Wednesday, 26 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC2927 offences under section 233B of the Customs Act will arise which do not depend on any evidence gathered through a controlled operation. In many cases there will be no certificate to present. My department is confident that the court will apply common sense principles of interpretation to the operation of section 15U and will not require the tendering of a certificate in a trial where no controlled operation is being conducted. The requirement to tender the certificate will arise only in those cases where evidence is to be led by the prosecution which has been obtained through the conduct of a controlled operation. I again thank honourable members for their valuable contributions to this debate. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Bill-by leave-reported to the House without amendment.

Quite frankly, I find it quite extraordinary that he has expressed those concerns but now wants to obstruct the passage of the legislation, which is supported by both the government and the opposition, to give the Commissioner of the AFP very necessary powers to deal with police corruption. His actions are inconsistent with his words. I therefore present the explanatory memorandum of the bill and proceed to the second reading. Vigilance against police corruption is an ongoing issue for Australian governments and the public at large. The more important provisions of this bill are focused on ensuring that the Australian Federal Police remains corruption free. A similar bill lapsed earlier this year due to the federal election. The government has decided to introduce a bill in a similar form to provide the necessary armoury to combat corruption within the Australian Federal Police. Members will be aware that the royal commission into the New South Wales Police Service has uncovered distressing instances of corruption and other serious misconduct. Such abuse of power and of the community's trust can never be tolerated in any police service. I know all members were distressed to hear that serving and former members of the Australian Federal Police have been implicated in corruption and other reprehensible behaviour. The government and the administration of the Australian Federal Police are strongly committed to ensuring that it is never debilitated by a culture of corruption and misconduct.",205,Representatives Main Committee

304,Mr Jull,"The comments made today by the honourable member for Moore have basicallyMC2928 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 26 June 1996 The institutional culture of a police force is of vital importance to a community. A police force stands at the threshold of the criminal justice system and is in effective control of the enforcement of the criminal law. Each police officer has an extensive authority over all other citizens, coupled with a wide discretion over its exercise. Subsequent stages in the criminal justice process, including courts and prisons, are largely dependent on the activities of police services and will inevitably be affected by their deficiencies. The Commonwealth is, of course, particularly dependent on the integrity and efficiency of the Australian Federal Police. First, it is the principal agency for the general enforcement of the Commonwealth's criminal laws. It provides a vital link in effective cooperation with international law enforcement bodies. It is essential that the Australian Federal Police maintains the confidence of these bodies as well as the public's confidence. In 1989, the parliament, with the support of all parties, substantially amended the Australian Federal Police Act 1979. The reforms were designed, in part, to introduce a new and unique employment scheme which would inhibit the occurrence of patterns of corruption uncovered in other police services. One aspect of these reforms was the replacement of tenure with a system of fixed term appointments. Another aspect was providing the commissioner with chief executive powers in relation to appointments within the Australian Federal Police, including the power to end the appointment of any police member or civilian staff member. One of the principles underlying this employment scheme is that the commissioner should have a clear and specific responsibility for the integrity and operational efficiency of the Australian Federal Police. Naturally, the scheme also envisaged that the commissioner should have the powers and authority necessary to fulfil these responsibilities. At present, the commissioner's power to terminate the appointment of members or staff members of the Australian Federal Police is subject only to two exceptions. The current legislation states that the commissioner must not make use of this power merely because a disciplinary charge has been or could be laid or a court has convicted or found the person guilty of a criminal offence. These exceptions were provided in order to separate the Australian Federal Police's disciplinary processes-which can result in dismissal as a penalty for a disciplinary offencefrom the commissioner's general power to end a person's appointment. In practice, the limitations on the commissioner's power of dismissal can lead to situations which are clearly inconsistent with the policy aims of the AFP employment scheme. For example, it is not clear that the commissioner can terminate the appointment of a member of the Australian Federal Police even if the member admits publicly that he or she is guilty of corruption or other serious reprehensible behaviour. To dismiss that person from the Australian Federal Police, it might be necessary for the commissioner either to invite the member to resign voluntarily or to initiate disciplinary proceedings. The commissioner's hands could be equally tied if the person were to be convicted of serious criminal offences by a court. The government believes that this situation is unsatisfactory. Corruption in a police service can seriously undermine the professional self-respect and morale of the decent and honest police who comprise the majority of members. It can also seriously diminish public confidence in the affected police service, something that may now be apparent in respect of the New South Wales Police Service. Immediate and effective action may be the only way to minimise the harm. On occasions, it will not be desirable to wait for lengthy disciplinary or court proceedings to be finally resolved before taking action. Wednesday, 26 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2929 The proposed amendments will remove the limitations on the commissioner's powers of dismissal which relate to disciplinary offences and criminal convictions. The intention is to give the commissioner a broader and more effective power to end an appointment where the commissioner has lost confidence in a person's suitability for continued employment in the Australian Federal Police. The amendments will, in particular, permit the commissioner to act quickly and decisively to end the appointment of a person where the commissioner believes on reasonable grounds that there has been corruption, serious abuse of power or serious dereliction of duty. While the government believes it is necessary in the public interest for the commissioner to have a wide discretion to end appointments, it also recognises that the employment rights of individual members and staff members within the Australian Federal Police should also be protected. Currently, members and staff members are protected in two ways in the event that they are retired by the commissioner before the end of their terms of appointment. Firstly, people who are retired may seek judicial review by the Federal Court of the commissioner's decision to end their appointments. Secondly, retired people are entitled to compensation for the lost part of their appointments. As this bill will widen the scope of the commissioner's powers to end appointments, the government believes it is also reasonable to extend to members and staff members additional remedies against the possibility that the commissioner's power might be exercised unfairly or unreasonably. The government has been at pains to find an appropriate balance between the public interest in maintaining a corruption free Australian Federal Police and the rights of the individual member or staff member who may be retired early either because of allegations of corruption or for other reasons, such as inefficiency. In particular, in reconsidering this bill, I focused on the need for appropriate safeguards to protect innocent members and staff members. The government has decided that, in addition to the existing protective measures I have outlined, individual members and staff members who have their appointments terminated early will also have access to merit reviews before the Industrial Relations Commission and the Industrial Relations Court. At present, the Australian Federal Police are excluded from those unlawful termination provisions by the industrial relations regulations. Honourable members will no doubt be aware that, under the government's industrial relations reforms, it is proposed that the Industrial Relations Court be abolished and for the industrial relations jurisdiction to be conferred instead on the Federal Court. The government intends to repeal the relevant industrial relations regulation, subject to transitional and savings provisions, with effect from the date that the amendments in this bill come into force, and that is 28 days after royal assent. The bill makes one exception to the opening of the unfair dismissal remedies to the Australian Federal Police. This is where serious misconduct is involved. The bill provides that, where a person's appointment has been ended because of their conduct or behaviour, the commissioner may make a declaration that the conduct or behaviour amounts to serious misconduct and that the serious misconduct is having, or is likely to have, a damaging effect on professional self-respect or morale within the Australian Federal Police or on its reputation with the public or with an Australian or overseas government or law enforcement agency. Serious misconduct is defined in the bill to mean corruption, serious abuse of power, serious dereliction of duty or any other serious reprehensible behaviour. Where a declaration of this MC 2930 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 26 June 1996 kind is made, the person who has been retired will be excluded from the operation of the Industrial Relations Act provisions concerning unlawful dismissal, and will not be able to obtain merit review. Such persons, however, will retain the present right to compensation for their early retirement and to seek judicial review of the commissioner's declaration, as well as the decision to end their appointment. Also, a person subject to a declaration of serious misconduct will be able to seek a statement of reason in relation to the commissioner's decision to make the declaration. However, where the reasons would disclose information that would not be in the public interest to disclose-for example, operationally sensitive information such as the identity of informants or current investigations-the Attorney-General may, in the public interest, issue a certificate under subsection 14(1) of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 preventing disclosure of that information. This solution reaches an appropriate balance between the public interest in maintaining a corruption free Australian Federal Police and the rights of the individual. As I have indicated, the commissioner will be able to make a declaration only where the commissioner believes on reasonable grounds that there has been serious misconduct by the person who is retired. It is also necessary that the commissioner believes that the serious misconduct is actually damaging, or is likely to damage, the Australian Federal Police in one of the ways I have described. Clearly, these are special circumstances. They are circumstances in which immediate action by the commissioner is needed to maintain the internal integrity or the public reputation of the Australian Federal Police, and where it is not appropriate that an outside tribunal may be able to remake the commissioner's decision. The amendment will permit the commissioner to make a declaration either before or after the behaviour or conduct in question becomes widely known. This is to allow the commissioner to act to pre-empt the threatened damage to the morale or reputation of the Australian Federal Police. The bill also contains several minor amendments concerning two separate matters. One group of amendments is intended to give the Governor General the power to authorise the commissioner and the deputy commissioners to appoint or promote persons as commissioned officers with the Australian Federal Police. At present the legislation permits the Governor General to give this authority only to the commissioner. The new arrangements are administratively more convenient. The amendments allow for appropriate safeguards. The second group of amendments deals with the disciplinary obligations of staff members when granted special leave of absence for service with an industrial association. The effect is to extend the existing provisions which deal with members to staff members, as well. I commend the bill to the Main Committee. I think, that the poor old government does not have much on its plate in the way of legislation so it has been picking up, in the main, the legislation of the previous government, and that is what this bill basically is. Apart from some minor procedural amendments that were made to the 1995 bill, this bill is substantially the bill that the Labor party introduced before the election, and the party supports wholeheartedly an expedited passage of the bill.

305,Mr Melham (Banks) (11.19 A.m.),"The opposition supports this bill. It is fair to say,Wednesday, 26 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2931 parliamentary committee in Western Australia that has recently reported to the Western Australian parliament; and, of course, there was the celebrated Fitzgerald inquiry in Queensland. In the light of all those inquiries, we can no longer say that either the state or the federal police forces are lilywhite. I think it is on that basis that this bill comes before the parliament. It makes it easier for a member or a staff member to be dismissed by reason of serious misconduct, regardless of whether that conduct may amount to a breach of the Australian Federal Police (Discipline) Regulations, either directly or as a result of a criminal conviction. I know that there has been concern expressed by members of the Australian Federal Police that they could be unduly or hastily dealt with under this legislation, but the opposition has looked at those concerns and believes that there are balances in the bill and remedies that officers can take if they believe they have been wrongly dismissed. I think the bill is fair in the current climate, and the second reading speech of the Minister for Administrative Services( Mr Jull), who is at the table, highlights it. The intention is to give the commissioner a broader and more effective power to end an appointment where the commissioner has lost confidence in a person's suitability for continued employment in the Australian Federal Police. The amendment will, in particular, permit the commissioner to act quickly and decisively to end the appointment of a person where the commissioner believes, on reasonable grounds, that there has been corruption, serious abuse of power or serious dereliction of duty. The minister went on to say that, as the bill will widen the scope of the commissioner's powers to end appointments, the government believes it is also reasonable to extend to members and staff members additional remedies against the possibility that the commissioner's power might be exercised unfairly or unreasonably. Then it goes on to detail what those additional remedies are. The opposition's view is that there is some balance in this bill, and it is appropriate that the commissioner have these powers. Mr Deputy Speaker, there is no need for me to take up my allotted time. Our view, as an opposition, is that we welcome the bill that is before the Committee. I think it is fair to say that the former Minister for Justice, Mr Duncan Kerr, can rightly take credit for a lot of the initiatives in this bill. I think he should be afforded due recognition. I know that he does welcome this bill before the Committee. Australian Federal Police Amendment Bill, it has been said that Australians are becoming increasingly cynical about the society in which they live. Evidence suggests that Australians are less community minded than they were in the past, that they trust one another less and that they put less faith in traditional institutions. The family, the church, the media, the state and federal parliaments and even the judiciary have all, arguably, seen a deterioration in their public image in recent years. Likewise, the police force has experienced its share of criticism and has withstood numerous accusations ranging from racism to corruption. Bodies such as the Fitzgerald inquiry in Queensland and the current Wood royal commission in New South Wales have partially eroded public confidence in our systems of law enforcement. This comes at a time when law and order rates highly on the list of community concerns. As the shadow minister at the table would fully understand, in recent election campaigns, at both state and federal levels, law and order issues have rated very highly on the political agenda. There is a widespread fear that the criminal justice system fails to punish",210,Representatives Main Commitiee
306,Mr Mcarthur (Corangamite) (11.23 A.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker, in relation to theMC 2932 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 26 June 1996 serious crime effectively. There is also an understanding out there that criminals receive light sentences and the streets are no longer safe, as they were. That is the perception that members of the public have. Confidence in law enforcement is ultimately the difference between a civil and peaceful society and complete lawlessness. For this reason, the confidence of the Australian people in the integrity of their police force is of vital importance. It behoves the elected representatives of the Australian people to support, defend and express their confidence in the police force. I put on the public record my support for that view. Members of parliament, both state and federal, should be seen to be supporting the police force in its operation and, I think, in both a moral and a personal way, should help the police to enforce the laws that are created by these parliaments. This, of course, includes ensuring that the police force remains corruption free and that it has the ability to quickly respond to any suggestion of corruption or serious misconduct. This bill is aimed at avoiding a culture of corruption and misconduct in the Australian Federal Police. While the Wood royal commission in New South Wales has uncovered disturbing allegations of corruption in that state's police force, present and former members of the Australian Federal Police have also been implicated and named before the commission. Against that backdrop, this bill empowers the Australian Federal Police Commissioner to dismiss police officers in cases of corruption or serious misconduct. Until now, there has been some doubt as to whether an officer of the Australian Federal Police could be sacked, even if they had been found guilty of a criminal charge. The officer would need to resign voluntarily or face disciplinary hearings, but the ability of the Australian Federal Police to move swiftly and effectively was compromised. This is an attitude of the public sector, and this bill really brings about quite a dramatic change to that attitude. Now the commissioner will be able to deal with any suggestion of wrongdoing in the Australian Federal Police and restore public confidence with decisive action. The bill will provide some limited access to the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, except in cases of corruption, serious abuse of power or serious dereliction of duty. While protection from unfair dismissal may be fair enough for most employees, clearly there must be a different set of rules for the police force. The community demands that swift action be available to dismiss police officers with a proven tainted record. Can you imagine what would happen if the former Labor government's unfair dismissal laws applied to the police force? In the case of these unfair dismissal laws, we have seen cases where workers have stolen, lied, accessed confidential files for personal use and been abusive to clients and seriously disloyal to the employer, and the Industrial Relations Court has reinstated them with back pay and compensation. As members of the former government would understand, the Howard government does not agree with this unfair dismissal procedure and is very unhappy with the consequences: it was about $7,000 for every dismissal. It was better, in most cases, for the employer to pay the money because that is what it would finally cost, no matter what the reality of the case was, because of the legality of the unfair dismissal arrangements. The Australian Federal Police and the state police forces need to be well equipped to respond to any suggestion of serious misconduct with very swift action, and not have to put up with the unfair dismissal procedures. For minor allegations, the police officers will be protected by the unfair dismissal provisions in the new Industrial Relations Act, where it is appropriate. Wednesday, 26 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2933 It is important, and the government would agree, that any termination of a police officer's employment by the police commissioner must be on reasonable grounds. Obviously, there is an area for debate about that, as always in terms of dismissal, but in terms of keeping the integrity of the force, be it federal or state, these provisions are sensible. The Australian Federal Police is the principal law enforcement agency of the Commonwealth; it is the federal force in charge of policing breaches of the laws of the Commonwealth. Aside from investigations relating to offences against Commonwealth law, the Australian Federal Police provides a community policing role in the ACT. The headquarters are located in Canberra, with regional commands in states and territories. There are nearly 3,000 members of the force in 31 Australian offices and 15 overseas bureaus. There are also Australian Federal Police representatives attached to Interpol headquarters. Members of the force have been involved in the UN peacekeeping operations in Cyprus, Mozambique, Cambodia and Somalia. The operations of some aspects of the Australian Federal Police are quite extensive. The operational priorities of the Australian Federal Police are to provide the best in prevention, detection and investigation of criminal offences against the Commonwealth, with particular emphasis on organised crime and strategic intelligence, and to provide leadership in the Australian law enforcement effort. The federal police has cooperative relationships with the National Crime Authority, the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board and state police agencies. As an aside, it has always been my view that this cooperation between the Australian police force and the state police agencies is an important aspect. Most Australian citizens really deal on a day-to-day basis with state police agencies, whereas the federal jurisdiction in terms of its moral influence and its enforcement is somewhat removed from the day-to-day operations of the average citizen. There have been previous reforms of the Australian police force structure aimed at stamping out corruption, which is certainly grabbing the headlines both in New South Wales and Victoria. In 1989, the parliament legislated to replace tenure for Australian Federal Police officers with a series of fixed appointments which, it seems to me, would be a step in the right direction. The commissioner was also given limited ability to end appointments for misconduct. The legislation builds further on that reform by strengthening the hand of the commissioner to dismiss police officers in such troublesome circumstances. In February this year, the then Minister for Justice( Mr Kerr) announced the completion of an enterprise agreement with the Australian Federal Police Association. I totally support that approach, in line with our industrial relations legislation, and I am pleased that the former minister was able to complete that enterprise agreement. Part of that package was a six per cent increase in salary, an increase in part-time and job-sharing work, working from home and other flexible working arrangements. Again, this is very compatible with the new industrial relations workplace bill that the Howard government has introduced into the House of Representatives and is now debating in that chamber. According to the press release, the number of jobs performing routine or processing functions will be reduced and the emphasis will be on multi skilled, flexible units. Pay will be based on responsibilities of roles rather than a rank-based system. Again, this is compatible with the philosophy of the Howard government's industrial relations approach based on ability and merit rather than on an award and rank system, as it would be in the Federal Police. So there is a more productive and flexible arrangement of workplace arrangements by the Federal Police MC 2934 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 26 June 1996 compatible with the general thrust of the government's industrial relations bill before the House. Additional measures are agreed to in order to combat potential corruption. The press release is suggesting that there is a greater risk of corruption where some of the Australian Federal Police are isolated in long standing squads or task forces in remote areas, or handling particular tasks. The federal police have recognised this and are moving away from static squads of the past to a more flexible system. We think these reforms are timely not only in terms of the context of the debates here in the parliament but also in terms of debates on the police forces around Australia. This is a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, the Federal Police have been involved in some of the arguments and debates in the Wood royal commission in New South Wales. In September last year, the commission heard that an elite joint task force consisting of Australian Federal Police members and New South Wales Drug Squad detectives had allegedly stolen $200,000 worth of drug money after an operation in 1983. The money had been seized as part of a raid but never submitted as evidence. Allegedly, it was split amongst the members of the joint task force. The Canberra Times of 27 September 1995 reported that one of the secret witnesses told the commission that he had seen a psychiatrist and was suffering moral collapse after accepting $10,000 which had been stolen from the drug traffickers. Allegedly, the witness had found an envelope stuffed with $20 and $50 notes in his drawer at the joint task force headquarters at Kings Cross. After leaving it in his drawer for a number of days, he eventually took the money home and hid it in his sports bag. He reported that he was suffering moral tensions and a festering sore in his subconscious ever since he had been involved in part of that corruption. Unfortunately, in this case, the Federal Police officers were caught in an isolated situation of corruption stemming from the joint operation with the New South Wales police force. This took place some time ago but it does add to the public perception and concern about the general performance of police forces around Australia. I will conclude by reiterating my belief that members of all parliaments should try to support members of the police force. They, like members of the parliament, are public persons and often many of the middle-of-the-road police officers are wrongly accused of being part of the total so-called corruption of some of the forces. My own exposure in Victoria suggests that the police force in that state is fairly good. Chief Commissioner Comrie has taken every effort to enforce the law, as the law-makers have put it forward in the parliaments, in a day-to-day operation to ensure that crime is kept to a minimum. It is a difficult task. I have heard Commissioner Comrie give some private remarks about the operation of the police force. I observe that certain media outlets emphasise the deficiencies of the police force and give undue coverage of that, compared to other elements of the society who enjoy certain notoriety about activities relating to police shootings and activities related to civil liberties groups. I draw the attention of the parliament to the disparity in some of these public arguments between the position of the Victorian police force and what the chief commissioner might have to say, as compared to what some civil liberty groups might put forward as their position. I think the Victorian police force, which as a Victorian I have some day-to-day contact with, has done a pretty good job. The police officers that I have dealt with are conscientious. They conduct themselves in a civil manner, executing the laws in terms of traffic offences and in terms ofMr Ted Grace-Like the way they treated the Premier. Wednesday, 26 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2935 that they do their best to keep law and order throughout most areas in Victoria. It is a difficult task and I place on record that, overall, I think the Victorian police force does a good job. However, in relation to the Federal Police force, which we are talking about, this bill brings about a change of attitude-that if they do not do the right thing the chief commissioner has the capacity to make a change dramatically in removing personnel. That will help with the general perception that the chief commissioner can move and make the changes if he so wishes. I concede that there are a couple of downsides, based on the fact that he may move peremptorily. But, on balance, I think the chief commissioner needs this power. earlier that I was going to move to have the matter referred to the main chamber and I have considered that in more detail. I was interested in the comments made by the minister at the table. I think he was perhaps not being serious when he suggested that impeding the bill's progress through the Main Committee was somehow going to impede its progress as a piece of legislation through the parliamentary process, which is obviously not true. I support the bill and I support the bill's intentions. I just make the comment that the bill was introduced into the Senate. One of the reasons for that is that the Senate has a standing order that requires bills originating in the House to be presented by 30 May in order for them to be considered by the Senate within a particular time frame. One of the consequences of the relatively late start of this new parliament has been that bills which must desperately be passed-and I consider this to be one of them-have to be introduced in the Senate. Otherwise they will end up in the Senate backlog of legislation and not be dealt with for some time. IfI can just paraphrase the words of Winston Churchill, it is probably fair to say, in relation to police and the criminal justice system, that Australia's criminal justice system is probably the worse in the world, apart from all the others. I make that comment in view of the fact that, of all the police and criminal justice models around the world, the Australian one does have some particularly strong advantages. Of course, it has disadvantages, and disadvantages are highlighted in this particular bill. I commend the work of a colleague, the former independent member for the South Coast, John Hatton, who served for some considerable time in the New South Wales parliament. He pursued the issue of police corruption in New South Wales almost incessantly, to the extent that he was able to cause to be initiated a royal commission into the New South Wales police force. He pursued that against the backdrop of considerable criticism from both sides of politics. In the last phase of his career in the New South Wales parliament, he was given a pretty hard time and was considered by some to be almost obsessive in his pursuit of that particular objective. If anybody is a hero of modem times in relation to our criminal justice system, then John Hatton, the former independent member for the South Coast, is one of them. A police force, more often than not, reflects the society which it serves; another truism that is reflected in the bill. We face considerable difficulties in our community at present with behaviour-that is, what is considered to be acceptable behaviour in relation to what is considered to be, let us say, a fair return for one's effort. The whole of the service of police force members around the country has to be taken into consideration against that backdrop. In other words, you get the police force you deserve. We must, as a community, ensure that our police forces around the country are operating to the highest possible standards.

That is because it looks at the day-to-day operation of a police station and, of course, the interaction of police officers as a consequence. More recent Australian dramas such as Blue Heelers have, I think, given a much greater and more realistic, sometimes gritty, feel to the reality of day-to-day policing in a modem Australian society. Some of the shows that were on television when I first arrived in this country, including Homicide and Division 4, were romanticised to a large extent, probably reflecting the romantic view that people had of the police forces. After all, a police force, as I mentioned, reflects the community. As communities develop, there is a pressure on police forces to develop as a consequence. It is clear from the Wood royal commission that, in the case of the Australian Federal Police and, of course, the New South Wales police, there are significant problems with corruption. There have been significant allegations and compelling evidence, I would have thought, of corruption. Quite clearly, it requires a sensible resolution and this bill provides that, particularly in relation to the role of the commissioner of police as the chief executive officer of a modem police force. When I first joined the police force in Western Australia, the commissioner was probably second only to the Premier in terms of the perception of the role as a significant public official. I certainly remember, when I first joined, that the commissioner was seen in a sort of revered way, up on the horizon, somebody of considerable authority. That authority, when I was a junior policeman, was very strong in the force. In fact, the commissioner had quite extraordinary powers to dismiss police officers whom he or his advisers considered to be unsuitable to remain in the force. It is obvious that, if you have a situation where human beings are police officers, you are going to get human problems. I spoke earlier about the insidious problem of drug importation and drug trafficking in our community. The problem is probably compounded by the extraordinary and enormous rewards that can be achieved by those who participate in that sort of criminal behaviour. You have a situation wherein the police forces are rubbing up against this sort of corrupt, criminal, conspiratorial behaviour. They see the rewards. The problem is that in some instances, as we have clearly seen in the Wood royal commission, the temptation is overpowering. It is clear that we have to deal with this, as a community, in a way that properly reflects the reality of the situation. scope for the reform of certain drug laws. But, in the final analysis, if there is a profit it does not matter what sort of drug it is; whether it is marijuana, an amphetamine or one of the latest chemical drugs. It does not matter what they are; where there is a criminal profit to be gained, you are going to have people attracted into participating. We have seen people who were even prepared to risk their lives to bring back drugs from South-East Asia, knowing that they were facing the possibility of a death sentence. They are",215,Representatives Main Committee

311,Mr Filing,"The member makes a comment about the reform of drug laws. There is someWednesday, 26 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2937 so significantly attracted towards the profit, through their own drug addiction or just through sheer greed, that they are prepared to risk their lives-and, in many cases, risk 30 years in some of the worse prison conditions in the world-in order to either make that profit or feed their own drug needs. It is clear that, in modem policing and the reform of modem policing, there is a need for greater visibility and scrutiny. If that requires the sort of authority that this bill provides the commissioner of the Australian Federal Police with, then that is absolutely necessary. In some ways, it probably reflects some of the past standing of commissioners of police as being people with considerable authority in directing the day-to-day operations of their forces. The independence of the police force is a very important facet of the balances within our criminal justice system. In more recent times, some of this independence has been imposed upon. I believe that is to the detriment of a better and more responsive, efficient and decent police force effort around the country. In particular, in the case of the Australian Federal Police, the role of the commissioner is absolutely critical. The commissioner's role should be as independent as is possible within the relationship between the commissioner's office, the minister and the parliament to whom the minister is responsible. In the case of rewards, one of the areas that I have wanted to see changed and enhanced is that of the remuneration and benefits that are available to police officers in our day-to-day community. After all, when police officers are well paid, in relative terms, compared to other members of the community, and they are secure in their employment in terms of doing the right thing, getting the job done properly and being decent and honest members of the force, obviously that is a greater deterrent to succumbing to the attractions of criminal profits or becoming involved in conspiracies with organised crime or other criminals. That is something that we all have to look at. If we want to have police forces that are going to be impeccable, efficient, responsive and answerable to the community, we ought to make sure that not only are we getting the best possible personnel into those forces but also they are well renumerated for their work, so that they are seen within the community as being higher than perhaps they have been in the past. Over the last 20 to 30 years, the standing of police officers in the community was reduced steadily until they became, in many cases, the butt of abuse. To refer to my own particular experience, I can recollect that, when I first joined the job, in social terms a police officer was almost seen as a pariah. If you turned up to a social gathering, it was almost as though you had suddenly put the pall of doom over it. Of course, people started whispering in cornersat a later stage, from his own personal observations. I agree that it is a question of perception and myth. We took on the British police model as our role model in the formation of our Australian police forces. We adopted, changed and developed that within the Australian context, both in the states and nationally, with the Australian Federal Police acting as the federal police force. Amongst those things that we took on, as opposed to other police jurisdictions around the world, was the concept that a police officer should be a part of the community, interact with the community and live in the community, as opposed to the barrack style police forces on the mainland of Europe and elsewhere. I must say that I think that is one of the great advantages. Community visibility is absolutely critical. One of the things that is occurring in",216,Representatives Main Committee

313,Mr Filing,"That is an interesting observation; perhaps the member could expand on that,MC 2938 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 26 June 1996 some police jurisdictions is the bringing of detectives back into uniform so that they are visible going about their duties. It is something that in the past I have opposed but, in the light of some of the circumstances of recent times, I think it helps the visibility of police practices and helps the community and the police to interact to ensure that they have very high standards. The other aspect is the scrutiny of the courts. I have to commend the former Minister for Justice, the member for Denison( Mr Kerr), on this issue. Some years back, when he first introduced the requirement for Australian Federal Police officers to videotape interviews, I was a critic of his. I thought that at times, particularly in remote areas of Australia, videotaping would pose significant problems of access, facilities, distance and time involved after apprehending a suspect, interviewing, and going through the further processes that are applicable under the relevant statutes. This, I believe, has now proved to be a significant advantage. It has enhanced police work. It has also meant, in the context of prosecution of cases in the courts, that the courts are able to see the accused at the point when they are being interviewed by the police in a way that often reveals more about them than mountains and mountains of written or oral evidence could possibly do. I would say from my discussions with other police officers, particularly the ones I consider to be thoughtful about these processes, that I believe that they are all in agreement with the changes that have been brought in, in particular the changes relating to videotaping of interviews. Also, videotaping is a critical part of the element of visibility, which I mentioned earlier. It means that people can see the process, with the benefit of hindsight to a certain extent. It is there on the record in physical evidence, visual and in sound. That is something that permits the courts to have a greater scrutiny of police practices and police behaviour. I reiterate some of the comments made earlier in relation to cuts. But, if we are going to have a police force and an Australian Federal Police that is going to be effective, it has to be as independent as possible. In other words, within the communal justice system it must be able to exercise its statutory responsibilities in a way that is consistent with the basic principles of a proper, responsive criminal justice system. Also, it is not to be interlinked or merged in joint standing facilities with other agencies. That is something I have criticised in the past; it is something from the former Minister for Justice that I have criticised. I felt that the joint standing operations between the NCA and the Australian Federal Police were to the detriment of both organisations. I believe that each should be self-standing and clearly separated so that they are clearly answerable in their own ways to their own particular statutes and, at the end of the day, via the minister, to the parliament. Our processes are critical to a criminal justice system. It is fair to say that in the past, particularly in New South Wales, if the legislators had been more diligent in looking over the operations of the New South Wales Police, we would have had a different situation. There were all sorts of allegations in the 1950s, the 1960s, the 1970s and the 1980s in relation to the interlinking of corrupt behaviour in the police and some of the political figures of the times. But it is fair that we must ensure that the police force's activities, its responsiveness, its efficiency, its effects, and its method of operations are as clearly visible as possible so that the community can see, to their satisfaction or otherwise, that they are getting a service that they deserve. I said at the beginning that you get the police force you deserve. If we have got police forces that are less than satisfactory, we have to look back at our own community and we have to make the decision to reform the police forces in ways that are consistent with what we ask Wednesday, 26 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2939 the community to do themselves. After all, police officers are human beings. A vast majority of them around the country perform their duties honestly and decently, as best they can. In many cases, as we saw recently with the Port Arthur massacre and in other instances, they go far beyond the call of duty to provide services that many other citizens would probably find themselves completely unable to do. We ask them to do that on our behalf. In order to ensure that they have the standing in the community, we have got to ensure that they are able to work in the sorts of administrative and organisational settings that enhance their honesty and their commitment to their work, and at the end of the day give the public the satisfaction that it is getting the best possible police service that it deserves. I commend this bill to the Main Committee. As I mentioned earlier, it is important that this bill is passed as soon as possible. As a consequence I have refrained from referring it back to the main chamber. members who have contributed to the debate on this legislation this morning. I palticularly thank the members of the opposition for their support. I would also like to thank the honourable member for Moore( Mr Filing) for not proceeding with his motion regarding this bill. I trust that the bill will now have a speedy passage in its remaining stages. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Bill-by leave-reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 22 May, on motion by Mr Sharp: That the bill be now read a second time. designed to increase the size of the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority by two: the present number of four lay members will be increased to six. The authority's Chief Executive Officer, Mr Leroy Keith, is also an ex officio member of the board. The bill is also designed to empower the minister to appoint one of the members of the board as a deputy chair of the board. Briefly, the background to this legislation has to be seen in the context of the tragic disaster of the Monarch Airlines crash at Young in mid-1993 and the subsequent Bureau of Air Safety Investigation report into that crash. That led to the then Minister for Transport, Mr Laurie Brereton, announcing that the government intended to separate the commercial and safety regulatory functions of the former Civil Aviation Authority into two separate bodies. The legislation to do so was announced by the then minister on 28 March 1995 and was passed by the parliament a couple of months later. As a result of that legislation, two separate bodies-Airservices Australia and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority-were created by the parliament. The controversy which surrounded the previous Civil Aviation Authority has not died as a result of that decision.

315,Mr Tanner (Melbourne) (11.57 A.m.),"The Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 1996 isMC 2940 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 26 June 1996 sector, are the questions associated with the safety regulatory functions performed by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority as it now is. The new board of the authority took office on 1 July 1995. The four lay members who were appointed then and who are still in office are: the chair of the board, Mr Justice Bill Fisher, who is Chief Judge of the New South Wales Industrial Court as well; Ms Gaby Hollows, who is a consumer advocate; Dr Claire Pollock, who is a systems safety expert; and Mr Geoff Molloy, who is a former Qantas pilot. As I indicated, the director, Mr Leroy Keith, is an ex officio member of the board. Shortly after coming to office, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp, endeavoured to force the four members of the board to resign. He wrote letters to them individually seeking their resignations. He rang each of them individually seeking their resignations and at at least one meeting, and possibly more, collectively spoke to the board members asking them to resign. The only reason that he gave at that point was, and I quote, 'ThatI have obligations to other people.' Given that the board members had been in office for only about nine months, that there had been no substantive complaints levelled against them, and that the issues which arose from, for example, the BASI investigation into the Monarch disaster, predated their period on the board, it was rather a peculiar performance by the minister. In fact, he subsequently admitted that it would not go down as one of his best performances. He did point out, correctly, that the coalition policy prior to the election was to increase the amount of aviation expertise, or direct aviation industry background, represented on the board. This was a position that was strongly supported by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, which strongly supported the coalition, and Mr Sharp in particular, during the election campaign. AOPA is headed by Mr Dick Smith and Mr Boyd Munro who is present here in the gallery today. It is fair to say that AOPA has been in substantial conflict with the former CAA and now its successor, CASA, over a wide range of safety regulation issues. A number of those issues have already been canvassed or dealt with by the minister. This bill has emerged ultimately because of the minister's failure to shift the existing board members. It is very disturbing that in presenting his ministerial statement to the parliament yesterday the minister made completely unsubstantiated statements to the effect that the existing board members,were, 'putting their own interests ahead of aviation safety.' These are fairly strong things to say about people who are performing a community function by representing the people of this country as board members on the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. It is a pretty strong accusation to make, without any substantial evidence to back it up, accusing them of putting their own self-interests ahead of the interests of aviation safety in this country. It is something that I think the minister may well regret in the future when he reflects on it. The opposition does not object to the content of the bill. It does not see a huge difference between four and six members of the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. If you look at the range of memberships of various equivalent boards, you will see that the numbers vary quite a bit, that there is no golden or perfect number, and that both four and six members are equally acceptable. So the notion of increasing the size of the board does not attract any criticism from the opposition; it does not see that there is any optimum number for members of the board. Wednesday, 26 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2941 Equally, the opposition does not object to the notion that the two additional places should be used to place additional expertise or aviation industry background on the board. The opposition believes that such boards should have a balance between generalist expertise, such as that of some of the existing members of the board, and specialist expertise that is directly relevant to the area that is being regulated. A number of very interesting statements have been made by the minister on this issue. I think it is important to take a more sober view of the issue. For example, as I cited in the House yesterday, I doubt whether there are too many directors of BHP who grew up shovelling coal into steel furnaces or working as iron workers. I note also, as I did yesterday, that the new head of the transport department, Dr Hawke, is in fact a geneticist by trade. I think it was an excellent appointment and it illustrates that there are many positions in the hierarchy in the public sector that should have a generalist rather than a direct specialist involved in the area. In the case of the CASA board, I believe there should be a mix: some aviation specialists and some generalists. It is also important to mention, as the minister as failed to do, that one of the three members he says has no expertise in aviation does, in fact, have very directly relevant expertise in system safety, and that is Dr Claire Pollock. She studied under Professor James Reason, who has developed the methodology which is most widely acknowledged as the appropriate methodology for analysing disasters such as major airline crashes and who, I understand, headed the investigation into the Manchester plane disaster some years ago. So it is quite clear that one of those three does have directly relevant expertise. Given that the function of the CASA board is not to go out and inspect the planes or do the hands-on work of the authority-which, quite appropriately, should be done by people with the directly relevant expertise-the function of the board is to ensure that the authority fulfils its obligations under the act of parliament which governs it. That is something which, I would have thought, a judge would be fairly well qualified to do, being somebody with substantial legal expertise. That supervisory role of the board, in a general sense, is quite different from the function of actually performing the task of safety regulation and administration that the authority itself does. On the substance of the legislation, the opposition does not object to the notion of the appointment of one of the board members as the deputy chair. From time to time, having a deputy chair will be of some consequence. A quick examination of similar boards, such as that of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, indicates that most similar boards under the Commonwealth umbrella have a position of deputy chair. There is some controversy with respect to the prospect that the minister is endeavouring to create a position on the board for Dick Smith and, in doing so, to force out the existing board members by backdoor means because he is unable to do so by the front door. The second reading amendment which I hereby move is specifically designed to deal not only with that situation but also with the broader concern that the opposition has with respect to people who have a partisan position in the aviation industry being appointed to the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. The opposition does not have any objection to Dick Smith as an individual. In fact, I have not met Mr Smith, although I have had several discussions with Mr Munro of the same organisation. So far, the indications are that I would probably agree with Mr Smith and Mr Munro on one or two issues. I certainly disagree with them on a number of others. The fact is, regardless of Mr Smith's position on any of these issues and whether he is right or wrong, MC 2942 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 26 June 1996 he is a very high profile and quite controversial campaigner within the aviation industry, campaigning on issues that directly relate to CASA's jurisdiction. In my view-regardless of whether I agree lOOper cent, or disagree 100 per cent, with him on those issues-it is inappropriate for anybody who plays or has recently played such a role to be appointed to the CASA board. Somebody who has been a highly partisan political lobbyist representing a section of the industry-regardless of who that might be-should not be appointed to what is basically an umpire's position. It is perfectly reasonable to have people with a background and expertise in the industry, as I indicated before, and I think Mr Molloy is a good example of that. But I and the opposition do not believe that it is appropriate for people who have been strong campaigners and political lobbyists on issues related to CASA' s jurisdiction to be placed on the board. CAS A makes very difficult decisions and choices that affect people's lives and livelihoods. It would be inappropriate to have people on the board of CASA who have axes to grind. There is a serious risk that, if that occurs, the CASA board will tum into a battleground between competing interests in the aviation industry. This is another reason why it is appropriate to have at least some people on the board who do not come from the aviation industry itself, but have other relevant expertise. In summary, the opposition opposes any partisan advocate for any particular section of the aviation industry being represented directly on the CASA board. I should also make it clear that the opposition does not agree with the general position that Mr Smith has been associated with on what is termed 'affordable safety'. I will not repeat them today, but I will note the comments made-at pages 8,50, 73 and 75-by the coroner who investigated the Monarch crash, with respect to the 'affordable safety' philosophy and the impact that that had on the Civil Aviation Authority, as it then was. It is too early for me, as shadow minister for transport, to form conclusive views on the issue of to what extent the problems of the then Civil Aviation Authority were caused by that philosophy. In fact, it may be very difficult to form conclusive views at all, because these things are extremely complex. Certainly, the coroner's view was that that philosophy had a significant contributing impact on the Monarch crash, and I think we have to take some note of that. It is interesting that there is an inherent contradiction in the position of the minister on these issues. On one hand, he has been very strongly supportive of the agenda that Mr Smith and his organisation have put-for example, the overruling of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority on the question of electronic locater transmitters. So far, he has appeared to be very supportive, and that will be clearly evidenced if he does appoint Mr Smith to the board. On the other hand, he has taken a very strong and very vigorous position, particularly in opposition, with respect to the performance of the Civil Aviation Authority and then CASA, regarding rigorous safety enforcement. I would suggest to him that there is an inherent contradiction in those two points of view and that, at some point, that contradiction will hit home. I tum now very briefly in conclusion to the amendment that I gather has been circulated by the honourable member for Calare( Mr Andren). This is at least the third such one, I think I am correct in saying. One was from the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Campbell), but they are all on the same issue; that is, giving the minister the capacity to dismiss the existing members of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority board. This particular amendment in effect gives the minister unrestricted power to dismiss the members of the board at any time, for no reason. The existing legislation specifies reasons, such as becoming of unsound mind Wednesday, 26 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2943 or bankruptcy and the like, which are usually included for dismissal of members of boards of statutory authorities. The amendment that has been moved by the member for Calare in effect would allow the minister unfettered power to dismiss board members. The opposition does not support this amendment; firstly, because it is directly targeted at removing existing board members where, as far as the opposition can see, there is no justification for doing so, since they have not done anything wrong in the discharge of their duties; and, secondly, particularly when the minister is pursuing another avenue which allows him to influence the composition of the board by adding two members. The opposition believes that this is completely unjustified in the specific circumstances. More importantly, there is a broader principle here, and that is the whole question of the relationship between statutory authorities and the government. If you have a situation where the minister can arbitrarily dismiss board members-all of them, at any time, and for no reason-you have to question why you have a statutory authority in the first place and why, in this case, you do not simply return to the old department of transport situation where the conduct of civil aviation safety regulation is directly under ministerial control; because the net effect of having board members who are subject to instant dismissal is the same. If you apply this principle across the board to other statutory authorities, and if you do it here, you have to ask why you are not doing it elsewhere. If you apply it across the board, then you effectively negate one of the key components of the whole concept of a statutory authority which is, to some extent, to depoliticise the process that it is involved with and the obligations that it is there to discharge; to remove the political process a bit from that, without severing ultimate lines of accountability but still allowing the proper administration of that area to occur without direct day-to-day political interference. That is the whole purpose. to refer to the anticipated amendment, but it is drawing a long bow to go into the detail, so I would ask him to come back to the matter being debated. I do not mind him referring to the amendment, but it is a bit beyond the pale to go into the details of it at this stage. respect to the amendment. For the reasons associated with both the specific situation in this instance and the general principle of the damage that it would do to the structure of statutory authorities and their relationship with the government, the opposition will oppose the amendment. My final comments relate to the way the minister is dealing with the question of the current performance of the staff of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. It seems pretty clear that the staff of the former Civil Aviation Authority, several years ago, were derelict in their duty in a number of cases. You only have to read the coroner's report into the Monarch crash to see that that fairly clearly was the case. However, the minister has made a number of fairly flamboyant and rather reckless statements in recent times suggesting that this sort of conduct is continuing, that the same people are doing the same things. For example, in his statement yesterday, he said that he was concerned that the old culture still existed 'despite the change of name', that existing CAA officers felt 'somehow immune to the consequences of their own wrongdoing', and that the government would not be 'repeating the errors of the previous government in allowing that attitude to continue uncorrected.'",219,Representatives Main Committee

317,Mr Tanner,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. That is pretty much all I wish to say withMC 2944 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 26 June 1996 The disturbing conclusions that I have reached are twofold. First, continuing accusations are being levelled against existing officers, without people being named and without direct action being taken in any way against the individual officers. All of the officers are slurred as a result of that. Second, no evidence of existing contemporary failure, of the type which has been revealed to have occurred in 1993-94, has been put forward. That is the first concern. Second, there is no evidence that the minister is actually doing anything about this. If he believes that there are officers in CAS A who are derelict in their duty, then he should be doing something about it. I doubt that expanding the board by two, even on the most optimistic view, will be a mechanism for doing something about that problem, if it does exist. All he said on that front was that he would be pursuing these matters with the director. I think he owes the parliament, the people of Australia, the people in the industry, and particularly the people in the authority, some more detailed explanation as to precisely what he believes is wrong here and now, who the people involved are and what he proposes to do about it. It is very worrying that the minister continues to act as if he is the shadow minister. It is particularly worrying for the general reputation of safety regulation in this country that he is still undermining the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, still attacking it, when he is now the person responsible for it. He is no longer the shadow minister; he is the person responsible for the organisation. He needs to be a lot more careful in his statements and how he deals with these issues in the public arena, because he is now the minister. Unfortunately, I think he has yet to come to grips with that. The opposition, as I indicated, does not oppose the bill, subject to the second reading amendment which I will move and which opposes the amendment which will be moved by the member for Calare( Mr Andren). I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that: (1) it is appropriate that the Board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority should include members in areas such as the law, regulation and general systems safety, as well as members with specific expertise in aviation; and (2) no person should be appointed to the Board who has engaged recently in political lobbying or public advocacy on aviation safety issues on behalf of any company or interest group involved in the aviation industry"".

A number were employed in the control tower and a number were employed in maintenance to keep the airstrip in good working order.

Where we had 68 employees at the Mount Isa airport, we now have two employees and one contractor. So if you are landing in Mount Isa, just hope and pray that nothing goes wrong because the nearest fire brigade tender is some 10 kilometres away, in the centre of the city. It might be more than 10 kilometres-I do not know how far it is. But it is a long way away. So if something goes wrong, say your prayers. In Mount Isa you just suffer, while people who are rich and want to go overseas have the magnificent $300 million terminal to enjoy. Overseas tourists are provided with that $300 million terminal.

On another occasion there had been some bad navigation by a pilot. He was an experienced pilot, too, I might add. He missed where he should have been by nearly 150 kilometres. When you are starting to run low on fuel, when you have got absolutely no idea where you are and it is the middle of the night, it is a very dangerous situation. But, as luck would have it, we were close to a town, I was able to recognise what that town was, and we were able to find our way back again to civilisation. But finding a little township, as we did on that occasion, is not very helpful. Landing in the main street at night would be extremely dangerous. But, if we had some system, or some device to switch on, whereby we knew where the airstrip was at these little towns, that would be of enormous benefit. In this case we were not close to a town where we could have switched on landing lights, but we were not far away. We were only about 40 kilometres away from a town where we could have switched on landing lights and found our way. But, at night, you have got nothing much that you can hold on to if you have not got the homing beacons. There is another issue which is vitally important in the area of civil aviation. If you read the Australian constitution, you will find that aviation is one of the heads of power which is the responsibility of the federal government. All of the airstrips in the electorate of Kennedyevery single airport, with one exception, I think-are imposed upon the local authority. There is nothing in the constitution about local authorities running airports or aviation; but again we had the economic rationalists and a really vicious decision by the then federal government of Mr Hawke forcing these local authorities to take on these airstrips. The federal government said, 'We are pulling out. We are not going to put a single cent into these airstrips forever. So it is upon your head.' I argued very strongly in the Queensland cabinet that the Queensland government ought to tell the federal government to go to hell and, if any accidents occurred, it would be upon the head of the federal government. The federal government has had the responsibility of looking after this area placed upon it by the people of Australia. Some people may say, 'With economic rationalism and user pays, if you cannot pay your way out there, do not live out there.' Mr Deputy Speaker, they have put that proposition to us, and the net result of it has been that people out there have said, 'All right; we cannot live out here. We are moving.' Thirty-nine per cent of people in western Queensland have moved over the last 25 years, and they are running away just about as fast as their feet can carry them, thanks to the user-pays principle and the principles of the economic rationalists. But, unfortunately, they are taking with them the wealth of this nation. This nation's biggest export earning item in 1988 was wool, as it was for the 10 years prior to that-or neck and neck with coal, as it has been for all of our history. Half of our sheep herd has gone, and the numbers are falling dramatically right at this very moment. The cattle herd-the fifth biggest export earning item for this nation-is falling over. The difficulties placed upon the mining industry by the Native Title Act that has been legislated into existence by this place, and the enormous power given to the extreme element of the green movement in Australia, have dealt death blows to the mining industry as well. Because of the fringe benefits tax and because of the user-pays principle, there are very many things now in these areas that we are doing without. Let me come back to Mount Isa for one brief moment, because they are discussing industrial relations in the other place. Because of the fringe benefits tax and because of the government's policy of having high interest rates and a high Australian dollar, Mount Isa Mines has suffered enormous pain. The net result of that is that we lost our fly-ins. One of the great advantages of working in Mount Isa was having your annual free holiday to Brisbane. Even though many people would consider Mount MC 2948 MAIN COMMITfEE Wednesday, 26 June 1996 Isa a hostile living environment, I would not. It is my home. I love it, of course, and I enjoy it out there. But most people would say that living there is very difficult. So, when they lost the annual holiday flights, there was very strong persuasion and pressure put upon the residents of Mount Isa to simply leave. The population of Mount Isa has dropped from 30,000 to 20,000. Whether it is in the field of mining, which used to whip along at about six per cent growth per year and has now dropped down to about 0.6 per cent growth per year-most certainly under one per cent-or whether it is in the field of agriculture, which is down from about three per cent annual growth to about 0.2 per cent annual growth over the last four years, you can see that people are moving out. In real terms, these industries are declining. The last time. I looked, I found that 93 per cent of the nation's entire export earnings comes from these industries. But if you remove the services irom these areas you will deal body blows to these industries. I could stand here all day and argue, if you want to go into true economic rationalism. If we really were fair dinkum about figuring out what was paying for itself and what was not, we would close down Sydney and move the population out to the Mount Isas, the Longreaches and the Hughendens. If you were being fair dinkum about economic rationalism obviously the only places where this country is internationally competitive is in those fields. Our export earnings indicate quite clearly that 93 per cent of our income comes from those areas. I come here today with a great deal of bitterness. When I land in Mount IsaI know thatlike all of my fellow citizens in an area where my own family have lived for over 100 yearswe live in very great jeopardy. My grandaddy was one of the original 26 investors in Qantas. The reason they invested in Qantas was-and here I want to refer to Reverend Flynn who founded the Royal Flying Doctor Service-to bring a mantle of safety to the outback. Again, my grandaddy helped the Royal Flying Doctor Service greatly and was a great admirer of Dr Flynn. Every day that goes by the economic rationalists are removing that mantle of safety. value, and native title and fringe benefits tax, we might profit from some discussion of the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill, which is before the House. That bill provides for the expansion of the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority by adding two non-executive members and empowering the minister to appoint a member as deputy chairperson. As the opposition spokesman, the member for Melbourne ( Mr Tanner) indicated, he is not opposing the bill, but he has moved an amendment arising from our concerns about the nature of those who should be on the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. We would again invite the minister, as we have done before, to give an undertaking that he will not appoint anyone who is an active political lobbyist on behalf of one section of the aviation community. We make the point that aviation has numerous factions and interests which are often in intense disagreement on major industrial issues, including safety regulation. If the board is to be a battleground for competing interests within the industry, I believe that the consequences for the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and aviation safety could be disastrous. We have noted that the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association has been waging a bitter battle against the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, and that its position has essentially been partisan in relation to all this. We have some concerns about that position being given undue authority.",226,Representatives Main Committee

326,Mr Katter,"They are the people involved. They are the people whose lives are at risk!Wednesday, 26 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2949 go on to describesilence. He will do the House and the other speaker the courtesy of doing the same. the point of view of the recent inquiry into civil aviation safety, Plane safe, produced by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure as recently as December of last year. That was an inquiry into aviation safety in the commuter and general aviation sectors. ThenI want to look at this subject from the point of view of a member of parliament responsible for the safety of constituents adjacent to an airport, the Essendon airport. If we look at the inquiry into aviation safety, we can see that the report has discussed the concept of affordable safety. The committee has expressed some concerns about that concept which I would endorse. My own view is that it is a very dangerous concept because it is a euphemism for market forces and deregulation which, in an area of safety standards, simply will not work. The committee at paragraph 2.50 suggested that the concept of affordable safety which was popularised by Dick Smith had within it the concept of accountability to the aviation industry and that that approach could indeed be an explanation for some of the shortcomings of the then Civil Aviation Authority in the performance of its duties. It went on further to say that the Civil Aviation Authority was never captured by the aviation industry; on the contrary, the regulator offered itself as a willing captive. It went on to note submissions it had received that safety standards may well have been reduced. Arising out of this concept of affordable safety, you had Alan Terrell giving the opinion that safety standards had been reduced as a result of deregulation, devolution and delegation to industry commercialisation. He expressed the view that the safety position in general aviation may already be below an acceptable level if the insurance statistics showing a 40 per cent increase in general aviation claims between the early 1990s and the late 1980s could be translated into operational events. You had the submission from the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association indicating that, in their view, safety standards had fallen disastrously. The committee went on to disregard the evidence given by Dick Smith because they pointed out that he had included balloon fatalities and excluded crew fatalities, which seemed quite extraordinary. They went on to conclude that there was some hard evidence of a decline in safety in the area of charter operations, although they said there was no hard evidence to show a deterioration of safety in other sectors of general aviation. They also made some points about the possibility of competition within the industry leading to lower safety standards. In chapter 5 they referred to destructive competition. The Industry Commission noted that greater competition might provide an incentive for some operators not to fully comply with safety requirements and that there may be a case for strengthening enforcement procedures. The committee concluded that some preconditions existed for avoiding essential maintenance which endangered safety. They proposed a couple of steps to try and address what they described as destructive competition: the publication of serious deficiency reports and special surveillance of charter operators concerning their business background, aircrew skills and aircraft conditions.",228,Representatives Main Commitfee

329,Mr Kelvin Thomson,"I want to consider the issues of civil aviation safety firstly fromMC 2950 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 26 June 1996 Chapter7 of this inquiry into aviation safety dealt with the issue of bogus parts. A senior airworthiness inspector with the Civil Aviation Authority indicated to the committee that the use of bogus parts was entrenched and a well-known feature of the industry, and that the Bureau of Air Safety Investigations had data that in the last 10 years there had been three cases where bogus parts were clearly a factor in aviation incidents. There was some concern expressed within the committee on the issue of bogus parts. The committee also expressed a view about emergency locater transmitters and said that those transmitters might be phased in. Since charter operators carry more people than other areas of general aviation, the committee therefore said that emergency locater transmitters perhaps could be installed in these aircraft first because the benefits of installing them were likely to be larger. We have that background of concern about aviation safety being expressed by the House of Representatives standing committee. It is also the case for people in the electorate that I represent, the electorate of Wills, that there is considerable concern about the aviation safety standards applying at Essendon Airport. Most recently, we have had a report released on the December 1993 crash of a 1948 Dove aircraft, from the Essendon Airport, into five houses in Gilbertson Street, Essendon. My concern is that this long-awaited report has failed to pursue recommendations which would guarantee that such a crash would not recur. The report identifies the failure of the Dove's right engine, caused by failure of that engine's fuel control unit pumps, as the key cause of the crash. But its interim recommendation that all such fuel control unit pumps be inspected was rejected by the Civil Aviation Authority. The bureau meekly accepted this. I would say that the Civil Aviation Authority's justifications for rejecting that recommendation were simply not good enough. They said, in the first place, that the cause of the fuel pump failure had not been adequately determined. That, in my view, is all the more reason for checking pumps in other planes. Their second justification for not implementing this recommendation was the 'operational and financial burden on Australian DH-104 operators'. In my view, that surely must not be allowed to override the safety of aircraft travellers and those who live near airports. It is an expression of that concept of 'affordable safety' which I referred to earlier and which I think is absolutely unacceptable. The other thing the report does is identify the failure of the landing gear to retract when the pilot first selected it as a key reason that the plane was unable to fly with its remaining engine. It was a twin-engine plane, so one engine failed and it was not able to fly with the other engine because the landing gear did not retract first time around. The report went on to state: periodic checking of the adjustment of the landing gear selection system is therefore a critical practice that was not addressed in the systems of scheduled maintenance. Yet the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation made no recommendation for landing gear maintenance to include this check. You would expect that a crash of this seriousness would at least lead to changes designed to prevent a recurrence. But, instead of receiving recommendations to address these problems, residents living around Essendon Airport are told that they are going to have to live with a lower safety standard than applies at, for example, Tullamarine. The report states: if light aircraft are to be operated in a realistic manner, a level of safety lower than that present in large aircraft must be tolerated. Wednesday, 26 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2951 It also says: During take off there is an accepted risk period within which, should an engine failure occur, an accident might result. That period is up to 25 seconds. If that is the case, clearly the area of Essendon, which is completely surrounded by housing, is hardly the place for these risks. My view is that the situation is particularly serious concerning charter aircraft, because, as the report indicates: No guarantees are provided regarding their ability to fly with one engine inoperative. The Certificate of Airworthiness simply doesn't require it. If that is to continue to be the case, we should certainly not have charter flights operating out of Essendon. On that count I, and the electorate that I represent, express considerable concern about safety standards. I express some concern because the minister-who, as a shadow minister, had a lot to say about aviation safety, much of which was of interest to me, representing the electorate that I do-has a mandate to improve safety standards, not a mandate to allow safety standards to slip. I would raise some concern at the decision that the minister took, going back a couple of weeks, to override the Civil Aviation Safety Authority on the emergency locater transmitter issue. This was only a first issue and a first step, I guess. Nevertheless, it is not a happy precedent that the minister has chosen to ignore the view of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and to impose his own position on that issue. I express some concern about that. I note that the minister made a lot out of safety issues when he was in opposition, with the Monarch crash and so on. These are important issues, and I used to share some of his concerns, because it was certainly my view that the Federal Airports Corporation and the management at Essendon Airport had always had a 'she'll be right, mate' attitude and were forever playing down issues of aviation safety, and that they were not up-front with me. I remember that, when the de Havilland Dove crashed in December 1993, I and everyone else who visited the site on that night thought, 'That's it, then. The airport will surely close now; but look at the terrible cost in terms of the damage that it has done.' I and others were amazed when the aviation authorities commenced glossing over this incident. And this is still happening. We had the owner-operator and pilot of that plane, Mr Rudge, writing to a local paper and saying that the inquiry showed that he was not to blame. I just wonder what he thinks happened: that the plane fell out of the sky by itself? We had a school of criminologists in the 1970s who used to say that society was to blame. So you may wonder whether Mr Rudge thinks that society is to blame for the crash. Even as recently as Saturday 15 June, just a week and a bit ago, we had eyewitness accounts of another near miss at Essendon Airport. Once again, the aviation authority was saying, 'Oh, this wasn't too bad.' The spokeswoman for Airservices Australia was reported as saying that a Beechcraft Skipper was flying south on its final approach to runway 17 when a Piper Cherokee approached from the east. The Cherokee pilot had been instructed by the control tower to follow the Skipper. She said: There was a student pilot in the Cherokee who turned on to the base leg without allowing enough distance to follow the Skipper. MC 2952 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 26 June 1996 The Skipper then had to make a go-around and he would have pulled out of the situation to allow the aircraft that was supposed to let him in to land first. According to eye witnesses, it was quite a serious incident, which occurred directly above de Havilland Avenue in Strathmore. It is most unsatisfactory from the point of view of local residents to have the procession of accidents and incidents that we have had at Essendon Airport and to have, once again, this being fobbed off by aviation authorities. We even have the situation where there is a fresh proposal for pilot training at Essendon Airport, with a proposal to establish a pilot training scheme for overseas pilots. Yet the near miss which occurred just a week and a half ago arose in relation to a trainee pilot, and it certainly heightens the case against the pilot school being established there. In conclusion, the mandate of the transport minister is to improve air safety in this country. It will not happen by kowtowing to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. It will not happen by going with the concept of affordable safety, which is a pseudonym for market forces and the absence of the necessary regulation 'of safety standards. It will not happen by appointing, for example, Dick Smith to the board. These sorts of things would greatly concern both the opposition and people in my electorate.
