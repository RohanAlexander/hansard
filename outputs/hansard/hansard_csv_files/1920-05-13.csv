Read, and ordered to be printed. i a question asked by mc, the Minister for the Navy said that it was the endeavour of his Department to let the wholesale -coal merchants liave as much coal as possible. I do no.t doubt that; but I remind him that at the present time there is probably not 1 cwt; of coal in many large districts. A firm which last May supplied 600 tons of coal to householders, has now only 20 tons of coal with which to furnish three of the largest depots. Is it not possible to give the people some relief? Winter is nearly on us, and if they cannot got coal very soon it will not be of much use to.them. regret these troubles, but they are inseparable from the circumstances in which we are placed. We have not got coal enough to go round, and therefore we cannot make it go round. The Coal Board consists of practical men who know the requirements of the public as few others can. The Navy is not controlling the distribution of coal, notwithstanding a statement in the newspapers criticising its management. Coal Board in any way. of the Coal Board are business men of the highest typo, the Chairman being the President of the Economy Commission. They are doing their best with a difficult situation. I am inquiring whether steps cannot be taken to entirely divest the Navy Board of all responsibility in this matter. Now that the Commonwealth control of shipping has ended, there seems to be no Teason why the Commonwealth should concern itself with the distribution of coal within a State, that being rather the function of the State authorities. My feeling is that we should let the State Governments look after this, matter. to fall between two stools, and get no co&l &t fill the people of Victoria are prevented from, getting coal because of the Commonwealth' control of distribution; hut I think that when our control has ceased, it will nothe any easier to get coal.

I shall make a more considered statement in the course of a day or two in regard to the whole subject. We shall be very glad to help the States, but I do not see why we should continue to take the sole responsibility for the distribution of the coal within the. States now that the shipping control has been released. I shall bring these matters under the notice of the Coal Board, and I hope sincerely that relief may soon be given. I know what it is to be pinched for firing in winter. ened shortage of wheat in the coming season, will the Government take steps to prevent its export, so as to obviate the soaring of prices next season? call the circumstances as detailed at the last meeting of the Wheat Board, the facts are that 'there is comparatively little, if any, wheat available for export. An arrangement has been made with the Government of New South Wales to supply the shortage there, which is very considerable, and the shortage in Queensland, which, while ""perhaps not quite so acute, is also considerable. That leaves the body which has control of the whole of the wheat supply in Australia with little or no surplus. I think that is the position, but the honourable member for Echuca( Mr Hill) will perhaps be able to correct me if I am wrong. we are not endeavouring to get rid of it .

It is unfortunately true that a considerable number of persons in Australia who live on what may be termed a fixed wage have been most hardly hit by the depreciation in the value of money, and, since we expect, very properly, that our public servants, in seeking for redress, shall not have recourse to strikes or other methods opposed to the law, it is only right that this Parliament should see to it that their salaries are adequate. I appreciate the motive of the honourable member's question. I am in sympathy with the object he has in view, and shall do everything in my power to give the Parliament an early opportunity of dealing with the whole question. ister state whether the promoters of the Oil Refinery Company submitted to the Government any figures showing the approximate cost of the establishment of a refinery in Australia, the expected production of refined oil, and the anticipated profits on the sale and distribution of that oil?

If the honourable member will let me know exactly what he proposes, and what is being done in New South Wales, I shall 'be glad to consider the matter. March last that there was some £23,000,000 owing to the British Government for which bonds had not been issued, and that immediate payment of a sum of £9,000,000, paid out by the British Government, was asked for, though it was not easy to meet the demand. In view of the statement which the Prime Minister made at the Commonwealth Bank in New South Wales, that we.had something like £100,000,000 surplus credits in England-includin g some £40,000,000 in one lump already owing, and immediate credits authorized and accruing in the next few months on the extra wool sales, and so forth-is there any way to meet those obligations out of the surplus credits, and, if so, what necessity was there to send a representative to meet obligations which we had money to meet? ber's question no doubt relates to a very important matter, and he has put it in a very simple and unintelligible way.

51,Mr Rodgers (Wannon) [3.0],"I redependent we were on British shipping, and the supremacy of the British Navy to see us through our difficulties. could only carry on an overseas trade to the extent that Great Britain was able to make shipping available for us. war struck us also in a year of drought, when we were compelled to import fodder and grain from America, which was done by an arrangement effected by the State Governments. Commonwealth Government had taken the supreme power in this Parliament to do anything necessary to control the whole of the resources of the Commonwealth for the prosecution of the war. The year of drought was followed by a record harvest of 162,224,000 bushels of wheat, which had never before or has never since been approached; but by this time, as the shipping difficulty had become very acute, the Commonwealth Government put forward proposals for the exclusive control of shipping. Later on there was a collaboration between the Federal Government and the Governments of the wheat-producing States, which ultimately formed the nucleus of the present Wheat Pool, and became the basis upon which the whole of our Australian products have been controlled. standing figures in that movement were the then Minister for Agriculture in Victoria, the Hon. Pred Hagelthorn, and the present Prime Minister( Mr Hughes). Following upon the formation of this Pool, the Prime Minister called .upon the agents who had previously controlled the purchase, shipment, and sale abroad of Australian wheat to give up their private operations and devote their experience and organization to the task of enabling the Commonwealth Government to operate the newly formed Pool with success.. mously came to our aid. Without their experience it would have been absolutely impossible, at that stag;©, for any of the Australian Governments to carry on such a Pool, and I think that the country must not be altogether unmindful of, and ought to generously acknowledge, the fact that they surrendered their businesses in a truly r i g h t f u l spirit, and came to the aid of the Commonwealth Government, devoting the best of their brains and their services to the necessities of the Commonwealth and the States. So far the Australian Wheat Pool has controlled five harvests, the total amount Mr Rodgers. of wheat handled being 503,216,000 bushels, or, in round figures, 13,500,000 We tons. There has been distributed from the Pool £100,000,000. I ts operations have been twofold in character; first, to provide The for the whole of the requirements of Australia, and then to market and sell the surplus overseas. Australia's home consumption is 31,200,000 bushels of wheat. To have collective handling, selling, and Meanwhile the management of its wheat was a novel experience for Australia; but, regarding it as something which the emergencies of the war rendered necessary, I think that, on the whole, it was an excellent conception on the part of the two gentlemen primarily responsible for it . I regret that 'one of them, the Hon. Fred Hagelthorn, has been turned out of public life in this country. No man gave his best to the services of his fellows more generously than did he, who was the central figure in the foundation of the Australian Wheat Pool. I knew him very well many years ago. He comes from the district in which I live. I know that he gave thoroughly bond fide service to the country in this matter. He kept politics out of it , and put his best into the The two outwork as a good Australian. A t this stage, eighteen months after the signing of the armistice, we have to consider our future policy. I quite agree with the honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill ) that it is of the utmost i m portance to the farming, commercial, and financial communities that they should know at once the policy of the Government with regard to the future control of Australian wheat. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse) gave us a statement the other day as to the parities on the other side of the world, but made These agents very magnanino reference to the quantities of wheat raised in other countries, and in order that tlie matter may be viewed in its proper perspective, I desire to place on record the average production for five years of the chief wheat-growing countries of the world. They are as follow:Russia, 817,000,000 bushels. United States of America, 685,000,000 bushels. India, 350,000,000 bushels. France, 317.000,000 bushels. Austria-Hungary, 232,000,000 bushels. Canada, 197,000,000 bushels. Italy, 188,000,000 bushels. Germany, 152,000,000 bushels. Argentina, 148,000,000 bushels. Australia, 91,000,000 bushels. If Russia recovers her soul and undertakes the development of her wheat belts she can supply as much wheat as all the other countries combined. Russia is the great factor in wheat production. That country and the United States of America, between. them, produce nearly half of the world's wheat supply. I come now to the point in which the wheat-growers are vitally concerned. What are the proposals for the future marketing of wheat? I do not necessarily mean the proposals of the present Government, because, primarily, this is not a function of the Commonwealth Government. The Wheat Pool was a war activity, well conceived and well controlled, although there may have been defects in administrative details. Rut taking it by and large the great Australian 503,216,000 bushels, and distributing approximately £100,000,000, has done a mighty service to this country. It was our paramount duty to keep the industries of the country going in spite of the war. We had no precedent in history to guide us as to the control of primary products in time of war without shipping, and those who make administrative details a ground for the condemnation, of individuals or Governments do .not look at a big question in a true light. I can see only three reasons why the Government should have anything further to do with the Australian Wheat Pool-(1 ) the condition of the world's shipping; (2) the announcement by the Imperial Government of their intention to handle wheat for a further year; and (3) the obligations which the Commonwealth and States have entered into in regard to guaranteeing the next harvest. The question of guarantees which has been twice asked by the honourable member for Calare( Mr Lavelle) is of no consequence to the Australian grower to-day. The world's price to-day is a sufficient inducement to any farmer to grow wheat night, and day. What, the guarantee may be is practically beside the question. Wheat is worth 12s. 6d. f.o.b., as a minimum for supply to the islands and ships' holds, and if it could be sold to other countries it would be worth more. Therefore, the question of existing guarantees, or of the guarantee given by the State Government of New South Wales, is of no importance. The latter, in my judgment, will not be as good a stimulus as is the world's parity. The guarantee given by the Commonwealth is the only factor that compels it to remain in the Wheat Pool. In time of peace the handling of agriculture is primarily the responsibility of the States, and the Commonwealth Government, therefore, would be well advised to drop out of the management of the Australian Wheat Pool. is advocating the middleman's cause. sort of cheap nonsense from the honourable member. I have no interest in this coontry except in land. I have not a brass farthine invested in any business in Australia. Wlhy, then, should I be interested in the middleman? Cheap clap-trap, like the interjection which came from Wheat Pool, handling the honourable member, has won for some men in this House a recognition that otherwise they would never have got. I come now to one phase of the question in which the honourable member for Echuca( Mr Hill) is interested. He stated in the House a few days ago that the Prime Minister had been responsible for the sale of a large quantity of Australian wheat without any authority from the Board, and at an unauthorized price. The answer of the Prime Minister spoke for itself, but there is a very sharp and serious conflict between the testimonies of the two gentlemen, and the farmers will not be content to allow the facts to remain in dispute in that way. The Prime Minister made a clear and definite statement, and appeai*ed to have the records of the Wheat Pool to justify his defence, but this is a matter which the two honourable gentlemen must thresh out between them. The honourable member for Echuca charged the Prime Minister with having made a 'bargain that represented a loss to the Australian wheat-grower of many millions of pounds. I pointed out the other day that he himself ( MrH ill ) was a party to a bargain for the sale of the home requirements of wheat at 7s. 8d. per bushel. In round figures the annual home consumption is 31,200,000 bushels. Eleven months of the year had to be provided for, representing approximately 28,000,000 bushels. The Prime Minister said that had the honourable member fos Echuca been content to wait until the Wheat Board had ascertained what the world's parity was at that time, the Australian wheat-grower could have obtained",22,Adjournment Formal Marketing Of Oversea Products
52,Mr Prowse,The honourable member,24,Adjournment Formal Marketing Of Oversea Products
53,Mr Rodgers,"I do not want thatthat parity. The world's parity was found hy cable to be Ss. 4jfd. f.o.b., and the differthere is a loss of £7,000,000. What right ence between that and the fixed price of 7s. 8d., after allowing penses f.o.b., represented a loss to the Australian producer through the Board's arrangement by refusing the Prime Minister's offer of, roughly, £933,000. No authority had been given to the farmers' representatives on the Wheat Board to sell wheat for twelve months at any price below the world's parity. to-day is 12s. 6d. per bushel, so that on the home consumption of 28,000,000 bushels for the eleven months the primary producers sustained a loss of £7,000,000. When, it is not necessary to continue the Australian Wheat Board, why should anybody desire to retain coutrol ox the farmers' business? proposals in regard to the future have not yet been announced. Some farmers have submitted a proposal to the Prime Minister which the honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse) in supporting it described as a proposal for a "" voluntary compulsory pool."" pool is to be voluntary for those who want it, and compulsory for those who do not. To-day, when the war is over, are Ave to continue a policy that will abrogate the principle of private contract, and destroy the right of private property in goods, so that those goods may be made the subject of pool handling against the will of those who own them ? 1 The statement has recently been made in Great Britain (by the Financial Secretary that that country made a profit of £150,000,000 out of Australian primary products, apart from wool, and I think that the Australian producer to-day feels that the sooner he can get control of his own business the better. I do not blame any individual member of the Government, nor any individual member of the Australian Wheat Board, for what has happened. No one can he a prophet in these days. When the Prime Minister sold our wheat to the British Government, I thought that the transaction was an excellent one, and I thought the same thing of the arrangement for the sale of our wool. At the time the co'ntracts were excellent. Echuca( Mr Hill) thought that hy selling our wheat at 7s. 8d. he was doing a good thing for the Australian farmers. Mr Rodgers. has any one to gamble with the property for the exof other persons? Dealing in wheat has always been pure gambling. In ordinary times, about the month of August, the buyers a'nd exporters of wheat. start to "" spec "" charter vessels, and to "" spec"" in wheat, the object being to so organize the shipping of the world as to get it to our ports just when the wheat arrives That parity there from the harvest fields. Is any one prepared to-day to say what will he the price of our coming wheat crop in the world's markets? The whole business of wheat dealing is highly technical, and success in it comes only with perfect world-wide shipping arrangements and a thorough knowledge of conditions. Did The Government I think a compulsory pool in the interests of the farmers, I would give the proposal the fullest consideration; but in their zeal for co-operation some men are advancing to the very threshold of Socialism. They seek to use the organization of the Government and its financial reThe term is an apt one. The sources for the handling of the wheat, but the experiment is a dangerous one, because, while this Government may have at heart the welfare of the producer, tomorrow there may be in power another Government which will think more of some other section of the community, and will operate the Pool in a manner that will not benefit the producer. I come now to the Wool Pool. When war broke out, the Government called to its aid the best brains in Australia having the necessary technical knowledge, to help it in handling the Australian wool clip, and we are under a debt of gratitude to those who for so long have voluntarily served as members of the Central Wool Committee. That 'Committee handled two-thirds of the 1915-16 clip, and it has handled the four following clips. Altogether, it has dealt with 6,851,485 bales of wool, and has distributed to our growers £150,000,000. The members of the Committee have made no charge for their services and experience, and the wool-growers and the community generally should be grateful to them. The honourable member for The Committee's work will terminate 'on the 30th June next, and it has been estimated that before that time another 200,000 bales of wool will be appraised and handled. When the wool control has",24,Adjournment Formal Marketing Of Oversea Products

Yesterday, I asked a question without notice, to which I received a captious answer from the Prime Minister.

I cannot coneeive of any honourable member objecting to such organization on the part of the farmers. AVe are in an era of organization. We find the merchants in their various linos of trade organized to protect their own interests. The workers are also organized for the same purpose. Why should not the producers organize to protect their interests? ber suggested that when we got away from the Pool, for which we have paid, we should return to the old channels.

They have done legitimate business, but they are, nevertheless, middlemen, and middlemen, we have been told, are parasites. If we did without the parasites we should be able to reach the consumer with our products far more cheaply than before. I do not use the term offensively. I think the Prime Minister has used it more than once. ber speak of Pharisees? "" Pharisees"" might be applied in other directions. We feel that there can be no reasonable objection to our proposal unless this parasitical influence is to outweigh us and prevail with the House. What we are asking is that when the farmers themselves agree to pool their interests legal sanction shall be given to the scheme. Our desire is that the farmers shall control their own interests, while at the same time protecting the food interests of the Commonwealth. necessary if the farmers can be got together. parasites who will try to bring influence to bear, and from what I have heard to-day they will succeed in some directions. In Western Australia we require butter from this State; New South Wales and Queensland need chaff from Western Australia; and Victoria and several other States require coal from New South Wales. The devising of some means for this necessary interchange of commodities between the several States is all important, and should receive the first attention of the House. I have asked on previous occasions that something should be done in this direction, and have been told, of course, that "" the matter is being looked into."" I recognise the difficulty in the way of ""obtaining the requisite shipping. The honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) today asked the Prime Minister to arrange for the utilization of Commonwealth steamers in carrying coal to the several States, and the right honourable gentleman promised to look into that matter.

There will he further opportunity to deal with this subject after the referentive efforts should be tested side by side dum of the farmers of Australia has been taken. By that vote we shall ascertain what is the intention of the farmers with regard to their products, and pending their decision I shall say no more on the subject. [3.42] -I . do not intend to occupy the attention of the House for many minutes, since I should like to have from the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) a pronouncement in regard to the wheat question, and also with regard to wool, if he is in a position to enlighten us on the .subject to-day. Under existing conditions, I should be well pleased if we could at once get back into the old channels. The Prime Minister has given the wheat farmers a guarantee, 'but the situation to-day is such that it matters very little whether our wheat is pooled or not. We are in the happy position that our wheat is wanted, and wanted at a big price, by otber countries, and I hope that the price, when obtained, will go into the pockets of the wheat-growers themselves. I am not going to speak for South Australia, because at this juncture the State Government should speak for its own people. I desire, however, to tell the honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse) that his views with regard to co-operation are by no means approved in South Australia. I cannot understand why honourable members of the Country party, who believe in freedom, of contract, and recognise that efficient handling is necessary to bring about economy, should advocate compulsory co-operation, which would cut off all the spurs of private enterprise, by which alone the value of co-operation can be tested. In South Australia we have a farmers' organization that handles more than one-half of the wheat 'grown in that State in normal times. It is a magnificent co-operative organization, but I would not give two straws for it if it were compulsory that all wheat should be handled by it. That would be no better than Government control. impetus would be given to good work, and the organization would drift into a lethargic state, to the detriment of the farmers. I speak with thirty-five years' experience of this matter, and while I approve of the organization of farmers, I contend that the value of such co-operawith private. enterprise. made optional during the war? my honourable friend were a little more logical, because I have not the time to set him right. In South Australia we have had a very painful experience of the handling of the grain of the country by amateurs. That experience has not been confined to my State. The handling of the wheat of Victoria has been better than that of any other State, because the management has been in the hands of, not a farmer, but a big business man with a good grip of big things. It is due to that reason that Victorian wheat scrip has been worth a great deal more than the wheat scrip of the other States. The honourable member for Swan has talked in a child-like and simple way about the middleman. We should not forget that in speaking .about the middlemen we are talking about private enterprise, which has made this country, and the Empire as a whole, what it is to-day. In South Australia the much-abused middlemen-abuse d by simpletons who do not think-hav e throughout set the price of wheat, even against our own farmers' organization. If this compulsory wheat pool which honourable members of the Country party advocate-if this stupid thing without any reason behind it-were brought into existence, men with brains would give up wheat-growing. They would not be prepared to grow wheat to be handled by amateurs who know nothing about the business. Wheat is the most risky and most difficult of all products to handle. Experience has taught us that. in regard to banking, but the Commonwealth Bank has been a success. my honourable friend would compare like with like. friend thinks that, after -all, this is a conflict between two sets of middlemen. cannot reckon up my honourable friends of the Country party.",27,Adjournment Formal Marketing Of Oversea Products

I do not propose for one moment to resurrect the debate-un happily, I was unable to take part in it in which the honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill ) lasb Friday discussed the question of the Wheat Pool. I am content to let my work in connection with the Wheat Pool speak for itself. look back on the five years or so in which I was connected with the Wheat Board with mixed feelings. Pool did great work. I am equally sure that it involved very strenuous labour. I want no more of it . If this table were piled to the ceiling with jewels precious beyond price, and I were asked to do that work agam for five years for those jewels, I would not do it . So far as I am concerned, then, the position is vacant. Applicants who clamour for selection need fear no rivalry from me. When members rise in this House and say they think that the Government, now the war is over, should no longer control these pools, I am very heartily in accord w it h them. No t only because my reason prompts me in that direction, but also . because I know very well that if the Government has anything to do with the business, I shall be given the job-and I am mot going to take it . Honourable members talk about managing the wheat business either by co-operative or other means, as if it was the simplest thing in the world. They talk as if men capable of running this great wheat business of Australia, or any other great businesses, -were p l e n t if u l; and men who, although they have failed dismally in transactions one-millionth part of its magnitude, push themselves forward with perfect assurance. this country think that in that way lies We can reckon you up. salvation, the case is simple; all that has My honto be done is to convert those concerned to that opinion; let them place the business in such hands, and put up w i th the consequences. I have been censured because I would not compel the farmers to put their wheat into the hands of men who said they were more competent to manage the farmers' business than were the farmers themselves. If there is to be compulsion, it can only be compulsion exercised by those constitutional authorities whioh the people have deliberately elected to represent them; and as, by general consent, it is agreed that this is undesirable, the matter settles itself, for I , at any rate, w ill be mo party to compelling men to hand over their own businesses to the hands of other men. It appears to me that there is only one of two courses-indeed , there is only one course-open . If those concerned believe in co-operation-as certainly I I do-le t tihem convert their people. There are many virtues in co-operation, but I do not quite understand what is meant I am sure the by a "" voluntary compulsory "" pool. I remember on one occasion going down to a wharf in. Sydney and seeing a gentleman fished out of the water with a boathook. I said to one of my friends in the union, "" H o w did he get into the water, B ill ? "" and B ill replied, ""We put him tjhere because he would not j o in the b union."" In fact, what the growers say to me is, "" They will not come into our co-operative society-yo u jolly well make 'em."" I am not going to do that. I must not be held for one moment to censure tho6e who say that the co-operative movement is the way in which bhe farmers can best find salvation. I believe that it is, and I am ready, as a citizen, as well as PrimeM i nister, toadvocate co-operation along with any man in the country. But I will not compel people to co-operate. I will show that co-operation will pay them, and that the middleman is no friend of theirs, and cannot be; I will show all that, but I w ill not by law compel people to j o in a co-operative union. NowI wish to say a word, as to the marketing of our products. My honourable friend, the member for Wakefield ( Mr Richard Foster) as well as the honourable member for Wannon( MrI f the farmers of Rodgers), though in different degrees, express the same doubt as to the possibility",28,Adjournment Formal Marketing Of Oversea Products
82,Mr Hill,,29,Adjournment Formal Marketing Of Oversea Products
83,Mr Richardfoster,,29,Adjournment Formal Marketing Of Oversea Products
84,Mr Hughes (Bendigo,"Prime M i nof marketing our products. Now, there are grave reasons for the doubt that disturbs their minds-grav e reasons. It is true, as both those honourable gentlemen said, that, while wheat is now, say, 12s. 6d. f.o.b., there is ample inducement to the grower. Buti t is one thing to grow wheat, and another thing to get it to the place where it can be sold. ""When we speak of affairs resuming their normal channels-goin g back to pre-war conditions-w e overlook completely the fact that tbe world is still in convulsions, that for all practical purposes-and this applies to wool as well as to wheat-ther e are only one or two effective buyers; that is to say, only one or two buyers who have money. I ask the wool and wheat growers of Australia, as sensible, hardheaded, business men, whether they would go to a market where there was only one buyer. If they do, what must be the result? There is division of opinion as to the best way to market wool. I feel very strongly that tlie future of Australiaindeed, the present welfare of Australia depends on the wheat and wool-grower getting the f u l l market price for their products. RecentlyI ventured to give my advice, for what it was worth, to the representatives of the wool-growers. made it perfectly clear that it was only advice-that it was my own opinion-and that if they rejected it there was an end of the matter. My suggestions did not depend on compulsion, they had nothing to do with compulsion. Speaking now, after having had something like a fortnight to consider still further the matter, and having had the advantage of reading those lucubrations which appeared in the press, and which, for want of a better term, may be alluded to as criti cisms. I still say that, if the wool-grower goes into the market without a plan, he is going to come out shorn. I noticed to-day in the newspapers two or three significant paragraphs. was an extract, I think, from the Manchester G-uardian-thoug h I may be wrong; another was from Yorkshire, and another was the opinion of SirA r t h u r Goldfinch. All these critics were against my proposal, a proposal which, in its essence, is one to sell Australian wool in Australia. ""Why were they against, my proposal? Becausei t was a bad thing for Australia? Not at all. It was because it was a bad thing for them and the interests they stand for. I ask the growers whether, if they had anything to sell, they would take it into the house of the only buyer, and say to h i m , "" There is my product; what w ill you give me for it ? "" That, in effect, is what would be the result if they send their wool to London. I say to the Australian grower that there is no compulsion; he may do as he pleases. If he likes to go and deliver himself, bound hand and foot, into a market manipulated by conflicting interests, let him do it. My proposal has nothing to do with the Government, qua Government. It does not depend upon or involve compulsion. But if they will act as sensible men, they will say, "" The world must have this wool. Let those who want it come to Australia, and buy it in open competition."" It has been said that the British Government might not agree to hold off while we sold our wool here; and that argument was nut forward as a reason against my proposal. I think that those who put -it forward did so with the fervent hope that the British Government would not hold off, so that we might be compelled to send all the wool Home. My last advice to the wool-grower of I Australia is to sell his wool here in Australia. Make buyers come to this country and buy in open market, at auction, and thus insure the world's price, whatever it is. If you watch the marketand I say this deliberately-d o not be.surprised to see from now to the 30th June the beginning of a downward curve. Who will be responsible for that curve? The prospective buyers-the mem who want to create a panic in Australia by creating the impression in the mind of the grower that the market is going to break, and thus causing the wool to be rushed Home, where it would all be in the hands of one buyer. The whole world is clamouring for wool. But in the One whole world there are only two, or at most three, effective buyers of wool. The rest of the world w ill have to use one of those buyers as middleman, and purchase its wool from him. I say, "" Sell direct-sel l in this place, in Australia-and sell for the best price you can get; the Government w ill not interfere at a l l . "" But the Government w ill do this, if it is desired-and I am addressing the wool-growers of Australia through honourable members here-the Government -will request the British Government to' do what it ought to do, namely, Terrain from selling the wool it now has while we are selling the new clip. That is a perfectly fair and legitimate request. Britain had our wool during all the war for very much less than, in some cases for only one-third of, the true value; and we have not received one penny-piece of the excess prices. Nor can we get any account of how much is owing to us. There is not an indication as to whether it is £1,000,000 or £50,000,000. neither business nor fair play, I say to the wool-growers of Australia, "" Make up your minds to sell your wool in Australia. sell your wool in Australia, and whatever the world may say before you have made that notifcation once you have made it, it must fall in with your resolution. Request the British Government to keep off the sales, and there is an end of the matter."" r Time is passing, and the position is becoming somewhat acute. It is quite time some announcement was made as to the policy of the Government with regard to the intervening period 'between war restrictions and normal conditions of trade. There has been too much secrecy. I do not like the idea of getting from some outside journal information as to the proposals of the Government with regard to Australia's products. About a month ago, during my absence in ""Western Australia, a letter was forwarded to me by a member of the Legislative Council in that State asking me if it was true that the Commonwealth Government proposed to take £10,000,000 of the wool growers' money for the purpose of helping to pay Australia's debt to GreatB r i 'lain. would not have taken much notice of it other than to reply at once, saying there was no truth in the suggestion; but as I was absent my typist sent the communication to the office of the Prime Minister, and that Department furnished a reply saying that there was not a word of truth in'the statement. Apparently that reply from the Prime Minister's Department was quite wrong, because we now see in the press that the Prime Minister has made a suggestion on the lines set out in the letter forwarded to me from ""Western Australia, andwe know perfectly well what a suggestion from the Prime Minister means. At the last moment we shall probably find ourselves confronted with a proposal from the Government to take certain measures. In fact, many measures are taken by the Prime Minister without consulting Parliament. While I am always ready to submit to any action taken by this Parliament, if the majority decide that it shall be done, I am not content that the Prime Minister, or any one else, should I maintain that this is issue instructions restricting the trade of the country, unless what he does has the approval of Parliament. The other day I asked a question with regard to the Notify the world that you will action of the Australian Metal Exchange in refusing a permit to export some old horse-shoes as ballast. Certain people who export sandal-wood have been accustomed to buy up old horse-shoes and ship them as ballast. They wished to do so again, but this metal exchange, which has no statutory authority, abrogated the duties of the Minister for Trade and Customs, and refused to grant a permit for the export of these goods. There are many instances in which the Government have taken powers under the War Precautions Act which prejudice our trade. This Parliament has been fooled. When we agreed to extend the operation of that Act until three months after tlie proclamation of peace, we were led to believe that it would cease to operate three months after peace was signed with Germany, but we are still ' controlled by it. We are getting close up to the end of the financial year, and we ought to have some clear indication as to what action the Government propose to ask Parliament to take in regard to the future control of our products. Something must be done to enable us to bridge over the intervening period until If I had received that letter I we get back to normal' conditions. According to a member of the Wool Committee who has just come over from Western Australia we have been travelling on a very dangerous road, and have now come to a precipice down which it is necessary to make a very gradual descent. The object of this gentleman's visit to Melbourne was to ask that certain control should be exercised by the Commonwealth in connection with the wool export for",29,Adjournment Formal Marketing Of Oversea Products

The products we are dealing with are not the property of a few. They belong to the people, and surely no harm can result from giving the negotiations the fullest publicity, because the more we know of them the more we can make inquiries from those who have a better knowledge of the conditions than ourselves, and the more good we are likely to do for the general producer.

Whether he has noticed that considerable transactions have taken place on the various Australian Stock Exchanges in connection with Commonwealth stocks? 2. Can he inform ithe House whether these transactions arc leading to the concentration of these bonds and debentures in few hands? the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. There is a free exchange in these securities at present, but the transactions cannot be considered abnormal. 2. There is no evidence that these transactions are leading to the concentration of the stock and bonds in a few hands. ister, upon notice1.

If any such restriction exists, w ill the Government take steps to have such restriction removed as soon as possible? 3. Seeing that, owing to the drought, the E lotinum miners in Fifield, New South Wales, ave been waiting for eighteen months to obtain a return for their platinum, and are now suffering considerable hardship as the result of being unable to find a market in Australia, although they have several thousands of pounds worth of platinum on hand, w i ll the Government take steps to see that a market is found, and that, in the meantime, advances be made to the holders of this platinum so as to assist member's questions are as follow:1 and 2.

As there is a free market for platinum, the Commonwealth Government cannot at this stage assist the industry in the manner indicated. 1. Has any fault or error been found in any of the designs or any of the plans of any of the ships to be built by or to the order of the Commonwealth Government in Australia? 2. If so, which ships are concerned? 3. What has been the nature of such fault or error, if any? 4. Who is responsible for the designs and plans of the ships built or to be built in . Australia ? honourable member's questions are as follow:1. No material faults or errors have been found in the designs or in the plans of any of the mercantile steel ships to be built by or to the order of the Commonwealth in Australia. As is the case in .practically every design of high-class vessels of this type (12,700 tons), alterations have been found necessar}' as the designs have developed. It has been desirable to make various alterations and modifications from the original proposal, which, as every one with knowledge of ship construction and marine engineering knows, is the ordinary and usual process. For instance, the vessels have been increased in length fro m 400 feet to 500 feet as the result of exhaustive discussions, and to meet the requirements of Australian overseas trade. The breadth has been increased from 52 feet to G2 feet, and for purposes of stability, 1 foot was added to the beam, making it 03 feet, since the length was definitely fixed at 500 feet. The deadweight capacity has been increased from 8,000 to 12,700 tons. The sea speed has been increased from 11 knots to 13 knots. As final calculations indicated that under certain extreme conditions of loading there was not that margin of stability considered desirable, it was decided to make further modifications. The decision to eliminate the passenger accommodation and to utilize the space for bunker coal or cargo also influenced this decision. The",33,Hughes Th E Answers To The Honourable

I move That all the words after the word "" That"" be omitted, with a view to inserting in lieu that the Government be requested to increase parliamentary allowance of members to a sum. not exceeding £ 1,000 per annum."" The moving of this amendment devolves upon me as "" the father of the House,"" I being the oldest member with a record unbroken. I think that tbe honourable members who constitute my family will be almost unanimously in favour of the amendment. There may be a few recalcitrant members, but their opposition, even if it may not be quite ignored, need not be regarded as serious In fact, I do not anticipate any opposition from any section of the House, because I have received assurances of sympathy from many honourable members on both sides. It must be acknowledged that while the price of every article has risen to other people members of Parliament have not been left unaffected. We are suffering as people outside are suffering, and in many ways. For instance, there has been an enormous increase in our election expenses. During the last election campaign we had to pay higher prices for halls, advertising, and accommodation. Whereas at one time. I could stay at a decent hotel for 10s. per day, I must now pay 14s. or 15s. per day for the same accommodation. These extra burdens are being felt by honourable members. The payment of members ceases on the day that Parliament is dissolved, and they get mothing until again elected. That is grossly unfair, as I have said before in this Chamber. The position is bad, and it is becoming worse. What is being done elsewhere? In Queensland, recently, the allowance to members of Parliament was increased from £300 to £500. That is an indication that we should get more. A State member is better off at £500 per annum than a Commonwealth member at £600 per annum.

124,Mr Bamford (Herbert) [4.32],"State representatives of which draw £4,250 for doing what I do for £600 per annum, and I say advisedly that I do as much as the whole of them. members of this Parliament whose electorates contain a number of State electorates know that that is not an exaggerated statement. Wales the parliamentary emolument was recently increased from £300 to £500, and I understand that there has been an increase in Western Australia. In view of these facts, we are justified in asking for more than we are now getting. It is only a week or two since the Prime Minister, speaking from his place in this House, complained of the inadequacy of the travelling allowances given to Ministers. From its inception, the remuneration of this Parliament has been on meam. arid miserable lines, no regard being paid to the dignity of the institution. I could namje several members who, having retired from Parliament, or having failed to secure re-election, have had to look for a job. I know one man a good party man, who occupied a seat here for many years-wh o had to accept the position of night watchman. This state of things is disgraceful, and lowerproposal. ing to the dignity of the National Parliament. Members should have an opportunity to accumulate little savings, but how is that possible out of the present allowance, with families to be reared and educated, and, in the many cases where men come from other States, with two homes to keep up? menting on the remarks of the Prime Minister, said that if members had to rely for their living on their parliamentary allowance, God help Australia. That is the sort of comment to be expected from a Conservative organ like the Argus. What brought about payment of members? Some thirty years ago, when many of those who are now listening to me were schoolboys, the great maritime and shearers' strikes occurred. newspapers of that day-the y were practically all Conservative then-sai d to the workers, ""Why do you not elect men to Parliament who will ventilate your grievances? If you do that, there will be open and public discussion, and your ills may be remedied."" This advice was taken, and we who belonged to the Democracy returned members to fight its battles in Parliament. But the men who could best represent us were poor: men like Andrew Dawson and Andrew Other Fisher, who were working for & daily wage, and had families to maintain. To enable them to live while performing their parliamentary duties payment of In New South members was instituted. Our example was followed in Great Britain. At one time the British unions subscribed sums to pay their representatives in the House of Commons, but this placed too great a strain on the unions, and it was considered unjust to tax them for their representation, with the result that the House of Commons, then possibly the most Conservative institution in the world, resolved that its members should be pa-id. The right of Democracy to representation so that its sentiments could be voiced in Parliament was not fully admitted until payment of members was instituted. No doubt to-morrow morning I , and those who may support the motion, will be vilified in the press, and a section of this House will be called on by the newspapers and by the Taxpayers Association to nail the flag of economy to the mast and kill this Members, however, should not be fearful. The man who fears to do what he knows to be Tight, fair, just, and reasonable, ought not to be here. The Commonwealth Parliament has cost the country nothing. Prior to Federation, gold was minted in Sydney, Melbourne, and Perth, but after the The Argus, comunion of the States the Commonwealth was permitted to issue its own silver and' bronze also. The silver we got coined for us in England, and imported it, paying for it the current price of the metal plus the expense of coining it . As for a long time silver was worth .only about 2s. an ounce, and silver coinage had a face value of 5s. 6d. an ounce, this arrangement was very profitable to us, but during the past twelve months the price of silver The having risen to between 5s. and 6s. an ounce, the position now is not so good. have taken steps to meet the increase in the cost of silver by increasing the alloys.

126,Mr Bamford,"According to the£354,276. In 1917-18 the .profit from the coining of silver was £209,952, and from the coining of bronze £19,426, a total of £229,378. In this year the Commonwealth Parliament cost £270,568, but of that amount £26,893 was the cost of the Governor General's establishment, so that the net cost of this Parliament, including £87,000 for the expenses of an election, was £243,675, which amount, deducted from the profits on coinage which I have given, made a net profit for the year of £153,000. year 3917-1S Parliament cost the people only 13.2d. per head, and I think that if the matter were submitted to the people there would be no difficulty in securing approval for 'my proposition, seeing that it has cost so little to maintain a Parliament which has done such very good work. In the early days of Federation, when Tariffs were under consideration, members had only to put out their hand' in the lobbies to get all the money they wanted. It is to the credit of our Parliament that the slur was never cast on any member, either directly or in directly, that he had taken a bribe, or had accepted money for his vote. All honour to this Parliament that its members have not accepted the opportunity which was theirs to enrich themselves improperly. In other places we hear of Tammany practices and of money being spent freely to secure parliamentary votes -be submitted to discussion. Money might have been taken by members of this Parliament, b u t no member of it has ever been accused of accepting improperly for his services even as much as the value of a postage stamp. I believe that the Government w i ll give this matter their sympathetic consideration, and that my proposal w ill be carried. the Government w ill give effect to it . I have only, to say, in conclusion, that throughout regard to this matter known. press from the public platforms electorate the opinion that the allowance which we receive by way of salary is too low. meeting which I was conducting in one of tbe largest centres in the Captain friends sat in the front seat, rose as soon as question time was reached and said, "" Mr Bamford, why you voted to increase your own parMr Bamford. liamentary allowance from £400 to £600 per annum?"" I replied, "" Captain Blank, I did not vote to increase my parliamentary allowance."" "" Whati Do you mean to tell me that you did not vote for it ? "" asked my friend. "" I do,"" said I ; "" I did not vote for it . As a matter of fact, no vote was taken. The proposition was carried on the voices. Further than that, let me tell you and the meeting that I was not in favour of £600 a year. WhatI wanted was an allowance Moreover, in the of £1,000 a year. I am wanting it yet, and I hope to secure it . "" A t the last meeting that I held in connection w it h the recent general election, I was asked whether I was in favour of the payment of members. My reply was, "" Certainly I am. If I were not in favour of it I would not be here, and what is more, were it not for the payment of members the ' other fellows' would not be chasing me for my job."" I have never made any secret of my views on this question, and I do not intend to do so. I am voicing my sentiments to-day as publicly as it is possible for me to do. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [ 4 . 5 4 ] I second the motion. The Constitution casts upon the Parliament the obligation of fixing the salaries of its members, and consequently the matter is one that must I propose to submit a statement covering my experience as a member of this Parliament for thirteen years. The statement is as follows:for Thirteen Years-December, 1906, to December, 1919-togethe r with Expenditure in earning such Income. We may rest assured that if it is, Income.

Net salary for thirteen years (averages approximately £235 per annum) In my thirteen years of political life, I have had to contest six elections, or an election on an average every two years. Two hundred and fifty pounds is the lowest amount on which I can conduct an election campaign. A t the recent general election I spent the last penny on which I could lay my hands in fighting the seat, and my expenses on that occasion ran into £165. balance. There are thirteen polling booths in the Cook electorate, and my friends demanded that at every polling 'booth there should be a motor car in attendance. that it is impossible to hire a car for less than £10 a day. of that item alone to incur an expenditure of £130. The Electoral Act provides that the election expenses of a date shall not exceed £100, but it is well that it should be said publicly that that provision is a piece of absolute hypocrisy. couid confine his expenses to £100. There is, as a matter of fact, what may be described as a "" catch"" in the Act itself, since the provision i u regard to the maximum expenditure of £100 relates only to certain items, and does not cover such an item as the hiring.of motor cars. item be a statutory expenditure? MrJ . H . CATTS' -No. The provision as to expenses not exceeding £ 1 0 0 relates only to certain statutory items. Quite apart from those items, there are necessary expenses which, in my case, have brought my expenses up to the total I have given. Some years ago I interviewed the Chief Electoral Officer, and. told himi that it was impossible for me to run my election campaign on an outlay of £ 1 0 0 . He then pointed out to me that the provision in the Electoral Act to which I have referred did not cover such items as expenditure for the use of motor cars to convey electors to the polling booth. .. .. 650 personal expenses. 150 MrJ . H . CATTS,-That is so. £4,160 cost of motors used in conveying a candidate to the different parts of his elec.. 3,065 torate during an election campaign. £7,225 Mr JH . CATTS -There is nothing to prevent the use of motor cars on election day as long as the cars are free to any one who likes to enter them for the purpose of going to a polling booth. No person who has asked for a l if t to a booth has 'been refused in my case provided there has been room for him in the car. I come now to the item of travelling expenses. On ""the average, we travel to and from Melbourne for six months in Friends had to assist with the the year. Honourable members may easily work out for themselves what that involves. It costs about £ 3 a week for train expenses to Melbourne, and back to Sydney, a6 well as for hotel expenses Honourable members are aware while in Melbourne. The Federal Taxation Commissioner has recognised that I had thus in respect £100 is a reasonable deduction to allow for travelling expenses in the assessment of income tax. I need make no f u r t h e r reference to candithe items in the statement relating to Federal and State income tax, because honourable members are quite familiar with the subject. In a contested election no man As to the item of £ 5 0 a year for electorate expenses, I admit quite candidly, that I have had to spend money in what is known as pre-selection campaigns, which are quite apart from a generai election. In many cases, Labour members have a pre-election campaign which is fought out probably more strenuously than is a general election. Then, again, the one referendum campaign, and two conscription campaigns referred to in the statement were quite independent of general elections. They do not relate to a referendum contested concurrently with a general election. In thirteen years as arising out of my public duties I have been served with six writs for libel, have had seven prosecutions under the W a r Precautions Act , and have had to take part in a number of State elections. These expenses I have not included.

He thought he was absolutely safe; but he made a mistake. Many seats which have been held for Labour as strongly as my own, have because of some mistake, probably because of insufficient expenditure in respect of organizing work, been lost to us.

I am not at my f u l l physical capacity the day after I have travelled from Melbourne to Sydney, or vice versa. The only work that a member of Parliament can take in hand, apart from his ordinary parliamentary duties, is that which can be done while he is sitting in the House.

130,Mr Mahony,"It is the same with alltary reasons, in connection with his public duties. There are, of course, honourable members who are wealthy, and they do not feel the position as men like myself do; but I ask them to consider the items I have submitted, and say whether they could, without their private incomes, have done any better than myself. It is unpalatable that these matters should be canvassed in Parliament, but I think it my duty to make this statement before the House, the public, and the newspapers. Any one is at liberty to criticise it in any way they like ; I only know that none will be able to show that my statement contains the slightest exaggeration. port the motion because I have found, during my brief experience in the House of some three years, that the allowance received by honourable members is insufficient. Those of us who come from other States, such as Queensland, feel this in sufficiency in a very marked degree. It is necessary for such honourable members to maintain two homes, and travelling expenses are always heavy. the election expenses, as already outlined, are a severe drain. I feel confident that it is not the wish of the people of Australia that their representatives should receive a salary which prevents them doing those things which they should be able to do as public men; it is not fitting that members of the Federal Parliament should, when travelling, have to consider every shilling. Unless we are willing to live beyond our means we find ourselves compelled at times to travel under conditions ill-becoming our position. Unless we are placed by the people of Australia in such circumstances as will enable us to act with dignity, nothing but harm can come. Education Department in Queensland in order to enter political life, I did so with the knowledge that that step would result in pecuniary loss; but even at that time. I did not realize the extent to which the cost of living would increase, and the amount I received monthly, whilst small, was enough to enable me to pay my way. tremely difficult to do this. I speak thus plainly because, now the subject has been opened, I think it behoves every one to freely express his opinion. There is no man in the House who does not realize that the allowance is insufficient. There are amongst us men who are fortunate enough, to be moneyed, or in business, and thus have their parliamentary allowance augmented; but honourable members who had to throw over everything in order to enter political life, deserve special consideration at the hands of Parliament. I hope that each honourable member will speak as his heart dictates and not as he t may. think the people outside would like him to speak. I feel a peculiar pleasure in following a young member, because of the fact that I speak with some thirty years' parliamentary experience behind me. When I first entered Parliament I was woTthI sup£10,000, though possibly, if I died tomorrow, I should be found, with the aid of insurance money, worth ten thousand shillings. My first election cost me over £900-w e had a'glorious time! I remember that somebody sent up a barrel of beer, and, knowing very little about politics, I thought that everybody ought to have a glass. However, an assistant of my opponent pointed out to me that I Then, again, was breaking the law in allowing the barrel of beer to be in the lane beside the booth, and when I went round I found it . saved, however, by the gentleman to whom I have referred knocking the end of the barrel in ; and then there was a r o w !

If my parliamentary allowance were increased, it would enable me to extend more such help than I am able to do at the present time.

About forty-eight years ago some one, thinking that I had a f a i r seat in the saddle, tried to persuade me to join the mounted troopers; and I often wonder what would have happened in that long interval, had I done so. Law-making should 'be a profession, and one of the most important in the community, for bad laws mean suffering to the majority.

If a member had a business he might be allowed to visit it as an auditor, but he should be called upon to devote the best of his abilities, indeed the whole of them, to making fair and proper laws. I further suggest that each member should be attached to a separate Department of the Government, so that he could be sent by the Ministeri n charge toany part of Australia to inquire into grievances and so forth . H a d there been such a plan in operation in the Federal Parliament, the Ministerf o r Home and Territories, for instance, might have selected myself from this side, and the honourable member for Denison( Mr Laird Smith) from the other to make inquiries into the Northern Territory troubles w i th great advantage.

I do not question the honesty of honourable members who have spoken in support of the proposal to-day, but it would be a better 'test of honourable members' honesty of purpose if they would go before the people and claim that £600 a year is insufficient, and that the allowance should be at least £1,000 per annum. and there would be no question as to their honesty. Every day we hear pleas put forward that we must economize, and undoubtedly one of the supreme necessities of to-day is economy in administration of public affairs. people should economize in order to counter the high cost of living. while we are continually preaching on these lines, claiming that the only way in which the high cost of 'living may be reduced is by a reduction of expenditure on the part of the people, what will the public say if at the same time we advocate an increase in our allowance?

In the circumstances, I am justified in saying that we could do the work just as well if we had only half the present number of Let them stand or fal l by that, members. I could only be persuaded to vote for an increased allowance if the number of members was also to be reduced, and it was made compulsory that a member must be in attendance in the House at all times, or forfei t his allowWe also say that the ance. I hope that the matter w ill not be pressed to-day, and that we shall wait But until the Federal Convention is held, and the amendments to the Constitution are submitted to the people. The question can then be honestly put before the electors. If I find from my experience of living at the Seat of Government that it is necessary to have an increased allowance, and if I am a candidate for election, I shall go before the people and advocate an increase. am pleased that this matter has been brought before the House, because I was anxious that honourable members should express their opinions upon it . There are several honourable members who are fortunate enough not to need to bother about what salary is paid to them, but 95 to support an increased per cent, of us depend exclusively upon our allowance, and our time is taken up in such a way that we are practhe number of members; but tically prevented from following other businesses which might augment our incomes.

My work in the electorate itself during the two and a half years, including the expense of preselection, cost me £566, apart from any exof boot3 and wearing apparel. The cost penses I incurred in visits to Melbourne during the same period. ceipts during the period were £1,563, giving me a net income of £997 for the whole of last Parliament, and had it not been for a fortunate occurrence by which a syndicate in which I was interested drew £1,200 in a Tattersall's sweep, my share after taxes had been paid amounting to £350, I would not have been in a position to pay my election expenses. I had to go into debt to carry on the campaign, and I had not quite cleared that debt when the last election was held, and again I had to seek means other than my parliamentary allowance to fight the campaign. again ? something seems to have gone wrong with Tattersall's since then.. Two cases have come under my notice Tecently relating to members of the Eederal Legislature. One is that of a man who had been in State and Federal Parliaments for twenty-seven years, and in the other case the period of service has been twenty-five years, and had they not succeeded at the last election they would have had to seek employment at their former trades. That would have been a tragedy after they had given the best of their lives to the service of the State. I hope that at the end of twenty-seven years, if my parliamentary career lasts so long, I shall not be in the same position as they occupied. I have not the slightest doubt that there will be columns of economy preached to honourable members by the ""newspapers. ""We, unfortunately, are not in the same position as are newspaper companies; we cannot without reference to anybody else increase our salaries by 100 per cent., as the newspaper proprietors have recently increased the price of newspapers. by them that, whereas printing paper cost from £11 to £13 a ton in 1914, That is what it generally' costs to-day it costs £80 per ton, and that in order to keep their newspapers going the proprietors must increase the price. It may be that some of the fair-minded newspapers will point also to the enormous increase in the cost of living and of the suit of clothes I am wearing has My total reincreased over 100 per cent, in five years. Similar increases have taken place in the prices of all the things we consume and wear. I am mot at all concerned with what the press may say about me in this regard. There seems to be an unfortunate curse placed upon those who oppose increases in salaries. >So far as I can learn, there are left in the two branches of this Legislature only two of those who voted against the last increase in salary. It appears that the people do not regard with favour men who oppose legitimate increases in. the payment for services rendered. The honourable member for Darwin( Mr Bell) has declared that he is not yet in a position to say whether or not £600 per annum is sufficient. I am positive that within twelve months, irrespective of the fate of this motion, the honourable member will know definitely that this is .not a payable billet. My parliamentary position will not return me more than £270 per annum, but I was receiving £325 before I entered this House. Recently the jurymen in New South ""Wales asked for an increase from 8s. to £1 Is. per day. Everybody is asking for more pay. We are moving in. a vicious circle, and I hope that' the Parliament of this Commonwealth will not be at the tail end of the circle. I have in this House advocated the fair payment of the servants of the Commonwealth. As an official of the Australian Workers Union, and prior to becoming an official, I have always advocated fair payment for services. To-day I am advocating the same thing for my parliamentary colleagues and myself. I believe that the Commonwealth can afford to pay its members, and that it should do so. It is not right that any man should be merely existing; but a member who receives only £600 per annum, and has to travel between his State and Melbourne, and from his home It may be truthfully said to his electorate, cannot possibly do more than exist.",42,Statement Of Income As Parliamentary Salary
140,Mr Gibson,Not through Tattersall's,43,Statement Of Income As Parliamentary Salary
141,Mr Blakeley,"Unfortunately,I 'do not know whether I shall be regarded by honourable members as a prehistoric man. when I express the view that, in my opinion, there should be no payment of members at all. But I recognise that there cannot be proper representation of every class in the community, especially the industrial classes, unless there is payment of members. Neither can there be stable government unless every class in the community is properly represented in Parliament. If , therefore, we are to have payment of members, the pay -should not be skimped in any way, but should be ample to attract tlie best men. In the first place, it should be ample, in order to increase the competition for the position, thus attracting the best men to the National Parliament. Secondly, I believe that an increase of salary will bring about much more quickly the further subdivision of Australia into self-governing provinces. The present cost of Legislatures must be -lessened; and I think that, by making adequate provision for bhe payment of members of this Parliament, we shall bring the people of Australia much more quickly to a Tight state of mind upon this question. My own position is that, before entering the House, I made up my mind as to the annual loss I could sustain, and I am willing to continue through this Parliament, and through any subsequent ones of which I may be a member, still bearing that loss. But I realize, from the short experience I have had in travelling between Melbourne and my own State, that there is no possibility of a member from other States, or even of a Victorian country representative, living within his present parliamentary salary. For that reason, I think it would be grossly unfair if I were to stand in the way of this proposal for no other reason than that I am a little more fortunately placed than are some of my fellow members, p honourable membeT for Herbert( Mr cluding those who have been in the House Bamford), I have been a member of this Parliament from its inception. During the last nineteen years I have given to the people of Australia the best service of which I was capable, and I am satisfied that had I devoted the same amount of energy to private business, I would have been infinitely better off than_I am to-day. This is not, and cannot be made, a party question. Every member is at liberty to speak or vote as he chooses' upon this amendment, and as far as I know, no arrangement of any sort has been made. Of course, the question cannot be settled by the carrying of the amendment, because an increase in salary can only be effected by passing an amending Bill. When that Bill is before the House, every honourable membeT will have an opportunity to speak and vote according to his own views. The last increase in the parliamentary salary was made in 1907. From the beginning of January, 1910, until 31st December, 1919, there have been five elections and five referenda, three of them were held apart from the general elections-tw o on the conscription issue, and one, in 1911, in regard to a proposal to amend the Constitution. In addition, it has been my privilege to have' travelled through four different States in connection with four State general elections, and also in connection with by-elections, and to visit all the other States of the Commonwealth in connection with public matters. In 1917, when we had a Federal general election, a referendum on conscription, a by-election in Ta'smania, and another in Victoria. I travelled about 25,000 miles.

Some honourable members, infor many years, are under the impression that I do receive an allowance. All I can say is that, if I do, I do not know where it goes; it never reaches me.

My jiosition can be put into a nutshell. I do not discuss the merits of the proposal, because I think that a great deal has been said by honourable members to justify an increase in the parliamentary allowance. But the case presents itself to me in this way. W it h a f u l l knowledge of the facts, I offered my services to the country for £600 a year, and it would be a violation of the most elementary rules of honesty if , my offer having been accepted, I were, now that I am a member of the Parliament which has control of the country's finances, to put my hands into the Treasury, and draw a larger amount. it, even if it were provided. your income from legal practice is probably double what you get as a member of Parliament? question as I answered a similar question when contesting the Pawkner seat. said that, in the first year of my practice at the Bar, I made ninety guineas, and that last year I made-considerabl y more. almost indecent for members to discuss their private affairs here as some of them have done. This is a question' of contract. Did. any member who is now objecting to the smallness of his allowance suggest, when fro m the public platform he solicited the suffrages of his constituents, that the remuneration was not sufficient ? orable members offered their services at the figure ruling. Moreover, one of the stock subjects of debate during the campaign was the high cost of living, so that candidates knew the facts, and, furthermore, many of the candidates had had the experience of living on £600 a year, and yet they deliberately offered to renew figure. Every man must look at this matter from his own point of view, and satisfy his own conscience, and I say that my conscience will not permit me to vote for this motion. higher salary. of wanting it . If we were going to the I country, I would advocate an increase in the' remuneration of honourable members. I do not know how those honourable members who aTe entirely dependent upon their parliamentary allowance, especially those who come from other States, can begin to live on £600 a year. Yet, knowing the facts, they offered to serve for that salary. MrJ . H . CATTS W ill tbe honourable member consider this point for a moment?

I speak, too, as one who has had almost as long an experience of parliamlemtary l if e as any member of this House. I have been chastened, as most men have, by that experience, and sometimes a little saddened by it . that what the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) has said is right in his case is right in mine. H ad I given my energies to law, or to the making of money, I should have been a very wealthy man today. Nay, if to-morrow I walked out of this House, and turned my energies into some other channels, I could earn more money in one year than here in three, even occupying my present position. So much by way of preface. I am a Minister, and the motion relates to the salaries of members. As most honourable members know, Ministers receive as members a salary of only £400 a year. Why that is so I have never been able to understand. The motion says, in effect, that the salai y of members is inadequate. quite agree with that. There is one principle that holds good the world over in relation to labour and everything else: if you want the best thing you must pay the best price. labour and a man's service differs from tin-e to time. It includes as the irreducible minimum the cost of subsistence. Six hundred pounds a year was considered a fair salary for members of Parliament in 1907. If that is so, it is certainly not a no pretence whatever to work for fair salary to-day. Something has been said of the position of members who"" devote their entire lives to the service of their country. Speaking for myself, I have found it a very thankless business. men who have been my friends and colleagues for many years, many of whom are as poor as, and some poorer than, myself. They have so slipped into the r u t of political life that once they are driven out they are utterly undone. They are unfit for anything. 1 have seen men hang round the portals of this place when the public, fickle, minded as it is, has rejected them, miserable beings, seeming, as it were, like those who were cast out of Eden. I have even known an ex-Federal Minister to be reduced to such straits that, walking down Bourke-street, I saw no man so miserably I dressed or looking such an outcast. Such cases are, no doubt, exceptional; but I speak of the general rule. W h y should the public expect those upon whose 'honesty and ability their welfare and the safety of the nation depends to work for less than a f a i r return for their services? What right have they to expect anything of the I am perfectly confident kind ? The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) said that he offered -himself to the electors for £600 a year. I certainly did not. I consider myself under no obligation to work for the same salary now as in 1907 any more than I consider my messenger is for ever compelled to work for tbe salary paid him when he first entered upon his duties. He has a right to ask for more money when circumstances change, the cost of living increases, or his services become of more value. "" I have had a very long experience of public life, and, like the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs), I have not known a man to be turned out of Parliament because he asked for more I salary, and took it . I have, however, lived to see, both here and in the New South Wales Parliament, men who, having refused a higher salary, have later on come back and taken it . I remember The price of a man's there was in our old party one man who would not take the increased salary of £600 a year. He was the only member of the party rejected at the next election. nothing.

No man money. No man has profited by it . On the wisdom, foresight, and regular attendance of honourable members at this place depends the welfare of the people. If we say to the people outside, "" You shall not have a wide choice; that is to say, you shall not select any men you like but only men who are well-to-do,"" then Democracy is a farce. If I were in the position of an ordinary honourable member, having to live on £600 a year, I do not think I would offer myself to the people upon the understanding that I should not be allowed any increase of salary.

Although the press, perhaps, does not realize it, it is 'by its persistent denunciation of Parliament doing the work of those who seek to overturn Parliament and substitute direct action. Some of those connected with the press of the country seek to propagate the idea, that directly a man becomes a member of -Parliament be becomes either a fool or a rogue-that there is no man outside Parliament so poor or so insignificant but before one chosen of the people. are those whom the people have deliberately chosen to rule over them.

I have heard from those who oppose the motion their reasons for doing so, and has trafficked his influence for those reasons do not convince me: they do not appeal to me, because they do not approach the question from the proper, angle. Like ray honourable friend the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor), 1 have given my life to this business-m y whole life. I did not take it up, and have never pursued it , as a pastime or a recreation I did not enter Parliament to take my place in a debating society. I have, as I say, devoted my whole l if e to ( the service of my country. In turn, the people owe me something. When they have chosen me as their representative they have intrusted me w it h infinitely greater powers than that of deciding what is a f a i r salary for myself and my fellow-members. I do not intend to consider for a moment what the press happens to say. As everybody knows who reads the press, what it says to-day it unsays to-morrow; and it does not bother me. I lived for twenty-five years a member of a party that flourished despite the press; and now, although I am a member of a party that sometimes takes a great deal of notice of the press, I never do. I owe nothing to No r is there a the press-the press has endeavoured persistently to pull me down. It has not succeeded, and it is little likely to affect me by its diatribes, whether on this or any other question. PerhapsI ought not to have said this; however, it w ill give the press a chance for an extra leader, and so to earn an honest penny. All I ask from the press, or anybody else, is a f a i r field and no favour. I am not going to commit tlie Government; the matter has not been considered by us; but I am going to say what I think, and that is that, an increase of salary is warranted by the circumstances. I am not going to commit myself to any particular amount, nor am I going to commit the Government; but I am, if the House approves the motion, going to bring this matter before the Cabinet, and I shall recommend tliat a B ill be brought down that his counsel can be taken in order that the House may have an We opportunity to express its opinion. suggest that when the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes)places this matter before the Cabinet, in the event of the House carrying the amendment, he should also place before it a suggestion made by the Bulletin some time ago, to the effect that, given a salary of £1,000 a year, £250 of it should be withheld until a member is defeated, or dies. That is a proposal which, personally, I favour, and I think it will appeal to the common sense of every honourable member. I have not been very long a member, but long enough to have had some of my views dissipated in regard to the amount of salary received by honourable members. I do not base my support of the motion on the fact that I cannot live on the salary. If the salary were increased as proposed, I might at the end of my term be no better off than I should be if the salary remains as at present. That is one of my reasons for the suggestion I have just made to the Prime Minister. Most of us have had experience of fighting for the particular people whose interests we believe in ; and, as honourable members know, members like myself generally fight with the gloves off, both inside and out of this House. In'that respect I do not intend to alter my practice. What is the position of a member, if defeated, who fights for his class outside? I am not afraid to go before my electors, even if the motion be defeated, member, upon the remuneration he gets carrying the responsibility or odium of having voted to increase my salary. am glad to see there are so many converts to direct action. There is no knowing where the movement will stop in Australia after the highest tribunal in the land has expressed itself in favour of the principle that those who work should determine the conditions under which they shall .work. mony with my principles expressed outside, to cast my vote inside for the same policy; but I hope that when Cabinet decides to bring forward a Bill to raise the salaries of honourable members they will give close consideration to the aspect of the matter I have mentioned. [6.22] -The honourable member has given a new interpretation of direct action. has refused to come to this House to "" do the job "" unless his pay is raised. The proposition that honourable members should be more adequately paid than has -been the case in the past is based on the same ground on which every section of workers in the community has secured the advances which have been given to them during the time the present salary of honourable members has been running in Australia. There is no considerable section of the community but has had an advance in some sort of ratio to the increased cost of living. Many people outside imagine that the position of a member of Parliament is a very remunerative one, but my experience is that it is worse paid than any position I occupied before I came here, and I think that has been the experience of most of us who have given up other work to take up the duties of a member of Parliament. The position of those who represent distant States has already been set out by honourable members who preceded me, and it is hardly necessary to elaborate the arguments put forward by the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Bamford), but I am unwilling to give a silent vote. I have always said that there should be proper payment of members of Parliament. The country will get service from its representatives according to the amount paid to them. I believe that employers generally get service according to the amount they pay for it. It is almost impossible for an honourable to-day, to give tbe time he ought to deI vote to the work of Parliament and to procure the facilities that he ought to possess, seeing that his vote controls the destinies of the people of the* Commonwealth. I am glad, in har[6.24] I shall not occupy more than a few minutes. I desire to say frankly that those who have spoken in favour of an increase in salary have made out a good case. I recognise the sacrifices that are made, particularly by those who represent constituencies in other States, but during the last election campaign I was asked, the direct question whether I would vote for an increase in salary, and I replied I would not, unless the matter had previously been submitted to the people at I have not heard that any one a general election At the same time.
