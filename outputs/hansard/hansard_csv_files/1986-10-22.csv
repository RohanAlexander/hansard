Let us look in a little detail at exactly how There can be no doubt whatsoever, despite all each of these claims has fallen flat on its face the fudging and all the attempts to confuse which and how the traineeship scheme, administered as we have heard from the Minister for Employit is by the present Government, has proved such ment and Industrial Relations ( Mr Willis), para damp squib. The Government's first claim, ticularly at Question Time today, but that the honourable members will recall, was that by the Government's position from the very beginning end of June this year there would be 10,000 young people actually on the job, working in The fourth claim was that the Government youth traineeships. I put out a Press release the would reduce youth unemployment as a result other day giving figures which I understood to of this scheme. Mr Deputy Speaker, when you be correct. They did not come to 10,000, they go back to those heroic words of the Minister in came to 2,449, and they applied not only to the September last year you should remember-this position on 30 June 1986 but to the period up is the greatest condemnation of all-that since to October, four months after the end of the the Government introduced the Australian trainfinancial year. What has the Government proeeships scheme youth unemployment has acduced? It has produced fewer than 2,500 traintually increased. That is the great result of the eeships. The Minister got up on his high horse Government's scheme and its fiddling around and took great umbrage about this. He said: with the system-youth unemployment has in 'You are peddling false figures'. Let me tell the fact gone up. Minister that those figures come from his own Mr Deputy Speaker, you are probably asking Department, and not just from one place within yourself how this came about, why the scheme his Department but as a result of checking with is a dismal failure, why we have had this paeach of the regional offices. If the Minister does thetic performance. If you are not, you should not know, his own departmental officers should. be. Let me give you the reasons. The scheme What is his defence? His defence is that I am has failed first of all because the Government claiming there should be 10,000 traineeships and has allowed it to be surrounded and strangled there are in effect only 2,449. But does he go on by red tape. For instance, I have with me a to say: 'It is not 10,000, it is 9,000'? No. Does chart which is the Government's attempt to exhe say that there are 8,000 traineeships? No. plain to employers the simple, easy, couple-ofDoes he say that there are 7,000? Even that steps process of how youth can take part in the would be better. No, he says that there are traineeship scheme. I show honourable members 3,030. Four months after the end of the financial this chart, which is so complicated that they will year, with a promise of 10,000, the best he can think it was drawn up by someone suffering provide is 3,030. If that is the best he can do, from the DTs-this jigsaw puzzle which is inhe stands condemned out of his own mouth. The comprehensible, this lot of bureaucratic gobblemere production of those figures, without any degook which could not help utterly confusing more, shows that this scheme, under the adminemployers. When one looks at the burden of red istration of this Government, with the union tape that the Government has piled on top of control and the bureaucratic red tape it has this scheme, it is not surprising that it has been allowed to become involved, has been a miserastrangled. The second claim was that the bulk of the Mr N. A. BROWN-Like the fringe benefits traineeships would be in the private sector. That tax.

He said that there imposed on the scheme a taxation burden such would be 50 to 60 per cent in small business. that it is not surprising that employers are now How many are there?
