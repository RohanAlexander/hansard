Regarding the first and second part I sball confer with my colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs, in an endeavour to obtain the informa tion which the honourable member seeks, and it will be made available to him as soon as possible. THE PARLIAMENT. a question, Mr Speaker, or perhaps it may turn out to be a suggestion, about the broadcasting of tbe proceedings of this House at question time. It must be very difficult for listeners to identify the questioner or the Minister who replies. When a questioner is called tbe name of his electorate is. mentioned by you in accordance with the Standing Orders. I suggest that, in addition, the name of the member called be mentioned by you, Mr Speaker, when giving the call to bim. the announcer. but frequently his announcement clashes with the beginning of the question and prevents listeners from hearing the opening words. I suggest, Mr Speaker, that, when giving the call to an honourable member, you say, "" Mr So-and-so, the honourable member for such-and-such a district"". If that were done, the identification of the member who had received "" tbe call would be complete, and the listenwas in operation there, and I made ining aiidience could-follow the proceedings more clearly. I know that under Standing Order 273 no member may refer to another honourable member by name, but I am also aware that in at least one other House of Parliament which has a similar standing orderI refer to the Parliament of Victoria-it has long been the practice to call a member by name. As the broadcasting of'the proceedings of the Parliament. has introduced a new element, I suggest that a modification of the Standing Order be considered. If the proceedings are to be broadcast, listeners should be able promptly to identify tbe questioner and the person who supplies the answer. give the name of the party to which the questioner belongs, as that would enable listeners to keep pace with the frequent changes of the name of the party led by r the right honourable gentleman. in the suggestion that the name of the party to which the questioner belongs sbould be given. ; ready given considerable attention. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, there is a standing order which requires an honourable member to refer to another member by tbe name of his electorate. I bave studied the origin of this practice, and from what I can discover from May's Parliamentary Practice, it was adopted as a means of maintaining decorum in parliamentary proceedings. It, was thought that if members were addressed by their names the practice could easily degenerate into the use of nick-names. At the moment, the announcers are acquainting ""themselves with the names of members and their electorates, so that they may be able to give the name of the member called as soon as he has received the call. Considerable improvements in that direction have already been made. Commons, members are always called by name. honourable member is under a misapprehension. I heard that that practice quiries. From my study of the Hansard reports of the House of Commons debates, I am convinced that honourable members are not addressed by tbeir names, but by tbe names of their constituencies.

Debate resumed from the 3rd July (vide page 2105), on motion by Mr That the bill be now read a second time. -This is a. bill to amend the Meat Export Control Act 1935. It is well that I should make a few remarks on the original Meat Export Control Bill, in order that this measure may be debated in true perspective. In 1935, the right honourable member for. Cowper( Sir Earle Page), as Minister for Commerce in the Lyons Government, introduced the original measure. Its objective was to regulate the exports of meat from Australia. It proposed the constitution of a board to make recommendations to the Government as to how the sales of Australian meat might be promoted and for"" other purposes. That board was set up in circumstances rather different from those that 'have attended [11.19] the establishment of . other boards for the regulation of the exports of primary products. Eor example, there bad not been wide representations to the Minister of the day as to the necessity for a meat export control board, although many of the meat producers believed that a body to regulate the export trade and to supervise the grades , and standards of meat exported should be established. Honourable members may recall that the action then taken arose out of the circumstances that existed subsequent to the making of the Ottawa Agreement. the meat market in Britain prior to that .agreement. At that time .the'British market, being the only free market in the world, was used by all countries' as a dumping ground for their.rneat'expbrts, with the result that' prices were reduced to very low levels. At' /'the-' 'Ottawa1 conference, importsof meat''ny Great Britain from foreign countries were restricted, and the Dominions^were given from the Dominions to -Great' Britain increased so greatly that they quickly overtook the deficiency caused by the limitation of supplies from foreign countries, and the British producer was placed in an' unfortunate position. In 1933, Great Britain seriously considered limiting its imports of meat.. Commonwealth Ministers went, hot-foot to London to prevent that at all costs, and they succeeded in preventing, not only the limitation of imports, but also any restriction on the absorption by the British market of chilled meats, in which trade Australia was just, beginning to engage.",18,Second Reading

In any case, of this point. When the Ottawa Agreement conditions are very different in New was being framed, and it was proposed to Zealand and Australia. New Zealand is, place a limitation upon the export of beef after all, a small country, and a system from Argentina, no limitation was placed which is workable there would be costly on offals. It was pointed out by the and cumbersome if attempted in a counadviser to the Australian Government, try the size of Australia. I have no fault Sir William Angliss, that there was a. Mr Hutchinson. I welcome the proposal to appoint It has received ""favours a new deal in industry. It is Anything and employees must be beneficial. At the present time, employees in an industry Some primary producers have stated In the final analysis, the unless it represented both sides. Perhaps need to define "" offals "". Representatives of producers 'did uot take the suggestion seriously. Offals could mean nothing but offals. Experience proved that the advice given by Sir ""William Angliss was sound, because no sooner had the agreement come into, operation and supplies from Argentina were curtailed than that country adopted the practice of cutting . beef into portions-and sending it to Great Britain as offals. Action had to be taken to rectify the trade. I therefore am of the opinion that if marketing aspects have to be considered, marketing interests should be represented on the board. Otherwise that body will not truly reflect the whole of the industry. A vital principle is embodied in clause 14 which deals with the powers of the board. The powers which will be vested in the board under the bill differ considerably from those which the old board could exercise. That board was really .little more than an advisory body, but the new board is to undertake the basic functions of meat control. I believe that the. bill is designed to make the new board a completely despotic body. The powers of the board, as expressed in clause 14, are additional to those authorized under the original act. Clause 14 provides that the board will be empowered, on behalf chairman can veto any decision of the of the Commonwealth and subject to any board. directions of the Minister(i) to purchase any meat, meat product or This power has been included in; the bill edible offal; (ii) to sell any meat, meat product or edible is actively trading with the United'Kingoifal; or (iii) to manage and control all matters connected with the handling, storage, £20,000,000 and .£25,000,000 ofpublic protection, treatment, transfer and moneys is involved in this trading pracshipment of any meat, meat product, tice. I agree that the responsibility f'oir or edible offal purchased by the Comthe expenditure of public moneys must monwealth. Under that provision, the board will be responsible to the Parliament. Were it empowered to do almost anything with otherwise, an independent board couldmeat. Moreover, as there is no time seriously influence a Government's budlimit to the exercise of those powers, the get. There are, hpwever, some pecuGovernment could continue to trade in liar aspects of this matter. In my meat and meat products indefinitely. The opinion, any decision of any board position would be similar to that which handling public moneys should be subject obtains in connection with Government to the approval of the Minister. That competition in air transport. The clause principle has been accepted for many practically authorizes the socialization of years. In other words, moneys raised the meat industry. purpose. clause contemplates Government intrusion into, the field pf private enterprise, possibly leading to the socialization of the meat industry. At the. present time powers of this kind may be required because of the United Kingdom-Australia meat agreement which extends to 1948, but in committee I shall move that such powers shall, be limited to three years. At the expiration of that period the matter could be reconsidered by the Parliament. I shall now deal with the provisions of the bill relating to the chairman of the board. Under the original act, he is to have a deliberative vote as well as a casting vote. If at any time the chairman, or the person presiding at a meeting of the board, dissents from a majority decision of the board, he shall have"" the right to approach the Minister, who may overrule the decision of the majority and make such variations of that decision as he thinks fit. That means that the board becomes merely an advisory body in the event of the "" chairman disagreeing with the decision of a majority of its members. because the Commonwealth Government dom Government in meat.

This bill differs from the usual practice inthat only in cases in which the chairman dissents from the view of a majority of the board does the matter come before the Minister. If the chairman is strong and incorruptible, the matter' will be brought to the notice of the Minister; if the chairman is weak or open to corruption, the matter may never reach the Minister. Under the original act the board was fund derived from a levy on the industry. In other -wordsthe levy was made on exports. ' Proceeds of the levy were placed into the fund from which the board obtained the requisite finance to carry out its activities, to appoint a LonCommittees. We know from practical exdon representative, to take steps to promote, the sale of Australian meat overseas, and to indulge in any branch of scientific research it deemed necessary for the promotion of the meat industry. The board had complete control of the fund. A majority decision was sufficient authority for it to act. Under the decision now before tion. Clause9 provides that the members us, however, not only public moneys but moneys standing in the fund may not be expended on a majority decision of the board; also such expenditure is subject to veto by the chairman. If the chairman dissents from a majority decision of the members of the board, reference is made to the Minister who may himself determine how the moneys shall be expended. The Minister may give a direction without attending a fullmeeting of the board; therefore the case for the majority decision may not be put fully "" before him. He may act without even calling for a written statement of the matters upon which a majority decision was based. He may simply accept the view of the chairman and base his decision upon that. We know that, it is the rule rather people , put . a . particular jvhich 'they"" are' interested in the manner "" that best suits their purposes. The Minister may dissent from a majority decision of the. board in respect of not only public. moneys used for the improvement of the industry,, but also r moneys ""levied' upon, the industry itself. I agree that the Minister 'should have an Mr Hutchinson. overriding authority inconnexion With the expenditure of public moneys, but I do hot agree ithat that authority should extend to such moneys as come from the industry itself. The hoard should have the right hy a majority decision to determine in what way the latter should be expended, and to deal' with practical matters affecting the industry of which the Minister of the day in most instances would not know anything. I commend these suggestions to the earnest consideration of the Minister. At a later stage empowered, to' administer a an opportunity will be afforded to test the opinion of the House in regard to them. I .come now to the last phase of the bill which I wish to discuss, namely the establishment of State Meat Advisory perience tliat these committees will play a very important part in the determina^ tion of matters relating to the industry. In many instances they will constitute the real determining body, although their recommendations will necessarily have to be passed on to the board for consideraof the State Meat Advisory Committees shall be appointed by the Minister and shall, comprise representatives of such sections of the meat industry in . each State as, in the opinion of the Minister, will constitute a committee adequately representative of the industry. In other words they, ai'e to-be persons who, in the opinion, of the Minister, will be capable of representing in the deliberations of the committees a fair consensus of opinion of those engaged .in the industry in their own State. That,is far from satisfactory. The Meat Advisory Committees will play an. important part in the successful continuance of the industry, nnd consequently I . believe that their members should.be drawn from organizathan . the exception that tions representing ' producers and case in exporters. If the Minister merely appoints representatives whom he-' thinks are suitable for appointment there will be anabsence of harmony and possibly suspicionsamongst producers as to these State committees. The Ministerv may eyen appoint "" stooges"" whose t opinions are""' -ur '""line with ; f his own and not necessarily representative of ""those of the organizations of-primaryproducers and exporters. The committees should consist of representatives of the producing and exporting interests who should be chosen from a panel of names submitted by the organizations. If that were done there would be' likely to be a great deal more harmony iri the industry than can he anticipated if the measure remains uaialtered. I trust that the points I have raised, which will he amplified by other honourable members on this side of the House, will be given most serious consideration by the Government, and that. the Government will not be guilty of the stupid and foolish assumption it has adopted in respect of other measures which have come before us that nothing good can emerge from the Opposition. 7 ( Mr Barnard) -The honourable member may not refer to the actions of the Government in respect of other measures. members on this side of the House have carefully studied the bill and have sought the advice of organizations of producers in relation to the proposals contained in it, and accordingly, their representations should be accorded the fullest consideration. I have endeavoured to approach the bill from a non-party angle; although I have mentioned instances of the mess and muddle that has occurred in the industry in the last few years as the result of mismanagement, I have not made any definite party Accordingly I trust that when amendments are moved by honourable members on this side of the House they will be accepted in the spirit in which they are submitted and be given the consideration they, deserve, the last six years those whose duty it' has been to co-ordinate our war requirements, matter of food production, have had to face ' many changing circumstances. Under the National Security Regulations they were clothed with authority to' fake immediate action Without reference to the Parliament' as to'the 'wisdom or otherwise' of'their'actions."" I pay a tribute"" to the*;' manner' "" in"" 'which they' have discharged their duties. This ""bill'represents an attempt' to incorporate in a new measure the, experiences of the war period and to devise a code that will, lead to organization and peace in the meat industry, and a greater benefit from our export trade than was possible in the past; As the honourable member for Deakin( Mr Hutchinson) has pointed out there -has been some dislocation of our export trade due to our inability to compete with' other countries principally with Argentina, in .the United' Kingdom market. Duemainly to Argentina's better knowledge of the affairs of trade, meat : exporters of that country have been able to outwit us despite the preference given to the Dominions under the Ottawa Agreement.' The principal criticism levelled at the bill by the honourable member was that it did not provide for fair representation, on the Australian Meat Board and the State Meat Advisory Committees of the various components that make up the meat industry, and Honourable that the Minister was being given autocratic powers to override decisions arrived at by those bodies. Meat producers are of the opinion that during the regime of anti-Labour administrations', merchants were able to obtain an unfair share of the profits of the meat industry. There may be some truth in that contention. Certainly, under Labour governments meat producers have had greater representation on various boards. However, the task of organizing the meat industry is not one solely for meat proattack. ducers or meat exporters. It is the business of the community at large. The old days when business interests could carry on in their own sweet way, regardless of -the interests of the community, have gone. In the national interest food must . . be produced and distributed in sufficient quantities to safeguard the welfare of the nation. It is also the duty of the nation to ensure that producers of food shall be particularly in the adequately protected from, exploitation. To this end it is essential that the Minister within whose jurisdiction the productiono f food lies, should -be able to initiate in this Parliament a discussion of any action, provided for in this measure, that 'the board may take, and also should be able to-veto immediately any move which -he considered to be not _ in the national 'interest ' A board composed entirely of",23,Scully

60,Mr Breen (Calare) [12.7],"Duringrepresentatives of producers and consumers, in the absence of any overriding authority on the part of the Parliament, might be tempted to do things that might -produce satisfactory results so far as they themselves were concerned, but which would not be in the best interests of the nation. ""We have had experience of that in the coal-mining industry. Experienced coal-miners and mine-owners have agreed on certain action without regard to the repercussions of the action upon the status of the industry, and upon the community at large. We cannot afford to permit that. That is why there is incorporated in this measure a clause giving overriding power to the Minister. Whilst complete producer control of the distribution and sale of a commodity may be desirable in theory, it is more of a political abstraction than an objective capable of immediate realization. The ideal of course is a co-operative organization representing producers, distributors and consumers, all working in the interests of society generally, and without thought of personal gain-; but we must deal with practical things, and it is the job of the Parliament to "" talk turkey "". During a previous debate in this chamber one honourable member opposite mentioned the lack of organization amongst food producers generally. He was quite right. Organization amongst primary producers has not reached the stage of development, that it has reached amongst other groups in the community. Consequently, it is impossible to set up an authority that is thoroughly representative of food-producers of whom probably only 20 per cent, are organized. That is anothar reason why it is the duty of the"" Parliament during the transition from the present inadequate social system to a more idealistic system, to keep continuous watch over the production, distribution, and exchange of such a vital commodity as food. The bill is an attempt to incorporate all that is practical in meat control, and to eliminate some of the features which, no matter how desirable, in theory, have proved impracticable. I wish to deal now with three phases of. our meat exporting industry. First, there is the export of lambs which is a major part of our export trade because of Australia's great sheep population, we are Mr Breen. able to export large quantities of lamb. Also, as most of this country enjoys a mild climate, it is possible for graziers to change over in a few years from wool production to meat production or vice versa should the international situation demand such a move. Because of that flexibility, we have been able to meet changed circumstances so far as lamb export is concerned, without causing any vital upset. However, because of the ease with which sheep-raising can be carried on in this country, we have been, prone to neglect certain phases of the industry, the development of which would have meant greater efficiency in lamb production, and therefore, a greater income from that activity than we have had in the past. It is well known that if lambs which at present are killed when sixteen to twenty weeks old were allowed to reach the mutton stage, we would not be able to export them because of the high incidence of lymphatic gland trouble. This ailment, which does not become manifest until the later stages of development, excludes almost 7 per cent, of our fullygrown sheep from the export trade. The result is that even at present"" when we have substantial supplies of mutton in cold storage, and Great Britain is in need of meat, this mutton is not being shipped. We may not be able , to market so many of our lambs in the United Kingdomi f transport between the Americas and Europe improves to such a degree as to outweigh our present advantage of being.able to offer cheap meat. Then we shall have to limit lamb production and improve the quality of our mutton, or look for another market. It may be wise to explore the possibilities of the market in the East. The international meat trade has a strong grip on the European market, but the Eastern market has been largely neglected possibly because of the limited individual purchasing power of the peoples in the Eastern countries, but, in the aggregate, there ought to be a tremendous amount of money available for the .purchase of meat at prices at which meat cannot be grown on the American pastures. That is a phase that the exnerts whose a-npointment is provided for in this legislation could investigate on tbp production and the merchandising sides. Mention Has been made by tbe Opposition of tbe intrusion of politics into what ought to be exclusively business organization, namely, the Australian Meat Board. One honourable member went to great pains to protest that he intended to debate the bill on' a plane far above that of politics, and that he intended to deal entirely with the economics of the meat industry. But every member of the Australian Meat Board has strong 'political affiliations with the anti-Labour forces of this country. So critical were the producers of the big business interests in the . metropolis, in whose hands their destiny lies, that they established the Australian Country party, thinking that that would mend matters and end their sense of frustration. No other tification could exist for the party's existence, but that the experiment failed will be proved when one counts the heads of the members who claim to represent country. interests on the other side of the. House after the general elections. I will not canvass that aspect any further, but I do point out that New South ""Wales has had unfortunate experiences with the autonomous boards that have been set up in the State. Owing to the preponderance of politicians of the kind that have lost public confidence in the Legislative Council, legislation sent to the council from the Legislative Assembly designed to end independence of the Meat Commission and other similar bodies has been so amended as to frustrate the intentions of thepopularly elected Lower House. The Meat Commission was set up as an independent authority to control the Homebush abattoirs prior to the advent of the Labour Government. Since then every effort made by the Government to bring it within the control of the State Parliament has been fruitless. The economy of New South ""Wales, in (particular, and Australia, as a whole, has been, damaged by the fact that the Meat Commission has been independent of the State Parliament. In view of the experience, of the State Government, this Government is not inclined to set up a hoard that is completely independent of the Parliament. It is the Parliament's keep control of the economy of the country. No parliament can function as it should without the power, once having created something, to change it if need be. Reverting to the meat export trade, and having dealt with the lamb .export section, I point out now that there is room for great improvement in the mutton export trade. A board on which all sections of the meat'trade are repre, sented and ""without the antagonisms and other weaknesses of the Meat Commission of New South ""Wales will he able to recommend legislation to control the industry in such a way as, among other things,' to bring about that improvement. Meat producers who have paid a lot of money for sires on their properties tell me that Australian beef is a very bad second compared -with beef from Argentina when the two are in competition on a fair basis. -jusI do not know bow that can be overcome. Hitherto beef has been raised in the Northern Territory and drafted south to' mature and fatten on Victorian pastures before being slaughtered for the export trade. That is a haphazard practice. the honourable member's imagination. ber learned about the meat industry through actual experience instead of by reading the Melbourne newspapers he would know that big drafts of cattle come from the Northern Territory for fattening and slaughter in the south, and that the --journey lasts perhaps a number of . years. I was in northern Queensland and in the Northern Territory, Vesteys Limited operated meat works at Darwin, but, for some reason or other, it decided that it was not economic to continue operations. At the same time the opportunity developed of exporting live-stock from Darwin to the Netherlands East Indies.. It seems that it is more profitable to export livestock to the Netherlands East Indies for .slaughter there, than to process the stock in Australia for export as frozen or chilled meat. It may be that, with more development of the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth will be able -job to to develop a trade with the Eastern countries in processed meat or livestock. Malaya, Indo-China and other countries to our north may be a profitable market for the meat-producers. I think it would",25,Scully

64,Mr Breen,"A few years ago whenbe, much better to slaughter stock raised in,-the Northern Territory in that area than to send"" it on the long trek through, western Queensland down to New South Wales. It appears that, despite the desire of the meat-export industry in the south for the continuance of the 'shifting of cattle from the Northern Territory and northern Queensland to southern Australia for slaughter and export, the Government of Queensland will not "" play ball"" with the Commonwealth transport department in the matter of picking up the cattle at the western terminals of the railways that link the Queensland cpast with western Queensland. ber should bring that up in caucus. already done so. At all events,I shall continue to advocate that .proposal. The railways in Queensland have been routed to tap the sheep and cattle-raising country in the far western portions of that State. Although some companies have established meat works in proximity to those districts, most of the works are established on the coast principally at Townsville, Gladstone, Rockharnpton and Brisbane. Considerable sums have been expended on the establishment of those works, but if it is clear that we cannot continue to run them economically, having regard to their great distance from the sources of supplies, we should not hesitate, particularly in.view of the intensive .drive, being made for trade by all ticularly in other countries which supply countries, to link the western terminals of those railway lines. Consideration s,hould be given to that problem immediately. I understand that the Government of Queensland has agreed in principle to the routing of stock in a direct line south through Cunnamulla and Barringun to Bourke and other meat works centres in the west of New South Wales.. In anticipation of this development three big companies have established meat works at points in western New South Wales in order to tap the flow of cattle through to Victoria. Swift Australian Company (Proprietary) Limited has established works at Blayney, Angliss-Vestey's at Forbes and Rogers at Orange. It is proposed to process the meat at these centres and to rail it to Sydney for export. However, as it will be many years before the western railway terminals in Queensland are linked up, the Government should take, imme-: diate action to develop the great stock? raising areas in the Northern Territory) with a view to processing the meat at Darwin and building up an export trade with the Far East. Under the measure, the producers as well as the meat processors will be represented on the proposed advisory committees. An examination of the various interests which will be represented on the committees shows that the Government is well aware of the need to safeguard the interests of the producers by making adequate provision in respect of all phases of the industry from the production to the export stage. have It is the duty of the Parliament to concern itself with production. The food producer must be secured in his farming pursuits not only from the point of view of remuneration, but also by making con-. ditions for him and his family more attractive, particularly in sparsely settled areas, so that the younger generation of farmers will not be inclined to drift to the cities in order to find more congenial employment. In order to achieve this objective the. Government, no doubt, will find it necessary from time to time to assist the meat industry financially and to place at the disposal of producers scientific advisers thus giving them access to the very latest information regarding developments in the meat industry parlarge quantities of meat to 'the United Kingdom market. I refer to the United States of America and South American countries which, in the past, have enjoyed a considerable advantage over meat producers in Australia, because they jhave been able to finance the importation of high priced stud stock from England which is the home of the stud stock industry. Our primary producers have not been able to compete for such stud stock. Consequently, they have laboured under a great handicap. The Government of New South Wales has, within the limitations of its powers, been very helpful in this respect. Recently, it sent delegations overseas to purchase stud sheep and cattle in England, particularly beef cattle -The Commonwealth could profitably co-ordinate",27,Scully
65,Mr Mcewen,The honourable mem,28,Scully
66,Mr Breen,"Perhaps, Ithe-efforts of the various States in that direction with a view to obtaining fpr ' A-ustralia'high priced stock fromEngland for the purpose of improving our strains. It-would thus lay the foundation .of a sound export trade in beef cattle. We have done very well in an ancillary branch of the meat industry as the result of adopting that policy. I refer to the inutton industry as a phase of the woolgrowing industry. Up to date, hpwever, we. have not made any progress in the direction of the encouragement of the beef cattle industry, mainly because we lacked stud stock comparable with that obtained by producers in the United States of America and South American countries. English press reports reveal that frequently prices of from £10,000 to £20,000 are paidfor stud bulls. Veryfew Australian producers could afford to pay those prices, although some patriotically-minded men engaged in the livestock industry and several commercial interests have spent large sums of money on' imported stud stock. However, for want of encouragement, and having regard to the limited results which would accrue to the industry generally from individual efforts, even ' these interests appear to have become discouraged; Recently some stud stock was imported into New South Wales from the United States of America, and the interests responsible are doing excellent work. I suggest that the proposed committee should direct their attention to this phase of the industry, because, I repeat, that that is the only way to lay a solid foundation for a prosperous live-stock industry capable of building up a sound export trade. . Sitting suspended from 1240 to 2.15 p.m. [2.15] -The principal purpose of the Meat Export Control Bill is to control the sale of meat in bulk to Great Britain until the end of 1948. One provision abolishes the original Australian Meat Board, and the Minister did not explain the reason for that proposal. Naturally, the Commonwealth requires some control over a transaction involving finance to the amount of £20,000,000 a year. But the proceeds from the large sale to the United Kingdom will be the property of' Australian, meat producers, and con} sequently, they have a definite interest in the-bill. This, transaction is further evi-: dence .of the great value of the British market to the primary producers of Australia'. The purchase price issatisfactory to Great Britain and to Australian meat producers. Under .the agreement, the Commonwealth Government will act as agent for the British Government, and, therefore, must exercise in some respects a guiding hand iu the fulfilment of the agreement. Whilst the Government should possess a measure of control, it should not have complete authority, as the bill envisages. Proposed new section 5 provides that the composition of the Australian Meat Board shall be as follows:> (a) three members to represent the lamb producers of Australia; (6) one member to represent the mutton producers of Australia; (c) two members tp. represent the beef.producers of Australia; (d) one member to represent the pig pro. ducers of Australia; .. (e) two members to represent meat exporting companies of Australia; (/) one member to represent publicly owned abattoirs and freezing works which deal .with meat or meat products for . export from Australia; (p) one' member to represent employees engaged in the slaughter and preparation of meat or meat products for export; and ' --(k) one member to represent the Commonwealth Government. The Minister will select from a panel of names submitted to him by the producers in various sections of the meat industry the three members to represent the lamb .producers, the member to represent the mutton producers, thetwo members to represent the beef producers and the member to represent the pig producers. Why should not the meat producers themselves have the right actually to select their own representatives? Why should the Minister possess that power? The honourable gentleman failed to explain that. One member of the board will represent the publicly-owned abattoirs and freezing works. I do not object to that proposal. Finally, one member will represent the Commonwealth Government, and he will be the chairman of the board. WhilstI agree that the Commonwealth should be represented on the Australian Meat Board; I contend",28,Scully
67,Mr Bernard Corser (Wide Bay),"that the chairman, who will be the Government's nominee, should'not have the right to veto the desires and decisions of the board. will not have that power. prove that my statement is correct. Seven of the twelve members of the board will represent various sections of meat-producers, and the chairman will be the nominee of the Minister. I direct attention to proposed new sub-section 5A of section 10 of the principal actI f tlie person presiding at a meeting of the Board dissents from any decision of the Board, signifies at tlie meeting to the other members present in person his intention to bring his dissent to the notice of the Minister and, within twenty-four hours after the close of the meeting,"" transmits to the Minister notice of his dissent together with f u l l particulars of the decision, effect shall not be given to the decision unless. the Minister approves oi the decision (whether w it h or without variation) and, . if the Minister approves of the decision subject to a variation, the decision so approved shall he deemed to be the decision of the Board. Therefore, what purport to be the decisions of the board , may be the decisions of the Minister. Obviously if the chair_man and the Minister disagree with the view of a majority of members of the board, they may override it. cised, not by the chairman, but by the Minister. makes the position even worse than I suspected. The Chairman will report his objection to the Minister, who will operate the veto. The meat producers consider that the chairman of the board should be a meat producer. The control of a trade union is not vested in a Minister's . representative, a person who, not being a worker, is foisted upon the organization. If a decision of the union so constituted did not meet with the approval of the chairman, he could approach the Minister who might not necessarily be in sympathy with the aims of the organization, and request him to veto it. The Minister's decision would be final. No industrial . organization would accept that control and I fail to understand why this power is being granted to the chairman of the Australian Meat Board. The power of veto is an idea of the Soviet, which is using it extensively against the interests of other members of the United Nations,, perhaps with the exception of Poland and a few other satellites of Russia. Now, the Government is introducing, the veto principle into Commonwealth legislation. I oppose it, because it is too drastic and unfair. What purpose is served by givingto meat producers a majority of the representatives of this board, if the chairman has the right to veto its decision and the Minister may proclaim some other decision which shall be deemed to be the decision of the board ? Such a position would be most undesirable. The honourable member for Calare( Mr Breen) claimed that this legislation will be in the best interests of the meat-producers. He said that it provided for the organization of the meat industry and for industrial peace. No such provisions are included in this bill or in the principal act. The main feature of the bill is the alteration of the constitution of the board in such , a way as to remove its power. The remainder of the bill deals with the sale of meat to Great Britain until 194S. It has no more relation to peace in the meat industry than it has to peace in the coal-mining industry, although we have recently seen in country districts, particularly those which have been stricken by drought, examples of the dire distress caused amongst growers of beef, mutton and lamb by strikes in meat-works. The honourable member for Calare said that the bill would give to the Minister the right to bring before this House from time to time, for the purpose of review, any decisions of the board which might react against the best interests of the nation'.. There is no provision in the bill requiring parliamentary approval of the Minister's veto of any decisions made by the board. The Minister will have authority to act. ' without reference to the Parliament. He Will be able to make decisions, with the assistance of public servants in his department, and put them into effect; immediately. The producers, who will be represented by a: majority of members of the hoard, would never want to do anything that would react against the interosts of the nation. The prosperity of every primary industry is closely linked:",29,Scully

No section of the community is more seized of the importance of promoting the interests of the nation than that section which grows primary products for export. If we seek those who are likely to injure the interests ball"" with the Commonwealth because it of the nation, we will find them in the secondary industries, amongst the meat workers and the-waterside workers, who have done so much to retard production. The honourable member for Calare admitted that the Minister will have power to control the industry under this bill. aud the Parliament will have no such power. Therefore this measure is a .step towards socializing the industry. Although the producers will be able to make, through the board, suggestions for the benefit of the industry, the Minister, having the right of veto, will be able to implement only such suggestions as he considers to he of advantage from a socialistic point of view. The destiny of the industry will thus be subject to the political opinions of the Minister. The honourable member for Calare also said that the bill would give to the Minister power over the production and distribution of meat. In fact, the bill does not refer to any such power. It refers to proconnecting my remarks with the stateduction and distribution only in relation to the contract with Great Britain. The honourable member claimed that Australian meat came a "" very had second "" in the world's markets. Presumably he referred to its quality. He mentioned the Northern Territory, but I point out that half of Australia's beef is produced in Queensland and that Northern Terri-' tory producers have little to do with direct export trade. The Northern Territory's chief role is that of a producer of store stock. The honourable member spoke of the need for providing scientific assistance for the industry and of the importance of killing cattle in the Northern Territory, instead of driving stock long distances to Queensland killing centres, and even to New South Wales, thus causing deterioration of the quality of the beef. The producers are not to blame for the fact that meat cannot be processed at Vestey's works in the Northern Territory. The works had to be closed because of continued industrial trouble and losses. The Government should make the unions obey industrial law, so that Vestey's works may be re-opened, enabling meat to be processed there and shipped to the world's markets, in good condition. The honourable member for Calare also said that Queensland was not "" playing was not prepared to do its part in completing the railway link between western Queensland and the rail head at Bourke to enable cattle to reach the market in better condition than at present. The provision of means for getting cattle from the Northern Territory to New The primary producer South Wales is not within the province of the Government of Queensland. The holders of large areas devoted to cattle raising in the Northern Territory have extensive holding and fattening country throughout Queensland. The Commonwealth should improve the water facilities for travelling stock, in order that they may arrive at their destination in the best possible condition. That applies particularly to the dry areas of the back fcuntry. stock is not relevant to the bill. ment of the honourable member for Calare. The marketing of stockin the best possible condition has considerable bearing on the bill. has ruled otherwise. Minister's reference to the appointment of State committees would lead one to believe that an extra facility is being provided for the benefit of the fjtates.. He has specified the nature of certain control that is to be exercised.

92,Mr Abbott (2tew England) [2.40],"taken, those difficulties would have been smoothed out. As to the composition of. the board, no provision is found in the bill to limit tlie tenure of office of the members. The measure states that they shall be appointed by the Governor General, in accordance with the provisions of proposed new section 5. It is entirely wrong to appoint members of a board without giving the people whose, interests they represent the right to express their views concerning the representation. I fail to realize why the Government maintains opposition to the election of representa* tives. Surely this is a democracy' in which the will of the people should be expressed from time to time. If board members are to be appointed merely at the pleasure of the Governor General, whicb means at the will of the government of the day, they may become completely out of touch with the interests which they are supposed to represent, and become mere automatons of the Government. For that reason, I believe it to be wrong that members should be appointed and. hold office at the pleasure of the Governor General. able member suggest as a reasonable term? One year is too short, but every three years members should come up for election by the bodies which originally' nominated them. not be too long? members of this House are elected for three years, and that term"" ought to be long enough for the proposed board. The bill provides that each member of the board shall be appointed from representatives nominated by the Graziers Federal Council of Australia or the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, or any other body approved by the Minister. I agree that the two bodies specifically named represent most of the meat producers of Australia, and there is nothing to stop those who are not already members from joining one or the other of them. producers now outside those organizations should affiliate with one of them. suggestion.. One of those bodies may represent certain interests, while the other represents certain other interests,, but between them they represent all the producers. However, I do not like the words ""'or any other body approved by the Minister "". meet a possible emergency, or to enable us to remedy an injustice. moment believe that the present Minister would use this provision improperly, but it is possible-that some future Minister, of whatever political colour, might even arrange for the creation of bogus bodies of producers, or for the representation of a body, the membership of which was confined .to one State, and thereby perpetrate an injustice against the producers of other States. The bill provides that the board shall have on it seven producer representatives, and if some future Minister were to give representation to a body with members in one State only it would be prejudicial to the interests of producers in other States. I suggest, therefore, that the Minister might accept provision, read "" or any other body of producers federally constituted"". I recognize that the machinery for the constitution of the board must be flexible. If the representatives of the producers get out of touch"" with the industry it should be possible for some other body to be constituted and obtain representation, but it should be a federal body. The Minister, in his second-reading speech, conceded this principle, because he said that the persons nominated for appointment to the board must be nominated by the producers' organizations constituted oh a Commonwealth basis. This stipulation, however, is not made in the bill itself. Clause9 of the bill is as follows:Section twelve of the Principal Act is repealed and the following section inserted in its stead: ""12 (1.) In order to assist the Board iu carrying out its functions under this'Act; the Minister may appoint for each State a Meat. Advisory Committee.",33,Scully

' (3.) 'Ihe members of any such Committee shall hold office during the pleasure of the Minister and shall be paid fees and allowances At such rates as the Minister determines."". I suggest that it would have been better if the constitution of the State committees had been more clearly denned. believe that on. them, as on the federalbody, there should be a majority of producers. I do not know whether that is what the Minister intends. the producer-members of the State committees should be elected by the State bodies affiliated to the federal primary' producers organizations, and provision for this should be made in the bill, Reverting to the constitution of the Australian Meat Board, I point out that, the bill provides that one member shall represent the Commonwealth Government, and I maintain that he should be a producer-member. The ideal man would be one who had been actively engaged in primary production, or one who is still so engaged, and who, during the war, served as a temporary officer with the Department of Commerce or some other Government department. Thus, he would have gained administrative experience, and would yet have a practical knowledge -of .the meat industry. Such a combination would be ideal, and would be helpful both to the Government and to the producers. I turn now to the very contentious clause 7, paragraph .c, which provides that' section 10 of the principal act shall be amended(c) by inserting after sub-section .(5.) the following sub-section:"" ( 5 A . ) If the person presiding at a meeting of the Board dissents from any decision of the Board, signifies at the meeting to the other members present in person his intention to bring his dissent to the notice of the Minister and within twenty-four hours after the close of the meeting, transmits to the. Minister .notice of his dissent together with f u l l particulars of the decision, effect shall not be given to the decision unless the Minister approves of the decision (whether with or without variation) and, if the Minister approves of the decision subject to a variation, the decision so approved shall be deemed to be the decision of the Board."". This is the provision which arms the chairman of the board with the power of veto. I know that the Minister claims that the Commonwealth is so deeply in-' volved in this scheme, being liable for the expenditure annually of an amount of £20,000,000, that it must reserve this right of veto on a point of principle, or upon any matter having a bearing upon I financial losses or gains. I do not know exactly what the Minister meant by a point of principle; he did not elaborate it. I can understand ""his fear that the board might involve the Government, as the agent of the British Government in the purchase of this enormous quantity of meat, in financial commitments which he did not believe to be warranted and which accordingly the Government considers it should have the right to veto. What is particularly worrying the producers' representatives is the final line in the clause, which readsThe decision so approved shall be deemed to be the decision of the board. that reasonably clear in the subsequent discussions I have had with representatives of the Graziers Council and others. I then agreed that the clause might be amended in such a way as to make it clear that when a Minister exercises his power of veto to interfere with a decision of the board, whilst such decision would remain in essence a decision of the board, it would be clearly understood that the onus of responsibility was entirely upon the Minister. The language in which the clause is at present expressed is the usual technical language used in measures of this kind. In no circumstances would a decision so arrived at be considered as a definite decision of the board itself. perfectly clear many of the objections of producers to the wording of the clause as it stands at present would be overcome. it is possible to amend the clause in such a way as to coincide with the wishes of the honourable member and of the representatives of the Graziers Association in that respect.",34,Scully
101,Mr Scully,It is.,35,Scully

104,""" Mr Abbott",If that were made,35,Scully
105,Mr Scully,"I shall ascertain whether: in that, for legal purposes, such a decision may have to be regarded as a decision of the board. However, I see no insuperable difficulty in so rewording the clause as to make it clear that in such cases the Minister, and not the board, is clearly responsible The representatives of the producers on the board hold office at the will of the Governor General who, in turn, is guided by the recommendation of the Minister of. the day, and thus they have no security of tenure, even for three years They should be appointed for at least three years and have the right to nominate for re -election. If these two important matters were cleared up most of the objections that the producers have to this measure would be overcome. Wide powers are proposed, to be given to the board under clause 14, and I am in entire agreement with the amendment which was forecast, by the honourable member for Deakin( Mr Hutchinson). The clause provides. Section., sixteen of the Principal Act is amended by inserting after paragraph .(d) the following'word arid paragraph:"" ; aiid (e) on behalf of the Commonwealth and subject to any directions of the Minister.(i') to purchase any meat, meat productor edible offal; ( i i ) to sell any meat, meat product ; or edible offal; or ( i i i ) to manage . and . control all .' niatters connected with the handling, storage, protection, ' treatment, transfer and shipment of. any meat, meat product or edible offal purchased by the Commonwealth,"". No limitation whatever is imposed hy that., clause. It . may be still in operation long after the expiration of the contract for the sale of meat to the United .Kingdom Government, unless, provision be made for a definite date of expiry of this legislation or the clause be redrafted in accordance with the amendment, sought by the honourable member, for Deakin. If that amendment is subsequently accepted, producers' interests will be safeguarded, because the legislation' will operate ""onlyfor a period of three years. This clause enables the Minister' to override completely the members of the board.' Whether they be representatives of producers, exporters, abattoirs, or employees, they, ""may have to accept direction's .from the'-Minister without protest or objection. I do not suggest that the Minister is likely, to use unwisely these dictatorial powers,but they will enable him, if he so desires, to maintain a facade of democracy by retaining a semblance of producer-control when, in fact, at his very whim, the ; members of the board might have to act like marionettes responsive to his pulling of the strings. I trust that the Minister will accept the amendment that the honourable member for Deakin will move so that after the expiration of three years, say in June, 1949, this legislation will expire. When it is then being reconsidered, .an opportunity will be afforded to amend the clause if necessary. And the people will consider it necessary because,as democrats, they will object to the-continuance of anything that sinacks of dictatorship'. Another matter which reaches the very crux of the bill is the block .sale of .'meat exported from Australia during'the next 1 three years: The total .amount of beef, -mutton' and -lamb that will be exported will-run into many millions-of pounds . 1 The agreement under-which these exports are to be sold to the United Kingdom; Government is to operate for three yefirs. What is worrying ine about .it is whether', during the operation of the agreement^ sufficient opportunities will be taken to explore thepossibilities of obtaining other markets for our meat. I found when the American troops came into this country, early in 1942, their dietary scale Was vastly different from bur own. We were told by responsible American Army officers' that , the American people would not live on the kind of foods to which we had become accustomed. They were pigfood eaters and; to 'a lesser degree; bjeef eaters. However, we. found that, subr sequently,. whilstnone of them would; eat mutton, many of them acquired a liking for Australian lamb. The taste for Australian lamb grew upon them so rapidly that many.preferred lamb to the ""pig products to which they .had formerly been accustomed..' This raises the possibility that there exists in the United States of America and in Canada a big potential marketfor Australian lamb. One can almost envisage a possible opening of a market in South American republics, as the standard of living in those countries is raised.. And thus some useful work, may",35,Scully
106,Mr Abbott,"A difficulty may arise""be found for our representatives in those -countries who are now merely disporting . themselves there at the Government's expense. I have not the faith some people have in the Government's ability to orpen up new avenues for the sale of our surplus meat, or in civil servants having'the necessary initiative or specialized knowledge that private enterprise has to find new markets for our exportable surplus. -Despite the three-year agreement with -Great Britain, without doubt a fight will develop' for markets, and at the conclusion of the agreement Great Britain may not be able to renew it because of its -commitment, as the result of its loan from the United States of America, to increase its exports by 75 per cent, above the pre-war level. Consequently, Great Britain may be compelled to divert its import trade from this country to countries that will freely accept its exports. I therefore hope that, Australia will develop new markets; overseas. The honourable member for Calare( Mr Breen) referred to the f oss.ibilities of the market in the East, realize that the purchasing power of the Eastern, races is small at present, but during the war India became a great creditor country, and, with an improve^ ment .of the living, standards of its people, ment of boards to foster the marketing there ought to be a possibility of our developing -a market in India for our meat, despite tbe prejudices of the Indian peoples .against food not killed and prepared by people of their religions. I agree that, this bill is necessary to carry out the terms of the agreement, hut certain' of its provisions are anathema to the meat producers, and I feel sure that the Minister for. Commerce and Agriculture, after having given further consideration; to them, will accept the amendments that have been foreshadowed on this side. not have spoken on this bill but for the .unless Tasmania has. direct representafact, that, the proposed constitution of the tion on the Meat Board, the interests of Australian Meat Board is a live question in Tasmania. The Tasmanian meat the fat-lamb raisers in .Tasmania will: be producers are not at all satisfied with it, prejudiced. . is not to be on a State basis. Some"" pose of the Meat Export Control Bill is years ago, the Tasmanian Parliament to reconstitute the ' Australian Meat and primary producers expended a Board with greater powers than' it large amount of money on the developpossesses under the principal act. In mentof the fertile lands in the northern deed, its powers will be so great that it part of the' State and concentrated, on will almost entirely control the' meat ; producing lambs for export. The lambs have no superior in Australia, but only a small quantity is exported. The exporters are fearful that the smallness of the Tasmanian trade in comparison with that of other States may result in their escaping the attention of the board and that their"" industry may easily be jeopardized, unless they have representation on the board. The proposed board will consist of twelve members, most of whom will be representatives of the producers, but the representation is not to be on a State basis. Proposed new section 12 shows that the Ministery is aware that State interests must be met, because it providesIn order to assist the board in carrying out its functions under this act, the Minister may appoint for each State a Meat Advisory Committee By the use of that word "" may"", the ^clause provides that it is not incumbent on the Minister to appoint State committees, but it would be interesting to know why that clause is in the bill, unless he intends to consider the interests of the States. I should like the Minister, in his speech in reply, to indicate the broad principles that guide Him in the appointof Australian commodities overseas, because it appears'-that, in this' Stateridden country of ours, the States with the greater producing power are apt to receive such consideration that the interests of the other' States may be jeopardized. I entertain that fear in -regard to Tasmania. I should like to know why that State is denied representation on the Meat Board but is granted representation on other marketing boards.'

My remarks will be directed to the constitution and powers of the board and the power of veto reposed in the chairman, which will probably be exercised in collaboration with the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. I agree that the existing board, with its 21 members, may be somewhat unwieldy, but, as the law stands, each State is represented on it. The principal act provides that the board shall consist of one member in respect of each State to represent the stock producers of the State. Several other interests are represented. The size of that number of voters. At the appropriate board may not be conducive to good business, but I do not agree that the proposed board should be composed on a production basis. In the production of lambs and cattle each State has its own problems and should have direct representation on the board. If that representation were granted it would not be necessary to enlarge the board. The Minister should divide the representation of the various sections of the meat industry between the representatives of the States. I have yet to learn of a board on which State representation has not been entirely satisfactory. The present proposal would allow the larger States to dominate the position, and that would lead to the development of a completely unsatisfactory and unjustifiable state of affairs. Tasmania does not produce so many lambs as some of the other States do, but it certainly produces lambs of high quality. It has been, said-by those qualified to express an throughout the Commonwealth This is opinion that some of the best lambs grown .in Australia are grown in Tasmania.. 1 am glad that the honourable dorses that statement with his "" Hear, hears"". The Tasmanian lamb is said to equal the famous Canterbury lamb of New Zealand better. ample opportunity to expand this vast industry. I believe that the production of fat lambs will increase considerably. Sooner or later, export quotas will be imposed. At the moment, that is not likely, but I remind the House that in 1939, the United Kingdom was about to advise that only a prescribed quantity of lamb could be accepted. Only the outbreak of war saved the industry from a' severe setback. If , at some future date, export quotas be imposed, the less populous States will be at the mercy of the more populous States. The producers of the smaller States with 'their own peculiar problems, will be compelled to take the crumbs that fall from the table of the large producers in the larger States, who will dominate the position. I regret that the Government, in this bill, is pandering to the more populous States, which have the largest time, I shall submit an amendment providing for the continuance of State representation, as on the original Australian Meat Board. In my opinion, that will not necessarily increase the personnel of the new board. The bill provides that the . Australian Meat Board shall have power, on behalf of the Commonwealth and subject to any directions of the Minister(i) to purchase any meat, meat product or edible offal; ( i i ) to sell any meat, meat product or edible offal; or ( i i i ) to manage and control all. matters connected with the handling, storage, protection, treatment, transfer and shipment of any meat, meat product or edible offal purchased by the Commonwealth. The House will agree that those-powers are very extensive, especially when the board does not represent meat producers evidence of socialist control: The-chairman of the board will have almost dictatorial powers. I warn the Minister that the power of veto has caused many international headaches recently, and that the power of veto which will be vested in the chairman of the Australian Meat Board* will cause many headaches in the meat industry. That the chairman of the board will possess dictatorial powers is proved by proposed new sub-section 5A of section 10 of the principal actI f the person presiding at a meeting of the Board dissents from any decision of the Board, signifies at the meeting to the otlier members present in person his intention to bring his dissent tn the notice of the Minister and, within twenty-four hours after the close of the meeting, transmits to the Minister notice of his dissent together with f u l l particulars of the decision, effect shall not he given tp the decision",37,Scully

Therefore, what purports to be the decision of the board may, in reality, be the decision of the Minister. I believe in producer control, but this bill does not provide for it. government control through the Minister. members of the board will represent various sections of the meat industry, but I remind honourable members that the board will really be only an advisory body. The chairman will be the lord high executioner. He will be able to veto any decision of the board with which he disagrees. If a decision of the board is not acceptable, the Minister may, through the chairman, or the chairman may, in collaboration with the Minister, veto it. The situation reminds me of a conversation between a young' man and woman who were to be married. The young man said: ""Before we go any farther, let us have an agreement so that there shall be no misunderstanding after we are married. ""Wben we agree on any matter in future, you shall have your way; but when we disagree, I shall have my way. That is only fair "". That proposal was just as fair as is this provision in the bill. the quantity of meat and other I am glad to have the Minister's assurance that he will endeavour suitably to amend this obnoxious provision. I appreciate his desire to review any decision of the board involving government finance, because, after all, the Parliament is the supreme authority and controls'the public purse. However, I hope that he will be able to. prepare an acceptable amendment so that the board shall not he subservient to the dictatorial powers of a chairman. I am glad that the debate on this bill enables me to .pay a well-deserved tribute to the wonderfully efficient work that has been done by the Australian Meat Board over a period of years, especially by the Controller of Meat Supplies, Mr Tonkin, during the last four years, and of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, -Messrs. Murphy and McCarthy, who assisted to inaugurate this policy many years ago. Australia is indebted to those gentlemen, as I shall later show. administer during the war period than the meat industry, and in those years Mr Tonkin displayed extraordinary tact and courage in performing his duties. He was always ready to obtain the benefit of the advice and experience of those? capable of assisting him Under most difficult conditions, he succeeded in doing a very good job, hampered as he. was by other circumstances entirely beyond his control. Those other circumstances include the recent strike of meat employees in Queensland, which caused the loss of many thousands of tons of export beef for Great Britain, and the refusal of slaughtermen at various times to kill sheep and cattle. As the result of their attitude, the stock often died of starvation after having heen sent to the abattoirs. Those factors were outside Mr Tonkin's control.* In my opinion, the rationing of meat in Australia should have been placed under the authority of the Controller of Meat Supplies. Prom Dr. Clements, chairman of the Nutrition Committee, which the Government appointed in 1945 to examine the position, we learn that, despite rationing, and probably because of the existence of black markets,, commodities consumed in Australia, with the sole exception of butter, has-actually increased since the introduction of -rationing. That had a detrimental effect on the quantity of meat that we in Australia were able to export to our starving kinsmen in Great Britain, and to other countries. As the Controller and the existing Meat Board have done such. a good job, one would have thought that the Minister would have given strong reasons for proposing the changes that are now being suggested, but no adequate reasons have been given for the new policy. Instead of receiving a pat on the back, the Controller of Meat Supplies and his Board are getting a kick. I am reminded of the treatment meted out to the Commonwealth Bank Board which, after having performed fine Work, was summarily dismissed.

The proposed, new board will consist whom seven will represent producers, and five non-producers, one pf whom will be a government member and chairman of the board. I have seen a suggestion, though I do not know whether it had official basis, that there may be two more government appointees who will act in a 'temporary capacity, one to represent the Prices Commission, and the other the rationing authority. I would not mind this, if it were not for the fact that the final control will rest with the chairman of the board. I am favorable to the ultimate control of these industries resting with a Minister who is responsible to Parliament, but ' in my opinion it is a long step backward for Sir Earle Page. the government member not -only -t& be made chairman but also to have'a' right of veto. The other eleven' member's' of the board may be against the chairman and. they may be more experienced in the details of the industry"" than he; yet. he is to have the right of veto. Itwill pay us to examine... for a few moments the record of the : Australian Meat Control Board in order to remind ourselves of what it has been, able to do. This should be done before we approve of radical changes. I am not strongly opposed to the changes that have been suggested, with the exception that I entirely disagree , with the placing of the . power of. veto in the hands of the chairman. We should take all .possible care to satisfy!., ourselves that we, do not agree to .anything-that will interfere'with theproper working of the board or the expansion of the Australian meat industry. 'The Australian MeatBoard has always worked in .the closest association, with the Department of Commerce and-Agriculture-of .which it is an integral part; and if has secured some splendid results for the-Australian me'at industry. With the whole-hearted' support of the 'government of -the day it was able,-in 19.36, to secure a substantial restriction of imports of meat from Argentina ' under.' the Anglo-Argentine Agreement. Argentina Most of those was our principal competitoron the British market. The board secured in 1937 a reduction of the 1935 Argentina quota of chilled' beef by 138,700 cWt., representing 2 per cent.; it also secured of twelve representatives of a reduction of the 1937 quota by an additional 138,700cwt. In 1939 it secured the same concession, provided that the total for that year should not be less than 6,595,000 cwt., which was the 1935 total, less 5 per cent. At the time that this substantial cut was. made in imports of chilled' beef from Argentina it was necessary to do everything possible to. encourage imports of chilled beef from Australia to Great Britain, scientific improvements having been made which rendered it possible for us to export our product in a competitive condition. It is true that our meat could riot reach the British market with quite the same bloom that could be retained on the more quickly transported chilled meat from Argentina^but the point is that wo were able, .to secure the business. The Government and :the. board .was also -able to obtain ' a'.'duty of three farthings per lb. ' oh chilled' beef from -Argentina, which',. previously, had been admitted duty., free. LaterI shall give figures which will indicate a steady growth of exports of Australian meat to Great Britain,'which enabled'us to take such a substantial part in providing meat for the people of Great Britain during the first two or three years of the war, : when the U-boat menace was at its height and the difficulties in securing shipping space for exports to Britain seemed to be -almost insuperable.' In addition the board secured the following restrictions of imports from, .Argentina :Frozen beef, 124,000 cw.t., and a duty of Jd. (two-thirds of a penny) per lb.,. plus 20 per cent, ad valorem. Frozen beef offal's, not less than 5.6 per cent, -of the total current importsof chilled and frozen, plus 20'-. per cent, ad .valorem. Canned beef, 605,600 cwt., a slight reduction on the 1935 figures,, plus 20' per. cent, ad valorem. 'Frozen mutton and lamb, 1937-886,00 0 cwt. (no reduction) free; 1938-797;4Q 0 cwt., 10 per cent, reduction,' free: .' ' -' ""Frozen pork,186,800 cwt., same' as 1935 . total, free. , -When I was in England in .1938 I was able to make contracts on behalf of the Australian Government for the supply to Great Britain in war-time of 240,000 tons of meat per annum, which is roughly the average quantity that we had been exporting for the last four or five years. Because of the good season, and the economies it was possible to make, we were able to send to England during the first year of the war not only the 240,000 tons we had contracted to supply but also an additional 50,000 tons, which proved of great value. The shipments consisted of beef, mutton, lamb and pork. Then, difficulties arose in the provision of the necessary shipping, with the result that we were unable to despatch all that the British people desired us to send. Thus, the Meat Export Control Board and the Government were confronted with the necessity to reorganize meat processing in Australia. The first step was to extend the cold storage facilities in this J country. During 1940 and . 1941, the [107] . cold storage space provided for all purposes was.increased ,by 500,000 tons, and & considerable portion .of it was devoted * to the storage of meat. That enabled us to hold a tremendous quantity of meat in. this country until refrigerated shipping space became available, as it -fortunately did late in 1941. Simultaneously, the production of canned meats was increased, from 15,000 tons in 1940 to. a maximum of 90,000 tons in 1945. That was one of our great achievements during the war period. The advantage of canned meat, compared with frozen or chilled meat, was that it did not require insulated shipping space, and could be carried in ordinary cargo vessels. It was revealed during the war that vessels with insulated space were equipped with engines that gave them a speed of 20 or 21 knots an hour. When the Navy and Army authorities had compared this speed with that pf ordinary liners, they commandeered most of these vessels for the transport of troops, and thus correspondingly reduced the tonnage of cold storage space available for the shipment . . . . . of perishable food, which then had to be transported ' in ordinary merchantmen. The Meat Export Control Board did good work during that period in effecting reorganization. It also attempted dehydration. . The experiments begun while I was Minister for Commerce were continued by the present Minister. I regret that they were'not wholly successful. Although dehydrated foods were produced, they were not very palatable. As only the poorer stock was used, the loss was not great. The'effort was well worthwhile,however, because it ensured to the people of Great Britain an increase of the number of calories they consumed, and thus assisted them to resist the advancing foe. . A plan for dealing with pig-meats also was introduced, and proved of very great value to Australia. In the first and second years of the war, the British Government could not decide exactly what pork or bacon it desired, and repeatedly varied the weight from high to low and vice versa. The increase of weight from 120 to 180 lb. was an easv matter, but the reverse was the case when a reduction in the weight of -carcasses was fought'by Great Britain. The snhipct was canvassed at some length and final agreement on standard weight was reached. It was essential that a plan should be produced which would permit Australia to make continuous progress in the pig industry under stabilized conditions. I trust"" that the . industry has now reached a stage of efficiency from which it will not be allowed to deteriorate. I fear, however, that if the dairying industry cannot attain to its rightful place, the pig industry cannot be maintained because the skimmed milk feeds so many pigs. Bacon is easily transported; consequently, our aim should be to produce it. Figures given by the Minister reveal that the number of dairv cows has decreased in the last six years by 250,000, and the number of dairy calves ' under one year old by 120,000, compared with the previous year. He has said that at least five years will be needed to restore production to the pre-war level. This emphasizes the necessity for fixing the prices of butter and other commodities produced on dairy farms at such a figure that there will be an incentive to increase production. The previous meat organization differed from that now proposed, in that it was based on a State instead of an industry conception. It will be interesting to see whether the present proposal will prove more satisfactory. I am prepared to support any plan that is properly based, but am most strongly opposed to the proposal in regard to a veto. I wish to deal at some length with the consiimption of meat in Australia. seems a strange anomaly that whilst the people of Britain have to be content with half a pound of meat a week, Australians are permitted to eat 3J lb. or 4 lb. The effect of rationing has been rather to make people coupon-conscious. Having coupons, they consider that they must use them. They regard them as more difficult to obtain than the money that is needed to purchase meat. The Nutrition Committee set up by the Government to examine a cross-section of 3,000 families in Australia, found that their consumption of meat in November, 1945, was substantially greater than it had been in November, 1938, despite the fact that our compatriots overseas had been practically starving. should examine, this matter Sir Earle Page. Probably the Australian Meat Board, consisting of men with a practical knowledge of production-, and wholesale and retail aspects of the meat industry, might be able to propound a scheme whereby extra meat could be sent to Great Britain, not in the dim, distant future, but immediately. That would establish widespread goodwill in Great Britain which would be of very great service to us for many years. We should do this in the interest of our future tradie with the TJinited Kingdom, quite apart from humanitarian, considerations, or the duty that we owe to. Great Britain, which stood solidly against every shock administered to it during the war, hardpressed though it was. A problem that will, worry the Australian meat producer is the market he will have for the disposal of his lamb and mutton. Under' the contract, the prices are: lamb 7\&. per lb., mutton 4£d. per lb., and beef 41s. 8d. per 100 lb. It is obvious that the value of lamb, is two-thirds greater than .that of either mutton or beef. Therefore, we should endeavour to grow and sell as much lamb as possible, and thus obtain much more money for equal weight. It has been evident for many years that only in the two great English-speaking countries, Great Britain and the United States of America, can the people afford to purchase lamb at that price. South Africa raises many sheep, and is an active competitor of It Australia in the production of wool. Canada is practically self-contained. But in the United States of America there could be a very big lamb market, which we could secure if we took proper steps to that end. I join with the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) in the hope that the new hoard will concern itself not only with the fulfilment of the contract with Great Britain, but also in taking advantage of any opportunity that may be presented to supply the United Kingdom market, alternatively with lower grades of meat and to secure entry to the American market. In conjunction with. Great' Britain, we should press for the reduction of the duty on lamb entering the United States The Government of America, in order to ensure that what clcsely. we send to that market will be sold at a reasonable price. In addition, the Ausr tralian Meat Board should closely examine the whole of our international trade relations, with a view to diverting considerable quantities of Argentina meat to European countries,which need is so greatly. The Argentina has admirable conditions for de-pasturing cattle. Its land is of high quality. Its immense rivers, such as the Eio de la Plata and the Parana, can take boats of deep draught, and this enables it to transport stock by water for hundreds of miles, l t is in comparatively close proximity to Europe. All of these factors enable it to market its beef in Europe at a much lower cost than ours. Therefore, I urge the Government to ask the board to bear this matter in mind. I wish to deal with the damage that is clone to our meat export trade by the lack of continuity of supplies. The recent strike in Queensland caused us to lose the sale of 40,000 or 50,000 tons of meat to the United Kingdom. This meat was urgently required by the people of Great Britain. Cattle which should have been slaughtered were returned to the proporties from which they had been brought, causing those properties to be overstocked. But those are not all the disadvantages that were caused. In addition, there is the lack of confidence in a continuity of supplies of Australian meat to our regular market in Britain. In Australia, the beef season lasts from February to April or May, and the lamb season from September onwards. This makes it difficult to maintain a continuous supply to the British market, and we found that it was necessary sometimes to sell our meat as Empire meat rather than as Australian, and to get other dominion countries, Canada, South Africa and New Zealand, to fill in the seasonal gaps so that we might keep the customers that we had gained by advertising. The dislocation of the meat industry by strikes not only causes immediate disto the financial responsibility pf the Comcomfort to the public here, but it also may result in a permanent loss of customers abroad. I regret that the Government has not seen fit during the recent strike do with industrial disputes. V trial disputes reduce supplies, and make it impossible to load ships to capacity. -Order! cussing the shipment of supplies of meat to Great Britain. If it becomes neces. sary to pay higher shipping freights because strikes have made it impossible to fill the refrigerated space on the ships trading between Australia and Great Britain, the cost of marketing will be increased, and the effect of the proposed levy will be nullified. I come now to the power of veto, which it is proposed to bestow upon the chairman of the.board, and I confess that I can see no reason for it. The money which the board is to handle will be the property of-the persons who produce the meat. It will represent the purchase price of the meat which they sell overseas, and surely they are entitled to an effective say in its disposal. The Government will incur liability only if , for instance, it enters into a contract to supply meat for, say, two years at a certain price, and is then unable; because of scarcity or of industrial dislocation, to obtain supplies at a price that would enable it to fulfil its contract without loss. However, it is provided that there shall be three Government representatives on the board who may be expected to watch the Government's interests, and the continuity of the board's marketing policy should be such as to reduce losses to a minimum. It seems absurd to claim virtue for appointing a board which will have on it a majority of producers' representatives, and then to insert in the bill a provision that one man out of the twelve on the board may override the wishes of the other eleven. I hope' that in the committee stage, the Government will agree to limit this power of veto to certain specific matters relating monwealth, a responsibility which can never be important in relation to the total operations of the board. hill proposes to carry into peace-time the general functions and organization of the meat control authority which",39,Scully

120,Mr Ryan (Flinders) [4.7],"Thisoperated during the war, and it proposes to clothe the new authority with greater powers. During the last few years, we have had considerable experience of meat control in Australia. The right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) paid a tribute to the good work of the officials associated with meat control, and particularly to Mr Tonkin, of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture. I agree with him as to the capacity and ability of those officials, but it would be a wild exaggeration to say that, so far as. Victoria is concerned, meat control has, during the last two years, given any satisfaction at all. In fact, I may say that the meat producers of Victoria have been extremely unhappy under the control system, and have been seeking to change it. Honourable members will recall the dispute which took place in the early part of this year, and the difficulties that arose regarding the supply of meat in Victoria. The Government and its supporters at one time blamed the producers, and at another time blamed the stock agents. Indeed, they sought to cast the blame everywhere except where it should rightly rest, namely,' with the Government. I have said' before, and I will go on saying it until I can convince the Government, that the trouble in Victoria over the supply of meat was principally due to the failure of the Government to enforce its authority during the early period. From this failure there grew up a tendency to disregard the law. I also believe that the advisers of the Government were not happily chosen. They certainly did not represent the interests that ought to be represented, and they sometimes gave bad advice. I suggest that the lessons which may be learned from the experience of the war years should be incorporated in this bill. We have an opportunity to do this now, and the opportunity may not occur again. Therefore, I hope that before the hill becomes law the Government will accept from this side of the House amendments designed to improve the measure. I believe that if it .becomes necessary at any time to organize the marketing of primary products, control should be in the hands of the producers themselves. After all, it is their produce which is being sold. They are the persons mainly Mr Ryan. concerned, and they should have complete control. This bill provides for a method of appointing the Australian Meat Export Board which is an improvement upon the method previously in operation in that there are to be seven. producer-members out of a total of twelve. If the board were to have any real control that method would bo very satisfactory, but the bill provides that the chairman, who is to be appointed by the Government, shall have power to dissent from any decision of the' board, and his dissent may he upheld by the Minister, or amended in any way that the Minister directs. I cannot .understand the reason for this.. Time and time again we have heard Government supporters affirm the principle of producer-control of marketing boards; yet now the Government proposes toinaugurate a system which ostensibly gives ""control to the producers, while in fact keeping all effective control firmly in its own hands, thus making the -wholething a mockery. Are we to have producer-control or not ? If not, the Government should say so, and we would know where we stand. I am unconvinced by £he excuse of the Minister that it is necessary that the Government should retain the power of veto because it will incur somefinancial responsibility. Surely the responsibility of the producers', whosemeat is being disposed of, will be far greater than that of the Government.. Therefore, I can see no reason why effec-. tive control should be taken out of thehands of the producers themselves. I was not present when the Wheat StabilizationBill was being debated, but that bill also provided for the setting up of a producers' board, and then nullified the effectiveness of the provision by leaving all ultimate power in the hands of the Minister. -Order! the similarity of what the Government did about the wheat board and what it proposes in relation to the meat board'. We believe that the producers should have control of their own industry, and this principle should be clearly stated in the bill itself. The bill provides that theproducers shall have a majority of seven",43,Scully
121,Mr Acting Deputy Speaker.,,44,Scully
122,Mr Ryan,"I am merely showing;to five on the board. The seven producermembers are to represent various sections of the meat trade in Australia, and there will be two representatives of the exporters, one representative of public abattoirs, .one of the employees, and one member appointed by the Government. Why are there to be two representatives of the exporters? As far as I am aware no other boards established by the Government include in their membership representatives of exporters. That is also the case in New Zealand, where the meat board is representative of producrs alone. Why should it be necessary to include in the' Australian Meat Board two representatives of the big exporting firms? If the advice of these firms be required the board may ask for it. There seems to be no reason why they should be able to influence the decisions of the board. The inclusion of representatives of the exporting firms seems to be clearly out of keeping with the whole proposal of producer control --The New Zealand Meat Board consists of six representatives of the producers, one of whom represents dairy-farmers; two govern? ment nominees,. both, of whom are pro-: ducers; and onestock and station agent, who is naturally very much concerned : with the purchase of stock. Clause4 of the bill prescribes that the member appointed tp represent the mutton producers shall, be"" selected from persons nominated by two. large organizations, namely, the Graziers-Federal Council of Australia or the; Australian Wool, and Meat Producers Federation, or any other body approved .by the. Minister. WhilstI thoroughly agree that those two great organizations should be entitled to nominate persons to represent their interests on the board, there'are, however, other organizations which have an equal if not a greater claim, to representation. 1 instance the Australian Primary Producers Union, a body which represents, I believe, a far greater number of t h e meat producers of Australia than either of the two organizations mentioned in the clause. This union has branches in four States of the Commonwealth andin Victoria alone' has 150 branches and a niembership of 10,000. Yet its claims have been completely, ignored. Recently the union-asked .the Minister to receive : a deputation to discuss the whole subject of meat control in Australia; but the Minister refused to do so. I have been at a loss to understand the reasons for his refusal and I trust that during the course of his reply to this debate he will make them clear. The Minister apparently does not realize the importance of that body which I should have thought would have been one of the first to be consulted when a bill of this kind was being framed. Representations have been made on numerous occasions that the union should be consulted, but the Minister's reply has always been in the negative. tions of that body have been adequately answered; variably been in the negative. always given. satisfactory explanation. I trust that the Minister will deal ""with this matter before the debate is concluded. ., "" . on many occasions. to understand the honourable gentleman's explanation.. '"" orable member's inability to understand my explanation would not be difficult to conceive. tions are invariably extremely hard to understand because he does not always express his convictions. I impress upon him the fact that the. two organizations mentioned in the clause cannot nominate persons adequately representative of the industry. The Minister should use his discretionary' power to accept nominations from the Australian Primary Producers Union. If he will not agree to do that, from what body is he prepared to -accept nominations? -Labour Council. .""

132,Mr Ryan,"I have studied the Newand, secondly, because it gives complete control to the meat board, which is truly representative of the primary producers of that dominion. Under the New Zealand scheme the dominion is divided up into ten districts in each of which the farmers themselves return one, two or three representatives to an electoral council which in turn elects representatives to the meat board. Every farmer with 100 or more sheep has to vote by post in the election of the electoral counthan one-half, or 1,862,586 came from cil. In my electorate' the New Zealand scheme is very strongly supported. The meat producers of Victoria have already subdivided the State into thirteen regions each of which has elected two delegates. The 26 delegates assembled in Melbourne in January last and formed a provisional meat council which in turn selected a central executive of thirteen members. Thus we have an organization already established which the Minister might call upon if he desires to institute a system along the lines of that in operation in New Zealand. However, although the organization is now complete it has received no recognition by the Government. I commend the Government to give the most earnest consideration even at this late hour to the adoption of the New Zealand scheme. The proposed representatives entirely an arbitrary one. The bill proposes that the Minister may make a selection from a panel of names submitted to him; but provision is also made that one-half of the members of the board may be selected by the Minister himself without reference to the panel of names submitted to him. Is the chairman of the board, the most important office-holder in the organization, and to whom the Government proposes to give very wide powers, including the power of veto, to be a producer? If the Minister will give the House an assurance that the chairman will be a producer the doubts and anxieties of many producers will be soothed. As far as I can gather, the bill makes no provision for State representation on the board. If regional organizations were established on the New Zealand pattern the whole of Australia would be divided into zones from which Mr Ryan. representatives would be elected, and thus the state aspect would be covered, the principal producing States perhaps having the larger representation. The claims of Victoria as a very prominent meat.exporting State, to adequate representation should receive special consideration. In its issue of the 16th February, 1946, the Pastoral Review cited figures which showed that out of. 3,336,766 carcasses of lamb exported in 1944-45, more Victoria. As regards mutton, of 450,218 carcasses, Victoria shipped 178,365. During the preceding year Victoria exported"" 2,306,392 lambs of a total of 4,013,027 exported, and 264.930 carcasses of mutton of a total Australian export of 519,920. In other words, in those two years Victoria exported more than one-half of the total sheep carcasses shipped from this country. clude sheep trucked into Victoria from southern Riverina. have'come from that area. It cannot be denied however, that the largest proportion of the lamb exported from Australia came from Victoria. Eveni f the lambs were not wholly raised in Victoria they method of selection of were fattened there. Thus that State has of the . board is a special claim for additional representation on the board. If the clause is redrafted it may be possible also to provide for representation of the Riverina district or. for an additional representativefor New South Wales. Price is perhaps the most important factor in the success of our export meat trade, and in the determination of the price of carcasses sent abroad there are many other subsidiary factors such as the value of fats and wools. An extraordinary anomaly exists in' connection with the price of tallow. I am informed on good authority that the present price of good colour inedible tallow in Argentina is approximately £120 a ton. In Australia the price up to six months ago was about £27 10s. a ton; it has since been increased to £37 6s. a ton. I cannot see why we should sell our tallow at a price substantially below world parity price, thus involving the producers of Australia in heavy lossc?. Tf they were",45,Scully
133,Mr Scully,Thos e figures would in,46,Scully
134,Mr Ryan,"Some of the sheep wouldable to secure for themselves the difference between the Australian price and the world parity price they could reduce the price of meat and at the same time enjoy a better all-round return for their labours. It has been estimated that if producers received world parity price for their tallow there would be an additional return to the grower of between Is. and Is 6d. in respect of each sheep sold. The extra return from cattle would be from 12s. to 25s. a head. .That would be an appreciable gain to the producer whi;h would enable reduction of meatprices. The Government ought to give serious consideration to. that. I believe that a more liberal issue of export licences would be of material assistance to the meat trade. number of licences issued are extremely small. They are held mainly by the three big meat exporting firms whose names are so well known to honourable members that I need not repeat tbem. I do not know why the licences should be concentrated in the hands of the larger firms to the exclusion of the smaller butchers. I hope that the Government will give consideration to that. As the Minister knows, Australia, as compared with, for instance, New Zealand, is extremely short of refrigeration space. The space available is again mainly in the hands of the large meat exporters, and the small butcher cannot obtain any in which to' store meat. I think I talk on lines that will be appreciated by the Minister when I suggest that the Government itself should provide refrigeration space. believes in socialism? degree in some matters. I see no reason why the Government should not establish refrigeration space if no one else is willing to do so. That has been done by the Government of New Zealand, and refrigeration space has been provided by the Government in Australia for food and other commodities. member like to see that principle extended to overseas transport? for a few points that I intend to raise in committee, I have said what I rose to' say. For the benefit of the Government, I conclude by summarizing my main points: I object to the provision for the vetoing of decisions of the Meat Board, which I regard as absolutely wrong and undemocratic and as something that the Government ought to delete from the bill. The Government has taken an extraordinary stand, in the matter of representation on ' the board, in ignoring the important Primary Producers Union. I still await an understandable explanation from the Minister of why the Government has adopted the proposed method of appointment of members of the board instead of the democratic and sound method of election by the growers adopted by the Government of New The Zealand in establishing a similar body in that dominion. Meat Export Control Bill deals with oneof the most important industries of Australia. Probably the annual value of the production of the .Austrian meat industry is greater than that of any other Australian primary industry. I have, not been able to ascertain from the Commonwealth Year-book the total annual value of. meat production-the only figures given by it relate to the value of meat exports-bu t I do not think there is much doubt that the value of .meat produced in Australia exceeds that of any other primary' product. Therefore, far-reaching legislation affecting the meat industry must be recognized as being of supreme importance. The industry is not only of great magnitude but it also presents most extraordinary diffi-' culties in the production, handling and marketing of its products. The pastoral I do to a considerable industry is not only subject to all the vicissitudes of adverse and changing seasonal conditions, but it also possesses great difficulties, some of which are peculiar to Australia. For instance, most of the sheep in Australia are bred for the primary purpose of producing wool, not meat, and the carcasses are not of high quality for butchering' purposes. Many of our cattle are bred for dairy purposes and the carcasses are also not very suitable for meat. Those difficulties are .greater in Australia than in any other meat-producing country. Then, of course, there are disabilities in",46,Scully

139,Mr Mcewen (Indi) [4.35],"The""the marketing of the meat and in ensuring that it shall be marketed on a fair competitive basis. The Australian meat industry has developed the system of' auctioning the live beast. Determination of the value of the animal at the point when its ownership passes from the produceror fattener to the butcher is made oh the -judgment of some person. It ' is a simple matter to determine the value of meat, .because it is a standard product. The formerly fairly complicated determination of wool values has been simplified by the adoption of a. table of limits. Similarly fruit and almost every other primary product present few difficulties' in the? determination of prices. But the value of meat on' the hoof is determined at auction on the judgment of men who are ""obliged to form a quick opinion of various factors that will determine the return that will be got from a carcass. A buyer has to be able to gauge not only the live weight of the beast, but also the carcass weight, what the beast will weigh when' it is slaughtered and hung. He also has to estimate the quality' of the-carcass when it is'hung. Superimposed on those two difficulties are factors which are unpredictable. The carcass value of a sheep may be reduced by bruising or by its having been bitten by a dog or prodded with a' stick on its way to market, but that damage may not be apparent to the purchaser when he is estimating its carcass value. Some carcasses that at auction appear to be suitable .for human consumption, are found, on slaughter, to be suffering disease that requires that they be condemned. A glandular condition in ewe mutton makes it. unsuitable for export to Great Britain because of British food standards, although carcasses so affected are accepted for local consumption. All those difficulties confront the butchers competing for stock at auction. On top of that there is the possibility of restricted bidding, I offer no solutions of these problems; they are inherent in the in.dustry. passing to (show that the industry is beset with great difficulties. This is -a measure to amend the Meat Export Control Act, which ""was'enacted' in ' 1935 and amended in 1938 at the instance of a government With' which I was associated. That act -"" established the 1 Australian Meat Board;"" on ""whicb the producers' representatives' are a substantial majority.' The'board has limited : authority, but it performs an important function in advising the' Government and in exercising some'cpiitrol'on the export meat trade. It has nothing' to do with the .local', trade. This' measure is also called a Meat Export Control Bill, but it contains nothing to reveal that the activities ' of the Australian Meat Board are to be confined to export meat. On the contrary,,it appears _to ine, as a layman, quite clear that the legislation will give the board unqualified authority ""to deal with any meat. The export side is by far the smaller part of the. meat trade.. If my memory is . correct, before the war' 83^ per cent, of the meat produced in Australia Was consumed locally, and 17 per cent., was exported. I believe; .that' during the war the quantity of meat exported fell to about 10 per cent, of that-produced. So the home trade is overwhelmingly the more .important. Yet this measure, which sets up a board to control the export of meat, vests the b.oard with power, which, unless the English language does not mean what I think it means, will enable it to deal with all or any meat produced in Australia. That brings me to the point that I am obliged to make. I regret that the Minister's second-reading speech was not more explanatory of this most important measure. I have carefully studied the speech several times with the knowledge of a person whose livelihood is the meat industry, but I say frankly that I have been unable to get a picture of the intended functions of the board. This Parliament should not be required to legislate on this most important subject without a complete knowledge of the purposes for which the bill has heen introduced. The Minister stated that the Australian Meat Board will have authority to expend large sums of money, but failed to explain to the House the I merely mention them in intended functions of the body. I hope that he will repair that omission when he replies to the. objections which honourable members on this side'of the chamber.",47,Scully
140,Mr Mcewen.,"have raised. It has become quite evident on this bill, as on the Wheat Export Charge Bill, that Government supporters do not propose to speak. Some of them represent rural constituencies, hut they have refrained from taking part in 'this debate just as they remained silent during the' dehate on the Wheat Export Charge Bill. -Orde r II ask the honourable member to direct his remarks to this bill. replies to the second-reading debate, he should explain to the House what the functions of the Australian Meat Board will really he. He will not satisfy us by telling us how the Government intends the board to function. The real point at issue is the authority that will be vestedin the board by this legislation. In the absence to date of an adequate explanation by the Minister, I am obliged to read the bill and interpret its provisions to the best of my ability. Ever since I have been an adult, the export value of meat has been lower than the home consumption value. Yet the export value has determined the over-all value of meat. It has not been uncommon during the last few years for deliveries of meat to the markets in Melbourne and Sydney, to exceed by 20 per cent, to 25 per cent, the local demand. Yet the effect of the surplus, no matter how small, has been to depress the whole market to the level of the export prices. The honorahle member for Corangamite ness very well, will endorse my statement. The Government would be taking a tremendous step forward if it intended, by legislative action,, to separate the values for export meat from the prevailing higher level of values ruling for meat intended for home consumption. However, the Minister did not mention this important matter which .so materially affects the prospects of the live-stock industry. Before we agree to the motion for the second reading, ' I should like to know whether the Government recognizes thatas one of the problems of the industry, and proposes to deal with it under the authority which it seeks in this bill AllI am able ;to. deduce from my study of this legislation is thai the real_ intention is not to' perpetuate the functioning of the meat export control authority, but to continue the autocratic control that has been exercised under National Security Regulations. Of course, that intention is in accord with the policy of the Australian Labour party, which is to take control of a product, although it has been produced by individuals on their own initiative, with their own capital and at their own risk, and dispose of it in accordance with Labours political and economic policies. It seems clear, from the proposal to . transfer to the new board all the authority which was' exercised by the meat' controller under the National Security Regulations that that is the intentions, of the Government. Having substantial majorities in the Senate and the Houseof Representatives, the Government is at liberty, once such a decision has been"" ' approved. by caucus, to introduce the necessary legislation and put it on the statute-book. But the Government acts unfairly when, having that intention, it does not inform the Parliament and the meat producers of the fate which awaits the industry. If the Minister proposes only to .transfer the form of the meat control under National Security Regulations to the Australian Meat Board, let him say so in plain language, and we shall know where we stand. What will heeven better, the electors will know what attitude they should adopt when, at an early date, they, are given an opportunity to voice their opinion on these matters The original board, which this bill purports to reconstitute,' functioned in an advisory capacity. It had a great .preponderance of producer-representatives. On the proposed hew and smaller board, the producers will have a small majority. The original board, which the Lyons Government established, had complete authority within the ambit of the Meat Export Control Act. The Minister informed meat producers that the reconstituted board is a present from Santa Claus, and 'will enable them to realize one of their earliest aspirations, namely, to have a board with producercontrol. The proposed board is a sham, a farce and a trick. Incorporated in the bill by -subtle wording are provisions",48,Scully

Therefore, let us be sure that the meat producers understand what they will get from the Minister's Christmas stocking. Tlie board will not have any authority, and behind this screen the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, will sit, not readily visible to the producers, but with his hands on the levers controlling the meat and wheat industries. I have never known of legislation which went further to socialize great Australian industries. I listened to lengthy debates in this House about the socialization of interstate airlines and the nationalization of banking but the effect of those bills was trifling compared with the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill and the Meat ExportControl Bill. Section 16 of the Meat Export Control Act, as amended, will provide'The' board shall have power on behalf of' the Coiiiiniimvealth and .subject to any direction of the Minister. . .. That excludes the' board, and establishes ihe-authority of the Minister(i) to purchase any meat, meat product or edible offal; ( i i ) to sell any meat, meat product or edible offal; or ( i i i ) to manage and control all matters connected with the handling, storage, pro-, -tectiqn, shipment of any meat, meat product or edible offal purchased by the Commonwealth. What words could we select from a dictionary which would make it' more clear that the Minister would be placed in complete control of this industry and decide the fate of all the meat producers'? Doubtless, we shall be told that the Minister is a benevolent gentleman, for he ordered that wheat should be provided for the manufacture of dog biscuits at a time when childrennothing to do with meat. express the hope that, as many people in other countries urgently require meat, no ministerial direction will be issued under amended section 16 of the act that meat fit for human consumption shall be diverted to dogs. That comment is very pertinent, having regard to certainhistorical events with which we all are familiar. If the Meat Board, with its producer-majority, reaches a decision contrary to the policy of the Labour party,^ the Minister's nominee on the board will have the right immediately to veto it. This policy, I remind the House, is contrary to the doctrine propounded by the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) so eloquently and continually in regard to the power of veto. whether the honourable, member has forgotten that he is debating the Meat Export Control Bill. out that'for many years the Australian Country party has expounded the policy of. the organized marketing of primary products.

176,Mr Menzies .(Kooyongleader Of,"has to consider. In an election campaign, the people would have been much better informed as to the Government's control of the finances if all the documents had been before the Parliament; because, as honourable members know, on the presentation of a budget there are budget papers and estimates, and therefore, in discussing the finances, honourable members have some opportunity of directing their minds clearly and precisely not only to the anticipations of revenue but also to the nature and details of expenditure. The absence of a budget at this stage means two things. It means, first, that we cannot get any clear idea of the expenditure, or of its justification in individual instances. In the second place, it means that we cannot really test the financial outlook for the current year, because that financial outlook cannot properly be evaluated unless we have before us some account of expenditure, as well as some broad estimates of revenue. Of course, it is true that that puts the Government in a position of singular advantage, a matter of which the Government is no doubt not altogether unconscious; but it is >a position which a government about to go to the people should not occupy After all, almost every problem of government in this country at this time is a problem which has affected or in its turn affects the finances of the people as well as of the Government, and if the people are to judge of the financial position of the country, as handled by the Government, then they should have before them at the relevant time all the information which will enable a wise and balanced judgment to be made. However, as I have said, the right honourable gentleman has exercised his rights in this matter, by presenting to us an abbreviated financial statement. Its main feature is this-and I quote the words' The Government proposes to make a second substantial cut in direct taxation by reducing the income tax, including the social services contribution, at a cost of £17,500,000. I quote that because, as it seems to me from the public point of view, that is the central feature of the statement to which we have listened. The true significance of that cut in taxation can be determined only by comparing the estimates of last year's budget with the actual results that are now disclosed; and that comparison,' which I have made as best I can, produces some very astonishing results of which the people should be aware: In the last budget, a copy of which I have again examined for this purpose, the Treasurer disclosed an actual revenue from the various direct and indirect taxes for 1944-45-that is, last financial year-of £345,661,000. At the same time, he announced a cut in the income tax rates, and estimated that the revenue from direct and indirect taxes for 1945-46 would be £343,000,000, or a reduction of £2,661,000. In other words, the Treasurer at that time, in announcing his cuts, one of them in income tax and some of them in sales tax, estimated that there would be some buoyancy of revenue during the year with which he was dealing. He must have had in his mind, as I am sure he will agree, that although there were cuts which, on the face of them, would involve a certain loss of revenue, the general increase of the national income, and therefore the general increase of revenues, would absorb some of those cuts. The Opposition has consistently maintained that the stimulating effect of reduced taxes is. something of which the Government has not really been aware, .and that that .stimulating effect would inevitably be shown in Commonwealth revenue. In brief, we have said that real .concessions in taxation at this time would give a real stimulus to production, would consequently cause a real increase of the national earnings, and would therefore cost the Treasury, in fact, very little if anything at all. That contention -of -the Opposition is proved by the figures that are now produced; because those figures show this: From the direct and indirect taxes which were estimated, only in the last budget, to produce £343,000,000 for the year, the actual receipts were a little over £360,000,000. In other words, the actuai receipts from those, .two sources-direc t and indirect taxes-Wer e £17,000,000 more than the estimate made by the Treasurer ; and that, of course, was after the cuts had been made. It follows that when the Treasurer'announces, as he has in this statement', that I am debating, that he is preparing to' give away, by a further reduction, the sum of £17,500,000, in reality he is only giving away the surplus above his estimated revenue for the last financial year. Let me recapitulate that, because this is a matter which ought to be made abundantly clear. In the last' financial year, a cut was made in income tax, and cuts were made 'in sales tax. It was estimated by the Treasurer that they would cost the Government, on net balance, between £2,000,000 and £3,000,000. But although those cuts were made, the revenues from the -sources affected--direct and indirect taxes-rose by £17,000,000, which is the very amount now to be given away by the proposed tax reductions. Let me emphasize the same proposition by a particular reference to income tax on individuals and companies; because so far I, have taken the total figure for all direct and indirect taxes. The actual revenue for 1944-45 was approximately £215,500,000. The estimated revenue in the last budget, after the making of the tax cut for 1945-46 and including the social services contribution, was"" £211,000,000. So even the Treasurer at that time, though he was announcing what was described as a 12^ per cent, cut in income tax rates and certain other concessions, estimated that his revenue would be £211,000,000. But the actual revenue is now disclosed at something over £214,500,000. It is therefore clear that the previous income tax cut costs the Commonwealth Government practically nothing, and that for the re3t of this financial' year the proposed new cut will do no more than reduce the Government's revenue from that source to the amount that was originally estimated before the cut was made. All through the piece, the Government has failed to realize the significance to the revenue of the restoration of hundreds of thousands of citizens, who have come out of the services, to productive, civil taxable earnvernment's apparent generosity may cost ing. Let me take the case of sales tax to illustrate that; and it is a very intereststimulating effect of a bold policy of tax ing illustration. In respect of sales tax, the actual revenue for 1944-45 was £29,671,000. In his last budget, the Treasurer announced -certain sales tax concessions. Honourable members will remember that he estimated, as the Treasurer commonly does in such circumstances, the loss to the revenue that would accrue as the result of those concessions. Mr Meneies. Making that estimate, and apparently making some allowance for buoyancy of revenue, he said that the total yield for 1945-46 would be reduced to £28,000,000; that is to say, reduced from £29,671,000 to £28,000,000. But, as honourable members will see if they look at the figures in the present statement, the actual revenue received from sales tax for 1945-46 was £33,600,000. So that, notwithstanding the cut and the concessions that were made-which , we were told, would be somewhat expensive to the country-the actual revenue from that source was £4,000,000 greater in the year than the amount received before the concessions were made. I do not propose to go through in detail all the figures in this financial statement. But I have taken these, because they are , illustrations which very closely touch and concern the ordinary citizen. They establish the truth of the belief that increased production, and with it increased national income, and therefore taxable, income, will be tremendously stimulated' by a reduction of tax rates. In this matter, any government can afford to apply a bold policy. It is not to the point to say, as the Government has said, that its total of tax concessions amounts to so many million pounds, because the brief examination which I have made of the figures shows that, notwithstanding the taxation cuts, revenue has increased. All that has happened is that the Government, in a somewhat tentative and hesitating fashion, has proved what we on this side of the House .have been expounding for the last twelve months, namely, that at a time when the nation is moving towards peace-time conditions, and industry is expanding, tax reductions will stimulate production, and the Goit very little, if anything at all. The reduction will be really dramatic, and of first-class value to the people of Australia. I know that the figures will be much more closely analysed in future speeches. My colleague, the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden), will, I hope, once more give to the House -the benefit of a close and expert examination of the figures. For my part, I am merely illustrating what I Americai n 1941 contained a variety of believe to be some of the highlights of the provisions, one of which was thisTreasurer's statement. I turn now to another aspect of the such foreign government receives any aid shall statement, namely, the settlement on tory, and the benefit to the United Slates of balance of lend-lease and reciprocal lendAmerica may be payment or repayment in lease.

178,Mr Menzies,"which are the material foundations of the Mberty and welfare of all peoples; tp the elimination of all forms of discriminatory treatment in international commerce, and to the reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers; and', in general, to the attainment ot all the economic objectives set forth iu the Joint Declaration made on 12th August, 1941, by the President of the United States of America and tlie Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Honourable members will see that the parties to the agreement contemplated that if any adjustment were to be made it should be made in general economic terms. Indeed, I was under the impression that a good deal of the discussion which has taken place during the last twelve months about what has been claimed by some countries to be discriminatory actionI refer to Empire preference-wa s founded on the supposed implications of the lend-lease agreement. As the war went on, Australia became actively concerned in providing goods for the United States of America on reciprocal lend-lease, and apparently accounts have been kept on both sides, one side keeping accounts of. lend-lease and the other of reciprocal lend-lease. We now learn that discussions, haye taken place on the subject, and we know that the Prime Minister was in the United States of America during the latter part of them. A balance was struck, and on that balance Australia is to pay £8,400,000. Nowi t is notorious -and I say this with profound respect to the United States of America and its negotiators-that the level of costs of production in the United States of America for relevant goods was much higher, than the cost of production in Australia for relevant goods supplied by this country. The Prime Minister has very properly said that one thing ofwhich we all can be reasonably proud is that we did maintain throughout the war a stable economy. ber may be surprised to know'that for the first two years of the war I had a great deal to do with the maintenance of our economy. If he is under the illusion that it was only the present Labour Government which had anything to do with it, I shall disabuse his mind. Australia provided ..many, goods for use by the forces of the-United States of America at prices much lower than those at which similar goods could be provided by the United States of America itself. instance example, because we are able to compare like with like. Apparently a balance has been struck on a purely book-keeping basis, no endeavour being made to estimate what was provided on each side in actual physical terms. to do. have thought that the right way to deal with the matter would have heen to say that we had been engaged in a joint enterprise, and to thank God that enterprise was successful. Perhaps the Commonwealth Government did contend that the right way to deal with the matter was to wash out the indebtedness On both sides. However, in the absence of detailed information, I remain sceptical as to whether the bargain ultimately struck was as good as the Treasurer . seems to think. I have thrown ' a bone of contention into the ring, but there is no reason why we should not have our own views on such a matter, even if it does concern a very great and friendly neighbour. I now turn td the subject pf production and price control. The statement of the Prime Minister contained one-piece of information which, though very long delayed, was none the less welcome on that account. It was to this effectGreater all-round production of essential goods must be the central aim of economic policy now and for a long time to come. The waryears have l e f t their toll in Shortages, some of which w ill take years to remedy. We cannot get back, in a day all those standards of living and enjoyment which the .war compelled U3 tp forego. Yet we can win them back and much more with them if we will make an effort. Those words of the Prime Minister sum up in admirable terms what has been the constant theme of members of the Opposition for many months past. It is the central truth which makes unnecessary industrial stoppages a wanton injury, to the nation, whichrenders the provisions of real incentive by tax reduction",55,Chifley

This was one of the first times that it was mentioned by a member of this Government. the Army intervenes. I am bound to say in his favour that, having had the supreme fortune to follow him a few weeks ago into Western Australia, I found that he had said something tbe same there; but I venture to say that that was the first time he . had said it.

The right honourable gentleman may well kiss himself goodbye. leagues will remember, when the Premier of Tasmania, a few. months ago, made a statement on the same lines as that of the Prime Minister which I have quoted, and it appeared in the press, he was eanpcfed within 24 hours by the Hobart Trades and Labour.

Only two monthcreased, .purchasing ""..power. The third ago we heard not a murmur from them about production; but now, because the Prime Minister, in, clear' and sensible terms, has stated something about it which we have been saying for months they come to the conclusion that it must be pretty good. . The Prime Minister's statement continuedControl of prices in Australia has been a triumph of war-time administration. On balance I agree with that statement. Price control was introduced by the Government of which I was Prime Minister within a few days of the outbreak of war, and the authority of the Prices Commissioner was at all times rigorously upheld.. All Australian governments maintained that system during the course of the war. Not only did we have price control; we. also had investment control, increasing rates of. taxation, and a big volume of public borrowing. All of these economic controls were never during the war brought within the real area of dispute. AU Australian governments during the war can therefore, in their own fashion, share in the credit for what has been a fine achievement in relation to price control, an achievement which, I would like to say in passing, has been largely rendered possible by some very competent administrators. The Prime Minister further statedWe shall not gain the full value of this achievement unless it can be carried on into the peace years when the balance of production and demand can be trusted to look after price levels. That pronouncement deserves some analysis. It means in the first, place that price control cannot terminate abruptly. Having regard to some serious representations that have been' made from time to time by the' supporters of the Govern; ment as to the termination of price control, I should like to' say at once that I entirely agree with that. Price control came into existence in order to meet an emergency, and it cannot now be terminated abruptly without causing some-, thing like chaos. [Extension of time granted]. In the second place, it means that price control should not continue",56,Chifley

L make that brief analysis of the right honourable gentleman's statement not to establish some disagreement with it, but ro point out my agreement with the im-' plications' contained in it. Some people talk about price control as a panacea, as if for the next 20 or 30 years we could play ducks and drakes with our economy and still rely upon price-control as something that would save us from disaster. The right honourable gentleman has made it clear that the function of price control is to hold things together until production itself achieves such volume as to destroy the real danger of inflation of currer'cy by an increase of price levels. I have indicated that there has been some propaganda on this matter, suggesting that we on this side of the House are advocating something different from that. On the contrary, these propositions to which I have referred I venture to describe as good Liberal doctrine. of the Commonwealth. Liberal doctrine here is good L beral : doctrine all over the Commonwealth, as the honourable gentleman discover when he .goes ""to meet his masters in the near future. Those who established during the war, not only price control, but also other economic controls are'not so foolish as to imagine that their function should expire just because the fighting has ceased. As I bwz siiid thssa controls were brought into existence in order to cope with an emergency, and as long as the emergency continues they are needed. The problem is not one of sudden termination but of tapering off as natrral factors are restored. Mr Lazzarini intersecting, Works and Housing-if he be still in charge of housing-mutter s something about the referendum. seems to have entirely forgotten that in thi.= House in 1944, on behalf of the Opposition, I moved an ampndment which offe^pd to support the Government in seeking a variety of powers, including the power to exercise such controls as were needed for the transition from war to peace. It is. not my fault that the Government was so purblind is not to accept that offer. gentleman was not sincere then, and is not sincere now. ' members must cease interjecting. these interruptions, Mr Speaker, because the House has been generous enough to grant me an extension of time. The present grave shortage of civil production was primarily caused by the diversion of a high percentage of our man effort to war service and war production. Until civil production ""becomes abundant-it must become substantially higher than it was before the war-wit h the complete re-establishment of our people in civil occupations and with the general acceptance of the supreme importance of production, some controls will continue to be necessary. The great danger is that governments and officials become so accustomed to exercising controls that they come to love them for their own sake. They become so accustomed, for example, to price control that they are disposed to concentrate their minds on the mechanism of control and overlook will the infinitely more important mechanism of restored production. It must be realized that when a country is at peace the willingness of democratic people to submit to controls diminishes, and that the temptation to evade them by all sorts of indirect and nefarious practices inireases. That makes it necessary as time passes-and this perhaps is the whole burden of my theme on this matterthat the accent should be thrown more and more on higher production, which is the natural antidote to inflation, and less and less upon mere restrictions, which should be regarded, to use a figurative expression, merely as a temporary treeguard surrounding the growing tree of production. SoI venture to say that this financial statement contains two He things that are broadly of immense importance to the people of Australia. The fir.?t is that it corroborates most strongly the view that a bold policy of tax reduction will .not really involve ,the",57,Chifley

198,Mr Menzies,"I am able to tolerateGovernment in financial difficulties, but will be an enormous stimulus to production. The second is that, however we may discuss this or that mechanical problem, the central theme to which governments must devote themselves in Australia in the next few years is the problem of so increasing civil production and civil services in Australia that the danger of inflation will disappear, that money will become worth real things, that increased wages will really mean an increased standard of living, and that all the other things we may talk about for the future will be translated into real terms. Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) opened his attack on the Prime Minister and Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) by complaining that the budget was not being introduced before the general elections. The right honourable gentleman displays considerable temerity or has a conveniently short memory. My recollection goes back over many budgets and many governments, and I can recall only one budget that was delivered before the elections in the election year, and I think government's estimates have been proved that was in 1934. but that, was an extraordinary election. gentleman ought to remember that. It was the year when he beat us. it, and the budget had to be considerably altered after I became Prime Minister, because it was very much astray. With regard to the actual receipts being different from the estimates, I confess that I have never known of a government whose estimates proved to be absolutely correct when the balance took place. In nearly every case governments have underestimated their revenue. cautious treasurers. So .there is nothing new in that practice to warrant criticism. It was done by the right honourable member for Kooyong and his own government. Then the right honourable gentleman laid great stress upon the fact that the taxation revenue Was £17,000.000 more than £11,000,000 of that came from indirect taxes. So it does.not prove that we shall get very mueh more income tax, when the rates are reduced. The right honourable gentleman also complained that the financial statement contained very little information. The Treasurer frankly said that the figures contained in the financial statement were not final. They are more or less relative but are a frank and honest display of the financial position to-day; they are not meagre or sketchy, but are very full. The only difference between these figures and*those that will be contained in the budget will be perhaps a few slight alterations involving no large amounts, but of course the budget-papers will contain the details of each department. I concede that such information is important, but I do not. think that it will affect the general picture very much. If the right honourable gentleman will examine the estimates and the actual receipts and expenditure for last year, he will see that ""they are remarkably close, considering that they cover the transition from war to peace, an abnormal year. Yet, even in normal years, every to he incorrect when the final balance has taken place and the budget has been brought down. So that criticism is trifling. A review of the whole of the war years and of the colossal expenditure during those years, in my opinion, shows remarkable achievements . by 7,000,000 people, achievments. of which Australia should be proud. Of the £2,490,000,000 expended in that period, 38 per cent., that is £950,000,000, came from revenue. What human suffering and sacrifices are represented in those cold figures! Whilst they were achievements of the people of Australia, of the soldiers who went to fight and the workers in the factories who kept up the flow of armaments and tools to them, I remind the House That is usually done by that those people were led for five years by a Labour Government. Not a word of commendation is uttered by the right honourable gentleman for the remarkable control exercised by the Treasurer. The other side of the picture ought to be, and will be, told. Some of the facts that I shall give will reveal the estimate. Well, a part of it: We fought a war and we",58,Chifley

The war has been fought and it has to be paid for. There is no good in moaning about the fact that we have to pay for it. The facts are there. We are not going to repudiate. We are going to meet the costs. diture show what colossal costs we have to meet, compared with the pre-war expenditure. War -pensions, reconstruction, and interest and sinking fund payments on ""the debt in respect of the World War. II . are set down at £80,000,000. War pensions, repatriation, and interest and sinking fund pay-, ments on war debts of the first world war will cost £20,000,000 this year. Listening to some people and reading the newspaper, one would imagine that When the war eiided eleven months ago all war expenditure -ceased. The first world war itself will cost us £20,000,000 this year and it ended '28 years ago. payments towards the United Nations Relief Fund, payments due to the United Kingdom, payments to the States and social services, added to the £80,000,000 and £20,000,000 that I have mentioned, represent an expenditure of £280,000,000, every item of which is inescapable. Will honourable gentlemen opposite say that expenditure must be cut down? yet and no one is likely to say it. honourable gentlemen opposite do say is "" You have to get rid of the bureaucrats . who are piling up this huge expenditure "". I have something to say about the alleged.bureaucrats. Besides the heads'of departments, large numbers of people outside the departments were brought in to assist in the abnormal activity of wartime. The Leader of the Opposition has claimed credit for having appointed a large number of those men and. has said that they were good men. So they were, and they gave of their best to Australia at a critical time. Some were men drawn from private enterprise, if honourable gentlemen opposite like that. Some were lent to the Government and others were engaged by it. There was quite an army of them, because there was great activity. Now the reward that these men get for six long wearying years of service to this country is to be sneered at as bureaucrats. But let us examine the accounts. Leaving out business undertakings like the post office, railways and similar enterprises, the administrative ""costs of the Public Service amount to £8,000,000, about half of which is represented by the Some main items of expensalaries of administrative officers, and that represents l i per cent, of our total income. Where is there great extravagance in that? Where can great savings be effected? The Leader of the Opposition rightly .said that the important issue in this financial discussion is taxation. I agree that taxes are heavy. I have found them irksome. So has everybody else. But we all realize :that, having fought a war, we must pay for it. I have read newspaper criticism that taxation this year is to be three times what it was before the war. So it will be, but our inescapable expenditure is four .times what Subsidies, it was before the war The Leader of the Opposition laid great stress on the statement of the Treasurer about the importance of production, as if he had never said it before and had only awakened and realized the importance of production, whereas the Opposition had been hammering at it as its constant theme. The Treasurer, according to'JtheLeader of the Opposition, is a babe in the woods. The Leader of the Opposition flatters himself if he thinks that his constant theme and the constant theme of honourable gentlemen opposite generally have taught the Treasurer anything about the importance of production.

Only two hours after his words had floated over the air he was conferring with Treasury officials, taxation officials and other advisers and observers. The people throughout Australia were cheering in the streets, bands were playing, the offices emptied, and the occasion was a public holiday for every one except this little band of Ministers and "" bureaucrats"" who ar.e shaping a new budget in the light of a return to peace-time conditions. sign of it. ber for Warringah ( Mr Spender) is so seldom in hid place that doubtless he did not notice any sign' of it. I shall show him the signs. On V-P Day the Prime Minister summoned his service Ministers, and issued to them instructions, which they, in turn, issued to their departments. The instructions were, "" demobilize as rapidly as possible"". Demobilization meant the restoration of our economy to normal production. Anticipating the effect of demobilization, the Treasurer then .issued instructions for an amendment of the income tax law. yet had the' benefit of any reduction. that the tax payable on incomes was reduced by 124 per cent, per annum. was 6 i per cent. 12^ per cent, per annum, but applied to only the second half of the financial year. That variation was effected iij September, 1945. It required two. months to prepare, print and distribute the revised schedules.' The Treasurer did an extraordinary thing.. He applied the reduction of income tax from the lst January, instead of the lst July, following. further reduction. In this financial year, the over-all reduction will be 22 per cent. most heavily taxed country in the world. tralia is a heavily taxed country, but, if the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) will study the figures honestly and fairly, he will find that Australia is not the most heavily taxed country in the world. I have compared the income tax tables cited by honourable members opposite as applicable to Australia with those applicable to the United Kingdom. Honourable members opposite include in the Australian income tax figures our social service contributions, hut omit from the British tables the contributions payable under the social service scheme in the United Kingdom. If the Treasurer had not been satisfied not see any that production would increase, would he have agreed to a reduction of income tax ? The right honourable gentleman' is a very sound Treasurer. He .borrowed £150,000,000 last year. This year, he will have to continue the policy of borrowing, but in spite of that, he has agreed to a further reduction.of income tax, believing that it will stimulate production. If the right honourable gentleman had not been convinced that the reduction would provide that stimulus, he would never have reduced taxes, whilst at the same time continuing to borrow. That is not sound finance, but it may be sound economics. I believe that it is. The Leader of the Opposition' referred to'.the increase of revenue from indirect taxation. I propose to indicate one factor which increased revenue. The service Ministers and their officers in 1945 planned to demobilize 400;000 men. The task appeared to be colossal,' but they accelerated demobilization to such a degree that the actual number of personnel discharged from the forces was 450,000. The additional 50,000 men engaging in production and returning to civil occupations substantially increased receipts from direct and indirect taxation. For the first time, most of them began to pay income tax. Their purchases in Australia with money earned in this country were reflected in increased returns from -sales-tax and excise on luxury lines. Now the Treasurer' proposes a I am rather astonished that, those additional 50,000 men returning to production and civil occupations did not produce an even greater increase of revenue from indirect taxation. The Treasurer would be severely criticized if he had made what the Leader of the Opposition",60,Chifley

Opposition himself was so bold that that the Treasurer had not done anything.. he visualized, if he were returned to I meet important visitors from overseas office, a reduction of 40 per cent, and important Australian businessmen, over a three-year period. Although the every one of whom has said to me, war ended only eleven months ago, this "" Chifley has done a great job "". I agree Government has already granted a reducwith them. He has controlled, not for the tion of 22 per cent. The Treasurer is a' sake of control, but for the sake of Aussteadfast man. He does not yield to tralia, the banks, the stock exchange, public clamour. He agrees to reduce interest rates, sales of property and taxes only when he believes that it will prices. I do not deny the Leader of the stimulate production and assist in the Opposition the credit to which his Gotransition from war-time to peace-time vernment is entitled for having laid down conditions. I have known him to resist the foundations of price control in the many demands for an increase of expendifirst week of the war. That was a good ture. Those people who talk most about start. But I point out that during the the necessity for reducing the income first four years of the war, the cost of tax are the most clamant in demanding living index figures rose by 23 per cent., increases of expenditure. Nearly every whilst in the last two and a half years honourable member in this House has they rose by only 1 per cent, after the either asked for, or supported others in Treasurer had adopted his stabilization asking for an increase of expenditure on and subsidy .plans.

If he has not reduced of lend-lease dealings. income tax so substantially as honorahle that he prefaced his remarks with a members desire, that does not mean that tribute to the United States of America, the collections from income tax are being and I endorse every word that he uttered. wasted.

That is precisely what still £20,000,000 worse off because he could occurred when the 'Treasurer discussed have had the extra sum in lieu of more this matter with the representatives of the borrowing.

I, hope Outline, that the Treasurer made a jolly that we shall, and I am sure that the good bargain. Treasurer will reduce income tax as soon as he is able to do so. But listening to the Mr Scullin. Incidently, tbe Leader of the ment one could be excused for thinking, I turn now to another criticism which the of the Opposition directed at financial statement. He referred at It is true Another feature to which I should like to draw attention is the position of our overseas funds and debts. I speak with an inside knowledge of this subject, hecause I became Prime Minister at a time when our overseas debt was just a nightmare and brought Australia to the very verge of bankruptcy, so much so that -drastic measures were necessary to correct the trade balance and the overseas fund position. I shall not go into details of the wild borrowing policy which was in operation before the Scullin Government assumed office, but it ruined the credit of Australia. When a country gets into that position its very soul is affected. One thing is undeniable-n o country can call itself financially sound while it is in a perilous position in respect of its overseas fundsThe overseas position has been most carefully watched by the present Treasurer. In outlining the present position of our London debts the right honourable gentleman told us that our total overseas indebtedness had been reduced by £72,000,000 by transfers to Australia, or by repayments. On the transferred loan the interest rate had been reduced from 5 per cent, to 3^ per cent. The success of the Treasurer in this respect has been so remarkable that honourable gentlemen opposite do not like to hear the story of it repeated. The amount of interest saved to Australia in respect of these transactions is £5,600,000 per annum. Whatever party political bias may be felt against the Treasurer, no reasonable person should deny him credit for having done a fine work in this connection during the last five years. I would have expected a word of recognition of this great fact ' from any one who loved Australia. The Leader of the Opposition stated in press comments which he made about a fortnight ago that ""the tax reductions proposed by the Treasurer were not equitably spread. He said that there should have been all-round reductions. I agree that the percentage reductions are very much more substantial on the lower than on the higher incomes. For instance', a man in receipt of £125 a year will receive a reduction of 39 per cent., a man with £400 a year, 16 per cent.; a man with £1,000 a year, 12 per cent; and a man with £3.000 a year, 8 per cent. I agree also that as taxes were increased on an all-round basis, theoretically they probably should be reduced in that way, but all the honourable members will surely admit that the heavy burdens of taxation which fell on everybody during the war years were felt most keenly by men in . the low income ranges. After all, those who are receiving £1,000 a year, as we do, may have to pay a heavy tax, but they also have a -fair amount left to live on and can live comfortably, if not luxuriously. That cannot be said of men in receipt of £2 10s., £3, £4, or £5 a week, who had to pay heavy taxes ali through the war years, week in, week out. I should like to see a greater measure of relief given to such taxpayers, but I ask the Leader of the Opposition to bear in mind the amount of tax relief which will be received ""by peoole in the various income ranges that-1 have mentioned. A man in receipt of £125 a year will benefit by £2 2s.; a man on £400, by £13 6s.; the man on £1,000, by £38'; and the man on £3,000 by £130. I therefore join issue with the right honourable gentleman when he'advocates an all round percentage reduction. There has been a regular spate of criticism in the press of the Government's proposals to reduce taxation. I shall select only one statement from among the many that have been made. I select this one because it came from the financial editor of one of the leading newspapers in Australia, the Sydney Morning Herald. He wrote, "" A single man fares better than a family man "". . He gave as an illustration a single man on an income of £400 who would benefit by £13 6s. a year, and a married man with a wife and two children would benefit by only £6 9s. a year, or less than half the amount of benefit enjoyed by the single man. But there is a simple explanation of that. The single man paid a tax of £81 which will now be reduced to £68, whereas the married man with a wife and two children paid a tax of £39, which will he now reduced, in round ficures, to £33. Both of them, however, will receive a reduction of 16 per cent. The writer could have made what would have appeared an even stronger indictment if he had compared a single man with an income of £250, which is about the basic wage rate, and a married man with a wife and three children on the same income. With the two cuts in taxation that have been made since the end of the war, the single man would get a reduction of £10, whilst the family man with three children will get nothing. Of course, the reason is that the man With a wife, and threechidren pays no income tax. I am aware that demands have been made by.. some organizations for complete exemption from taxation of would means-, a loss to the revenue of £34,000,000 of that £40,000,000 would have relation to income of persons without dependants, a further £5,000,000 of it would .have relation to income of married people, and only £1,000,000 of it would have relation to the incomes of the average family man to whom I have referred. I stress the important point that the average family man, that is a man with a wife and two children, with an income of £300 does not pay income tax as such; he pays a social services contribution of £12. a year. contribution. Does the honorahle member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) agree that the contribution that would be required from people under the contributory insurance scheme advocated by the parties opposite would also be a tax? That fact cannot be camouflaged. It has been urged that greater tax reductions and more liberal rebates should be made in respect of the average family man with a wife and two children and an income of £300 who is exempt from income tax, and who pays the social services contribution of £12, but I consider that such an individual can be afforded greater relief by means of improved social services than by income tax reductions. [.Extent sion of time granted.] I say emphatically that the average family man on an income of £300 who pays a social services contribution of £12 is much better off than he would be if he were granted only a straight-out tax reduction. The wife of such a iman receives child endowment of £19 10s. a year for one child, and let me reread a first time. mind the House, in passing, that child endowment has been increased 50 in office, the ..amount having been raised Post-war Reconstruction and Minister from 5s. to 7s. 6d. a week, which involved an increase of the total expendi-[ ture from £12,000,000 to £18,000,000/ The wife would also receive increased, maternity allowance, such payments haying been increased substantially recently. Nomeans test is appliedto these payments. In addition, hospital benefit of £2 2s. a week is available for the family, all incomes of £300. That unit. Those benefits represent many times as much as the benefits received by single£40,000,000. An amount of men. Moreover, dental and medical benefits' will be available after the referendum' in regard.to social services has been carried. These are illustrations of the benefits of the social services to the family man, and they are available with-' out a means test. An increase has been made also in the pensions rate. The in ' : formation given by the Treasurer in the financial statement, as a matter of fact,' indicates clearly that a big forward step has been taken towards the elimination of the means test. I thank honourable members for having granted me an extension of time. is a social services I shall say no. more, although a great more could and no doubt will be said before the debate concludes. My final word is a suggestion that, in accordance with the splendid spirit . of Australia during the war^ there should be no more, moaning about taxation.. When we think, of-the blitz that Britain suffered, and of the thousands of people in Britain who are still homeless, still paying high taxation, and still rationed severely even in. respect of bread, the' staff of life, let us not moan. When we remember the devastation there is in Europe, where, people are dying of hunger, and where little children are suffering from malnutrition, the results of which will pursue them to the end of their days, let us,, who are privileged to live in this, country,, thank God that Australia, was saved' from similar devastation and suffering. adjourned.

' In explaining this bill, I would emphasize that whilst the critical coal position -cannot be attributed to toy single cause, it is fundamentally the result of the industry's inability to keep pace with -changing needs. This failure has affected >.yery home and almost every industry in Australia { the. war period. n jhe past , six years of abnormally rapid 'industrialization in Australia, the consumption of coal has leapt ahead of pro{tuition in a chronically sick industry. ^Between, the years. 1942 and 1945} for instance, permitted consumption exceeded production by 1,700,000 tons, and coal stocks have progressively decreased as a -result. After one experience of this kind, the Government is. determined that never -again must, the industry be permitted to lapse into the position in which we found -it, and from which, while the war continued, there was no chance.of recovery. ,'. To-day, in the midst of the transition ""from war to civil production, we are confronted with a dangerously low level of coal stocks on the one. hand and an evermounting demand on the other. The latest estimates and figures available to .me areTons. Demands on Australian (black) coal for 1946-47 .. Likely demands on Australian (black) coal for 1949-50 16,500,000 These figures maybe compared with the .'average annual output of all Australian .mines during 1939-44 of less than 13,500,000 tons. The demand on New .South Wales black coal for 1946-47 was .11,666,000 tons, and the likely demand on such coal for 1949-50 is 13,500,000 tons. These figures, again, may be compared with the average annual output of all New South Wales coal mines during 1939-44 of only 11,500,000 tons. The estimates for 1949-50 represent an increase of 25 per cent, over the 1941 demands. During the war years, we had to improvise and . patch as best we could in tie circumstances. We deeply appreciate the efforts of the Coal Commission, and of the New South Wales Labour Government in collaboration with us. To-day, however, we face a peace period hi which the Government is determined that we shall proceed vigorously on a programme of basic re-organization. That iss why We mark the first year of peace by bringing' down this legislation to. lay the framework for a new deal for the New South Wales industry, whichproduces over SO per cent of our black coal. It is a problem industry, and*; in order to understand it, we much' appreciate the During essential features of its' history At bottom, there was the incapacity of an-individualistic industry to reorganize itself. There was an: unwillingness on the part 'of owners to make available or to seek .the finance for private re-orgariization, modernization and re-equipment. When, ""Occasionally, a particular management : showed a willingness to introducenew methods, it sometimes meta fearful and negative response from its workers. That response was not uniformly. experienced, but where it did occur it was at least ""-understandable. Throughout the interwar period, the workers experienced real insecurity in an apparently declining industry, and a lack of continuity of employment. Statistics of employment in the New South Wales coal industry show that this feeling of insecurity was based on a foundation of solid facts. The number of men. employed declined from 22,470 in 1929 to 12,788 in 1935, 'and since that time has never increased much .. 14,500,000 .beyond 16,000. Nor does the actual number employed each year, tell the whole .story It conceals the human tragedy of discontinuous employment; 250 days a year would represent -50 weeks' work on the basis of a five-day week. The average-number of days worked by miners in 1929 was 223;. and in 1930 ""it fell to 119 for those"" who remained in the industry. Only in a desperate war year like 1943 did the average again reach the 1929 figure of 223. I remind honourable members that the loss of working days was by .no means due solely to strikes. The break-down of obsolete mining equipment has often been the cause of a temporary closing of mines. Moreover, once stocks of coal above-ground were adequate tp meet demands for some time ahead, miners worked under the constant fear of being laid off, because mines on the Australian fields have been frequently closed down to save expenses in sueh circumstances. The frequency of accidents in the mines is another cause of economic loss and of bitterness among miners. The average of New South Wales casualties during the sixteen years which ended in 1944 was more than sixteen killed and 70 injured each year. The number of accidents generally bears a definite relation to the amount of coal hewn each year, where mining equipment is not the best and most up-to -date. Official reports clearly demonstrate that a large proportion of accidents could have been prevented by the adoption by mine managements of adequate safety measures. Accidents are not the only physical danger to the lives, health and employment of coal-miners. Because of the nature of their work, in the absence of the most modern and safety measures a very high proportion of coal-miners contract respiratory and-other diseases. In most instances, the only way of avoiding permanent disability and death is for the affected men to leave the mines for good. But, when other jobs and opportunities around the mining districts are not plentiful, this has often been impossible, and men suffering from disease in mild degrees have been forced by their circumstances to continue working in the very conditions that had caused their disease. When the Commonwealth Government took over the Coalcliff colliery, it experimented that a substantially identical bill will be with and introduced a method of water injection which has proved highly successful against dust. Mr Justice Davidson described it in his recent report as the liament will be conferred. The function most effective method of controlling dust in pillar workings yet practised. A great deal of expenditure is required to ensure the introduction of similar safeguards for the New South Wales miners. In these few introductory remarks to the bill, I have not overdrawn the position in the coal industry. Mining is at best a strenuous, thankless means of earning a livelihood. It is at worse an avenue of fitful employment, constant fear of disease, and ever-present possibility of death or disablement by accident. Men work in the industry under physical and nervous pressure, which is rarely absent; and when they find themselves working under that pressure in an industry suffering from technical obsoifr. Dedman. lescence and decay, and from insufficiency of capital, it is understandable, if not always wholly excusable, that the industry should be the seat of chronic indus-. trial discontent, inflamed as often as not by irresponsible newspapers and by parliamentary spokesmen for the owners, who are prepared to make political capital out of the position. There is an exasperation and frustration among the miners which only a "" new deal "" for the industry has a hope of expunging. This Government, and the Government of New South Wales, must make a fresh start at resolving the clearly recognizable problems of discontent and under-production in the industry. Only a wide, systematic and thorough re-organization of the industry will meet the real needs. The bill before the House is at once the earnest of fruitfu l co-operation between the two governments and the framework through which they will work together. By geological accident, the main black coal resources of Australia are in the State of New South Wales. But coal is a national problem, and demands a national solution. . Co-operation between the Commonwealth and State Governments is therefore necessary, and the present bill has teen drafted only after careful discussion with the New South Wales Premier and other Ministers, and on the definite understanding introduced into the New South Wales Parliament. In this way, powers within the legislative competence of each Parof this bill is to establish a Joint Coal Board, with all the powers that are necessary to ensure a regular production of coal to meet the needs of the Australian economy. It will consist of three mem-' bers, appointed for seven years by arrangement between the State of New South Wales aud the Commonwealth. These members will not represent sectional interests in the industry, but will be selected because of their special qualifications and capacities to carry out the wide functions and the heavy responsibilities of the board. The main duties of the board will be, first, to ensure that coal shall be produced in the State in such quantities and with such regularity as will meet requirements throughout Australia and in trade with other countries; secondly, to ensure that the coal resources of the State shall be conserved, developed, worked and used .to the best advantage in the public interest; thirdly, to ensure that coal produced in the State shall be distributed and' used in such manner, quantities, classes and grades and at such prices as are calculated best to serve the public interest and secure the economical use of coal in the maintenance of essential services and industrial activities; and fourthly, to promote the welfare of workers engaged in the coal industry . in the State. Owing to doubts as to and limitations on the extent of Commonwealth powers under the Constitution, reliance will be ' placed on State authority for many of the major functions of the board. It is desirable, however, that the Parliament, the industry itself, and the people should be able to get from each bill. a comprehensive picture of what the board has to do, and what powers it will have. For this purpose, this bill has been drafted in rather an unusual form. Clause 12 and the following clauses set out all the powers, functions and duties of the board, whether the Commonwealth or the State confers them. These clauses are purely declatory in form. The bill must not be read as an attempt by the Commonwealth Parliament to vest in the board all the powers set out. The only powers that the Commonwealth does vest are those that are within its own constitutional authority. For the rest, the board will draw its powers from the State. The same principle is followed in relation to the industrial authorities provided for in Part VI . of the hill. So that it will be able to carry but these duties promptly and effectively, the Joint Coal Authority will have wide powers and a substantial degree of autonomy. It will be able to take the initiative in dealing with day-to-day problems free from political control. But because of the far-reaching nature of it3 decisions, it is important that the board should conform to directions on particular matters of policy. The principle of Parliamentary and .ministerial responsibility for policy has been preserved by ihe ultimate right of the Prime Minister, in agreement with the Premier of New South Wales, to give policv d'rections to the hoard. The Prime Minister may also direct the board to furnish reports to himself and to the State Premier; whilst parliamentary appropriation of funds also will ensure ministerial responsibility. There are two further restrictions on the powers of the board. First, it will be noticed that there is to be no form of industrial conscription. Secondly, where the safety of mine workers is involved, there must be a joint inspection by an officer of the board and an inspector of the New South Wales Mines Department before the board can take action, and any action must not derogate from the New South Wales safety' code. Within the limits of these restrictions, the board will"" have power to deal with every phase of the coal industry. It will have powers over such matters as the opening or closing of coal mines; methods of working; mechanization; use and distribution of coal; prices and profits; the health and safety of workers, and their welfare both in and about the mines and in their communities; employment and training; statistics, and research. Just how drastic and far-reaching the board's measures will be, will depend solely on what is necessary to get the coal we want and make mining a worthwhile occupation. We hope and believe that, with the co-operation of the industry, much can be achieved by a vigorous programme of technical and financial assistance, backed up by orders and directions to mine owners. Naturally, any extra costs incurred in carrying out the board's directions will be taken into account in determining price levels. On the other hand, in some instances, cooperation may not be forthcoming from the owners and managers, and the board may need to assume control of or acquire and operate a mine. Finally, the board may suspend or exclude from the industry any superintendent, manager or other person who acts in a way prejudicial to the efficient operation of the industry. Special provision is made to ensure that this power will not be misused Turning now to distribution, I should like to indicate briefly what the Government has in mind. The Joint Coal Board will be responsible for seeing that coal shall be distributed efficiently and that adequate arrangements shall be made for safeguarding essential stocks. In the event of shortage, it will be' responsible for rationing coal. The board may be able to carry out these obligations most effectively by acquiring all the coal produced in New South Wales. But improvement of the actual working and distribution of coal will be of no avail if the miners at the coal-face and in their homes are left, as they have been in the past, to burrow in the darkness of a harsh and insecure livelihood. They must feel that they, too, are participating in the social life and progress of the nation which depends so greatly on their efforts in winning coal. This is partly a matter of working conditions and amenities in-and about the mines, where the board must see that the coal industry shall live up to its responsibilities. This will be done by vigorous enforcement of health and safety provisions, including measures to remove the spectre of dust and silicosis. Lighting and ventilation must be improved, and adequate pit-head amenities provided. The board will insist that these things shall be done, and it will be' ready to provide financial assisResources, the public health authorities tance to enable them to be done. Moreover, we intend to guarantee a continuing expenditure on amenities, by establishing a coal industry welfare fund. This will be administered by the board,, and contributions to'it will be made by the Commonwealth and State Governments as well as the board itself. In . addition, much must, be done aWay from the mines to make coal mining areas of the State the centre of vigorous and happy families and communities. This is some-, thing that can be. achieved only with the co-operation of the mining communities which must take the initiative and seize the opportunities which will be open to them. But the Joint Coal Board will be ready to collaborate with the people themselves and with other authorities in providing health' and other services for miners and their dependants, in establishing educational, recreational, housing and other facilities', and in promoting diversidisputes, and with any matters referred fication of industry and town and regional planning in coal-mining areas. It is also essential that the dread fear of unemployment shall be banished from the coal-fields. I have already cited estimates which show that the demand for coal-is such the i the'drift of workers from Mr Dedman. the industry must be arrested and recruitment vigorously encouraged. It will be the responsibility of the board to take a long-range view of the level of employment in the industry in relation to the production and the demand for coal. The board will be required to develop mechanization and technical efficiency in the mines, and, at the same time, to provide regular workers in the industry with an assurance of stable employment, and a secure and satisfactory livelihood in keeping with the policy of full employment to which the Labour Governments of the Commonwealth and New South Wales are committed. In order to achieve its objectives the board will need to undertake and arrange intensive programmes of research -in connection with coal resources, techniques of production and use, health problems and other matters. In this field the hoard will work in close collaboration with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the Commonwealth Bureau of Geology, Geophysics and Mineral and other research and scientific agencies. With, regard to workers compensation, the board will have power to conduct an insurance scheme with which coal-owners would be required to effect their workers' compensation insurance. At present, employers"" conduct their insurance with their own company which is being heavily subsidized by the Government, and a part of this subsidy goes, of course, in maintaining the profits of the company. Let me now draw your attention to the industrial provisions of the bill. We have provided for the establishment of a coal industry tribunal with the necessary powers to settle industrial disputes, and to promote industrial peace in the industry. This tribunal will have the qualifications of an Arbitration Court judge, and will be appointed for seven years It. will deal with matters affectingthe miners' federation, including interstate by the board. So that. disputes can be dealt with quickly, we have given special consideration to the appointment of local authorities. Accordingly; the tribunal will appoint local 'coal authorities' with powers to determine disputes of purely local significancej.'and; to which it will refer such disputes. It may also appoint at any coal-mine a mine conciliation committee, comprising an equal number of employer and employee representatives, to prevent the development of disputes. Finally, the board itself may appoint reporting officers to keep it informed of the facts on any matter which is, or is likely to he, the cause of an industrial dispute"". As you will see, this new structure for dealing with industrial matters affecting the New South ""Wales coal industry replaces the central industrial authority and the local industrial authorities established under war-time legislation. It preserves, however, sufficient of the existing machinery for continuity to be maintained. The foregoing covers the major provisions of the bill, but honourable members enable the human and economic problems will be interested in a number of imporof the industry to be tackled. It will be tant matters not incorporated but on backed up by a bold and comprehensive which agreement has been reached with programme of re-organization and dethe New South Wales Government. In velopment. In this spirit I commend the connection with finance, large sums are bill to the House. involved by way of capital and current expenditure which this Government is fully prepared to make available for such a vita] public purpose. The Commonwealth and the.State have agreed to divide financial responsibilities on this basis: The State will contribute half the costs of administration and an amount not exceeding £70,000 per annum to the joint, coal board's welfare fund-thi s amount to be contributed on a pound for pound basis with the Comis notable that no one has raised any monwealth. In turn, the Commonwealth will contribute the remaining half of the serious objection to the purposes of this costs _ of administration, a share of the bill. This is due to the fact that, superboard's welfare fund not less than that ficially at least, the bill provides for procontributed by the State; all other current ducer-control of the meat export industry, expenses including any subsidies and any and if the industry were really to he other expenses arising from the board's placed under-the control of the producers production and trading activities, and all its interests would be adequately proadvances and grants for capital purposes tected. such as the capital cost of amenities, "" superficially "" because I am convinced other than those covered by the welfare that the producers will, in fact, have fund, mechanization, acquisition and new no effective control at all.

225,Debate (On Motion By Mr Menzies),,69,Second Reading
226,Mr Bowden (Gippsland) [9.55],"I trefuses to meet the representatives of this organization. It may be news to the Minister to hear that it has more members than any other organization of meat producers in Australia. I do not suggest that the persons nominated by the bodies approved by the Minister will not perform their duties in the best interests of those whom they represent, insofar as they are allowed to do so under the restrictive provisions of this legislation. However, the great majority of meat producers in my district favour a system of selection similar to that, in operation in New Zealand. There the country is divided into regions, which have no geographical significance, but merely represent arbitrary divisions within each of which the meat producers elect a member to an electoral committee which, in turn, elects the producer-representatives who sit on the meat board. That system is favoured by the majority of small producers in this country, yet for some unexplained reason the Minister has refused point-blank to consider it. On behalf of unrepresented organizations, particularly the Australian Primary Producers Union, I protest against the obnoxious provision in clause 7, which proposes that the chairman nominated by the Government shall be vested with power to veto a majority decisionof his own board. This must be the first instalment of the new order about which we have heard so much. Undoubtedly the idea has been borrowed from the United Nations, for I know of no precedent in this country for its adoption. There may have been some merit in allowing the power of veto in the United Nations to what are known as the "" Big Three"", because those nations would have to foot the billfor arms equipment and men to back up any decision resulting from a majority vote of the minor nations. We know perfectly well, however, that the power of veto, which was intended to be used as a protection, is now used by certain members of the United Nations to further their'.own nationalistic aims, with the result that the power of veto, as we know only too well, has been brought into disrepute. able member must confine himself to Lhe bill. ilr. Bouden. becomes law the Minister will establish a board which will be presided over by a chairman of his own selection, who will be vested 'with power to circumvent a majority decision. This, in my opinion, savours of 'a Russian election in which, a voter has permission to do as he likes as long as he does as he is told. Eirst, the Minister proposes to take to him'self responsibility for the selection of the members of the board from nominees of bodies of which he himself has to approve, and then he immediately shows his lack of confidence in them by seeking authority to appoint his own chairman, in whom he proposes"" to vest the power of veto. I am sorry to see such a principle introduced into legislation in this country. I trust that it will not. be repeated in any other measure. I am optimistic enough to hope that the Minister will see the merit of the protests voiced by the Opposition and amend that provision in the bill in accordance with their wishes. The honourable member has had sufficient experience of ministerial office to know that no responsible body of primary producers, whether it be selected by him or by the producers themselves, would take any action, make any motion or reach any resolution which would involve the Commonwealth in heavy expenditure without first obtaining the consent of the Minister or at least submitting the matter to the Treasurer for his views. If that be so, why vest in the chairman the power of veto? The Australian Primary Producers Union, which represents a very large number of small producers, rightly believes that this obnoxious provision should be removed, and I am still optimistic enough to hope that when the bill is in committee the Minister will concede this small point. The primary producers believe that the chairman should be a producer and should have a deliberative and a casting vote but no power to veto the majority decisions of the board. I trust that consideration will be given to this protest, because in other respects the bill has the approval of the primary producers and of honourable members generally. of the Opposition said that it represented an instalment of socialism.",69,Second Reading

229,Mr Lazzarini,"The Deputy Leaderestablish boards of this kind in order to control the overseas marketing of our primary products. Whilst we agree with the bill in principle, we regard the proposal to vest in the chairman the power of veto as an affront to onr democratic beliefs. [10.7] I cannot allow this bill to become law without making some comment on some strange provisions contained in it. Clause4 is.in such striking contrast to other measures which we have had before us in the not far distant past that I cannot let it pass without comment. That clause provides for the establishment of a board of twelve members, consisting of three members to represent the lamb producers of Australia, one to represent the mutton producers, two to represent the beef producers-the bulk of our. beef exports are from Queensland, so that does not prerent a great deal of difficulty-on e to represent pig producers, two to represent meat exporting companies of Australia, one to represent the publicly-owned abattoirs-as these are situated in almost every State there may be some competition in the selection of their representative-and one to represent the employees. I have no doubt that some dispute may occur on both sides of the river Murray, and, perhaps, in the vicinity of ""the Brisbane line"" as to which trades hall shall have the right to select that representative. Perhaps the dispute may be remitted into the Australasian Council of Trade Unions and be happily resolved. , Then, finally, one member is to represent the Commonwealth Government. That makes a total of twelve, perilously, close to an. unlucky number. The clause provides that these gentlemen are to be appointed by the Governor General. I i i ordinary common English, that means that they will be selected by the Minister. I have also noticed that the clause provides that if an insufficient number of nominations is received the Governor General may make such appointments as he thinks fit. These, of course, would be made upon the recommendation of the Minister. provision. provision is in striking contrast to some other administrative proposals of the Government in the not far distant past. I pass on to the procedure at meetings of the board and the power of veto as proposed in clause 7. In one of my more illuminated moments I marked this clause as the "" Molotov clause"". Under it anything that mayhe agreed upon by the other eleven members of the board as their sincere and honest conviction and on the basis of their expert knowledge may be vetoed by the chairman. According to the rather striking and forthright language of the clause, if the chairman happens to dissent from the views of the other eleven members of the board he must signify at the meeting to the other members present in person bis intention to bring his dissent to the notice of the Minister and, within 24 hours after the close of the meeting, transmit to the Minister notice of his dissent withtfull particulars of the decision. If the Minister approves of the decision, or varies it to what extent he may vary it is not stated-the decision so approved is deemed to be a decision of the board. I assume that if the Minister agreed with 10 per cent, of the decision and vetoed 90 per cent., it would still be deemed a decision of the board. How in the name of common sense can such a provision be contained in an act of parliament? Personally, I would not esteem it a great honour to be asked, to become a member of a board which had to function under those conditions. I , and perhaps ten worthy colleagues--muc h worthier than myself-migh t be entirely opposed to 90 per cent, of a certain decision which the Minister, acting upon the advice of the chairman, decided was necessary in the interests of the country, yet we would find that the decision of the Minister would be represented as expressing the views of the board. That, to 'my mind, rather .savours of the old method of at'.empting to invert the pyramid. I suggest that before this bill becomes law the text of clause 7 might be transmitted overseas for the opinion of the Attorney-Gpneral (Dr. Evatt), not only from the legal aspect, but. also from the aspect of a practice and procedure with which the right honourable gentleman has been connected",70,Second Reading

One of the Minister's colleagues may regret that this bill did not become law a couple of years ago when it might have been very handy in the famous case of the Portland butcher, Mr Dargan. It would perhaps have saved him and his colleagues in the Ministry a lot of headaches in solving the intricate problem of what to do about the Portland meat supply. Had the hill been law, under this provision, they could have gone to Portland and, on behalf of the Commonwealth, and subject to directions of the Minister, purchased any meat, meat product or edible offal that they liked and, as far as I can see, there is nothing in the bill that -would have prevented them from giving it away. That may be an unfortunate omission, but, in the absence of contrary provision, they could have disposed of the commodity so purchased in any manner that they thought fit. I leave those matters with the Minister because they concern the people who produce meat. Some are big producers, others are very little producers, like me, and others go in for meat production as a pleasant pastime. Mr Archie Cameron. -' The last point' that I make is that raised by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) and one or tWo of his colleagues about the strange atti"" tude of the Minister towards the people who form the"" Australian Primary Producers Union, V "" fairly' 'well known organization. At the request of the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr McDonald) I journeyed withhim to ; Warrnambool and met some 500 or 600 of them, and they seemed' to be a fine class of people,as. I 'would' naturally expect,-some of them being my own constituents. I know these people They are devoted to ' the' one objective ""of improving the position of 'Australian primary producers ' generally. They are interested, not ""only in meat, but also in almost'every'other kind of ""primary product.' Yet the. Minister has r consistently and' repeatedly refused to . meet them. There are certain points that they want to put-'to hiin, 'and I think it is better, in the'interests .of-the associa-' tion, that they should put them to him person-ally. Not. long ago I asked him Whether he was 'prepared to meet them before this legislation became law, because in my younger days, when I was at school, I read something about the mouse, and the lion, and I know that even small things may be of help to the great and the mighty. I think that the men'who represent different kinds of primary production, and are willing to leave their dairy farms, their wheat ' farms', their pastures, their potato patches and so forth in order to put their views before the Minister, may have some views ' that would be useful to the Commonwealth Government in the framing of legislation of this kind. I can only regret that the Minister, in his wisdom,' decided that he would meet them, to use his own language, I think, in Ijis own good time. The Minister nods his head, so, for once, I seem to be near the mark. I may be wrong, but I took that to mean that the Minister did not propose to meet them until after this bill had become law. I say with all good feeling towards the Minister, who is one of my political opponents, that in all these matters, whatever he may happen to think personally of an organization, it is a fair thing for the Minister to meet its .representatives in what may be described as their own. good time, in order that anything they might represent as of benefit to the Commonwealth, to industry or even to persons individually, may be submitted to him for his consideration. I regret that my honourable friend has not seen fit to pursue, that rather well-worn path, but has elected to take the path that he has talien on this occasion. It has been said that successful marketing is the satisfactory conclusion of the. work and management of the producer. It might also be said that the work and the management of the producer is necessary if we have anything to market. This bill is entitled, "" A bill for an act to amend the Meat Export Control Act 1935-1938) and for. other purposes "". I suppose that meat is generally considered to be a beast after it has boon slaughtered, but this bill covers a wider field than meat itself. It covers a very wide field, because the policy of the Australian Meat Board, to be set up under this bill, may have.to do with the breeding of fat stock. New Zealand has developed a fine export trade in fat. stock and Canterbury lamb is known nl] over the world, but Australia has not developed the same standard of efficiency iji marketing as has New Zealand. I take it that I am in order in speaking about the breeding of live stock, because the policy of the hoard may encompass an incentive for that. It is very necessary that the men appointed to it shall know something about matters other than the export of meat, in order that they may devise a policy that will foster the breeding of the very best stock for the export trade. I therefore, support the contention of the honourable member for Barker( Mr if most of the members come from VicArchie Cameron). The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) ought to have given ac-me consideration to the request, of the Australian Primary Producers Union that he receive a deputation in order that it might nominate for appointment to the Australian Meat Board a producer from its ranks. It must be apparent to all that the organization is not small. The Minister may-know that it claims [108] to be the most properly federated body in Australia because it has a membership in four States of the Commonwealth. If the Minister delays meeting these people till after this bill has been passed they will be denied the opportunity of having one of their nominees on the board on their behalf. I protest against the Minister's attitude. I know, many of them; a few of. them are my constituents. Many other members are in southern Victoria, but the membership is representative of four States. The men I know are engaged in raising fat lambs and cattle. They have been breeding stock for generations. It is because of their activities that we have such a well organized meat industry in Australia to-day. that organization are in New South Wales? organization has a membership of about 10,000 and it covers four States of the Commonwealth. Amongst the"" members are men of great influence in the meat industry who desire to submit to the Minister names of men whom they would like to be appointed to -the Meat Board! I do not think that is too much to ask. It is an ordinary proposal. If the Minister did not approve of the men nominated, he could reject them. The organization wants the opportunity to submit a nomination because it represents the leading meat breeders and meat producers in Australia. Why should tbey -he debarred? The recent conference of the union in Geelong was one of the best conferences of primary producers ever held in Victoria. Even toria, as implied by the Minister for Post-war ""Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman), that does not detract from the worth of 'their proposition. Of 3,336,766 carcasses of lamb exported in 1944-45, more than half or 1,862,586 came from Victoria. As regards mutton, of 450,218 carcasses, Victoria shipped 178,365.

Victoria by producing more than half of the fat lambs exported by Australia, is in an unassailable position in the Commonwealth fat-lamb trade. The trade must be fostered. It has been pointed out by sheepmen throughout Australia that it is necessary to export as many fat lambs as is possible. It is therefore necessary to breed the right class of lambs for export. We want to have people overseas ask for Australian lamb. The only way to achieve that is by exporting lamb of the right type. The combination of breeders, fatteners and exporters that makes up the membership of the union surely can ' produce an expert, who would bo an acquisition to the Meat Board. Mr Scuxi,r -Would there not be experts in the other organizations? they can be considered too. The organization merely asked that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture should allow it to submit a nomination to him. The bill provides in several places that the Minister ""shall have the right to approve of not only nominations but also other aspects of the proposed meat board's activities. The only way in which they can place before the Minister arguments in favour of the appointment of their nominee is by a personal meeting with him. He has signified that he will meet them in his own good time. I would not object to that but for the fact that this bill is on its way through the Parliament, and, unless the Minister meets them soon, it will be too late for them to do anything to ensure that they shall have a say in the marketing of their products. That is unjust to the fat-lamb raiser, the pig raiser and the fatteners of and the quantity of mutton exported will stock generally, men who have been engaged in the meat industry for many years. this matter' so much but for the fact that a lot of honorahle members have heen thinking about this bill and about the men who should be on the Meat Board. There is a lot of difference about thinking' and knowing. I know that the organization ought to be represented on the board because I have been associated with the marketing of fat stock all .my life, with the exception of the six years that I was overseas. I have been associated with the meat industry, first aa a producer and then as an auctioneer. In those capacities, one gains a valuable knowledge of the men who could best serve. Australia on the meat board. Therefore, I urge the Minister to re-examine this matter, and, if possible, interview in Canberra the representatives of the Primary Producers Union. If he is not impressed with their submissions, he will not accept them. But how can he reject their claims when he has not heard them advanced? That is why I make a plea on behalf of these men, many of whom I have known personally for fifteen or twenty years or even longer. They include the presidents and members of shire councils, and are men of honesty and integrity. Surely they are entitled to a hearing. The proposed composition of the Australian Meat Board is not so satisfactory as is the composition of the New Zealand Meat Board, which consists of five representatives of the producers, two representatives of the. Government, one representative of the stock and station agents, and one representative of the dairy, producers. The bill proposes that the Australian Meat Board shall include three representatives of the lamb producers. In view of the number of fat lambs that we export compared with mutton, that representation is inadequate. We cannot export large quantities of mutton on account of gland trouble, and for economic reasons. The export of fat lambs is most important to Australia. With the top-dressing of pastures in various parts of the country, we shall have more fat lambs for export, be .further reduced. We shall get the best values in the market which seeks I would not stress lamb instead of mutton. Lamb is always preferred to mutton. Purchasers not only in Australia but also in other countries realize the importance of buying young meat. WhilstI contend that lamb producers should have increased representation on the Australian Meat Board, I agree that we should not deprive the mut-. ton producers of the one member which",73,Second Reading
239,Mr Turnbull,"Certainly, butthey have been allotted.. The bill provides also that there shall be two members to represent the beef producers. Obviously, that number cannot be reduced. One member will represent the pig producers. I agree with that. But I do not agree with the proposal that two members should represent the meat exporting companies of Australia. Various sections of the meat trade should he allowed to submit to the Minister a panel of names from which their representatives will be selected. The names of the representatives of the meat exporting companies will be submitted by a group known aa the "" B i g Three"". I do not need to mention their names. claims of the small exporters for representation have been overlooked. They are not to have a voice. When I was an auctioneer at the Newmarket saleyards, I watched the market very closely for years. I am not boasting when I say that no other honourable member has had such a close experience of the marketing of stock as I have. Eor seventeen and a half years, I was a licensed auctioneer and for eight years of that period I sold stock at Newmarket. I missed only three sales. a very good record, but it has nothing to do with the bill. attending that great selling centre, I learned that when the big exporters relax"" on prices, the "" mosquito brigade "" consisting of 20 or 25 small 'exporters immediately came' into the market and maintained prices at a fair level Had it not been for their operations, the bottom would have fallen out of the fat lamb market. Individually, those operators do not export many lambs, but collectively they export large numbers. Why' should the big companies have the opportunity to submit for appointment to the board the names of two persons, whilst the comparatively large number of small exporters will be debarred from nominating a representative? That proposal is not in the best interests, of marketing in Australia. On many occasions, the Government has declared that it favours the small man. Therefore, the small man in the meat trade should be given his chance. If he had been debarred from buying lambs for export and other purposes, the price of stock in Australia would not have been so stable as it was in the past. Naturally the large exporters-the y can be counted on the fingers of one handcould agree to let prices fall by three farthings or one penny per lb., perhaps more. Buti f they know that the moment prices begin to decline the "" mosquito brigade"" will purchase stock, they are not so likely to let the market fall. For -those reasons, I am opposed to the big exporting companies having two representatives on the hoard. Mr 'CALWELL -Who stated that the Evidently, the big companies would have two representatives on the board? that they will. I contend that the small exporters should have the right to nominate a member. I am not opposed to the large exporters having a voice in an advisory capacity. Probably, they could shed light on certain matters which may be of great advantage to the trade. But the proposal to allow the big exporters, who are purchasers, a share of the control over the producers' stock while denying to the small butchers the same privilege is entirely unjust. The board should be under producer-control and for that reason, I have emphasized the failure to allow the Primary Producers Union a representative. I shall not refer at length to the power of veto, because other honourable members have already dealt effectively with that subject. In my opinion, the proposal is unjust. The chairman of the hoard should not be able to overrule the decision of the majority of members. So far as I am aware, the proposal is unique. Undoubtedly, the chairman should have a deliberative and a casting vote, but he should not be empowered to override the decisions of the board. Australia must make provision for the organized marketing of stock, but this bill will not achieve the best results. As I stated, the New Zealand meat board has definite advantages compared with the proposed Australian meat board. In addition, the New Zealand board has proved itself after years of trial,",74,Second Reading

242,Mr Turnbull,"It is well knownestablished it. whether a Labour government established the New Zealand board, but I shall support any proposal for the establishment of a board which will serve the best interests of the meat-producers of Australia. In entering my protest against certain portions of this bill, I voice the opinion of many primary producers. I consider that the appointment to the board of a man who is a breeder will have great advantages. beard may be breeders. will. The wider selection will not detract from the excellence of the appointment. Indeed, the wider the selection, the greater will be the chance of obtaining the services of men of outstanding experience in the fat stock trade. Summarizing my views on the bill, I emphasize that I am strongly opposed to the chairman's power of veto. contend also that the proposed composition of the board will not be in the best interests of producers. As I have shown, the New Zealand board includes a'stock and station agent. A stock and station agent has a wide experience of marketing, and his knowledge would be invaluable to the Australian Meat Board. The honourable member for Indi mentioned that when a buyer attends a stock sale, he must be able to calculate exactly the dead weight of a sheep by looking at it when it is alive. Exporters and butchers who buy at stock auctions naturally endeavour to purchase as cheaply as possible. The person who keeps them "" up to the mark "" is the auctioneer. Auctions are always a fight between the auctioneer and the buyer, the auctioneer endeavouring to obtain the highest possible price and the purchaser endeavouring to buy as cheaply as possible. orable member is not in order in giving adissertation on auctioneering.

Such power should not be given to the chairman of the proposed' board. I believe that producer-control should reign. It is useless to tell the producers that they are to have complete control when the final word rests with the chairman. Much has been said about technical points in this debate; but I emphasize the practical point of view. The producers are capable of operating the scheme; but if the chairman is to be given power of veto, and to refer his dissent to the Minister, all the talk by honourable members opposite of producer-control in this instance is . eye-wash. Tho second point I emphasize is that the Australia.n Primary Producers Union should be enabled at least to meet the Minister, I with a view to nominating a representative to the proposed board. I do not believe that the meat exporters should have two representatives on the board. Perhaps, I could agree to their being given one representative. However, representatives of the exporters should he consulted in an advisory capacity only. If the Minister wishes to retain the proposed numerical strength of the board he should give an additional representative to the lamb producers, because the export and marketing of lambs is of paramount importance to the industry. After all, successful marketing crowns the work of the producer. Unless 'representation on the board be given to the producers of lamb who understand thoroughly their phase of the industry, we shall not utilize fully the means at our disposal to make a success of this scheme in the interests of the nation. 110.48] -Listening to the second-reading speech of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully), one's first impression was that primary producers were being given fair repesentation on the proposed control board; but 'subsequently one learned that all decisions of",75,Second Reading

However, whatever their reasons for joining the Australian Primary Producers Union may be, the fact remains that that organization has the greatest membership of any primary producers organization in the Commonwealth. I am sorry that the Minister was not able to attend the annual conference of the union which was held at Geelong on the 3rd July. The Premier of Victoria attended that conference and eulogized the manner in which delegates discussed their problems, and placed their case before him in respect of the recent hold-up of the sale of meat in Melbourne. He admitted that the representatives of that organization gave him information regarding that dispute which he did not previously possess. Those representatives were prepared to meet the Minister in Canberra, or in Sydney, or amy other centre, which suited the Minister's convenience; and . he would have saved himself a tremendous lot of trouble had he taken them into his confidence. To-day, they feel that they are not wanted, that they have been consistently repulsed. They resent such treatment. However, it has been instrumental in building up the union membership which has increased hy over 300 per cent, during the last twelve months. The union now claims to have more meat producers among its members than has any other organization in Australia. Even at this late hour, I appeal to the Minister to send a. telegram to the union intimating that he is prepared to discuss this matter with its representatives in Canberra. If the Minister does that, I am certain that those representatives will hurry for Canberra as quickly as they can. Because they have so much faith in their claims, they are prepared to do everything possible to submit them to the Governmenjt. The Minister woulldi be well advised at least to listen to their representations. After all, there is nothing to prevent the Minister from rejecting their claims. I hope that I have said sufficient to induce the Minister to arrange for them to interview him in the near future. mary Producers Union an Australia wide organization? Mr MoDonald. 4 made remarkable strides in Tasmania, Victoria, South Australia, and . New Zealand, and before the next Parliament assembles it will be established in Western Australia and Queensland. I appeal to the Minister to do justice to this organization which has banded together the producers on the one-man farms, who are doing yeoman service in the interests of primary production, but, unlike the big man, cannot spare sufficient time to attend conferences. However, the small producers have now become articulate. They represent the backbone of primary production; and they have right on their side. At the committee stage I propose to move an amendment in an endeavour to insure that the Australian Primary Producers Union shall be given a representative on the proposed board. After all, the board will be hand-picked by the Minister from names submitted to him by the organization mentioned. He can please himself as to whom he appoints. I repeat that the Premier of Victoria found the union most helpful to him in dealing with the recent trouble in the meat industry in that State, and I urge the Minister in his own interests to accept . similar help from that organization. I shall deal more fully with this matter at the committee stage. personal explanation. While I am a member of the HouseI do not wish to make any statement which is not correct.

268,Mr Scully (Gwydir,"Minister forrepresentatives of only federally constituted bodies. . About that time, 1 received correspondence from the Australian Primary Producers Union, which had its origin in Victoria, asking for an interview, in reference to the bill. Several other State sectional organizations also expressed a desire to meet me, with a view to discussing matters appertaining to the bill. In every instance, I said that I would consult only federal organizations. I have kept my word. The organizations I have met are representative of all sections of the meat producers throughout the Commonwealth: in Queensland, the Settlers and Selectors Association and the Graziers Association; in New South Wales, the Wheat Growers Federation, the Farmers and Settlers Association, and the Graziers Association; .in Victoria, the Wheat Producers Union; and in. Western Australia, another organization of primary producers. I have not one word to say against the members of the Australian Primary Producers Union, which has agitated the minds of honourable members opposite. I know a few of the members individually, and appreciate their worth to the fullest degree. It is extraordinary that this organization should suddenly have become federal in character only after I had replied to it. I congratulate its organizers on its rapid spread, first into South. Australia and then into New South Wales and Tasmania. In a telephone conservation. I informed the president of the organization,who said that either he or a -member of. his executive would come to Canberra, that I expected to be in Melbourne shortly and would then discuss with him matters of mutual interest. He thanked me, and I believe that our relations will be cordial. There is no need for members of the Opposition to work themselves into a frenzy. SinceI have been Minister .for Commerce and Agriculture, the door of my department has always been open to the representatives of all sections of primary producers throughout the Commonwealth, and this organization will not be an exception to that rule. In the constitution of the proposed new Australian Meat Board, the representation will be on an Australia wide basis. The Government is giving effect to its policy that producers shall have a majority of the representatives on the board. To conform with this policy, regard must be had, in the first instance, to the general interest of the industry as a whole, and, secondly, to the volume and value of production within the States. The bill provides that there shall be seven representatives of producers on a board of twelve members, including the chairman. The endeavour is being made to cover production according to the classes and value of meat; consequently, there will be three representatives of lamb producers, two representatives of beef producers, and one representative each of mutton and pig producers. Representation by States, advocated by the honourable members for Bass( Mr Barnard) and Denison (Dr. Gaha), has not proved satisfactory in the past. The Government has departed from that principle in the constitution of the Australian Wheat Board, the proposed new meat board, the Australian Dairy Board, and several of the committees and boards set up under National Security Regulations. It is considered that the value and volume of production should determine, to some degree, the basis of producer representation. For example, the exports of meat from Tasmania have rarely exceeded in. any year 2,000 tons of a total exportable annual surplus of 260,000 tons. On that ' basis, Tasmania would not be entitled to representation on the new board. It has only partial representation on the Australian Dairy Board, because of the relative unimportance of its dairy production, but has a preponderance of representation on the Apple and Pear Board, as it is the largest and most important fruitexporting State of the Commonwealth. This principle is fundamentally sound, and should not be departed from. State interests in the meat industry will be fully safeguarded by the"" appointment of the proposed State committees, which will"" act in an advisory capacity to the board on meat industry matters pertaining to the State., This system-of representation has proved very successful in the existing meat control organization; the experience gained during three years of control has proved that conclusively. Therefore, the Government intends to continue it in future in respect of, not only the .meat industry, hut also other primary industries. The fight honorahle member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) commended the board. that is now operating for the good work it had done over a number of years and deplored the proposal to supersede it by the new board Minister. Therefore, this is not a new about to be constituted. That board has given general satisfaction, and has worked of the legislation on this subject introexclusively on the State committee principle. As the. principle has proved so successful, the Government considers that its continuance will meet the wishes of those who favour representation on a State basis. One bone of contention has been that ment of members of the board. Obviously the chairman of the board may dissent he had not read the bill. from decisions arrived at by a majority of its members. This matter was disprovision for a term of three years. The cussed at length with the organizations Minister.is to have the right to re-appoint ' of primary producers that I met in conretiring members. I desire that the ference. They, too, are opposed to the associations shall be entitled to submit proposal, perhaps reasonably. the matter from the stand-point of the Government and in the light of the responsibility of the Parliament, it is considered that the Minister should have formation regarding the functions of the the final voice in matters of serious board.

The industry in Tasmania produces these Iambs partly because of the favorable climatic conditions in that State, but largely, because of the scientific manner in which the industry has been established there. The State Department of Agriculture sent its officers out to instruct .prospective producers of fat lambs as to the' best means of laying down pastures. The industry was growing rapidly when tlie war intervened. Had it not been for the war, I believe that the output, of the industry would' have been much greater than it is at present. If the consideration to he given to Tasmania is to be determined by the quantity of meat' it now produces this measure will be considered on a false basis. Expansion of the industry in Tasmania is inevitable, and because of the high quality of the meat produced it is necessary that special representation of the, State should be provided for under the bill.

Our opposition to this amendment does not mean that we refuse to admit that the Australian Primary Producers Union should be included among the bodies which are entitled to representation on the hoard, but is dictated by the necessity to preserve brevity in the definition of the organizations. a.m.] -To every amendment which the Opposition submits, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) should give a considered reply. The purpose of the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Corancorporate in proposed sub-section 4 the Australian Primary Producers Union. This organization extends to four States, and represents in some States, at least, if not in the majority of them, the small producers of lamb and mutton. Therefore, this union is entitled to be considered when the Australian Meat Board is being constituted. So far, the Minister has not replied to the proposal. Certainly, the honourable member for Calare( Mr Breen) stated that there was no reason why half a dozen other primary producers' organizations should not be considered in the same category as the Australian Primary Producers Union. That statement will not bear examination, because the honourable member cannot name any other organization which extends to more than three States and represents so many producers of lamb and mutton. The Australian Primary Producers Union is rapidly extending its influence throughout Australia. Already, it has a very big hold in four States. That should not escape the attention of the Government. If the Minister has any valid reason for. oppos-* ing the amendment, I invite him to state it. Amendment negatived. a.m.] I move That, in proposed new section live, subsection (4.), after the word ""body"", the following words be inserted:"" of producers federally constituted "". Nothing has convinced me of the necessity for this amendment more than the speech 'of the honourable member for Calare( Mr Breen). He declared that he could name dozens of primary producers' organizations and fill pages of the bill with their names. As the proposed new sub-section is now drafted, it means that some day some Minister may name a polo club, croquet club or a dog and cat society The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN -Order!

I dealt fully with the reason for my amendment when speaking to the motion for the second reading of the bill. I again remind that involved; first, moneys which are made available from the public purse, that is from the taxpayers as a whole, to finance transactions between the Government and the Government of the United Kingdom; and, secondly, moneys which are derived from a levy upon meat exported, that is, a levy upon the industry itself. Under the principal act the board had certain powers which were largely of an advisory character hut in some respects those powers were quite definite because they referred -to measures to improve export methods and the promotion of sales of meat in other countries. The money required to finance such activities was raised by an export levy upon the industry. The objections voiced by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) in his second-reading speech to the suggestion made by honourable members on this side of the chamber to delete the veto power of the chairman arose from the fact that certain public moneys were to be made available to the industry under the scheme. I agree with that contention; and I do not propose to repeat my arguments on the point. Parliament, is responsible for the expenditure of public moneys; but moneys which are derived from a levy upon the industry respect of such moneys I submit that The proposed amendment limit4 ing the power of dissent to the financial activities of the board is not sound. There are policy decisions which ultimately may affect the funds advanced by the Commonwealth Government to the board which may not be acceptablo to the Commonwealth Government. The power of dissent from such decisions must, therefore, remain with the chairman. I cannot accept the amendment. two classes .of moneys are a.m.] I refer particularly to the activities of the previous board. Under this measure entirely new, and almost despotic, powers over .all phases of the industry are to be given to the board; and these powers involve the expenditure of public moneys. I am not referring to those moneys, but to. moneys used to finance the activities of the board to which I have referred and which are raised by a levy upon the. industry itself. In respect of those moneys, the chairman should have no right of veto at all. The expenditure of such moneys should be a matter for a majority decision of members of the hoard. Amendment negatived.

The reason for giving such powers to the board is that to-day we have government purchase. So far as I can see, government purchase will continue until 1948, when the present arrangement between the United Kingdom and Australia will be terminated.

The honourable member for Calare( Mr Breen), who does not lack frankness, gave interesting reasons why the Government has introduced this bill. He said that the purpose of the legislation, wasstabilization, and that a principle is written into the measure for the purpose of putting a floor in the meat market.' Most people do not object to floors in houses, but some of us object to a government fixing a low ceiling price for meat, so that the producer will not get for his product the price that he deserves. It is interesting to note that the honourable member for Calare advanced an entirely different reason for the introduction of this bill from that given by the Minister( Mr Bill returned from the Senate without Scully) in his second-reading speech. The Minister said that the purpose of the measure is to provide for the reconstitution of the Australian Meat Board, and to grant to the board additional powers necessary to enable it to carry out work in relation to the long-term purchase agreement covering meat export entered into between the Governments of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. The. Minister did not say anything about the principles referred to by the honourable"" member for Calare. Perhaps he spoke on different lines in caucus, and the honourable member for Calare has. been guided by what the Minister said there. That is what is worrying the honourable member for Deakin and other honourable members. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN What has happened in caucus is not under discussion by the committee. intended to implement a long-term agreement between the United Kingdom and Australia for three years, or is it intended under the cloak of that agreement to do something entirely different? If so, let the Minister say so; if not, let him deny it. I suggest that room should be left for the exploitation of markets in places other than the United Kingdom. The greatness of Great Britain and of the United States of America was established upon the principle that the trade followed the flag. In other words, traders found their own markets by their own initiative. There is in the United States of America at the present time a market for our lamb, and that, market should be exploited. However, there will be little, opportunity for this if the export trade is to be ."" cribbed, cabined and confined"" by a scheme of indefinite duration. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to.

339,Mr Abbott,"I s this legislationThe following ansiuers to questions were circulated:notice--1. What amounts of land tax and income tax were outstanding for each of the years 1943-44, 1044-45 -and 1945-40? 2. What efforts are being made to collect these amounts? honourable member's questions are as follows :1. The total amount of land tax assessed but uncollected at the 30th June,. 1946, was £306,693. The amount of income tax assessed but uncollected nt the 30th June, 194G, was approximately £41,000,000. The separate amounts of land tax and income tax outstanding for each financial year have not been calculated, but the greater part of tax assessed but uncollected at the 30th June, 194G, would he attributableto the financial year 1945-46: 2. Every effort possible having regard to the extra burden placed upon the Taxation Depart-, ment by war-time legislation and the difficulties of obtaining and .training staff is constantly made to collect outstanding tax as it becomes due. It should lie remembered that a considerable portion of the amount outstanding was not actually overdue at the 30th June because the time allowed for payment had not expired. Commerce notice1. In view of the steady decline in dairy protrial Finance Department on the 2nd duction and the continuous reduction in the number o£ dairy cows in milk and the shortage of dairy heifers coming on to replace them, will he prepare a comparative statement of the position of the relative numbers in 1939-40 and 1.945-40? 2. Will he secure from the officers of his department or, if necessary, the State Agriculture Departments an estimate of the number of years before the enlargement of the dairy herds could restore pre-war milk production, and also an estimate of the incentive price necessary to stimulate action in this direction by the dairy farmers of Australia in increasing their herds? orable follows:1. Figures relating to numbers of dairy heifers in Australia are not available for years prior to 1943, and the figures for 1946 for all classes of dairy cattle are not yet available. The following table sets out comparative figures as at the beginning of 1940, the 3>lst March, 1943, and 31st ""March. 1945:-1910. 1943. 1945. .

Milk, production in 1939-40 was .1,254,000,000 gallons. Owing to the war and drought seasons the supply decreased to approximately 1.048,000,000 gallons in 194.5-46. It is estimated that, it will take another five years before enlargement of dairy herds will reach a level capable of increasing the production of milk to pro-war' level. i' lionorable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) asked a question regarding advances made by the Commonwealth Bank for housing and industrial purposes. I now inform the honourable member that, during the six months from the inception of housing loans to the 30th June, 1946, 961 Credit Foncier loans to amount of £920,000. In addition, finance totalling £5,100,000 has been approved and Agriculture, upon for building societies since the end of the war.

Mr Forde,"On' the 12th July, theI t is not possible, from tbe particulars given, to identify definitely tbe balU' bearing transactions, but I have ascertained that an application for the importation of ball-bearings from Sweden was received by the Division of Import Procurement on the 23rd January, 1946, no supporting data being given. ' On the 27th February, the applicant was advised that licence would be granted for 4,544 bearings, but that the balance of 1,900 bearings was available from United Kingdom sources. This advice was based on the best information available to the department. The licence was issued on the 7th March-si x weeks after receipt of the application, not three months a9 charged by the right honourable member. Only in June was the department advised of possible difficulty in obtaining delivery from the United Kingdom and subsequent information from the United Kingdom indicated that at least half of the most important types could be delivered within twelve to fourteen weeks. It is the practice of the department to check applications for import licences for ball-bearings first against surplus stocks heldby the Department of ' Munitions and secondly against available supplies from the United Kingdom. However, to avoid the possibility of harmful delays, the Division of Import Procurement some time ago authorized the granting of -licences to a total value of £20,000 c.i.f. & e. to S.K.F. Ball Bearing Company (Australia) Proprietary Limited, without such check In regard to 1-lb. hammers, the particulars given are insufficient to identify the transaction in the departmental records, hut if the right honourable member will supply tnorci details, a further inquiry will be made. Three applications were received (on the 13th, 14th, and 20th May respectively) for licences to import roller-chain. The issue of licences in respect of all three applications was authorized on the 20th June. During the war, stocks of motorvehicle and tractor spare parts were maintained by Government purchase in order to avoid break-downs of ess.ential equipment. The slight delay which occurred was unavoidable, as it was necessary to check the goods shown on the applications against remaining stocks. The right honourable member will realize that the process of checking licence applications against available supplies, first inside Australia and secondly from sterling sources, which is essential if our limited overseas currency resources are to be conserved for essential requirements, inevitably involves a certain amount of delay. The delays encountered are not excessive in view of the great volume of transactions involved. E a r i i E TRADE PREFERENCE. honourable member for Bourke( Mr Bryson) asked a question concerning the conditions governing the application of preferential rates of duty on goods produced by Empire countries. The Minister for Trade and Customs has now informed me that duties under the Australian Customs Tariff are payable on goods in the condition in which they are imported, and not on the materials as such Which are used in their manufacture. The tariff does not prescribe British Empire Preferential rates of duty. The tariff preferences granted by the Commonwealth are the subjects of separate agreements with the United Kingdom, the Dominion of Canada and the' Dominion of New Zealand. The rates of duty, and therefore the margins of preference, negotiated with these countries vary and, in view of this, variation an Empire qualifying content is not practicable but the value of Australian materials used in making goods for which, on importation, preference is claimed may be included in calculating the qualifying content. The honourable member may be referring to a recent case in which material of United Kingdom origin was used in the manufacture of certain goods in New Zealand. The finished goods were not the produce or manufacture of New Zealand, as prescribed, that is/less than 50 per cent, of their factory cost was represented by New Zealand and Australian labour and material, and duty at the General Tariff rate was correctly leviable. Similar material is made in Australia, and if such material had been used in the manufacture of the goods in New Zealand, the finished goods would have been admitted at the special rate of duty applicable to goods when the produce or manufacture of New Zealand.",92,Import Licences
