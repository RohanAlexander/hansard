24,The Prime Minister Mr Pigott,"The honorahle memberThe second paragraph, in the question put by the honourable member set out that 1 had made the following statement:That a representative of Armours, the great wheat-buyers of Chicago, had sought, in the middle of 1916, large quantities of Australian wheat on the basis of 12s. 6d. per bushel * Chicago, and were prepared to arrange freight equal to from 8s. to 10s. net. The statement that I made wasHe( Mr Catts) knew for a fact that a representative on behalf of Armours, the great wheat-buyers of Chicago, had sought in tlie middle of 1916 to buy large quantities of Australian wheat on the basis of 12s. 6d. per bushel Chicago, and were prepared to make their own arrangements for freight. This would have worked out at from Ss. to 10s. per bushel net. This sale was refused on the ground that the British Government wanted the wheat to feed her armies and the civilian population. He applauded the farmers for their great patriotism and generosity to Britain. But the farmers should get credit for their self-sacrifice, and not have it drummed into them u n t i l the story became nauseating that they should go down on their knees and thank God for Billy Hughes, their saviour. The third statement attributed to me in the question put by the honorahle member within the bounds prescribed by the wasThat thc payment for wheat to farmers worked out at from 2s. 6d. to 3s. per bushel, instead of 4s. 6d., as promised. WhatI said wasFarmers so far had received 3s. l i d . per but he will not be in order in traversing bushel for their 1915-16 crop, and 3s. for the the whole subject. 1916-17 and 1917-18 crops. made ?

The truth is that they have to small struggling farmers only worked out a large wheat-buying department, and are at from 2s. 6d. to 3s. per bushel, instead of one of the largest buyers of wheat in the something like 4s. 6d. net as promised.

Tlie in Australia endeavouring to arrange with farmer was then charged from 8 to 10 per cent, interest on the account. Wihen a "" divvy "" the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) for a of 6d. came along it was mopped up with new line of steam-ships to connect with interest charges and excess charges for goods, the port of Seattle. and s t ill left tbe farmer in debt. The same operation took place when the next "" d i v v y "" of 6d. was paid, whicE meant that those small ber is now going beyond the reasonable dividends did not really go to the farmer, but limits of a personal explanation, and is to the army of middlemen supplying him with financial accommodation. I notice t h a t the M in is t e r ( Mr Greene), the facts in connection with the offer of in answering these questions, challenged wheat purchase. the accuracy of my statements generally. In the first place, my information as to the price being paid to farmers in Canada was taken from the records of the British House of Conimons, in which it was set out, that the farmers ..were being paid something like 8s. 2d. per bushel for their wheat on the farms in Winnipeg, Canada. Secondly, as to the offer of Armours to buy wheat in Australia in 1916, it is within my own personal knowledge that that offer was made. The Minister referred to Armours as the "" great meat-packers,"" insinuating, with something approaching levity, that it was ridiculous to suggest that meatpackers would be seeking to buy wheat. As a matter of fact, his own information on this subject needsfcohe corrected, since Armours have a great wheat-buying department. Johnson) -!

Gold mining is exempted under the principal Act, and so is the mining for certain metals, . such as tungsten and allied ores, if the outthat a reasonable compromise is now proput is disposed of to the British Government, and if it was begun within the time prescribed by the original Act. The proposed amendment will permit of the exemption of tin mines begun since the 4th August, 1914, and of the mining for other metals if for any reason, such as the low-grade quality of the ore being worked, it is considered desirable to give an exemption. The provision is framed in an elastic way, and it was due originally to the strong desire evinced by the large section of the community interested in tin mining to obtain relief for that industry. copper ? mine in which low-grade ore was being worked under great difficulties, the provision is elastic enough to allow an exemption to be given, but copper mining generally, which has proved fairly lucrative since the war began, 'will not be . exempt. special reason for excluding coal mining from exemption? exemption in the original Act, and there [311]2 is a good reason for the exclusion. The price of coal has risen enormously since the war began, and, although charges have increased, certain mines, even with a diminished output, have made profits which should be taxed. However, I propose to deal in detail with objections when the Committee stage is reached. The profits of agency work arising exclusively from commissions on purchases or sales, wherein little or no capital is required, are exempted. Tliis will probably involve a loss of revenue amounting to £20,000. Under the original Act commercial travellers, and those whose remuneration is fixed regardless of the business done, are the only agents whose profits are exempted. Under the Billi t is proposed to exempt from taxation agents whose business income is derived Coal exclusively from commission, and whose capital expenditure is little or nothing. The provision in the original Aot has, of course, been much debated, and I think posed. We shall still keep within the scope of the original. Act agents whose business is not the result of personal exertion, hut .is chiefly the reward of capital. Under section 11, where a business has not had one pre-war year, or the business has become remunerative only since 4th August, 1914, the Commissioner may grant concessions regarding the tax, but he can do so only to insure the financial stability of the business concerned. Under -this provision it has been impossible to avoid harshness in some cases. It is now proposed to widen the discretion of the Commissioner so that relief may be given not merely where the payment 'of a tax would affect the financial stability of the -business concerned, hut also in cases in which, in the judgment of the Commissioner, the severity of the tax should be abated. There may be a difference of opinion on this, as on other provisions, but the Commissioner has plainly expressed his view that the discretion proposed would be exercised without hardship, and would considerably improve the operation of the law. The Commissioner will also be empowered to allow to any new business such a percentage return on capital as he may determine to he just by",32,Assessment Bill

But the new man, who has to buy and. sell in the same market, is allowed a maximum profit of only 10 per cent, on his capital.

I come now to section 12 of the original Act dealing with alterations of capital. Additional capital is at present entitled to the same rate of profit as tlieold capital. This means that a business is exempt from tax on profits earned by new capital up to the percentage of the pre-war profits, or 10 per cent., whichever is the greater. It is now proposed to allow only Equality of oppor10 per cent, in respect of the new capital. Reversely a reduction of capital,under And equality of responthis amendment, w ill affect the case at the rate of 10 per ceut., whereas under the I do not recommend these as present law the rate of the pre-war standard is used in the calculation. To put the position more clearly before honourable members, let me explain that if a business which, before the war, had a capital of £100,000. and earned 25 per cent, profit, doubled its capital during the war period, then under the principal Act, it y was allowed a 25 per cent, profit in respect of the new £100,000 of capital. We think that that was excessive liberality on our part. We therefore propose that with I shall deal with them respect to capital existing in a business, and brought forward from the pre-war time, the pre-war rates, whatever they were, shall be allowed, but that with repect to capital added during the war,in stead of the pre-war rate, only 10 per cent, shall.be allowed. This provision will be objected to strenuously by a certain class of taxpayers who,in a quite unexpected way, escaped taxation under the original Act . I am quite satisfied, however, that when honourable members come to deal with the matter as a principle, quite apart from the incidental But there is a difeffect of its operation as a tax, they will see that this is a fair provision to make.

This law is retrospective. The Act as originally imposed was to apply to the year beginning on 1st July, 1915, and closing on 30th June, 1916. That was the first year in respect of which an assessment was to be made, and the taxation in respect of that year has already been collected. Whether this B ill be carried or not, we have yet to collect the tax in respect of 1916-17, 1917-18, ..and 1918-19. We are, backward to the extent of two and a half years.

The Government have consulted, I think, the convenience and necessities of the taxpaying community by not collecting more than one taxation yield in the one year. It would have been possible, under the Act, for the Commissioner to levy at once in respect of the three years, but because of the retrospective effect of the Act, he has regarded such a course as being likely to inflict undue hardship, and has therefore not followed it.

It is proposed to abolish the restriction, because in practice it has been found unfair. As an example of the first of the conditions referred to, it may be pointed out that fire insurance companies employ very little capital in the actual business of insurance, but the capital necessarily at stake is large. The premium income is, therefore, a better basis than capital for the comparison between pre-war and war time. May I say in explanation that the ordinary normal business of an insurance company is the reception of premiums and the payment, out of premiums, of working expenses and losses. Although capital has, as in surance to the insured, to be necessarily much larger than the premium income per annum, that capital is frequently invested apart from the business altogether, and is only there in case the premium income should not be large enough to allow the company to pay the losses. Difficulty has arisen in the assessment of such companies, because if it is based on the capital actually used in the business, it seems to be unfair, as compared with otlier businesses. The premium income is deemed by the Taxation Commissioner to be a better basis than capital for the comparison of pre-war and war-time results. If this amendment is made, -the actual operations of the company and their effect on yearly profits will be more in the form of premium income, and not in the form of capital nominally employed in the business. back to the income tax assessment. companies from most, if not all, other enterprises because they are not identical. In consultation w it h the principal insurance men, I find that they see the utter f u t i l it y of endeavouring to measure the results of their business by what capital they have in it . We have only made capital the measure of value, or of allowance before the assessmentof excess, where it really operates in all the phases of the business.

In other words, if the balance-sheet of a company or person shows that that company or person has been pelting money away in advertising, rather than paying it to the Treasury, the Commissioner is empowered to place an advertiser, in regard to that deduction, where he was in 1913-14, and any one who endeavours to evade the tax will find that he still has to pay it, and will he left lamenting. are reasons for this? sons, as the honourable member must know, if he has read the advertising columns of the Sydney and Melbourne papers during the last six or twelve months. of kindness,"" all right! one hand to one class of men who are hit unduly, and reaching out to get those who have escaped fairly lightly; and that, I think, is au ideal attitude for a Treasurer.

I am now dealing with established businesses, ancl there is set up a pre-war standard. .In the matter referred to by the honourable member, the ' clauses dealing with new businesses will govern each decision.

The Commissioner in administration cannot now check this; but under the .Bill he will be -able to disallow unnecessary expenditureI t is considered proper to grant exemption from war-time profits tax in respect of donations to patriotic war funds or to the Repatriation Department. The provision in the income tax law for such deductions has, therefore, now been inIncome tax is allowed in calculating war-time profits, and war-time profits taxation is allowed as a deduction in the calculation of income tax. The result is not quite exact in practice, and a slight amendment is suggested to make the calculation definite. As an illustration of the effect of the amendment, the case may be taken of an individual taxpayer with war-time profits of £5,000 and a pre-war standard of £3,000; his apparent excess profits would be £2,000. From that amount there must be deducted his income tax, say, £566, leaving £1,434 as the taxable excess profits. The tax at 75 per cent, would be £1,075 10s. The income tax assessment of the profits would then be amended by deducting £1,075 10s. from the £5,000 profits, and calculating the income tax on the balance. Any over-payment would be deducted from the excess profits tax or refunded, as the case I am giving relief with required. The present law interpreted strictly would require the adjustment to be continued at length in both assessments. In the case of mining, the income tax law allows a. deduction in respect of profits expended on development or appropriated for development and new plant. The War-time Profits Tax Act only allows deduction' of profits appropriated for development or new plant. Experience shows this to be unfair to small mining businesses, because they generally expend all their income on development as it is received, and have nothing at the end of the accounting period to appropriate. Large businesses did not suffer in this respect. The income tax law enables large and small mining businesses to enjoy deductions of expenditure on or appropriations for development and new plant, and it is proposed to embody the same provision in the War-time Profits Tax Act. reserve for development? will operate if accepted, and the way a similar section operates under the income tax, is that a big company first of all, at the end of a year, ascertains its profits, and sets aside by resolution of the shareholders, on the recommendation of the",37,Assessment Bill

If all, or some of it , is not spent it is brought into the next accounting period. That is the law as it at present stands in regard to appropriated moneys, but expended money is not treated in the same way. ought to bring the War-time Profits Act into line with the Income TaxA c t in relation to large and small mining com« «panies engaged in business. Where, since the first of the three pre-war trade years up to the beginning of the accounting period under assessment, a business has shown a loss, and the profits of such accounting period have been applied in extinction of that loss, then a deduction is allowed under the present Act in reckoning profits for tax. Owing to faulty drafting the relief can be given only where there are three f u l l pre-war trade years. mitted to apply the concession where there are less than three such years. It has heen found that the present law acts with undue severity on some businesses established one or two years before the outbreak of war. The Act now permits a deduction to be made fi*om profits equal to the difference between interest paid on borrowed money which has not been repaid at the end of the accounting period and the statutory percentage thereon. Let me make this matter plain. If a man has a capital of £10,000 of his own, and £5,000 borrowed, the latter by way of bank overdraft or otherwise, he is allowed on his own capital, either the pre-war test or 10 per cent., whichever he elects. On the borrowed capital he is allowed the same rate that he pays for it . If he pays 6 per cent, for the money, and elects to take the 10 per cent, rate, he makes a profit on the borrowed money of 4 per cent, nominal, hut he is allowed only the amount that is owing, at the end of the accounting period, on the 30th June or 31st December. It is felt that the average amount of borrowed money used to The Commisproduce the profits in the period under review is the proper factor to take into consideration, and not the amount acciing period. rived at by the average taxpayer? sideration of the facts. In the balance sheet to he assessed the taxpayer can show I think that with fairness we that in daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly rests, his overdraft, or borrowed money, ran at so and so. On this it is a very easy thing to fix the average amount of money borrowed, and assess that sum rather than the particular moneys actually owing at the end of the accounting period. TheB ill , therefore, provides for basing the calculation on the average borrowed mon^y used in the accounting period. The deduction w ill not be made when ascertaining the pre-war standard, as that would penalize the business. It w ill operate only during the war period under review. An amendment is subAnother amendment w ill allow the Commissioner to recognise interest which has accrued and become due, but has not been paid. If a man's balance sheet at the end of his accounting period is prepared in June, and the hank in which hedoes his business closes its hooks on the 31st March or the 30th September, the actual interest on his overdraft is not paid at the date of the preparation of the balance-sheet, because the adjustments between the hank and the customer do not synchronize, but, nevertheless, the money is due, and he can bring it into account in the year as if it were paid. This simply applies a prin ciple which is operating for deduction purposes in the Income Tax Assessment Act. A new sub-clause is proposed to exempt such portion of the profits of co-operative societies as is distributed by way of bonus or is set aside for that purpose, but the tax w ill apply to reserve profits.

164,Mr Watt,"It is arrived at by concatch what are popularly called profiteers -the original Act was designed in that way-'bu t the particular institutions dealt with in this proposed addition to section 15 are the very antithesis of profiteers. They are co-operating units, which seek to prevent men from battening upon them, and to procure supplies for themselves and their families with the abolition, as far as possible, of all secondary or tertiary charges, by cutting out the middleman and getting as close as possible to the producer. The Act, 'as drawn, has shown a dangerI am not sure that it is not more than a danger-of reaching people whom we never intended to reach, who may make a dividend at the end of a year, of, say, Is. or 2s. in the f l on purchases from the co-operating unit, which is equivalent to a reduction in prices when profits are ascertained. We say that all money that comes back to the co-operators or is set aside for that purpose will be free of taxation under this Bill. But there are other companies-and this is why we cannot exempt co-operative companies entirely without great riskthat work under the clothing of co-operative companies, but are merely such in principle and not in effect. I could name numbers of them, but I have no wish to particularize, because they are beneficial organizations. However, mostly they arc trading propositions, which should pay this tax if they are liable for it,. This provision will bring them under the tax, because it will apply to profits made hy trading with people other than members of the societies.

Under the Land Tax Act a Board consisting of the Commissioner of Taxation, the Secretary to the Treasurer, and the Comptroller-General of Trade and Customs may release taxpayers from the payment of the whole or any part of their land tax if by reason of drought, adverse seasons, or other conditions the returns from the land have been seriously impaired. It is proposed' to give similar relief in connection with the war-time profits tax.

Rules not directly associated with the war and having the immediate effect of widening the area of unemployment, should likewise be repealed, e.g., Rule 233 of 1917-limitatio n of sport. 5. Rules or gazetted prohibitions forbidding the introduction into Australia of papers and other periodicals published and freely circulating head&r-sboul d be withdrawn, and the ban removed from publications, the attitude of which to the war is purely Christian and ethical, and entirely free from the taint of disloyalty, e.g., The Ploughshare, The Weapon, Defeat, Tlie Fiddlers, and many others now prohibited. C. Rules apparently designed to placate the animus of a section of the community against another section, and conveying an. imputation of disloyalty on tlie part of a large part of the population should be repealed, e.g., No. SO of 1018. Finally, the Labour party believes that the Statutory Rule is no just substitute for an Act of Parliament, and deplores the extent to which this method of legislation has been re: sorted to. It , nevertheless, thinks that, in the absence of the larger reform, much progress could be made towards a better feeling in the community on tbe lines tentatively laid down herein as a basis on which the Government might be expected to redeem the promises made at the Recruiting Conference, and we trust that we shall soon have necessary administrative evidence of the removal of all obstacles to more harmonious relations amongst the people.

The importance of the impartia l administration of tlie regulations is f u l l y appreciated by tlie Government; but, in the exercise of their discretion, whilst desirous of securing the good-will of a l l sections of the community, the Government must be guided more by the nature of the acts, and the national interests involved, than by thc consideration of the effect that any official action is likely to havein giving offence to any particular class of persons in the community. 2. The Government appreciates with you the value of free discussion, the right of public meetings, and tlie freedom of tlie press; but in war time, rights f u l l y recognised in peace are necessarily subject to certain limitations . in the national interests. limitations imposed to withhold matters advantageous to the enemy or likely to give offence to an allied Power. The Government hold strongly the vicw that the further limitation not mentioned by you is also necessary -th c prohibition of matter prejudicial to recruiting. You make reference to tlie censorship of the press, but you suggest the repeal of no particular regulation in this regard. It is presumed, therefore, that you aro more concerned with the administration in this connection. In reply, I desire to inform you tliat recently a conference of representatives of the press was held to consider the question of press censorship. were constituted as a Board of Appeal. The Labour press is represented, and any matter on which the press feel themselves aggrieved can be referred to this Board and dealt with. It is considered that this should remove any objections whicli have been raised in connection with tlie administration. You specify Statutory Rule 1917, No. 304, and various amendments, and presumably refer particularly to Regulation 42 of the M i l it a r y Service Referendum Regulations, which deals w it h the making of false statements of fact of a kind likely to affect thc judgment of electors in relation to their votes.

W it h respect to those Statutory Rules whicli, in your judgment, prejudicially affect the status of industrial organizations, and the conditions of labour and employment, I desire to inform you that the vicw of the Government with regard to those specifically mentioned b}' you is as follows:Statutory Rule 1917, No. 190, imposes a penalty on those who interfere with or hinder the discharge, loading, coaling, or despatch of shipping, or with industrial operations connected therewith. This regulation being necessary for the protection of transports in time of war, its continuance is considered necessary for the national well-being and the efficient prosecution of the war. Statutory Rule 1917, No. 196, prevents the institution , of certain actions arising out of the failure to perform certain contracts for You mention the the sale and delivery of wheat. As the regulation was intended by the Government for the protection of the Commonwealth and State Governments, and officers and authorities of tlie Commonwealth and the Statesi n respect of action taken in the public Interesti n connection w it h the Wheat Pool, it is difficult to understand why the repeal of this regulation is asked for. Several regulations of a similar character exist, and are necessary for conserving public interests. This regulation can in no way be construed as an obstacle to recruiting. To o n l y one of o u r requests in t h is r e g a r d d i d the G o v e r n m e nt agree, a n d t h a t was A committee of four (4) in connection w it h the r e f e r e n d u m Statutory Rule 1917, No. 212, confers upon the Governor General the power to de-register organizations registered under any Commonwealth or State Act.

As certain rights have accrued to persons under this regulation, it is not considered just that those persons should be deprived of whatever protection thc regulation gives them. 4. The Government arc quite willing to reconsider any regulation which is not directly associated with the war the immediate effect of whicli can be shown to widen the area of employment. Tlie desire of the Government is to extend, rather than limit , the area of employment in Australia. Statutory Eule 1917, No. 233, of whicli you seelc the repeal, is the regulation which gives the Government control over race meetings and other sporting events. necessary, in thc public interests, to l i m it horse-racing and boxing. cannot sec its way to repeal this regulation, especially in view of the strong public opinion which exists that unrestricted sport is prejudicial to recruiting. 5. 1 presume you refer, in paragraph 5 of your letter, rather to the administration of Statutory Eule 1917, No. 255, than to its repeal. It is essential that the Government should have the power to prohibit the publication, possession, or transmission of certain prohibited publications. You mention a number which have already been proclaimed as prohibited publications. The Government have already reviewed the list with reference to the publications mentioned by you, and w ill further consider how far it is necessary, to continue the prohibition of any particular publication. C. You ask for the repeal of rules which you say are "" apparently designed to placate the animus of one section of the community against another section, and conveying imputations of disloyalty on the part ""of a large portion of the population,"" and you specify in this connection the repeal of Statutory Eule 1918, No. 86. The Statutory Eule to which you refer is aimed at the punishing of any person who advocates, incites, or encourages This regulation was indisloyalty or hostility to the British Empire, or to the cause of the Britisli Empire in the present war, or advocates the dismembermentof the British Empire. Tlie regulation also make3 it an offence for any person .to wear D u r in g the whole of t h is or display any badge, flag, emblem, banner, or symbol, being or purporting to bo the badge, flag, or banner, emblem, or symbol of a country with which thc K i ng is now at war, or of any body or association who are disaffected to the British Empire, or the Socialists Association, or movement known as Sinn Fein. Y o u r e f e r to the numbers .From the reading of the regulation, you w ill see that the regulation is not designed to "" placate the animus"" of any section of the community against any other section; but it distinctly aims at the prevention of disloyalty The great b u l k of them or hostility to the Empire. As thc advocacy , of such disloyalty or hostility at the present time is so obviously inimical to the preservation of tlie Commonwealth, the Goveniment cannot consent to its repeal. I cannot see how it can be contended that thc existence of such a regulation can be said to be an obstacle in tlie way of recruiting. Thc Government w i ll take immediate steps to repeal such of the above regulations the repeal of which are specifically indicated. In conclusion, the Government recognise tlie desirableness of parliamentary action as a general rule, but the object of the enactment of the War Precautions Act was to enable prompt and effective action to be taken' in war time. Moreover, the vast majority of tbe regulations made under that Act are distinctly of a type usually made by the Executive, acting under statutory authority. The GovernI t has been found ment have already, by the release of persons in prison, the remission of outstanding Tho Government penalties, and the abandonment of prosecutions, redeemed the promises made at the recent Conference; and assures you that, in the administration of the. regulations, regard w ill be had to the attitude taken by the Government at that Conference.

In my opinion, the Government of a member of Parliament, she might get to know all about the war regulations. That in itself would be enough to I doubt very much if there is a member of the House who knows the effect of a hundredth part of these regulations; it is only when one "" bumps "" up against them that their effect is felt. The Director of Munitions, the Comptroller of Shipping, the chairman of the Wool Committee, and the Chief Prices Commissioner were asked to give their opinion as to the repeal of these regulations; and'I wish to put on record that some of these men have rendered valuable service to the community during the conduct of the war, many of them in an honorary capacity. But it is only human nature to seek to retain any power that one may possess; indeed, that was one of the reasons which actuated the people in voting in the negative at the conscription referendum. By the way, there was a very instructive article in the Age a month or more ago, giving a list of the Boards and other bodies to which the powers of the Government have been delegated; and now we are told in the press that a Board is to be appointed to discover where economies can he effected. It should be the responsibility of the Minister of the day to undertake this task.

As the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, if honourable members had known that the original Bill was being asked for to give power to frame some of the regulations which have heen issued under the measure, it would never have been passed. When tremendous power is placed in the hands of any body of men, military, naval, or achieved. I admit that, had I heen the Minister controlling a Department issuing these regulations, and if I had been surrounded by bureaucrats pressing continuously for the passing of regulations to govern this thing or that tiling my view might have been just as circumscribed as that of the Minister, but looking at these matters from the point of view of the man outside, I feel that, after four years of stress and strain, the time has arrived when fears for the safety of the realm have passed, and there is. no further need of the powers asked for in this Bill. A t any rate, in times of peace Ministers should not combine the authority to control their big commercial operations with the general power to do just reasonably have made a selection of the powers bhey wish to retain. so.

Honourable members have been asked to come here and ""vote money to enable the Governmeut to .do just as they and our justification for voting the money was that we believed that we were giving the Government lives and liberties of citizens of this country from the depredations of the enemy; but now, although there is no signed declaration of peace, seeing that has handed over her navy, that her soldiers have retired to the Rhine, and that eight or nine Republics have replaced the once powerful Empire, does any one believe that she is going to get together again a fighting force capable of defeating the Allied armies? would make such a statement. fore there is no necessity for the extension of the powers given by the War Precautions Act.

He must be an excellent lawyer, and, as in the case of the medical man who they is able to give professional advice without committing himself too closely, so that he cannot be pinned down if anything should happen afterwards, it is hard to pin him down.

298,I Do Not Think The Average Mr Boyd,"That does not affect the country were in danger. But, surely, the test is-I s there any risk of our country being submerged by the enemy? If so, I would give the Government or an autocrat any power necessary to save the country at such a time. necessary there is no reason why such a power should be given. . To-day the nation which has been the bugbear of Europe for the last forty years lies in the dust, down and out. And where do we stand ? Great Britain stands on the very pinnacle of both military and naval power, a position which it has never occupied at any previous time in its history. Even Australia has more than twice as many trained soldiers who have been in action than Britain had in its entire army when war broke out. And other Dominions of the Empire stand in exactly the same position. The only other nation of any consequence that could challenge the' might of Great Britain is America, which is now linked with the British Empire on more friendly terms than have ever subsisted between the two' nations since the American colonies won their independence. W it h such a power in the hands of the Anglo-Saxon race, what chance is there of any further war in the near future? The present war is practically finished, and if we accept the definition given by the British Legal Committee of the time when the war will end, as the date when the ratification of the peace terms is accepted by the belligerent nations, the War Precautions Act will cease automatically on that date. The Government have all the time between now and then to prepare what this House desires, and ought to have, namely, a .measure continuing those functions which the Government desire to continue to operate after the declaration of peace. To such a measure I do not think there will be any opposition; but unless the Government are prepared to take some means to meet the views of the Housei n that regard, they will have an extremely difficult task in placing on the statute-book a B i ll to extend the duration of the War Precautions Act. This remark by the Minister in his in troductory speech is a gemTf the Act is extended immediate action will be taken to repeal regulations or orders no longer necessary or reirnve Government control as soon as"" prss blp in all cues where it : is practicable or advisable to do so. Mr Hrt'jd. What does that mean ? Absolutely nothing. It sounds very well, but its only effect is that Parliament will remain a cypher. As I have pointed out before, the modern tendency of Democracies If it is not which have constitutional government is to d r if t the power more and more into the hands of the Government, instead of the people's representatives. And within that charmed Ministerial circle there is a tendency observable, in Australia at any rate, to d r if t the power from Ministers into the hands of the Prime Minister until he becomes an absolute dictator. to unofficial dictators. a better illustration of that than the position of William Morris Hughes, as Australia's dictator under the War Precautions Act. Realizing the position in which the Empire stood during the wax we have had to agree to that state of affairs, because we believed that it was in the best interests of our country. But now that peace is at hand, I no longer believe that any man, no matter how shrewd or capable he may be, is able to control the affairs and destinies of this country merely through the inner consciousness of either himself or his colleagues. The assistance of Parliament is essentia] to ths good government of this country, and people have only put up with the effect of the War Precautions Regulations for the reasons I have mentioned. Here is another carefully thought out and definitely expressed opinon given by the Minister-""The Government have no desire to control the censorship."" It would have been all right had the honourable gentleman stopped there, but he added,"" beyond what is absolutely neoessary."" Of course, tlie Government has no such desire. "" W h y , "" the Minister asks, "" don't we allow you to publish the departure of ships, and the fact that a troopship is arriving next week?"" member think the continuance of the censorship necessary ? negotiations are proceeding? ber differs from the British Government.",53,Smith Copie S Of Every As Obstacles To Recruiting

305,Mr Groom,"Then the honourable memWar Precautions There were a lot of stupid persons in the British Government who lost their billets during the war. British Government are a pretty safe guide for the Empire. Prime Minister and a lot of hi9 colleagues had to be removed before the right men were obtained. should not forget the good work done by the gentleman to whom ho refers. tribute to the work of those who have steered the Empire through this crisis. No one doubts my loyalty to the Empire. There is no special genius in the British Government above other Governments. A British Cabinet is composed of men with the ordinary human frailties and liability to err. During the war I have, on more than one occasion, expressed in this chamber my opinion about the censorship. Tire manner in which the American Government has dealt with war news is in sharp contrast to the practice of the British Government. Every week the American Government has made public the number of American troops in Prance, and the list of casualties has been published daily. The advances made by American troops have been made known; only details as to battalions and the like have been withheld. All that information was published in the American newspapers during the war. ber of ships leaving America. transports leaving was published. What happened ? Net oue transport was lost on its way from America to Great Britain. What is more, the American public was satisfied with the information it was getting. The British Government sometimes gave false information. It stated that the A vdacious, which was torpedoed in the Irish Channel, was towed into port and repaired. America published was'all of it advantageous to the Allies. America was not in the war when the Allies were being kicked from pillar to post. [27 NOVEMBER, 1918-1 BiU. 8425 I do not care if I do. Mi-. BOYD -Doubtless the information published in America had a bad effect on the other side. It made them the more inclined to give up the struggle. censorship is not so severe as in Australia. was censored in Great Britain has been censored again before being published in Australia. What does the Government mean in saying that it has no desire to control the censorship beyond what is absolutely necessary? The determination of the necessity lies with Ministers, not with Parliament. If Ministers think it necessary to prohibit the publication of a member's speeoh, there is no preventing it . Parliament has given them the power to do this. Another statement made by the Minister was that "" the general policy will be to restore the right of expression of public opinion and freedom of discussion as speedily as possible."" Peace has practically come, but the Government still has power to prevent the publication of speeches delivered in .this chamber upon measures affecting the welfare of tbe country. What right have Ministers to say that there shall or shall not be an expression of public opinion and freedom of discussion ? They draw from the people the powers that they wield. dom of opinion. some persons have had to serve sentences for expressing their opinions, and rightly so, too. But the necessity for war-time restrictions dees not continue in time of peace. The Government should take the earliest opportunity to wind up the different Pools, instead of continuing them Ra a function of government. The. party that sits on this side is opposed to the policy represented by the establishment of these Pools. My friends opposite, who are believers in Socialism, approve of it . a proper way. on this side are totally opposed to this policy.

319,,"The information which Mr BOYD A great majority of thosehave developed an extraordinary state of miud in contemplating the difficulty that would follow the non-continuance of the Act. I am led to that conclusion by the words that he used in referring to the extension of control over matters affecting the financial and business interests which have been handed over to Government Boards. A f t e r dealing w i th the Wool Pool., he said, "" The activities of the Wool Committee include, also, the handling of sheepskins."" "" A mere reference to this activity shows how impossible it is to contemplate its sudden termination."" I do not know that there is anything extraordinary in the control of sheepskins. It seems to me an exceedingly simple matter. the whole of the wool activities. council of the Chamber of Commerce, which, at a meeting held yesterday, passed the following resolution, and directed that it should be forwarded to the Acting Prime Minister( MrW a t t ) : That this Council re-affirms the principle that tlie interests of the Commonwealth will be best served as regards production, trade, nnu commerce by the cessation, as soon as practicable, of the restrictions and. control conditions prevailing before the war, the sidered necessary in time of war. Further, that this Council considers it is now practicable to repeal many, if not all, the regulations restricting trade and comnierce under thc War Precautions Act. This resolution was passed by a body representing the commercial interests of this State, and the members of which are accustomed to deal with large business matters. They see no difficulty whatever in controlling activities which the Minister says must be controlled by Government Boards unless the commercial and financial interests of the country are to become disorganized. If these interests were controlled by a huge company which suddenly failed, they would not be in the least disorganized if handed over to a receiver. All these gigantic interests, the control of which seems to worry the M i nister, would be attended to by capable men if handed over again to those who were in the habit of dealing with them before the war. The Minister's attitude in this regard reminds me of the story of the young lady who for some months had been expecting her intended to propose, and who, when the proposal did at last come, professed to be surprised, and exclaimed, "" This is so sudden."" We have been anxiously looking forward to the termination of the war. 'We knew and believed that with the coming of peace the Wa r Precautions Act would cease to operate. We knew, also, that there would be difficulties to overcome, but that they would not be insuperable. The difficulties attending the getHe then went on to say, ting of these various activities under control during the war were infinitely greater than those which will surround their return to normal conditions in time of peace. The Minister says that the Government are gradually going to allow conditions to filter back to their pre-war state as times become normal. But will they ever become normal ? What will be normality ? We have undergone changes I am a member of the during the war that may prevent our ever returning to the conditions of life that prevailed before the war occurred. In any event, we are not likely to return to them for many, many years. Would that, however, be any justification for the continuanceof Government control of these activities ? I venture to say it would not, and the sooner we get back to the conbetter for the community and for this Parliament. One of the activities referred to by the Minister was that controlled by the Dairy Produce Committee, which has just been constituted. The Minister read-at greatlength the functions assigned to that Committee, which has just begun its work. But if the work ceased to-morrow, would the cows give less milk, or go dry? A r e the owners of the cows, and the sellers of the milk, not possessed of sufficient brains to enable them to deal with their own products? Has the success of these Government institutions, which have interfered with the commercial life of the community, been such that we should withdraw everything from private enterprise, and hand them over to Government control ? We know that these matters are being controlled by officials. who have been trained in the Public Service, and who may be very efficient public servants; but when they are asked to administer affairs which they do not, and never did,",55,Smith Copie S Of Every As Obstacles To Recruiting
320,Mr Boyd,The Minister seems to,56,Smith Copie S Of Every As Obstacles To Recruiting
321,Mr Gboom,I was referring there to,56,Smith Copie S Of Every As Obstacles To Recruiting
322,Mr Boyd,"understand, what can we expect but in efficiency ? We come now to another item. Let us consider for a moment the attitude of the Government with regard to price fixing. The Minister, in his speech, said that they had changed their policy practically as tihe result of the armistice. He said, in referring to the desirability of introducing legislation to provide for the continuance of price fixingThe termination of hostilities and the prospects of an early peace, in the opinion of the Government render this course unnecessary. . . . The position will, however, be carefully watched. . . . We say that as the conditions gradually come back to normal there will be a relaxation of the powers. It is not intended to extend the operation of the Price Fixing Department unless there appears to be grave cause to do so. In this statement we have the promise that the Government will abolish the right to control such matters, but will retain in their hands the power to interfere if they consider that there appears to be grave cause for interference. In the earlier part of the speech, the Minister made this statement, which I consider to be one of the most important uttered by himThe far-reaching nature of the operations of the war necessitated the exercise of extraordinary emergency powers, the administrative intrusion on the part of the Government into areas of finance, industry, production, and dismight be used for the maintenance of the tribution never before contemplated, and an interference with the rights of individuals and their freedom of action of a character quite alien to the customs of our Tace. What sort of representatives of the people would we be if we tolerated the continuance of that state of affairs five minutes longer than was necessary after the termination of the war? The public will not support the attitude of the Government, and it should be, as far as possible, the object of honourable members. I , for one, am prepared to give what assistance I can-to help the Government to classify those subjects in respect of which they feel it is necessary to have some power. But for the Government to ask for general power to control .anything that it may occur to them to control-o r which it may be suggested to them shoidd be controlled -is unreasonable. to do that without consulting the representatives of tlie people, they are asking for dangerous and autocratic powers which ought not to be granted to them. The Minister told us that the War Precautions Act was passed, in the first place, to secure the public safety and the defence of the Commonwealth. All that has been accomplished, and there is no further necessity for it . The honourable gentleman quoted the decision of the High Court in the Bread case-the only case relating to price fixing that went before it . The quotations that he made from the law reports, however, provide absolutely the best evidence we could get that there would be no possible chance of the Act being upheld .in time of peace. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) has quoted from the judgment of the Chief Justice, Sir Samuel Griffith, fro m which I propose to make the following short extractI agree generally with Mr Mann's argument, that the power to legislate with respect to defence extends to any law which may tend to the conservation or development of the resources of the Commonwealth so far as they can be directed to success in war, or may tend to distress the enemy, or diminish his resources. Clearly, the Chief Justice had in mind the view that the only ground upon which he could hold that price fixing came within the War Precautions Act, and that that Act was constitutional, was because it integrity of the Empire, and more particularly of this country. Mr Justice Isaacs, in his judgment, used practically the same argument. He saidAsI read the Constitution, the Commonwealth, when charged with the duty of defending the Commonwealth and States, is armed as a self-governing portion of the British 'Dominions with the legislative power to do in relation to national defence all that Parliament, as the legislative organ of the nation, may deem advisable to enact in relation to the defence of Australia as a component part of the Empire. The judgment of the H i g h Court rests upon the foundational consideration as to whether this law tends towards the defence of Australia. If it does, it can be justified. If not, then, according to the Court, apparently it cannot be justified. Mr J. H . CATTS -The question was, In seeking authority "" Isi t necessary to enable us, as a nation, to win the' war ?"" decision of the H i gh Court was that it was necessary at.the time that the Court was appealed to. In answer to the honorahle member, I venture to say that if such a case were to go before the Court after the signing of the declaration of peace, it would not be upheld. The end of a war, as understood by ""the average layman-^-aud, after all, we are average laymen representing average laymen-is tlie cessation of hostilities, and there is no body of opinion wortli considering which thinks that tlie war will ever be restarted . the Act continuing ? case, and there is no need for me to obreasons why he should not-h e could even ject; it will operate u n t i l peace is ratified. find many reasons for not giving up his We are told that until the different najob of £600 a year. tions concerned agree to a ratification of the peace treaties, the war cannot be regarded as ended.

A weaker and a more puerile speech has never been submitted to this House. The kind of contemptuous way in which tlie House was treated in this respect should arouse general indignation. A f t e r having this meaningless essay put before us, we should demand that the Government give us their real reasons for wanting the perpetuation of this obnoxious measure. reasons amount to, boiled down ?1. To cover control of affairs during the period of transition from war to peace. 2. To obviate social and economic disturbances that may be caused by cessation of operations of the War Precautions Act all at once. It is stated the War Precautions Regulations were devised1. Mainly for Defence. 2. To control aliens. 3. To prevent internal trouble and disaffection. It is asserted that(a) The internment question will be settled at the Peace Conference. (b) It will be necessary to exercise some degree of censorship t ill peace is ratified. The extension of the Act has been asked for, it is said, byDefence, Munitions Department, Shipping Controller, Wool Committee, Prices Commissioner, Dairy Produce Pool, on account of moratorium and patents. We the this except by a reference to the following decision of a tribunal in England of a legal character: We assume that the war will be ended by a treaty or treaties of peace. In order to arrive at a final conclusion of the treaty, various stages will probably be required, such as. agreements for armistices, cessation of hostilities thereunder, articles of peace, agreement of terms, signature of terms, ratification, exchange or deposit of ratification"".

How long will this be?

By day-time the German surveyors would put in pegs to determine the territory to be annexed; -at night-time the French would pull them up, and so the work had. to be done all ovtr again the next day. Although the Germans were absolutely in the position of dictators, the Peace Conferences 1 extended over a period of eight or nine months. .The present task of settling the. peace terms will be infinitely greater than the problems the Allies have had to deal with during the progress of the war. The Central Empires and Russia are in a state of turmoil and chaos. A hundred or more distinct nationalities are claiming to be set up as independent States or Republics. Ordered government has 'to be arranged in connection with the affairs of all these different nationalities, covering upwards of 100,000,000 or 150,000,000 people. There are also slight differences among the Allies themselves.

Is not our own Prime Minister striding up and down Great Britain sowing seeds of disaffection and sedition against the British Cabinet?

The Government say that they require some time in order to taper off, so to speak, in regard to the administration of the War Precautions Act. What have his they been doing during the last four years ? D i d they not realize that the war would come to an end some time? It is the samo with repatriation. They will wake up to the fact that repatriation is necessary when we have 200,003 soldiers knocking at our doors for employment. In the four years of fighting, the Government have not done one thing to prepare for the day when the war will cease, and enable the country torevert to normal conditions.

Mr J. ll. Catts. Mr J. H . CATTS -As Illawarra w ill send the honourable member into outer darkness when this Parliament ceases, he is not worthy of notice. The newspapers indicate that there is to be a relaxation of the censorship. We were promised that the administration of the War Precautions Act would not be abused, but there is not a Department of the Governmnmet in whicli. there has not been the most outrageous and violent abuse of the Act since it was passed. Every promise given when the Act was introduced has been broken. I have a letter signed by four democratic newspapers showing what the Government mean by the relaxation-of the censorship. It is as follows: Melbourne, 26th November, 1918. To the Acting Prime Minister, We are told by the GovernMelbourne. Dear Sir, We desire to draw your attention to the increased abuse nf the censorship which, in the case ot some papers, seems to have reat-lied its height i'nee tlie signing of the Armistice. Not only wonU or sentences, but whole articles, tlie trend of whose argument is objected to, havo been struck out in papers which have not received such"" treatment in the past. Over and over again news that has appeared in otlier Australian papers has been refused publication in ours. What we really have in Melbourne is a censoring of the already censored, a super-censorship. Papers like the Argus, Age, Sydney Daily Telegraph, &e., with a circulation of hundreds of thousands, have been permitted to publish what has been refused to papers like ours with a much smaller circulation. Such pbras>es as "" Against Imperialism,"" "" For a Constructive Peace by Negotiation,"" have been struck out, though one would naturally suppose that the qualifying word "" constructive"" would rob the word "" peace "" of all fears that are attached to it. We are not making complaints against individual censors, with whom our relations have always been most friendly, but against the system which permits the political instead of the military censorship of a writer's contribution to public opinion, against the system which permits such subjects as freedom, Democracy,, social and industrial reconstruction, to be dealt with from only one political stand-point, against the system wbicb permits the free expression of hate and malice, and forbids the voicing of contrary sentiments. For a hundred years, British people have accepted the fact that a free press is the only has real bulwark of freedom, and we would remind you that both Mr Fisher (Prime Minister), and Mr Hughes (Attorney-Ceneral)-, in 1914",61,Smith Copie S Of Every As Obstacles To Recruiting
349,Mr Hector Lamond,"Howgave solemn pledges to the House, and, therefore, to the people, that the liberties of the people would not be interfered with under the Act; that it was merely devised to meet military needs, such, for instance, as preventing news of military importance being conveyed to the enemy; and Mr Hughes declared unequivocally that "" no general powers"" would be conferred under tbe Act. As far as the democratic papers of Australia are concerned, nothing but ""general powers"" have been directed against them since the Act was passed. Although our patience and forbearance have been severely strained, we have opposed a l l proposals to circumvent the censorship by a secret press, & c , trusting that, with the cessation of hostilities, the Government would gladly re-establish the freedom of the press. We now appeal to the Government, through you, to honour the pledges given by the Prime Minister and Attorney-General in 1914, and to remove at once a l l ""general powers"" from the censorship. Yours faithfully, Editor, Labour Call. R. S. Ross, Editor, SociaUst. VroA GOLDSTEIN, Editor, Woman Voter. F. Editor, That is an indication of the revised, kindly, and considerate methods hy which the Government are restricting the operation of this hitherto vindictive and political censorship. Another indication of the Government exercise of their power under the War Precautions Act waa given by me in this House when I mentioned the criticism by Mr Giles, the farmers' representative on the Wheat Board of the operation of the Wheat Pool by tjhe Government. He said at a farmers' conference at Ouyen that £75,000 had heen mysteriously paid to some person or persons for work which the Prime Minister said he himself had done, and when other serious questions as to the general administration of the Wheat Pool were voiced, what did the Government do? A report of the conference was telegraphed to the Melbourne Age. hut the censor prohibited its publication, and sent a letter to the editor of the local paper at Ouyen, stating that the report of the conference was not to be published in any local newspaper. The suppressed report was not news of military value to the enemy; it had solely to do [312] with the administration of the Government and the functionaries which they had set up. The administration of the Government and its pets must not be criticised; consequently, the facts disclosed at that conference were prohibited from receiving publicity. Price fixing to-day is being carried on under a cloak of secrecy, and if there is not in existence in Australia the most rotten corruption that has ever existed in any country, it is only in spite of every invitation to such a condition of affairs, for the Government, by their censorship of the press and the secrecy of their methods in connection with price fixing, have created those conditions which on other occasions and in otheT countries have produced everything undesirable in publio life. In Sydney a few weeks ago the milk vendors complained that the large milk companies were charging them a price in excess of that fixed by the Government, and their outcry became so inSIN CLAIRE, sistent that the Government were at last Fellowship. compelled to initiate a prosecution. The cases came on before the Central Police Court, Sydney. The representative of the companies asked for an adjournment of the hearing for a fortnight. When the cases were called on a fortnight later the Crown Prosecutor, without offering any explanation, withdrew the charges, and there has been no further action since. There was undoubted evidence which would have led to a conviction of the companies, and had that happer-rl the small vendors could have taken action against the big companies to recover thousands of pounds which they had been overcharged. It is said in Sydney that such adjournments are common, and that immediately they have been granted in connection with cases for offences against the price fixing laws, ""there is a pilgrimage to Melbourne, which results in the prosecutions heing withdrawn. able member to state the facts of that case.

350,Mr Groom,"I should like the honorgeneral statement. The facts are that complaints ""were made in behalf of the Dairymen's Association in Sydney in regard to tlie outrageous violation of the price fixing laws by the great milk companies. Prosecutions were initiated in the Central Police Court, an adjournment was granted, and a fortnight later the cases were withdrawn without any explanation.

Mr J. H . CATTS -The honourable member can turn up the regulation for himself. Does the Minister deny that there is a regulation in existence prescribing a penalty for anybody connected with the Price Fixing Department who gives information to any outside person in regard to the work of his Department ? gives information to persons outside the Department he ought to be punished. ber refer to the regulation which requires a declaration of secrecy to be made by the officer, and psrovides that any officer price fixing offices, I shall state to the who directly or indirectly divulges any information that comes to his knowledge in consequence of his employment shall be punished ?

If there is nothing wrong, why should anybody keep the facts secret? I say deliberately that hundreds of prosecutions have been recommended, but never proceeded with.

Let us consider some of these subjects. The suppression of free speech on the public platform. There is no such thing as free speech in this country to-day. There is a limited number of things with which one may deal on the platform; to go beyond them is to get outside the area prescribed by the Government, and to get into a danger zone, because certain criticism of the Government is visited with pains and penalties under the War Precautions Act and Regulations. The coercion of the press and the pollution of the channels of public information. No newspaper in this country caii to-day print facts as they come to it, and as they affect the general community. There is a revision by officers of the Government, acting under the War Precautions Regulations, of what the public may know. They tamper with the public press. We have a tyrannous control over the printing press and the publication of pamphlets. also to the publication of hand-bills and of any other matter produced by a printing press. It has gone to this extent, that I myself have had an order submitted to me by the Chief Censor at Sydney in person, instructing me, in connection with a political campaign, that every circular multiplied on a roneo machine, everything typed or copied by any mechanical means whatsoever, to be sent to the branch secretaries and to the agents conducting the campaign throughout the length and breadth of the country, must be submitted to the censors before being despatched. I told this gentleman on the spot that I should not do what was required of me, and that he might take any action that he pleased. Could Mr J. H. Cattt. any one have imagined that the tyranny of the Government would have gone to the length of seeking, by using the War Precautions Regulations, to get inside inhas formation respecting the conduct of a political campaign by an opponent? Then we have the gagging of Parliament. The Government has taken to itself cussion of measures in Parliament.

During During the last two or three the last four years we have been governed by regulation. As the honourable member for Henty( Mr Boyd) has said, during the war period it was no doubt essential that something' in the nature of a War Precautions Act should be in operation to enable the Government of the day to cope with war emergencies, but I certainly think that those charged with the administration of the Act exceeded the intentions of those who voted for it . They availed themselves of it to frame regulations, which would not only assist us as a community in discharging our functions from a military point of view, but to enable the Government to interfere with the normal conditions of labour and industry. I decidedly object to the personnel of the Boards which are controlling industries in this country, and to the methods adopted by them.

If it should he the lot of memhers on this side to he in power at the end of two years, as I helieve we will, I shall have very much pleasure in supporting some of these regulations when they are put into the shape of Acts of Parliament. I remember hearing the late Lord Forrest saying that the War Precautions Act was brought into existence to deal with "" the other fellow,"" and that he was going to deal with that ""other fellow"" effectively while the Government had the power. I remarked at the time that this was a policy of spoils to the victors; and I can only now say that if we on this side get a chance of dealing with the ""other fellow,"" we will deal with him The just as effectively as we have been dealt with during the last three years. promise? appears very strange to me that, while the Government had all the power necessary to deal with any associations it pleased, tbey found it necessary to pass an Unlawful Associations Act. Evidently the Government recognised that the War Precautions Act would be absolutely invalid at the termination of the war, and, to make sure that the men whom they had imprisoned should be kept in prison, the special Act was passed. -It would be very easy for the Government to introduce a special Act, giving them the specific powers they wish to exercise after peace is declared; and that, I think, is the proper course to pursue. If there is not the necessary constitutional authority to enforce such an Act, lot them do as a previous Government didtake a referendum of the people. On that occasion there were a dozen questions submitted asking for extended powers in regard to industrial matters, monopolies, price fixing, and in other directions; and I should he quite prepared to take the platform in support of the Government if they put their proposals in a similar It is absolute despotism on the part of the Government to continue one moment longer than is necessary the War Precautions Eegulations; they have been most unfairly administered. All that is necessary is for the Executive of the Government-no t the Government-to get together and issue what regulations they choose, which must he accepted with all the penalties. This is not government hy the people, but government by ten or twelve members of the Executive; indeed, it is only necessary for three memhers of the Government to meet together and pass regulations, which are then binding on the whole Parliament and people.

The majority of the regulations should be burnt, so that there may be a little more freedom-in the community, and better relations between employer and employed. To-day the employer is using the Act and the regulations to camouflage his business. Whenever the employees go to him with a complaint, or endeavour to take him into Oourt for au infringement of an agreement or an award, he pulls out a few regulations, and tells them that if they decautions Act no longer exists, and it is sire any alteration they must go to the Government, who are running his business. If the employees go to the Government, they are referred to a Board, on which they find the business manager to whom they went in the first instance I desire to make a personal explanation. They are simply chased from pillar to post; and, in order that we may know exactly where we are, it is time the Act and regulations were "" scrapped."" So far as the shipping is concerned, there does not seem to he any definite control by either the Government or the Board. The unions that are working under the Board can get no redress from either the Board or the Government; and, personally, I should like to see the Board disbanded, and conditions put hack to normal.

I authorized the withdrawal of some prosecutions, and I did so for excellent reasons. When one is administering a Department, he must use his judgment in these matters. I can give an instance of the withdrawal of a prosecution. A regulation was gazetted for fixing the price of some kind of infant's food, the wholesale price being fixed at so much per dozen tins, this being the contents of the package usually delivered by wholesalers. In the course of his business, one wholesaler was called upon to deliver quite a numher of broken packages, and he adopted the usual trade practice of adding a small percentage per tin for the broken package. An officer in New South Wales strongly recommended a prosecution, and this had been taken in hand before I went to the Department; but when the facts came under my notice I took the view that the wholesaler had only followed the usual trade practice, and that the fault lay in the fact that our regulation did not prescribe that a broken packet should be charged for'at a slight increase per tin. The officer in New South Wales took the strongest objection to what I had done, hut, nevertheless, the prosecution was withdrawn, and I immediately gave instructions that the regulation should provide for an increased charge per tin for the broken package. -This question is by no means as simple as some honourable members seem to think it is. I have noticed that the speeches made on the Opposition side of the House have all turned upon some individual abuse in regard to one braneh of the -exercise of the powers given by the War Precautions' Act, and that' they have not dwelt in any way upon the broad principle which we are now called upon to decide. I am not opposed to the Bill, but I am opposed to the form in which it has been brought before the House. The honourable inember for West Sydney( Mr Wallace) expressed an opinion which I thoroughly endorse, that, instead of bringing before the House a Bill containing one broad principle of renewal for a number of months, the Government should have specified the particular directions in which they desired to have the powers given hy the War Precautions Act extended.. Looking at this question in a very broad way, we have to remember that u .we pride ourselves on being a self-governing community. We have our Parliament elected upon a franchise which, I suppose, is the most liberal in the world, and, however unequal we may be to the expectation of outsiders in looking at our proceedings, we have the satisfaction of knowing that every detail affecting the liberties of our people-is fully, clearly, and freely, even if quarrelsomely, discussed in this Chamber. As a self-governing community, we found ourselves plunged into a war which sometimes necessitated very prompt and very drastic action regarding public affairs, and the party in power at the time-it must not be forgotten that it was the Labour party-followe d the cue of the British Parliament, and introduced a War Precautions Bill. they did so. other question. I do not think that they could have avoided doing so. When the honourable member makes an observation, of that sort, I am disposed to think that he does not know much about the question. If Great Britain found that it was necessary to pass similar legislation, it was quite as necessary to introduce it here. I admit the necessity of the legislation.

We know very well that in different countries of the world where oligarchies govern they grow careless, and get to think that the extraordinary power which they are able to exercise is an inherent power, and that they cannot make mistakes. The same infirmity attaches to a Government, Cabinet, or Ministry which has an arbitrary power placed long in its hands. I am not going to say that this Government or the Government which introduced the measure has exercised this power in a way that has done any great harm, but it is a power which we as a Parliament do not wish to see continued longer than is absolutely necessary. There is no doubt, if we could take a broad survey of the activities of the Government during the war, we should recognise that the powers given to the .Government have helped very much in winning the war, and in making more effective our small contribution to the great struggle in Europe. The war is now practically over, and we find that these powers will naturally extend up to a point at which we consider iti is terminated. number of people saying, "" Until peace is proclaimed."" I do not anticipate that there will be any proclamation of peace between ourselves and our enemies. Our enemies are defeated, and there is no doubt a time will come when we shall lay down the conditions upon which we shall agree to terminate our invasion of their country. tice, according to the Hague Convention, is only a temporary cessation of war pending the securing of its purpose. Our purpose is to defeat our enemies completely. We do nothing now beyond suspending hostilities until we have actually entered the enemy country and demonstrated to its people, not only that we are going to hold ourselves as a company may regard a receiver, but also that we are an Army in possession until we get Mr Bruce Smith. willing to carry out the terms which we impose upon them as a condition of our final cessation of war with them. At all events, the time will come when it will be held by the Courts that the powers of the War Precautions Act have come to an end. The Government anticipate, and we all anticipate, that possibly before the House meets again after Christmas, we may find these powers have exhausted themselves, and the Government naturally come to us and say, "" These powers are so drastic, so far reaching, and so multifarious in their character and effect that we must ask you to give us authority to continue them for a certain time."" I agree with the Government up to that poiut, but I differ from them in regard to the form in which the Bill has been brought before the House. The onus is upon Ministers to select for the approval of the House those forms of the war precautions powers which they think it absolutely necessary to continue, so that honourable members may be consulted in regard to those particular activities.

If the honourable member for Cook would take up the line which I am suggesting, and which the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Wallace) took up, that we must perforce, as representatives of the people, consent to some extension of these powers, provided the Government show quite clearly that they are necessary, I would agree with him. me deal with these particular The Minister in the course of his speech said that the gentlemen who have charge of munitions have pointed out that there are certain commodities connected the activities under their charge which it is necessary to control, but I do not see any necessity at the present time for giving any further power to these gentlemen to control the particular ties which go to the making of munitions.

It It must be dealt is quite possible that those gentlemen may We cannot say, have represented to the Minister that it is very necessary to regulate some parheads, ticular commodities for that purpose, but the Minister will have, even under the That procedure which I suggest that the Government should follow, the opportunity of bringing these facts before the House and allowing members to decide with him or against him in regard to that particular activity.

[Quorum formed.] which are necessary for the proper conduct of affairs may require to be continued, and so far back as the 12th June of this year I warned the Government that when the war ceased these extraordinary powers would automatically disappear, and I urged upon the Minister in charge of the House at the time the necessity for the Government immediately taking some steps to obtain an extension of our constitutional powers, so that Parliament might operate in a legal way those activities which are at present unconstitutional. my suggestion, and now the Government are asking the House, not for power to deal with some specific subject, but for a blank cheque, and an authority which will enable three Ministers to exercise the functions which belong to Parliament it self. The request for such powers is outrageous,and Parliament ought to hesitate before granting them. Our system of government has been built up on the assumption that the peojple govern themselves by electing representatives to Parliament to decree the things that they desire. In no British country has any one man, or any two or three men, the right to shut the door of Parliament, and to do by regulation what Parliament itself would not do. Members on both sides should combine to restore responsible government to Australia. The danger that threatened no longer exists. This Parliament, elected by the people, should make the laws of the country; our laws should not be made by one or two Ministers. If the Government desires power to control the distribution of wool, or wheat, or metals, or anything else, let it bring down ' specific measures, and if its proposals can be justified, Parliament will grant the necessary powers. We should not, however, give to the Minister for Defence power to continue to do what he has been doing since the war began. Such powers should not be in the hands of any one individual. The Government should accept its responsibilities, and come to Parliament for the powers that it needs. Responsible government is menaced, and we should take care that the laws of the country are enacted by Parliament alone. But certain powers confess that I was in more doubt concerning the wisdom of the vote that I gave for the War Precautions A ct than I have been in concerning any other vote cast in this House. The bitterness that has been infused into the debate is to be regretted. It is due to the circumstances that brought about the disruption of the old Labour party shortly after the passing of the War Precautions Act . I clearly see the difficulties in which the Government is placed. The old props .by which business and commerce were supported have disappeared. They were anything but perfect, and often No notice was taken of were rotten and corrupt. They have been supplanted by a system of Government control. We cannot now throw aside our responsibilities in connection with this system without chaos supervening. The discussion has shown the division between the truly National Labour members and the Official Labourites, and between the National Labour members and the members of the old Liberal party with whom we are at present co-operating. Members opposite have had a great deal to say about the tyrannical application of the War Precautions Regulations. We are all largely in sympathy with what has been said on that head. We are also greatly in sympathy with the controlling of industry by the Government, and the co-operation of Commonwealth and State authorities to secure cheaper marketing. We are interested in maintaining and improving the soundness of the principles to which we have so long subscribed, just as we are anxious that human liberty should not be restricted. During the past four and a half years there have been many cases in which it has been unjustly restricted. I cannot' let the occasion pass without referring to the source of the whole trouble, and showing that if true principles had been subscribed to in the beginning the bitterness which has been displayed would not have been engendered, and the subject under discussion would have been approached in a fairer and more judicial spirit. The old Labour party, with a few exceptions, supported the War Precautions Act, which a Labour Government introduced. We did this either because we felt that the necessities of the war required the passing of",76,Mauric E Blackburn
413,Mr Lynch (Werriwa) [10.2],"Ithe Act , or because we thought that we would of the other fellow who would squirm. But when a lew irreconcilables outside Parliament, who for many years had been kept in subjection, collared the Labour machine, and gave orders to the representatives of the people, and declared that the Labour member was no longer responsible to his constituents, but was the servant of those controlling the Labour machine, had we stood together like men for the Labour platform and constitution, we would not have seen the confusion that has entered into politics in Australia, and we should not have heard the bitter recrimination in which the honourable member for Cook( Mr Catts) has indulged to-night, maintaining that the War Precautions Regulations have been used as a weapon against the members of the Official Labour party. I u defence of my leader, MrW . M . Hughes-and I speak as a man who had no sympathy with the principle of compulsory service for defence overseas, though in accord with compulsory service for defence within our own borders, because the men so subjected to military discipline would be able to control that discipline by their votes and the votes of their relativesI say that never was a man more reviled for asking a party to stand by the principles which it had always advocated. It was the saddest experience of my life to see men whom I respected, although willing to protest against the outrage which was being done to the Labour party's platform, acknowledge that they could not live in politics unless they submitted to the power that was dragging Labour principles into the dirt. I stand for the principles for which I have always stood. I believe that the Labour movement is a great humanitarian movement which cannot be stopped by a few extremists who t r y to take short cuts to liberty by trampling on every principle of individual freedom.

If we trample on the principles of freedom, for which the Labour movement stood in the past, punishment will follow. If we prove unworthy of our inheritance of political freedom, autocracy will be the result. . W h at was on trial at the time of the Labour split was the principle of representative Government. No body of men has the right to control the actions of the representatives of the people. knew well that a joint protest was being drawn up against the tyranny that threatened. Some of us subscribed to it , not only with our names, but also with our deeds, and by followiug our leader out of the party room, made clear our opposition to an attempt at coercion which was contrary to Labour principles, and without constitutional warrant. Because we are now in co-operation with those to whom for years we were opposed, we have not in the slightest degree sunk the principles in which we believe. We maintain that it is for the constituencies to deal with their representatives. The Labour split was the result of the most tyrannous action ever perpetrated in the political history of any country, and it has brought about great trouble. As for the War Precautions Regulations, we hold that every restriction on individual action and freedom sliould be swept away as soon as possible. But the bitterness engendered by the disruption of a great party was like that caused by the quarrelling of the members of a big family, and the drastic application of the War Precaution's Regulations prevented certain developments that would have brought disgrace upon Australia. If we, a selfis rough on governing Dominion, possessing the freest Constitution and the fullest franchise on earth, had resorted to revolutionary or reactionary methods, we should have f u r nished the strongest argument for Kaiserdom that the world has known.

417,Mr Lynch,"The honourable membersliould have proved the unwisdom of trusting the people, and should have subscribed to a principle to whicli so many nations have subscribed to their utter discomfiture, namely, that the vast majority of the people are so ignorant and incompetent that government must be left to the intelligent few. However harsh the regulations made under the War Precautions A ct may have been in their application, they did good service in certain cases, because it was known that there was a hand of steel behind them It was known that there would be no wincing on the part of the Government in giving effect to them. In this way Australia has been piloted safely through the most crucial period in her history. She has come through that period with credit. As an Australian who loves his country, I say that Australia has done her duty during this perilous period, despite the tendency on the part of a great many individuals to spend their force in fighting and rendgradually perfect a better system, and to ing each other in the unhappy circumstances to which I have already referred. I trust, however, that the Government will recognise that while their difficulties be made to realize this fact.. are great, all sections of the community are claiming with justice that many, of these restrictions upon individuals shall be swept away, while others are anxious for a measure of Governmeut control. Although some businesses have suffered by reason of governmental intervention, and can be carried on reasonably and honestly without this form of Government control, there are many business people who are anxious to get r i d of it altogether, so that the helpless in the community may be further exploited. I hope that the greatest care will be exercised by the Government, so that we shall not have the experience of other countries that are now in a state of chaos and disruption. Those who foolishly think that now that the War is over, every restriction may be removed, must be reminded that the world has been shaken to its very foundation. Wars equally as bitter, but not as bloody, as that through which we have just passed will be waged from one end of the world to the other with regard to the old systems under which produc, tion and distribution were carried on, and upon which the relations between nations and Empires were based. There will be a tremendous upheaval, and it will require all tlie sagacity and statesmanship that every party can bring to bear to preserve the process of evolution by which better and truer methods with regard to not only individuals but nations and empires may be gained. Even the very principle of empire building is now at stake. Those who would rush us into extreme systems of communal Socialism need to be reminded that the peace with which we hope shortly to be blessed will be the greatest triumph for national in dividualism that the world has ever known. It will be a recognition of the right of small nations to exist, and of the right of a free people to determine their own future, and to give effect to it , according to whatever standard of honesty, and intelligence they can evolve. It is upon such a principle that peace w ill be based. Our hope of a League of Nations is also founded upon it . Those who challenge the right of the Government to carry on in this way unti l the world's peace terms are proclaimed-tbos e who would rush us into wild extremes must We have great activities in f u l l operation at the present moment. We have, for instance, the Wheat Pool. And as a working farmer, I say that we have to thank the Federal and State Governments for their co-operative action in respect of the Wheat Pool, as the result of which the Australian farmers have been saved during the last four and a half years from almost complete extinction. It is true that ill-informed people are constantly trying to poison the minds of the farmers of the community by pointing to what they describe as the terrible consequences of Government interference. Buti t is as clear as daylight, that no market would have been available for our wheat-n o means of marketing or financing our wheat crops could have been evolved-if the credit of the country had not been pledged as it was by the Federal and State Governments. Although as a farmer I am well aware that grave mistakes have ""been made in connection with the administration of this scheme-al though I know that wasteful systems have been developedI recognise the absolute soundness of the basic principle of this system of control which has spelt such success for the fanner. However distasteful it may he to many honourable members, I hope that when we get rid of party differences we shall be ahle to evolve great co-operative systems as between the Commonwealth and State Governments by means of which our produce will he carried by Government-owned fleets of vessels to the various markets at the very lowest rate, and that every farmer, whether rich or poor, will secure exactly the same advance in respect of his produce until it has been finally sold. In that way the salvation of our farmers will be secured. It is absolutely impos-' sible for farmers' associations hy cooperation or any other method to finance the needy farmers in their tens of thousands throughout Australia, and to remove them from that unfortunate position which made them the prey of the speculator in previous years. It is only by the strength and power of the Commonwealth and State Governments that that can be done. In conclusion, I urge the Government for the Navy( Sir Joseph Cook). The to at least give us what the people outActing Prime Minister has said that I side are anxiously waiting for, and that desire to "" sow dissension "" between himis immediate relief from many of bhe self and the Prime Minister; but I assure regulations framed under the ""War Prethe House that I am acting in the incautions Act.

When^ these Bills are prepared, let them be laid before meetings of the party in caucus; so that their supporters may know what legislation is to be brought forward. The delays caused by the lack of knowledge of honourable members supporting the Government regarding the contents of ""Bills are of serious importance to the people. There are honorahle members on this side who are ready to assist in carrying on the business of the House; hut when we see such an exhibition of incompetency on the part of Ministers, and such a disregard for the wishes of the country) we are justified in drawing attention to the wholesale delays which take place in the conduct of business. Honourable memhers opposite were sent here to bring forward certain measures, yet they do not agree among themselves when the Bills are brought down to the House. They are worse than a lot of school children. It is absolutely annoying to honourable members on this side to have to sit here and see this disagreement and misunderstanding among honourable members opposite. It would not matter much if the disagreement merely affected individuals. The trouble is that it affects the interests of the country. Honorahle memhers do not seem to understand that the work of preparing for peace is just as great a responsibility as -is the task of preparing for war. Mr ""WATT A new discovery! it. If the Acting Prime Minister would only accept my advice and hand over his Treasurership to some other member of the Ministry who may be capable of filling the office, he could devote the whole of his time to the duties of Acting Prime Minister. There are many people who cannot obtain interviews with him, because it is impossible for him to spare the time to see them. I make no apology for delaying honourable members now. I hope that my few remarks will Tesult in the Government bringing forward measures for which we are thirsting. We are anxious on this side that the business of the country should be proceeded with. If Ministers cannot carry on, let them say so, and we on this side will show them how to do it. In future I hope that Bills will be brought forward after the party has given consideration to them, so that we shall not have a renewal of the spectacle we have witnessed during the last couple of days.

I would like to ask him how many prosecutions have been recommended from the State of Mew South Wales since his occupancy of the office, and how many have been instituted, and in how many cases the advice of his responsible officers has been turned down ?

Minister and Treasurer) [11.2] -In reference to the remarks made hy the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr these important questions. Higgs), I do not desire to bandy words with the honourable member, who is an experienced parliamentarian, or to endeavour to engender bad feeling between the Ministerial party and the Opposition, but I say again that I doubt his bona fides with respect to the alleged quarrel between the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy. I am in possession of enough information to say that the bulk, if not all, of the statements in the press are untrue, and I hope to be able to-morrow by means of a joint cablegram from those two gentlemen, which I shall read to the Housei f it arrives in time, to thoroughly confirm my statement. I say further that I am without doubt that the Prime Minister has with respect to wheat, wool, copper, and the other things, thirty or forty in numher, which the Government have asked him to attend to in addition to his manifold other public duties, in the most assiduous way done all that mortal man could do under the extremely difficult conditions that obtain with all the watertight departments of the British Government to be visited, to uphold the interests of Australia. As to the Prime Minister's ability, I think it is so much nonsense to say to this House that he is unable to deal with a matter like the wheat sale. All the transactions that have taken place, with the exception of the last wool sale, were engineered and guided by him. They involved most important and tangled questions of finance and negotiation, and I join with the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lynch) in saying that, whatever people may think in regard to the honourable gentleman's politics or the cleavage that occurred in the Labour party during the war, this country must, when the record of Australia is read, give the greatest possible credit to Mr Hughes, not alone for his efforts, but -CATTS -There is a disalso for his magnificent results which have largely contributed to stabilize this coun try during the period of greatest crisis and tremor. It is of no use talking at this late hour for political purposes of either neglect or ineptitude, because I am sure that the right honourable gentleman has contributed all that is in him to settle £3,000,000 wheat deal the speculators would give very little for the wheat. lished largely through the instrumentality of the right honourable gentleman, and but for them wheat would have been at a serious discount, compared with pre-war prices, instead of being elevated to a parity with all the wheats of the world. As to his selling wheat and wool cheaper than they should have been sold, ask the men who produce those commodities. speech the other day on the wheat question was the most damning indictment of the Prime Minister that has been uttered. is worth that statement, made more in sorrow than in anger, if one can trust the countenance of the honourable member. If , as the honourable gentleman seems to imagine, the Prime Minister had nothing to do but to sell the wheat, if there were only one man in London to whom he could take it , and if the cables were free of congestion, one could expect to receive an answer within forty-eight hours. But that is not the position. Various authorities have to deal with this question. There is the financial authority on the one hand, the shipping authority on the other hand, and the purchasing authority for the third part. This question is mixed up with all the other matters with which the right"" honourable gentleman has been dealing. The gaps in the cables do not represent either neglect or forgetfulness; they represent the difficulties in the situation.
