In the Since this House rose a week ago, we have had a last two days we have learned about the capital further decline in the dollar, the announcement of gains tax. During the election campaign I went the capital gains taxing, the fiddles with the assets around the country saying, 'As certain as night test and numerous other elements that deserve to follows day you will get a capital gains tax' and be discussed. the people of Australia are getting it. They now know that, as certain as an express train coming at On only two previous occasions in .the nation's them, the Government will dump a capital gains history has the Parliament been recalled for a sittax on them. Why will the Government not disting such as this on a day other than that specified cuss it with utoday? Why will it not give us time in the special adjournment motion.

That is the present proposal. The Governconsider Australia's national security; and the secment knows that the demands for a capital gains ond was in 1975 when the financial scandals surtax are by the Australian Council of Trade rounding the Whitlam Government forced it to Unions, by the Left, and by the Centre Left; they try to account to the nation.

It is to be Financial Review a very dramatic illustration of found on the front page of the Australian this Prime Minister's craven populism, his frantic Financial Review. The Prime Minister( Mr inability to accept a reduction in his personal Hawke) has been busy leaking against his popularity. It is an illustration that he is lurching Treasurer ( Mr Keating). That is what has been from one poll which reduces his popularity and happening. He does not like the fact that over the his esteem to another. He cannot stand the credit last few weeks the Treasurer has been getting and the publicity that his Treasurer gets for the some good headlines. I know what goes on in that courage that he is displaying in pushing ahead on corner office when Treasurers start getting good matters related to good taxation reform. What headlines. I can tell honourable members that. I does the Prime Minister do? He resorts to the have not the slightest doubt that those minder cheap device of going to the front page of the Ausmates of the Prime Minister have come in and tralian Financial Review, beating his chest and said: 'Hey, Bob, this is getting a bit out of hand'. saying: 'Wasn't I tough, wasn't I clever?
