225,The Speaker,"The answer to the hontee has duly reported to Parliament: DevelopmentWednesday, 1 June 2005 ----Principal for a Day for a Day-a program run in New South Wales, and perhaps in other states, whereby community, business and opinion leaders, and politicians are invited to spend a day, or a portion thereof, with the principal of a public school in order to gain first-hand insight into the current state of public education-its challenges and its achievements. Last year I visited the Matraville Soldiers Settlement School, a primary school in the electorate of Kingsford Smith with a school population drawn from many cultural backgrounds, many of the parents having recently arrived in Australia, including a number of Aboriginal children too. I was taken by the high level of care shown by staff, particularly to kids with physical or mental challenges. In past times, these kids would have been isolated in institutions. Nowadays they are embraced as full members of the school community. The school supported these kids, as well as other kids in the school, and worked closely with families to get the best out of the kids at this important stage of their education. I commend the principal and the staff for their untiring efforts at Matraville. This year, I had the opportunity to visit Randwick Boys High and again was struck by the generous spirit and obvious dedication shown to students by teaching staff and by the very real achievements of the student body. Numbered amongst them were outstanding athletes, kids with fine academic records and those making real contributions in art, music, science and, more generally, to the life of the school community. Given the recent patterns of curriculum choices we have seen in Australia, where there has not been a great emphasis on learning in science and technology, I was particularly pleased to see the science labs full and humming with senior students. Naturally, I enjoyed the performance of the composite orchestra, made up of a string section, the local band and students from the collegiate school next door, Randwick Girls High. Playing together, they made absolutely wonderful sounds. The measurable benefits of learning a musical instrument, the foundational role music plays in our culture and, of course, the way playing music with other people brings the school community together, cannot be underestimated. Principals have a range of complex responsibilities as they lead and inspire their schools. At Randwick Boys High and Matraville Soldiers Settlement, I saw their good efforts first hand and I commend them to the House.

228,Mrs May (Mcpherson) (9.32 Am),"With just two words last Friday-‘You’re in’-thedisappointment last year and the commitment of a small band of dedicated individuals had delivered a rugby league team back to the Gold Coast. The excitement was infectious. The news spread very quickly throughout the city and the celebration was on. I am told that Michael Searle and his mentor, Paul Broughton, shook hands and then hugged each other. There were no words. These two special men had ridden an emotional rollercoaster for nearly six years. They both had a dream to deliver a National Rugby League team back to the Gold Coast. They dared to dream and the dream had become a reality. The hard work is not over. We have less than two years to put together a team that we can all be proud of. This will be a team that our entire Gold Coast community can get behind. It will be a competitive team. It will be driven by our local community, by the young players in the junior ranks who will now have a pathway to strive for-a pathway that will lead them into the national competition and even to aspire to representing their state or their country at international level. I have had the opportunity of working with the Gold Coast bid team for nearly two years. Today, I want to pay tribute to the professionalism, commitment and credibility of two men who drove this bid and the dream: first, to the managing director, Michael Searle, an exceptional young man who has driven this bid with tenacity and belief and, second, to Paul Broughton, a man who is passionate about the game of rugby league-one of life’s gentlemen who never gave up the dream. At 74, Paul was the inspiration to us all to keep going until the dream was realised. These two men were supported by Ian Buchanan, who drove the media, worked tirelessly to ensure the message to the fans was the right message and put the positive spin on every step through the journey; by Geoff Smith, the legal brains, the man who ensured the legal paperwork was done, whose excitement last Friday was unbelievable; and by Rob Molhoek, now a Gold Coast City councillor, a man who is committed to the youth of Gold Coast City and believes the youth will benefit enormously with a career pathway in rugby league. These five men were the driving force behind the consortium. Jim Raptis, Steve Burns and I came on board around two years ago and lent our different areas of expertise to the bid team. We have all enjoyed our roles and feel very proud to be part of this winning combination of people. Let the planning begin for 2007. Central Queensland Air Services Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (9.35 am)-I regret that I am here once again to raise the matter of a further reduction in the services offered to Central Queenslanders by Qantas. As from today, 1 June, Qantas has cut its Jetstar services to and from Rockhampton by 50 per cent. It is now not possible to fly with Jetstar and spend the day in Rockhampton or, going the other way, a day in Brisbane. Jetstar customers from Central Queensland are forced to stay overnight in Brisbane, which of course negates the advantage of a cheap airfare. This 50 per cent reduction in Jetstar services will also have a very serious impact on the Central Queensland tourism industry. Qantas made much of the introduction of its low-priced Jetstar service to Rockhampton. The House may recall that I said previously that it appeared to me that Qantas was forcing the people of Central Queensland to use Jetstar to give the new airline a revenue base while it MAIN COMMITTEE established itself on the main trunk routes. Now, as Jetstar is established between the capital cities, we see Qantas withdrawing those Jetstar services from Central Queensland. I see that as proof positive of the Qantas policy of abandoning regional Australia. It is true that Qantas is making much of its intention to replace the Jetstar service with the propeller-driven Dash8 aircraft. But let me give you an example of what this really means to the people of Central Queensland. One of my constituents was booked to fly from Rockhampton to Cairns on this small Qantas aircraft, which goes via Mackay and Townsville on its way to Cairns. When this constituent learned that in fact he would be in Mackay on the day of his departure, he rang Qantas and said that he would now like to board in Mackay. Of course this would give Qantas the opportunity to sell that seat to Mackay to someone else. However, my constituent was advised by Qantas that he could not do that unless he paid a $33 re-routing fee and purchased a new full fare ticket to Cairns at a cost of $457. Another constituent, who was trying to attend the same conference in Cairns, simply gave up trying to go because of the difficulties in trying to find a flight that would get him there in a reasonable time. Yet another constituent of mine, who travels regularly for business to and from Rockhampton, has told me that he purchased a frequent flyer cabin bag to ensure that he did not have a problem walking onto planes with carry-on luggage. He was boarding a Dash8 in Brisbane last Thursday when he was advised by Qantas that the Qantas cabin bag was in fact too big and he had to check it in-a great inconvenience. He was advised that the bag was okay on a jet but not on the smaller Qantas planes that service Rockhampton. Mr Deputy Speaker, you really have to wonder whether Rockhampton was better serviced in the 1960s by TAA and the good old Fokker Friendships than it is today by Qantas. It would seem that the best friend that Virgin Blue Airlines has is Qantas management, with these kinds of decisions that really penalise regional Australia. Water Re-use Heritage) (9.38 am)-I want to talk about water reuse on the Mornington Peninsula, in the Westernport area and in Australia more generally. Firstly, I would like to welcome yesterday’s decision by the Victorian government to finally complete and launch the water retreatment program for Cranbourne and associated areas, which is known as the Eastern Irrigation Scheme. This scheme will deliver approximately five billion litres of water to golf courses, market gardens and parks and gardens in the eastern area of Melbourne. In my electorate of Flinders, farmers in Cranbourne South, Five Ways, Devon Meadows and Clyde will have access to high-grade treated water and they can use that to save costs, provide volume and take pressure off the environment. All of those things together make this a tremendously important project-overdue but important. Secondly, this proposal, the Eastern Irrigation Scheme, deals with about three per cent of the waste water discharged from the Gunnamatta outfall, which is about three per cent of 150 billion litres a year. So effectively it prevents any further increases. It does not really deal with the underlying question. To solve that, we have to aim for much higher than the states’ proposal of 20 per cent reuse. There is no question, as we look all around Australia today, that we have to work towards a total reuse policy for water. It is reasonable, it is achievable and it is the way of the future. At Gunnamatta the problem continues. Over 150 gigalitres, or 150 billion litres, of waste water every year are being discharged right on the shoreline. It is unacMAIN COMMITTEE",164,Statements By Members
229,Mr Hunt (Flinders,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment andceptable, it is environmentally damaging, it is a health risk and it is a total waste of a valuable resource. I recommit myself to working towards a zero outfall for Gunnamatta. I am delighted to say that I have been working with the Prime Minister’s office, with the Deputy Prime Minister and others on precisely that objective, and I believe that there may be something from the Commonwealth in the near future. Thirdly, at the national level, we have to work towards 100 per cent water recycling nationwide. The position in Sydney of two billion litres of waste water at the raw sewage level and almost 400 billion litres of waste water at the primary level being discharged into the sea is an utter disgrace. Across Australia we need a national ocean outfall strategy which will achieve the ending of ocean outfalls by 2025 and the full recycling of water. I am delighted that yesterday was a beginning. (Time expired) University Funding Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (9.41 am)-Today is the National Tertiary Education Union’s national day of action protesting the assault on university funding and the impact of that on staff since the Howard government decided to rip out $5 billion worth of funding. The latest insult to our tertiary sector is the threat to withhold a further $838 million if staff are not moved onto individual contracts. I am very fortunate to count staff at the University of Newcastle amongst my dearest friends and amongst those whom I admire most for their contribution to our society. This week staff at Newcastle university have seen what a proposed job loss of 439 full-time equivalent jobs will look like. In this very difficult phase, I register my strong support for them and regret that they are suffering quite markedly. I have faith that their professionalism will cushion students, but there is a real risk of a crisis in confidence. I again call on the government to assist the Hunter region to absorb this economic and human loss. It is estimated that the economic cost to our region will be greater than $100 million per year. A recent study showed that our university contributes nearly $650 million a year in gross output plus $215 million in salaries. So it will be felt very strongly by our region with the flow-on effect of another 150 jobs lost. The government shows very little sympathy, but certainly our region deserves and should demand some assistance. Our labour market is a lot thinner than those of cities like Sydney. That was recently quantified by Professor O’Neill, who said that our labour market vulnerability is such that, for the lower Hunter to have the same job-to-population ratio as Sydney, it would have to create 73,000 additional jobs immediately. We always feel economic shifts much more strongly. In 2005 in the Hunter, the average total income per annum per wage and salary earner is only approximately $43,000-not exactly prosperous or rolling in cash. I understand that the university would like to manage this change very quickly. I am sympathetic to its desire to get back in the black; I understand that. But the costs of getting this wrong are huge-huge for the region and huge for the people involved in the industry. At our university we do not just turn out units of production; we actually solve some of the problems of the world, some of the problems of Australian society. At the moment, groundbreaking research is being done in obesity, prostate cancer, premature births, family relationships, the rural GP shortages, nanotechnology, engineering, the Jameson Cell-some landmark research values benefiting all. It is disgraceful that our region is left to handle this crisis by itself. It is disgraceful that universities are compromised by every decision this government has made. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE South West Indoor Aquatic Centre Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (9.44 am)-Australia has had an outstanding record in international swimming, going right back to the days of Freddie Lane winning a gold medal at the Paris Olympics in 1900, and from ‘Boy’ Charlton, Dawn Fraser and Murray Rose right through to our current champions: that great crop of women sprinters from Brisbane; Ian Thorpe; and Grant Hackett. But I rise on an issue of local importance to my electorate-that is, the state of South Australia has no FINA-standard pool. South Australia is not able to host any national swimming championships. We are not able to host a world masters championships. We have not had a FINA pool for some time. Even a state like Tasmania has three to four FINA-standard pools. The South West Indoor Aquatic Centre is a project that has been around for some time. It has been proposed by state governments of both political stripes-the Olsen government and the Rann government-to be built at the Domain in Marion, in my electorate. In February 2004, it was proposed that this be done through a public-private partnership. The Minister for Recreation, Sport and Racing, Michael Wright, announced this in a media release. Late in 2004, approaches were made to me by the Marion council to see if there was any possibility of federal assistance. I made the point to them that swimming pools are not normally an area of federal responsibility but that I would see what I could do. I helped the Marion council to make a submission as part of the 2005 budget. We got a tremendous hearing from the Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator Rod Kemp, and the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Nick Minchin. Although there was no federal funding, I will be continuing to push for this project. Having said that, I am disappointed that the state government is using this as an opportunity to further delay a project which has already been delayed for three or four years. There has been a sign at the site of this proposed pool since October 2001. It is now being said that what was always planned as a state-local government project will only go ahead contingent on federal funding. I will be doing what I can, but I feel akin to someone who has gone in to help a drowning person, only to be pulled in as well. (Time expired) Bittersweet Freedom: Memories of Liberation 1944-45 Peter Cosgrove opened a very interesting exhibition, at which I was present, called Bittersweet Freedom: Memories of Liberation 1944-45, at the Jewish Holocaust Museum and Research Centre in Elsternwick in Victoria, in my electorate. I congratulated Major General Cosgrove on the fact that, in concluding his very important leadership of the Australian Defence Force, he had taken time to come down and open the exhibition. The exhibition is open to the public, and I would urge members of the public to go and see it. The exhibition is produced by the museum’s curator, Jayne Josem. It basically consists of video interviews with people who were liberated by the American, British or Soviet forces. It also includes major works by Australian war artists of the time who were serving with the British forces and who, witnessing some of the camps that were liberated, felt that simple photographic evidence of what they were seeing was not necessarily an accurate way of portraying things. They felt it necessary to give vent to their art. One of the artists felt that no-one MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Statements By Members
230,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (9.47 Am),"On the weekend before last, Major Generalwould believe what he was drawing and therefore took it upon himself to do a photographic copy of every painting that he had prepared for that exhibition. I said to the large crowd at the exhibition opening that I congratulated Major General Cosgrove on being there representing the sort of tolerance and decency of the Australian armed forces that is typical of Australia. I congratulated him on providing for the people in the audience-many of whom have made successful lives in Australia during the 60 years since the end of the Second World War-a continuum from Sir John Monash right through to himself. The exhibition by the Jewish Holocaust Museum and Research Centre is to be commended. It underlines again the tragedy and the importance of the great victory of the Second World War. Veterans Grants service, sacrifice and suffering of our veterans, what they lived through and what some of them are still living through to defend our way of life. It is important that we pay due respect to their service, but in practical ways, so I was very pleased to announce a series of funding packages for veterans groups in the Hinkler electorate. In recent weeks, I announced a $3,480 Saluting Their Service grant to the Elliott Heads and District Ratepayers and Residents Association to help them enhance the Submarine Lookout Memorial. From a small headland and timber tower at Elliott Heads, civilian coast watchers looked out for Japanese submarines in World War II, a very practical way of assisting the war effort. I have just had the pleasure of telling the Gayndah RSL sub-branch that they will be receiving a $17,348 veteran and community grant to install air conditioning in the RSL hall and help set up a drop-in centre for local veterans. This is a new and very important focus for Central Burnett veterans. The Bundaberg sub-branch of the Vietnam Veterans Association, of which I am patron, also received two veteran and community grants totalling $7,406 to fund outings and buy a photocopier so that they can produce their own newsletter. The Bundaberg and District Korean War Veterans group received a $2,500 grant to fund bus trips to reduce social isolation for veterans and their spouses. All these projects are worthy of government support. I am fortunate that as the federal member I get to attend a wide range of commemorative functions from the Rats of Tobruk day to East Bundaberg state school’s marvellous pre ANZAC Day commemoration in their school grounds. I always make a point of attending as many ANZAC Day services as possible. This year I managed to make it to Bundaberg’s dawn service, the Rosedale dawn service, the Boyne Island-Tannum Sands RSL’s morning service, the Gladstone citizens’ ceremony, and the Burnett Heads ceremony in the afternoon. My wife, Margaret, also lent strong support by representing me at services that I could not attend. She attended the Bargara dawn service this year and the Bundaberg citizens’ service. By funding memorials and commemorative events and community based activities for veterans, we are honouring the actions of those who served our country. Although our gestures can never fully compensate veterans for their experiences, it is important that we do what we can and show that we care.

It has been providing this service for the last 11 years. Yet at this point, in the first week of June, DEWR has once again failed to assure its funding for the next financial year, which is 3½ weeks away. The centre is once again in crisis, as it is at this time every year, due to the lack of advice on its funding position for the following year. Is it going to be receiving any funding? If so, how much? When will it be told? Should its staff look for other jobs? Should it plan to shut its doors, give notice on leases and plan the garage sale? Will its clients be left in an increasingly unfriendly work environment without its support? If the government finally does decide to fund the centre and finally tells it, will the government be even vaguely aware that a small group of people at this time of year every year risk their own financial security by hanging on and keeping the centre open without any idea of its future? Even more importantly, given that the government is ripping away well-known and tested support structures for the most disadvantaged workers, the majority of which are women, will the government assist workers to deal with this changing environment by increasing the funding to the centre to a respectable level? Is the government even vaguely aware of, let alone concerned about, the position that our valuable community based infrastructure is placed in at this time every year when funding decisions are made this late? Is this lateness of decision a case of incompetence, a display of power and arrogance or just a general lack of care about an extremely important community organisation? Does the government even know if it will be giving any funding post-June, let alone the level of funding? The centre has endured real reductions in funding levels over the last 11 years. Given that women are the most disadvantaged in the workplace, receiving lower salaries and being far more likely to be working in casual and unskilled positions, the advocacy role of the centre is essential and growing. Yet, while the demand for the service is growing, financial support is not. The initial allocation that established the centre in the 1993-94 budget was $297,062. It has dropped in real terms by 37 per cent, to around $240,000. Yet, since 2000 alone, the centre has received a 70 per cent increase in clients and expects that trend to continue with the new industrial relations reforms. Despite staff reductions in 1999, the service to clients is quite extraordinary. The centre operates a telephone advisory service that opens three days a week. Staffing is at a 3.1 full-time equivalents but with over 20 voluntary staff. (Time expired) Sea King Helicopter Accident which claimed the lives of nine of our serving personnel, there was a tremendous outpouring of grief, none more so than in our local community of the Shoalhaven in my electorate of Gilmore. In one fell swoop, this tragedy took away four of our extended family. Four members of the crew were from No. 817 Squadron, whose home station is HMAS Albatross at Nowra Hill. It is difficult to describe the emotion that was being freely expressed at the time, as each and every one of us approached the news with different feelings. I can say that I have not seen such a reaction from a community in all my days. The four were Lieutenant Matthew Goodall, Lieutenant Paul Kimlin, Lieutenant Jonathan King and Leading Seaman Scott Bennet-all fine upstanding young Australians taken at the prime of their lives in their service to humanity. Of the four, Leading Seaman Bennet had a young family-a wife and two children-whose family home was in Tomerong, near the shores of Jervis Bay. It was the 31st MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Statements By Members
232,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (9.56 Am),"After the 2 April helicopter crash on the island of Niasyear of his life. I attended his funeral, which was held at HMAS Albatross. The funeral was attended by several hundred people, many of whom did not know him, but such was the sense of family felt by the community that they grieved equally. It was a very moving occasion, and its impact will be felt for quite some time. Shortly after we received the news that four of our own had gone down, we made available condolence books so that local residents could express their feelings. A similar book was made available at the chambers of the Shoalhaven City Council and at the Navy base, and the book will be given to the Navy at HMAS Albatross. Reading the entries is a bittersweet experience-on one hand deep sadness, yet at the same time extreme pride that we shared a moment together. They are brief statements, awkwardly written in some cases, but genuine in their sympathy and gratitude. They are also a symbol of the bond that has been formed between residents and those in the garrison of HMAS Albatross who have been with us for over 60 years. Every day, in some little way, we have become accustomed to seeing these Defence personnel around us, whether it be in their uniforms as they go about their daily business or as we hear the drone of the Sea Kings and other aircraft flying in and out of the air base. They are quietly in our everyday lives. I am glad we have the Navy with us: no better tenant can you find. But the four from No. 817 Squadron who perished are not the first peacetime casualties for Nowra and, sadly, probably will not be the last. Next to the general cemetery at Nowra is a neat and well-kept cemetery. It is the naval cemetery and has interred there a number of other naval personnel who died in the service of their country. It is a special place, with each tombstone having its own story to tell. In preparing for war, our servicemen and servicewomen undertake demanding tasks, sometimes with great personal risk and most times unseen. We should not need a tragedy like this to remind us of their contribution. We should be forever appreciative of their service and give them every support we can, and looking after the family of Leading Seaman Bennet in Gilmore is one such way. Bankstown Airport tence. It will govern the activity at Bankstown Airport for the next 20 years. The people of Bankstown who worked with me to achieve the key objective-that is, to stop 737 jets from being able to use Bankstown Airport-have won an enormous victory. But there is still more work to do. A noise management plan needs to be put into place. The fundamental problem in regard to noise management is that more freight aircraft will be operating out of Bankstown Airport-and there will probably be more at night. The extension of the runway by 200 metres means that planes can be more fully laden and will be flying lower and closer to people in Condell Park and associated suburbs. Logically, that means that the noise impact will therefore be greater. I call upon the management of Bankstown Airport Ltd to ensure that there is proper and full community consultation in regard to this and that the lives of people are not destroyed by inappropriate noise from Bankstown Airport. agreed to on 30 May 2005, the time for members’ statements has concluded.

Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (10.01 am)-I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak in the debate on the 2005 budget. This is the Treasurer’s 10th budget. It is the eighth budget this government has delivered which has been in surplus. A most important part of this budget is the $21 billion in tax cuts which represents, for the second time, a very significant extension of the threshold for the top marginal rate and for the second highest marginal rate. When we introduced the new tax system in 1998 we were able to ensure that everyone on incomes below $50,000 was on a marginal rate of 30c in the dollar. At that time, 80 per cent of taxpayers were on incomes below $50,000. But we were never able to implement the tax cuts we had promised because the Senate would not allow us to do so. Last year we were able to take advantage of the Leader of the Opposition at the time, Mark Latham, who had previously made a number of comments about the fact that the top marginal rate was cutting in at an income which was too low, and we were able to increase the threshMAIN COMMITTEE old for the top marginal rate to $80,000. The budget measures will now increase the threshold for the top marginal rate to $125,000. When you find that the steelworkers in Port Kembla are paying 48½c tax in every extra dollar they earn in overtime, you realise that our top marginal rates are cutting in at incomes which are far too low. One million Australians are living and working overseas. Many of these people will be looking at where the top marginal rate cuts in and this will be an encouragement for many of our best and brightest to return to Australia to work under a tax regime which is not so punitive. The welfare to work changes are another very important part of this budget. Our unemployment rate of 5.1 per cent is the lowest it has been since November 1976. As Australia’s population ages over the next 20 or 30 years, we are not going to see the growth in the work force that we have traditionally seen. It is going to be more and more important to make sure, not only for our overall economy but also for individuals, that those who can find a pathway into work are able to do so, because it leads to a much more rewarding life. The budget also contains a number of initiatives related to boosting skills. Because the economy has now been expanding for 13 years and because unemployment is now so low we are seeing a number of skills shortages emerging in the Australian economy. Because of the 13 years of economic growth we are also seeing shortages in unskilled labour. I am very pleased that we are increasing the skilled migration program by 20,000 places. This means that if you have skills which are recognised by Australia you can migrate to Australia from anywhere in the world. The budget forecasts a growth over the next year of three per cent. This also reflects the fact that our export prices are at a record high. Australia now has the best terms of trade since 1974, particularly for iron ore and coal, and this has been very significant for what our exports are earning. As I said, unemployment, at 5.1 per cent, is the lowest since November 1976. It can go lower, but it will only go lower with changes to workplace relations and a more flexible labour market. The government is also looking at ways that it can increase the participation of people in their late 40s and 50s and encourage them back into the workplace. Government debt has decreased from $96 billion 10 years ago, almost 19 per cent of GDP, to just $6 billion in this budget. There are very few countries that have wiped out their government debt. A couple of years ago we had a debate about whether we should maintain the debt market for Commonwealth government securities. A decision was made that it would be maintained. We will now be putting future surpluses away into our future fund, which means that the superannuation liabilities which have previously been unfunded will be covered. There is a cash surplus in this budget of $8.9 billion, roughly one per cent of GDP. Compare this with the OECD average of budget deficits of three per cent of GDP. Australia’s position by contrast is much, much stronger. There has been comment on yesterday’s news about the current account deficit and Australia’s foreign debt. There are a couple of points that need to be made on this. First of all, Australia has a floating exchange rate. If people believe that our current account deficit or our level of foreign debt is unsustainable, it will be reflected in the exchange rate. The exchange rate currently is very strong on the trade-weighted index and also against the United States dollar at about US76c. The other point to make is that, because we have had government budget surpluses over the last eight years, the current account deficit largely reflects private savings and investment deMAIN COMMITTEE cisions. As the OECD Economic Survey of Australia-2004, released in February 2005, states, because we have few distortions in the economy: ... private sector savings and investment decisions are likely to be efficient, with capital flows reflecting informed decisions about relative investment opportunities. Moody’s has rated us ‘Aaa’ and Standard and Poor’s has given us an AAA rating. The banking system is in good shape and the financial position of firms and individuals is in good shape. The government’s share of net external debt is very low. Government debt, as I said previously, is very low-it is less than one per cent of GDP at $6 billion. It is just extraordinary and one of the lowest in the OECD. I again quote from this year’s OECD economic survey: This places Australia in a comparatively better position than most other countries to respond to future economic shocks. To preserve this favourable position, the authorities should continue to ensure that the government does not add to aggregate external financing requirements. Put simply, we should not be running up budget deficits; we should be, as we have been, running up budget surpluses. The key theme of the 2004 federal election was, ‘Who do you trust to run Australia’s $800 billion economy?’ The mood of the Australian people at the moment is that they got that decision right. One of the things I find in the community is that people actually reflect on what might have been had Mark Latham become Prime Minister. After a few chuckles and so on people do reflect that it was a very close call but that they got the decision right. Our message was that it does take a lot of discipline and experience to run the Australian economy. We saw that the Labor Party’s approach would be to give into narrow sectional interests ahead of jobs and the economy. Nowhere was that better demonstrated than in Tasmania, where you had the extraordinary scene of members of the Labor Party National Executive, CFMEU members, urging their members to vote for the Liberal Party. That was a snapshot which encapsulated the overall theme of the election-that is, every day you considering on an intervention. Will the member for Boothby accept the question? ecutive who advocated a vote for the coalition as against supporting timber workers in Tasmania? In your remarks you claimed that a member of the ALP National Executive said that timber workers should vote for the coalition. I would like you to name that person. bourne Ports will resume his seat. Executive shared the stage with the Prime Minister. I took that as implicit. I do not think he was not advocating a vote for Mark Latham. Certainly the timber workers were very happy to see the Prime Minister. I think if you look at the result in Braddon and in Bass you can see that that was strongly reflected. It does take a lot of discipline and experience to run our economy. Every day there are decisions to be made. Let us look at the key challenges we face. First of all, there is the ageing of our economy. Since 1978, we have had a fertility rate below replacement level. At the moment it is about 1.75 or thereabouts. We expect over the next 40 years that the proportion of people over 65 MAIN COMMITTEE",171,Statements By Members

239,Dr Southcott,"PerhapsI should clarify this. A member of the Labor Party Nationalwill double. This has important implications in terms of increases in what we will be paying in health costs for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and so on. Having said that, I believe Australia is in very good shape to meet this challenge because of our strong retirement income system with a means-tested pension and compulsory superannuation. What this means is that our estimates are that we should only be paying about an extra two per cent of GDP over the next 40 years for the age pension. Compare this to some other countries like Canada, for example, where it is expected that they will be spending about six per cent of GDP on the age pension. The OECD average is about three per cent extra of GDP. I believe that we are well placed to meet the challenges and opportunities. But in only 15 years time, in the decade beginning the 2020s, we expect to see growth in the work force slow. Where we would normally expect 180,000 new workers to enter the work force every year, because that has been the pattern, in the whole decade of the 2020s the work force will grow by only 120,000, and by the time we get to the decade of the 2040s our work force growth will be only 0.1 per cent. So we will not see the increases in the work force that we have always had. But in countries with much lower fertility rates and where ageing is more advanced, such as in southern Europe, Spain, Italy, Greece, Japan, South Korea and so on, the populations will be ageing much faster. They will actually see periods of work force decline. It is not expected that we will see this in Australia. But it is important that we address the reasons why we have a very low work force participation rate amongst people aged from 45 to 64 years. We need to make sure that we take advantage of all the human capital in our society and that people are able to get the personal rewards available by working. In terms of the approach that the government has taken, which is exemplified in this budget, what are the challenges we face? First of all, we need to increase work force participation rates, especially among the group aged from 45 to 64 years. The Prime Minister is to be commended for appointing a specific Minister for Workforce Participation, the member for Dickson, whom I am delighted to see in that position. We also need further reform of the economy, including tax reform and making sure that infrastructure is in place so that we do not have any bottlenecks in the economy and including workplace relations reform, because it is very important to have wages set at the enterprise level, not by a centralised tribunal. Lastly, I want to touch on families. When the Howard government were elected in 1996, one of the things we did through family tax benefit part A and part B was to see that the relative position of lowand middle-income families was improved vis-a-vis the rest. For example, the family payment, which was only about $600 in 1996, is now about $1,800. We did that because we recognise the importance of families in our community, and the figures in the budget documents do show how the real incomes of dual-income families and single-income families have increased over the last 10 years. On the skills side, skill shortages are emerging, as I have said, and there is funding in this budget to improve vocational education and training through our new Australian technical colleges. But I am also very pleased to see that we have increased our skilled migration by 20,000. Lastly, on local issues, one of the key local things I pushed for in this budget was federal contribution to the South-West Indoor Aquatic Centre. I believe the Marion council did put in a very good submission. It was supported by all of the peak aquatic sport and swimming MAIN COMMITTEE groups. We had a very good reception from the Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator Rod Kemp, and the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Nick Minchin. I am disappointed that we were not able to get funding this year, but it is worth remembering that, for example, Mount Panorama, which I believe received $10 million in the 2001 budget, only got that at their fourth attempt and only after a very concrete contribution from the NSW state government. Having said that, it is important to note that swimming pools and aquatic centres are not normally core business of federal government, except where there is a specific case. As I have said in a previous speech, we have no FINA standard pool in South Australia. We do need one. Our local swimmers, our junior swimmers, can never compete in national championships in their own state. We cannot host a national championship because we have no FINA standard pool. infrastructure Australia desperately needs and, tragically, is therefore another wasted opportunity by the Howard government. The budget fails to adequately invest in the health care, child care and aged care so urgently needed in Sydney’s inner west and instead spends $21.7 billion on an unfair tax cut, providing little incentive for lower income earners, and insults 80 per cent of honest taxpayers in my electorate of Lowe by offering them a miserable tax cut of $6 a week. The government’s tax cuts are unfair. TodayI speak for the eight out of 10 taxpayers on average incomes in my electorate of Lowe who will see the lousy $6 a week. This is more evidence that once again the Howard government has sold short households and families in Sydney’s inner west. The tax cuts proposed by the government will cost more than $21 billion and are skewed heavily towards the highest income earners, with the maximum tax cut of $65 a week available only to those with a taxable income of $125,000 or more-that is, 280,000 taxpayers. The maximum tax cut available to those earning up to $63,000-that is, 7.4 million taxpayers and 80 per cent of constituents in my electorate-is just $6 a week. Under the government’s proposed package 45 per cent of the value of the tax cuts go to the top 10 per cent of taxpayers, while the remaining 90 per cent of taxpayers share the other 55 per cent of cuts. While an average-income earner in Sydney’s inner west will get a tax cut of $6 a week, a person earning $125,000 a year will gain an additional tax cut of $65 a week. I know this sort of tax reform must reflect the progressive nature of our income tax system, but this imbalance is unnecessary and therefore a lost opportunity to begin to adequately address other critical issues such as Australia’s skill shortage and urgent infrastructure needs. Worse, the government’s tax changes not only provide an unfair distributional outcome but also fail to adequately address the high effect of marginal tax rates for low-income earners moving from welfare to work. Many lower and middle-income earners face marginal tax rates of more than 60c in the dollar from income tax and the withdrawal of government benefits as they earn more private income. The opposition’s plan for fairer tax cuts would deliver a $12 a week tax cut to seven million Australians, providing fairer tax relief for 80 per cent of taxpayers in my electorate of Lowe, and could be delivered at the same cost. The plan announced by Mr Kim Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, delivers a $12 a week tax cut for those earning from $25,000 to $75,000, which is double what the government is providing. It will also preserve the government’s tax cut for people earning from $70,000 to $105,000.

240,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (10.21 Am),"This budget fails to adequately invest in training andApplying from 1 January 2006, the government should cut the tax of people moving from welfare to work by introducing a welfare-to-work tax bonus. It should replace the existing low-income tax offset and, when fully implemented, fully offset any tax on the first $10,000 taxable income for people earning up to $20,000 a year. To improve incentives for lowincome earners, to help them in a meaningful way, the government should also extend the income range where the 17 per cent marginal tax rate applies by raising the threshold where the 30 per cent rate applies from $21,600 to $26,400. In addition, the government should also adopt Labor’s tax plan and deliver a tax cut of $12 a week for lowand middle-income earners. From1 July 2006, the government should extend the income range where the 30 per cent marginal tax rate applies by raising the threshold where the 42c rate applies from $63,000 to $67,000. This would compensate middle and higher income earners for the effect of bracket creep and ensure that at least 80 per cent of taxpayers pay a marginal tax rate of 30c in the dollar or less. Finally, the income range where the 42 per cent marginal tax rate applies should be extended by lifting the threshold where the 47 per cent rate begins from $80,000 to $100,000. This would improve the competitiveness of Australia’s tax system. Labor’s plan would ensure that a worker or single-income family on average weekly earnings will over the next four years gain $936 more than under the proposals contained in this bill. Further, a dualincome family on $85,000 will over the next four years gain $1,872 more under Labor’s plan. As far as income tax relief is concerned, only Labor is willing to offer a fair outcome for Australian households by providing greater incentives for work and greater tax relief for the people who need it the most. While the government remains narrowly focused on supporting and rewarding Australia’s highest income earners-after all, they are the Howard government’s natural constituency-it fails to give urgently needed attention to other serious problems that most Australians would expect any worthy Australian government to address. Firstly, it is shameful that the Howard government believes it can get away with skewing so-called tax reform in favour of Australia’s highest income earners while flogging those Australians who are most disadvantaged. In this respect I will refer to an opinion piece written by Mr Frank Quinlan, the Executive Director of Catholic Welfare Australia, which was published in last week’s Catholic Weekly. Mr Quinlan precedes his opinion piece titled ‘Budget “a lost opportunity” to help the disadvantaged’ with the following: ‘Part of what makes Australia a good and decent society is our willingness to tilt the playing field in favour of low and middle income families with dependent children. This has been a defining philosophic commitment of mine for the past 20 years, not least in the area of taxation reform.’ Mr Quinlan then began: These are the words of the Prime Minister, John Howard, during his Menzies Research Centre Address in Sydney last week. Given the tax changes contained in the budget it is very difficult to believe the Prime Minister and his government are serious about anything else other than tilting the playing field away from the lowand middle-income families. As Mr Quinlan rightly continued: Reflecting on the Budget, Catholic Welfare Australia is dismayed that rather than tilting the playing field in favour of low and middle-income earners, it seems many of them are being sent to the sidelines, off the playing field altogether. MAIN COMMITTEE This is absolutely correct and it underlines why Labor opposes these unfair tax changes. Mr Quinlan continued: In a Budget that delivers an annual tax cut of more than $2,000 to those earning more than $100,000 a year ... low-income earners (those among the 20 per cent of Australian households that earn less than $12,000) receive a tax break of only $1.54 per week (not enough to buy a hamburger or a milkshake). Families on low incomes and middle incomes will have twice that figure consumed by the shift in the Medicare Safety Net in any case. There is no doubt that the Howard government’s tax changes in this bill fail to provide an incentive for people working on low incomes or the income tax relief to those who need it the most. While lowand middle-income earners are being sidelined by the Howard government, the story is reversed for those on the highest incomes. As I said earlier, the opposition believes that all Australians deserve some tax relief. Our income tax system is progressive in nature so it is obvious that higher income earners will always share in tax changes designed to give tax relief. However, it is scandalous that the Howard government continues to allow some high-income earners to avoid paying tax altogether. I bring to the attention of the House an answer to my question on notice No. 3 in this parliament to the Treasurer. On 17 November 2004, I asked the Treasurer: What proportion of (a) barristers, and (b) solicitors failed to lodge an income tax return on time in each of the financial years ended 1992 through to 2002. Following my 3½-year campaign to protect honest taxpayers, the Treasurer’s answer, provided by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, confirmed that 36 per cent of barristers failed to lodge a return in 2003, with similar failures recorded every year from 1999. The Howard government flogs honest taxpayers and insults them with a $6 a week tax cut at the same time as it fails to crack down on the more than one-third of barristers who have broken the law and failed to lodge a tax return. It is bad enough that far too many of the legal profession have used their knowledge to avoid paying their fair share of tax or even lodging a tax return. Further, and incredibly, we now know that over one-third of barristers in Australia have not bothered to complete an income tax return and the Howard government has been allowing this to happen since at least 1999. It is an absolute disgrace that many of these people, who have taken oaths to protect the public interest, still believe that tax is optional for them and it is an absolute disgrace that the Howard government has allowed them to get away with that. This is an insult to the vast majority of honest taxpayers, who suffer an enormous and unfair burden under the Howard government-the same taxpayers the government believes only deserve a $6 a week tax cut. I ask: what is the government doing to assist the New South Wales Bar Association and other professional bodies to expel those rogue members who refuse to do the right thing and who bring their profession into disrepute? What is the government doing to help them protect the name of honest professionals-in this case the 64 per cent of barristers who did lodge a tax return on time? I began by saying that, in failing to address the problems faced by all Australians, this budget is a wasted opportunity. Why does the government ignore the increasingly sad and unfair Australia it is helping to create? I want to refer to the sixth annual Manning Clark lecture, delivered on 20 March 2005 by respected social researcher Mr Hugh Mackay. My colleagues in the federal parliamentary Labor Party’s social policy committee and I were priviMAIN COMMITTEE leged to welcome Mr Mackay to a meeting of the committee last week here in parliament. Mr Mackay is rightly raising the alarm about the fact that we have been living through: ... the restructure of the Australian economy. This has resulted in a cultural shift in which we have gradually learnt to live with a widespread sense of job insecurity. We have witnessed a significant shift from full-time to part-time work, from permanent to casual employment and we have seen the problem of underemployment emerge as a more significant issue than the problem of absolute unemployment. We know this insecurity will only get worse under the Howard government’s unnecessary and unfair industrial relations agenda. Further, Mr Mackay points out: The redistribution of work has resulted in a redistribution of wealth. We have widened the gap between the rich and the poor. The average annual household income of the top 20 per cent of Australian households is about $180,000. The average annual household income of the bottom 20 per cent of households is about $12,000. We are also living with our highest ever levels of personal and household debt. Such shifts throw out a challenge to our traditional ideal of egalitarianism and raise serious questions about whether we are prepared to allow Australia to become a three class society, stratified by the dollar. Why is the Howard government ignoring this challenge? Because, in my view, it believes that it can get away with governing for the minority of Australians who believe a growing divide in Australia is acceptable and that it can scare enough other Australians into keeping it in office. I believe this will not last, but, equally, Australia cannot afford the government’s complacency. My constituents need a federal government that is willing to invest more in the services, training and infrastructure needed to ease the pressure on our communities and our household budgets. The budget contains no plans for infrastructure spending to address the growing crisis of traffic congestion in Sydney’s inner west and throughout Australia’s major cities. This is a problem that must be addressed across all levels of government. Instead we suffer a serious lack of leadership from the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister. This is an abdication of responsibility that matches the government’s handling of other critical transport related issues such as aircraft noise and overdevelopment at Sydney airport, not to mention the security debacle in the cargo and baggage-handling areas at Sydney airport. I raised this issue on 11 May 2005 in my question No. 1320 to the Minister for Justice and Customs. In view of the reports in yesterday’s and today’s Australian, I will be very interested to see his reply. With all the money in its slush fund, I also ask: why is the government not ensuring that the long-term operating plan for Sydney airport is fairly implemented and why is it not honouring its promise to build a second airport for the people of Sydney? The government remains idle as Australia suffers the terrible environmental consequences of and reduced productivity caused by its failure to respond to Australia’s urgent transport infrastructure needs. Further, the government’s key election health platform-the Medicare safety net-has been cut by $499 million. This will increase current thresholds from $300 to $500 for concession card holders and family tax benefit A recipients and from $700 to $1,000 for all others. The current safety net level was a ‘rock solid, ironclad guarantee’ before the last election, but now the Howard government wants households to pay more when they need a doctor. The budget will cut $1.3 billion from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme by increasing the safety net thresholds for prescriptions. The government is also punishing elderly Australians and cancer patients by removing calcium tablets from the PBS. This is both horribly MAIN COMMITTEE short-sighted and counterproductive, in my view. It is an unfair attack on Australian households in an area-that is, health care-that will cause maximum anxiety. In addition, at a time of a national skills crisis the budget fails to make any significant new investments in the education and training sectors. The budget contains no general growth funding for additional TAFE places, despite about 40,000 Australians being turned away from TAFE last year. The budget contains no growth funding for additional HECS places, despite the fact that Australian businesses are crying out for highly skilled professionals like engineers and scientists. The Howard government has failed to adopt the opposition’s proposal for a $2,000 trade completion bonus for traditional apprentices who complete their training. Having fewer apprentices in Sydney’s inner west-including a drop of 23 per cent in my electorate of Lowe-training in trades like bricklaying, plumbing and carpentry is an outrage when local businesses urgently need qualified tradespeople. This skills crisis hits all households and businesses through higher interest rates, increased costs and delays to building and renovations. The Howard government has also badly let down families in my electorate of Lowe by failing to invest in adequate child care. The budget contains no new funding for long day care and nothing to ease the shortage of care for the under-fives. Many parents with young children will be unable to work to help pay the family mortgage and stay relevant in the labour market because of the huge shortage in long day care places. The queue for child-care places in my electorate of Lowe continues to grow, and the government is failing to create new places. It is typical in the inner west for child-care facilities to have something in the order of 200 parents waiting to get their children into child care. The government should be addressing that, in my view. The long waiting lists for outside school hours care will continue because the funds allocated for new places will not be available until 2008-09. This means that parents who want to work past 3 pm are still being prevented from doing so due to the shortage of places. The budget also neglects families looking after elderly parents and relatives because it ignores the ongoing skills shortage and the funding inequities in aged care. It fails to invest in training and retention measures for aged care nurses and personal carers. It does not address the systemic problem in the allocation of aged care places exacerbating the current waiting list problems. We know that there is a national shortage of 10,000 residential aged care beds and that there are over 17,000 phantom beds-that is, 17,000 beds that have been announced by the government but have never been opened. The budget also ignores the need for adequate funding for high-care residents and for capital development. By failing to adequately invest in, and in some areas cutting funding to, health, education and training, child care and aged care, the Howard government is contributing to the terrible anxiety of households in Sydney’s inner west. I do not believe the Treasurer is serious when he expects this anxiety to be alleviated by a lousy $6 a week tax cut. In the time. I have left I want to confirm my support for the second reading amendment moved by the shadow Treasurer, the member for Lilley, that the House condemns the government for a budget which: (1) delivers grossly unfair tax relief which favours the highest income earners at the expense of ordinary Australian families; MAIN COMMITTEE (2) ignores the crippling effect of punishingly high effective marginal tax rates on workforce participation; (3) imposes harsh conditions on the income of the most vulnerable members of the community; (4) fails to invest in skills and infrastructure disregarding repeated warnings from the RBA and OECD about skills shortages and infrastructure bottlenecks; (5) exposes Australians to the risk of higher interest rates as a result of capacity constraints and escalating economic imbalances; (6) predicts a significantly slowing rate of real GDP growth to below the Australian long-term average and considerably below world GDP growth; (7) confirms continuing unsustainable current account deficits into the future; (8) predicts a continuing increase in Australia’s foreign debt; (9) predicts import growth to exceed export growth; and (10) contains a proposed Future Fund which is focused on offsetting the superannuation liability of Commonwealth employees at the expense of sensible long-term investment in vital infrastructure”. I encourage the government to adopt our amendment and make this a fairer budget in the interests of the future of Australia. (Time expired) this very sound and responsible budget-the 10th budget delivered by the Treasurer, Peter Costello. When I hear the contributions of the members opposite in this House, I sometimes wonder whether we are in the same parliament or whether we have a literacy problem, as they do not seem to be able to read the legislation that has been announced. The previous speaker, the member for Lowe, was decrying the shortage of long day care centres in his electorate. I remind the member for Lowe that there is not a cap on long day care centres. If there is a shortage, make sure you go out and fight for your electorate rather than simply coming into the House and complaining. The measures and priorities in this budget are an investment in Australia’s future. It is a budget about aspiration. The budget also comes at a time that is right to make important structural changes to help ease people away from the growing trap of welfare dependency. In 1996, when we came into office, the focus was on dragging the economy out of the debt mire of the Keating era. Since then the government has delivered eight surplus budgets, which have helped to restore confidence in the Australian economy and, in turn, opportunities for Australians. I am proud to be part of a government that has introduced major initiatives throughout this term. On top of record investment into vital services such as health, education and aged care, this government has never lost sight of its genuine reformist zeal. There has been vital tax reform, important structural changes to the health system, and an emphasis on accountability and sustainability in the aged care sector. Furthermore, the workplace relations system has also had much needed reform. The new IR reforms, announced as recently as last Thursday by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, are a welcome step and should lead to more jobs, better wages and improved conditions for Australian workers. These workers have received far better outcomes from this government than the 13 years of the previous government, where real wages only went up by about 1.3 to 1.4 per cent, compared to 14 per cent under this government.

241,Mr Barresi (Deakin) (10.41 Am),"It is a pleasure to rise in this House and speak aboutNine years of pain-following Labor’s $96 billion debt-have helped put the economy in great shape. This is the eighth budget that has delivered a surplus. As the Treasurer said on budget night, before we came into office the Labor government was in deficit by two per cent of GDP. Two per cent of GDP in today’s terms is $19 billion-money which could have been better spent on vital services and programs in this country. We are paying off that debt. By June-July next year we will have reduced that net debt by $90 billion. We are paying off Labor’s debt and soon we will begin saving-saving for the future, and, as the Treasurer says, saving for the ageing of the population and for the opportunities of future generations. This is a record that every member of the government can be very proud of. The Australian public have certainly recognised this time and again by re-endorsing us as their government of choice. It is also important that we use this strong position to set the scene for the future. At present, we are well aware that Australia’s population is ageing. The time is right to make important changes to ensure that we remain on a sustainable footing. I am pleased that this budget is placing an important emphasis on moving people off welfare and into the work force. Our task now is to help people find a balanced approach where they can participate in the work force. It is important to help prevent people from feeling that they cannot afford to move back into work. It is important for them to once again start feeling good about themselves. They need to develop positive feelings about themselves and to develop self-esteem and a feeling that they can make a contribution to this nation. This is not a budget that is about punishment. It is a budget that provides support and assistance to those who are seeking to return to the work force. To illustrate the importance of participating in the work force, I turn to a study recently commissioned by the Australian Institute of Family Studies. This study highlighted a very important point. In their report Growing up in Australia, the institute found that 70 per cent of parents feel that working makes them more competent parents. The study focused on the families of 1,000 infants under 12 months old and children under 4 and 5. The results are very significant because they go a long way towards dispelling the misguided assertion that parents who want to return to work will harm their children’s development. In most cases, of course, the parents we are referring to are mothers who are seeking to return to work. This assertion is misguided, because it does not harm the children’s development. In fact, as the study shows, it assists the competency of those parents to deliver a meaningful, loving environment for their children. The positive effects of a steady job and a life outside of the home cannot be overestimated. I read with interest comments in the Melbourne Age by the director of the study, Ann Stanson of the University of Melbourne. In discussing the results of the survey, Ms Stanson stated: ... a lot of parents feel that outside involvement helps them to be positive and responsive to their children when they are there. It is important in the context of this debate to highlight that a healthy working life can be good for a parent. This is particularly pertinent for very young mothers who have children prior to entering the work force. I am sure we all know of such cases. If a young mother moves onto a parenting payment as her first source of permanent income, it can be even more difficult for her to move into and establish herself in a workplace environment. In many cases, young single mothers want to work. The workplace environment can provide purpose and an avenue for a young mother to make new friends and build selfMAIN COMMITTEE confidence, self-esteem and feelings of self-worth. The last thing that a young mother in her early to mid-20s wants to face is a financial burden when she enters part-time work. This budget is all about assisting that transition and providing real incentive to make the transition into the work force. As many members in the chamber will be aware, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation, which I chair, recently tabled a report in the House. That report on increasing participation in paid work inquired into how we can lift the participation rate in Australia. At present, Australia’s work force participation rate is at 63.8 per cent. This is one of the lowest levels in the Western world and is a real long-term concern for our economy. One worrying observation that our committee heard is that Australia will have approximately 500,000 jobs with no-one to fill them by the year 2030.

The reasons for the slow participation rate are varied. Some of the terms are fast becoming part of our contemporary vernacular. Terms such as ‘ageing population’ and ‘skills shortages’ are often thrown about; they certainly feature prominently in the current national debate. A significant recommendation from the report I was referring to is recommendation 4, which I would like to share with the chamber: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government review the tax free threshold, taper rates, effective marginal tax rates and income test stacking to maximise incentives to move from income support payments to increased participation in paid work. I am pleased to see the fast adoption in the budget of part of this recommendation. Lifting the allowable income level to $37,500 before family tax benefit A decreases will help ease single parents back into the work force. This is good news for those looking to return to work. It provides an additional incentive through the tax system to make the transition. In combination with a decrease in the marginal tax rate from 17 to 15 per cent, those seeking to return to part-time work will have their benefits scaled down at a much reduced rate.

244,Mr Barresi,"As I was saying prior to the divisions, one of the key priorities for futuresustainable. I have already mentioned the need to encourage more single parents on parenting payments to get back into the work force. The other significant welfare payment that currently does not carry an obligation to seek work of any significance is the disability support pension, the DSP. I am pleased to see that there were some changes made in this year’s budget to encourage those on DSP, from 1 July next year, to increase their participation in the work force. In January 2004 a representative of the Australian Council of Social Service explained this shift to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation, which I chair. I am pleased to see the former deputy chair of the parliamentary committee in the chamber today. According to ACOSS, the increase has been, in part, attributable to switching from other benefits. It is more appealing to be on DSP than the Newstart allowance. It is important that people with a disability are not simply typecast as being unable to work. Just as importantly, I have come across disabled people in my electorate and throughout Australia. Many of them have strongly implored me to be allowed to work if they are able to do so. This budget is a $2 billion investment into services over the next four years, to help people find work. Members on the other side have made the accusation that it is about cost cutting and getting people off DPS. What they have failed to acknowledge is that there is no net gain from the changes to DSP and welfare to work for at least the next eight years. Of course, there are many different kinds of disabilities and not everybody is physically capable of working the prescribed 15 to 29 hours per week. But many people with often debilitating disabilities, such as neurological conditions, do want to make a contribution to the work force. One such group I have become familiar with are MS sufferers. I am fortunate to have the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Victoria based in my electorate at the Nerve Centre in Blackburn. The honourable member for Calwell and I had an opportunity to visit the MS Society in the course of the committee’s inquiry. The MS Society is a fantastic organisation that strongly lobbies in the best interests of people with this chronic and often disabling, disease. The MS Society has also highlighted the need for a change of culture towards employees with the condition. Employers can be reluctant to keep employees with MS on their books for the long term. Among many factors, the MS society has stated: Employers are often uncomfortable with discussing workplace accommodation and accede from fear of allegations of discrimination rather than a desire to provide appropriate assistance in the workplace. This is a real problem for those with MS. There is a feeling that it is not matter of ‘CanI find a job if I have MS?’ but rather ‘CanI make keep my job if I have MS?’ because of the degenerative nature of the disease. I strongly value the MS Society’s contribution to this issue, and I am endeavouring to work with them on establishing a pilot employment program under the Employment Innovation Fund. This project will provide an avenue for employees with MS to work through training and workplace integration and I look forward to its implementation in due course. In addition, the society and I plan to co-host a forum in my electorate later in this year, which will focus on workplace participation for people with disabilities. We hope to involve many of the local groups in the employment sector, particularly those employers who have a strong commitment, a strong desire, to lend a hand up to those with disabilities to enable them to enter into the workplace. MAIN COMMITTEE In the limited time. I have available I would like to touch on a number of other subjects, particularly the budget’s strong commitment to vocational education and training. We all know that the unemployment rate is currently 5.1 per cent, yet it is still important for us to invest strongly in increasing our skills base. The best time to encourage people into the work force is a time of low unemployment when jobs are available. We also need to acknowledge that there is a skills shortage in key industry sectors in this country. Through its budget allocation, this government is giving priority to vocational education and training. It is important to recognise that a love affair with a job begins at a young age. School age people in Deakin will benefit from some of the 4½ thousand new prevocational places announced in the budget. The $20 million for this initiative will support the $26 million that will go towards 7,000 new school based apprenticeships. We are pushing for a greater focus on vocational training. There are many more significant issues that I could go into, such as the $537 million to extend youth allowance and other assistance to young apprentices. I am sure there will be plenty of opportunities in coming weeks to debate these issues. One of the problems with school based apprenticeships is having the training recognised by the relevant industry sector. I have certainly encouraged the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education, Gary Hardgrave, to identify some of the impediments in the Victorian system. These impediments prevent the school based apprenticeships and traineeships from being recognised by prospective employers. There is a real concern that a number of industry awards make it incredibly difficult for such recognition to take place. While they recognise the formal curriculum side of an apprentice’s training, often they will not recognise the workplace experience that accompanies it. It is not uncommon for an apprentice to be asked to start all over again when they have finished their school based apprenticeship. The ‘Local Answers’ funding included in this budget is important for my electorate of Deakin and has been most welcome. It has been directed at helping community groups do their fantastic work in our local area. It is targeted towards helping young people remain active. I have had several young people write to me and call my office about the need for recreational facilities, particularly in the City of Maroondah in Ringwood. For years young skaters and rollerbladers have had to travel to nearby Croydon to use outdoor skating facilities. The Maroondah City Council has long envisaged building a similar facility in Staley Gardens right in the middle of Ringwood. I recall in the election campaign making a commitment to ensure that we will get federal funding as part of a three-way contribution to establishing a skate park for the young people of Ringwood. A $50,000 commitment by the federal government is one which I know has been most welcomed and I was pleased to see that it was included in this year’s budget. It is satisfying to know that this funding will make a large difference for local youth. Just last sitting week I was fortunate enough to have one of my local schools, the Antonio Park Primary School from Mitcham, visit Parliament House. When I invited the students to ask questions, rather than asking the usual: ‘How much money do you earn? How often do you fly to Canberra? Do you miss your family and friends? What kind of car do you drive?’ the first question was, ‘Are you going to get us a skate park?’ It showed that it really is an issue of great interest to those young people and I am very pleased to see that we are able to help deliver that election commitment. MAIN COMMITTEE Other groups within my electorate that have benefited from this budget include the Scouts. I am pleased to see that funding was also made available to help two Scouts groups in particular with some much needed refurbishments to their halls. These groups are the Seventh Ringwood group and the First Eight group in Blackburn, with $15,000 and $20,000 respectively. It is good news for them. I know that every member in this House values the work that the scouting organisation does in their communities, and in encouraging amongst young people a sense of the virtues of life skills, leadership and service. The people of Deakin are an intelligent, diverse and articulate group of people. They keep me on my toes. They do not allow dominant issues to pass by without letting me know their diverse feelings. From time to time, some of these issues straddle the traditional demarcation belonging within the local, state and federal realm. One such issue which I have raised in this House on numerous occasions is the Scoresby Freeway. I am pleased to see that the federal government has kept its $560 million offer on the table for a toll-free road. I will not say anything more than that. It is on the table. I know that while Steve Bracks took much delight in the hyped-up sod turning of the project it is clear that the state government’s backflip on its no-tolls promise has not been forgotten by people of Deakin. (Time expired) Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney) (11.51 am)-I would be really pleased if government members used this opportunity in the debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006 to do what speakers in the appropriations debate are supposed to do: come in here and talk about the budget, in particular about the Welfare to Work measures that are contained in this federal budget. We have 86 coalition MPs. One after the other they troop in, tell the good news story and troop back out again. WhatI am really interested in is how they can justify to their constituents-in particular to the poorest constituents-the iniquitous tax cuts in this budget and the harsh Welfare to Work measures. I cannot understand why members opposite think that if someone is wealthy they need to be given more money as an incentive to work yet if someone is poor they need to have money taken from them as an incentive to work. I want coalition MPs to come in here and explain to us why it is that they think shifting people on to newstart allowance-which has a higher taper rate than the parenting payment or the disability support pension, so that people who will be on newstart will lose 60c in the dollar for every dollar that they earn instead of 40c, like they do now with the parenting payment and the disability support pension-is going to encourage people to move from welfare to work. How does making it more expensive for people to pick up some part-time work, making it less attractive for them to do that, encourage people to move from welfare to work? I want coalition MPs to come in here and explain to us how cutting access to the JET program, the Jobs, Education and Training program that provides child care for people who undertake training to move from welfare to work-a marvellous program that was first developed by a Labor government-encourages people to move from welfare to work. At the moment people are able to access JET child care for longer than a period of a year. They go on it for a year and then if their course is not finished they can go on it for another year. This budget says that if your course is longer than a year you have no access to JET child care training. How can it be that making it harder for people to undertake training-like hairdressing apprenticeships, learning to be a social worker or studying to be a nurse or a teacher-will help them move from welfare to work? It is a mystery to me, and I would love to hear coalition members of parliament explain it. MAIN COMMITTEE I believe that shifting people from the disability support pension and from the parenting payment on to newstart from 2006 is simply a cost-cutting measure. The member for Deakin said that it is actually not going to save money in the short term. The reason it is not saving money is not because of any of the Welfare to Work measures in it; it is because of the policing of those measures, because we are going to come down like a tonne of bricks on single mums who cannot find child care and thus cannot get part-time work. That is why it is expensive. We are going to pay the Job Network providers to breach people without explanation. The first time they do not turn up to a job interview, the Job Network provider will be able to get Centrelink to breach people, to rip them off benefits. That is where the expense comes in. It certainly does not come in from changing people to newstart allowance, which is going to be a major cost saver for this government. The second class of welfare recipients who are going to go on the parenting dole or the disabled dole are the hardest hit by this budget. I will talk a little bit about the tax cuts later on, but the people who should really concern us in this budget are the people who are going to be put on this second-class parenting dole and second-class disability dole. Disability support pensioners are going to lose $77 per fortnight. This is an enormous amount of money to someone who is on a benefit. It is not much to the Treasurer and his mates who are getting their $65 a week tax cut on top of their pay rise, but it is an enormous amount of money to someone who is on a disability support pension. It is not just because the cost of living is unaffordable to people who are on welfare benefits; people who are on disability support pensions have a number of additional costs. They often have lots of medication to pay for; they often spend a greater proportion of their money getting around just doing the ordinary things that people do from day to day. Some people have incontinence aids to pay for and all sorts of things that we do not consider to be day-to-day expenses. These are the necessary types of expenses for people on a disability support pension, and they cannot afford a $77 a fortnight cut. People who are sole parents will lose $44 a fortnight when they are moved onto the parenting dole. If they are working or getting money from a private source, they are going to be enormously hard-hit by this budget. In fact, some single parents who work part time will have their benefits slashed by up to $236 a fortnight. Under current arrangements, a single parent with four children under the age of 16 and who has $800 in private income gets $250.26 in parenting payment. From1 July that person will have their benefits cut by $236, and they will be left with a benefit of $13.80 a fortnight. How can we justify taking $236 from this sort of family? What the government seem to forget is, in their rush to punish these undeserving parents who are living the high life with their children, it is the children who suffer. It is always the children who suffer when money is taken from these sorts of vulnerable families. This family will be expected to suffer a 22½ per cent cut in their income. It is not just families in this scenario. Let us look at a single parent with one child between the age of six and 16. When they move onto the parenting dole, if they have $800 in private income a fortnight-if they are working a couple of days a week, maybe part time; they are doing exactly what it is that the government is asking single parents to do-they are going to lose $206.94 a fortnight. They would suffer a 20.3 per cent cut in their fortnightly income. Under the current regime, they would receive $220.74 a fortnight; under the new regime, they will receive just $13.80 a fortnight. How can we justify punishing parents who are doing exMAIN COMMITTEE actly what the government wishes them to do-working part time, improving their chances of full-time work as their children grow older-by taking from them $206.94 a fortnight? It just beggars belief. As well as this, there is also the second class of welfare recipients who sign up after 1 July 2006. They are not just going to lose $77 a fortnight if they are disability support pensioners or $44 or more a fortnight if they are sole parents; they are going to miss out on the higher rate of indexation of pensions, so the gap will grow over time. The gap that we are talking about now will only grow because of the different way that pensions are indexed from the newstart allowance. They are going to miss out on the pensioner education supplement. All of the rhetoric about the welfare to work measures has been about skilling people and sending them out into the work force. How can it be right then that we would take from such people the pensioner education supplement? How can that be right? What about the telephone allowance? Surely someone who is looking for work needs a telephone to be connected to the rest of the world. Surely this is a basic requirement of someone who is searching for work. But people on the new newstart allowance, the parenting dole or the disability dole will not get it. So any help that they were led to expect in moving from welfare to work will be undermined by that as well. The government has been trumpeting these welfare to work measures for months. People who watch these social issues were thinking: ‘Great! They must have something really great in their back pocket because they sure have been making a fuss about these welfare to work measures. It must be something pretty exciting.’ What a sad disappointment this budget has been. When it comes to moving people from welfare to work, it is all about punishment; it is all about stick and no reward, no carrot. It has been an enormous let-down. With $22 billion to spend on tax cuts, surely the government could have done a better job than giving 45 per cent of the tax cuts to the top 10 per cent of earners. I do not understand how it is that we have family tax benefit part B, which is essentially a reward to a primary carer of children for staying out of the work force. It is structured so that, in a family where there is a major breadwinner and someone on a much smaller income or no income, they are rewarded for staying out of the work force or for working a minimum number of hours. Other people have called it social engineering and said that it is an attempt by the government to keep women out of the work force. Yet, if a woman is a sole parent-if her husband has died or left her or if she has left him because he was bashing her and the kidsthen it is not a good thing for her to stay home with the kids. In those circumstances, when she is doing the job of raising her children on her own, suddenly she is a bludger. I cannot understand how we reward one set of parents for staying home and punish another set of parents for staying home, when the only difference between these two sets of parents is that in one instance they are in a couple and in the other they are on their own and doing it much tougher. The other thing we need to talk about when it comes to moving people from welfare to work is: where are these part-time jobs going to come from? The government has been very enthusiastic about the 83,400 out of school hours care places. That is terrific, and Labor welcomes any increase in out of school hours care places because there is a shortage around the country. On budget day in the lockup Treasury officials confirmed that there are already 35,000 children waiting for out of school hours care places. That is almost half gone. There is MAIN COMMITTEE no guarantee that any of these extra out of school hours care places will go to parents seeking to move from welfare to work. There is no tying of the extra places to parents who are seeking to move into the work force, and so it would be quite natural that a number of these places, perhaps the majority of them, would go to parents already in the work force. It is a real disappointment that this government has not done more in the area of out of school hours care and, more critically, in the area of long day care. One of the reasons that women get locked out of the work force and lose their skills is because it is impossible to find child care for children under the age of five and particularly for children under the age of two. When you do find it, it is so expensive that, unless you are a very high income earner, in many circumstances it is not worth your while going to work. So you take people who perhaps have a trade, a skill or a profession and you say to them: ‘For the next five years, it is not going to be economical for you to be in the work force. But when your child turns six, just like that, we expect you to pick up where you left off.’ That is not a reasonable thing to expect of people. If we had seen some more long day care places in this budget so that working women in particular could maintain their skills and maintain their attachment to the work force, which is so critical to people getting work, then perhaps I would be more convinced of the government’s sincerity. But the fact that there is nothing in this budget for long day care and that there is so very little when it comes to family day care really makes me question what it is that the government intends with its child-care announcement. I think basically it is window-dressing. It is supposed to make this budget look a little more compassionate than it is. It is worth remembering too that most single mothers are already working or looking for work-over 64 per cent of them. Most want to be in the work force. If we do something about child care and about training, I think there is a good chance that a lot of them will voluntarily move into the work force. At the moment all we seem to do is put hurdles in front of these people. All we seem to do is make it harder for them. As I said earlier, the harder we make it for the parents the harder it is on the kids. A lot of these kids are already skipping meals and missing out on school excursions, and the government’s solution is to move their parents onto a lower welfare benefit. If you look at this budget you also see that we are developing a two-tiered welfare system, which I think is appalling. I think that it is shocking that we are moving to a system where, if you are on a benefit on a certain day, you get one rate but, if you are in the same circumstances and have the same need for government support but you go onto the benefit after 1 July 2006, you will get a different amount. That is incomprehensible. I was interested to see that Ross Gittins also found it incomprehensible. In his column last week he said that this decision is: ... a cold-blooded decision to switch the nation to a two-class welfare system-a system where some people get benefits a lot higher than others. He points to people on the age benefit who will retain their higher benefits and their higher taper rate and he compares them with the people who are going to go onto the parenting dole and the disability dole. He says: The lower class will be the unemployed, sole parents whose youngest is six or older and people with disabilities who are judged capable more than 15 but less than 29 hours a week. They will get a benefit indexed the consumer price indexMAIN COMMITTEE in contrast to the pension, which is indexed to male total average weekly earnings. Ross Gittins says the reason the government have been boasting about how their package is going to cost a bit is that they have been trying to portray that as an indication that they are in fact doing something constructive to move people from welfare to work. He points out that it costs a fair bit just to impose the work test-hassling people about how many jobs they have been applying for-on people who formerly would not have been subject to it. But the government has admitted that the package of changes will be saving the budget money after about eight years. We know why it will be saving people money: because people are going to be on a lower benefit with a higher taper rate, and they are going to miss out on programs like the JET program and the pensioner education supplement and the telephone allowance and all the other benefits they will miss out on. Ross Gittins concludes by saying: The real saving will come simply from screwing working-age welfare recipients a lot harder than the politically untouchable golden oldies. I think Ross Gittins hit the nail on the head. The other thing that is important to remember when it comes to what is keeping people out of the work force is child care, which I already mentioned. Child care has had what is called a broadband review. The minister has been looking at all the different types of child care and what we are going to do with all of them. The bad news is that some services are going to miss out. One that is going to miss out is in Daylesford Victoria. On 23 May 2005 David Wroe wrote in the Age: The irony of this month’s federal budget was not lost on single mother Michelle Lowndes. As the Government encourages single parents into work, it is tinkering with a child-care funding formula that might force the Daylesford Community Child Care Centre to close, in turn forcing Ms Lowndes to quit her part-time work and studies. The manager of the centre, Julie McLean, is quoted as saying: What seems to be missing from the equation is that the low-income people in this area cannot afford to be paying higher fees. The member for Ballarat, Catherine King, presented to the parliament a petition with 700 signatures about the closure of Daylesford Child Care Centre. Because of this government’s policies, centres like the one at Daylesford, which help working parents to balance their work and family responsibilities, will close. I do not think this is irony. It was described in the newspaper as irony, but it is hypocrisy. To say, on the one hand, ‘We are going to help people get from welfare to work,’ and, on the other hand, to take away from them every support that helps them move from welfare to work-their child care, their training opportunities-is not irony; it is hypocrisy. The range of training and support measures provided in the budget is manifestly inadequate. Recipients of the disability support pension currently number 700,000 and recipients of the parenting payment 600,000. As well, there are about 65,000 mature age recipients of newstart. So there is a group of 1.3 million people that we are hoping to move from welfare to work. What have we done for these people? We have allocated 136,600 additional Job Network places. Someone is going to miss out. Only one in 10 people will get access to an additional Job Network place. There are 7,600 vocational training places for 700,000 disability MAIN COMMITTEE support pension recipients. Training measures provided in the budget are manifestly inadequate. The problem is that a significant number-about 60 per cent-of the target group have only a year 10 or equivalent qualification. Something serious needs to be done about their training and their child-care needs. This is not about moving them from welfare to work. It is about cutting their benefits. (Time expired) propriation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006 and associated bills. This is a great budget for Australia, and it is a great budget for the people of Ryan, whom I have the great privilege of representing in this parliament. The people of Ryan are very supportive of the government. That was reflected in my overwhelming re-election only several months ago, in October last year, which resulted in a substantial increase in my vote. I am delighted to say to the people of Ryan that it is great honour to be their local representative in the Australian parliament. I call on the Labor opposition to pass the government’s budget so that Australia, including the people of Ryan, can benefit from the budget measures. This is important for the people of Ryan and it is important for the businesses of Ryan. It is absolutely undesirable that the government, which was re-elected in October last year, cannot have its measures passed immediately. So, stop the obstruction, stop the senseless politics and stop the blatant opportunism. It is important that a government with a very strong mandate can implement its policies. This will certainly be seen post 1 July, when the new Senate takes its form. The government’s measures can then be implemented fully and extensively. However one looks at this budget, whether it is income tax cuts, small business, welfare to work measures, health care funding, our international engagement or providing for the future of Australians through the future fund, this budget caters for all sectors of the economy and makes a very strong contribution to Australian society, in all its forms. I want to take the opportunity to refer the parliament to the days of the Keating government and make a comparison between how the economy stood at that time and how the economy stands under the very strong leadership of Prime Minister Howard and his cabinet. In 1996, the Keating government’s budget deficit was $96 billion-two per cent of the nation’s GDP. Interest payments alone were some $9 billion. The inflation rate was over five per cent. A million people were out of work, and the unemployment rate was going through the roof. I am sure that many people in my electorate were affected by those figures. Mortgage interest rates were astoundingly high, at 18 to 20 per cent. Business confidence was at an all-time low, and small businesses were paying through the roof-with interest rates of over 20 per cent. The taxation system and the industrial relations system were shambolic and outdated. This begs the question: who was the finance minister at that time? It was none other than the current Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, the member for Brand. The people in my electorate of Ryan have spoken decisively, having returned a Liberal member to this parliament and having played a strong part in returning the Howard government on three successive occasions for four election wins. The coalition election victory in 1996, after a decade of Labor neglect, was very significant for this country. I am sure that when the Prime Minister took office he surveyed the scene and saw that the challenges facing him as the new Prime Minister of this country were very significant. There were always going to be massive challenges. Of course the government went to work straight away and took to the 1998 election a very historic taxation reform package.

245,Mr Johnson (Ryan) (12.11 Pm),"I am very pleased to speak in the debate on the Apasked the people of Australia for a mandate to implement those reforms, and those reforms have taken this country into the 21st century and set us up for decades of prosperity and growth if we can continue to govern wisely. Those reforms are going to set up this country so that my children and grandchildren, and the children and grandchildren of every member of this parliament, will prosper. Not surprisingly, the ALP opposition stood in the way of these tax reforms of the 1998 election-the so-called GST election. I am sure the opposition thought they could surf to victory by being a small target. The Australian people showed very strongly that they were not going to be taken for a ride and saw straight through the blatant opportunism of the small target campaign that was adopted. We do not hear too much about it now, but their policy was one of roll-back-that is, rolling back the GST reforms. word was roll-back. I am not sure when that word was last mentioned in the House of Representatives or indeed in the Senate-I might check on that in Hansard and advise my colleague. I am sure his electorate would be very keen to hear about this as well. I know that he is doing a fine job representing his constituents. The roll-back policy is dead and buried. It proved to be something on which the Australian people were not going to be taken for a ride. Thankfully for that, Australia today is a much better place. We are enjoying remarkable economic growth and remarkable prosperity-something which has allowed the government to deliver vital services to take this country forward. On budget night the Treasurer delivered his eighth successive budget surplus. The federal government’s cash budget surplus stands at $8.9 billion. This represents a surplus of one per cent of GDP. The unemployment level is at an almost 30-year low of 5.1 per cent. Isn’t that remarkable? I would like to refer to the remarks of the previous speaker, the member for Sydney, about welfare to work. She seemed to focus a lot on that. The best thing you can do for people in this country is to give them a job. The best thing we can do is to give them a highly paid job, and this government focuses very much on skills and training. That is what is going to take people off welfare and into the employment market. Over the past nine years, real wages have risen in this country by 14 per cent, which compares most favourably to the 1.2 per cent rise over the 13 years of the ALP government. As the Prime Minister said recently, we are now in the 14th year of the longest unbroken economic expansion that Australia has had at any time since World War II. That is a very significant statement of fact. I remind the parliament that the ALP left office in 1996 with a $96 billion budget deficit, or two per cent of GDP. Why is this important to the people of Ryan? It is very important because what that meant was that we were paying an incredible amount of interest. What did that do? It deprived the people of Ryan and the rest of the country of vital amounts of money for services to hospitals, the education sector and other important areas of the economy. Labor’s debt has been repaid to the tune of $90 billion. It has certainly been hard going, but we are making those repayments in the interests of our children, our grandchildren and the future of this country. Only by reducing the principal of that debt can we remove further interest payments. By doing that, $5.7 billion of interest payments have been freed up. We are talking about a very significant amount of money.

247,Mr Johnson,"I am happy to advise my National Party coalition colleague that thatPeople have asked me from time to time in the Ryan electorate, ‘Why do you keep harping on about this budget deficit that the Labor government left you in 1996?’ I say to them, and I again say today in the parliament, that I go on about it because it is very important to remind the Australian community that when Labor were in government they did not have the capacity to run the economy in the interests of the Australian community. How can you run a country with a massive debt and not expect that to catch up with the country some time down the track? For the people of Ryan, and their children and grandchildren, the government’s policies will make their lives and their economic prosperity much better into the future. We are certainly the envy of other nations. I want to take the opportunity, while I am speaking on the debt that Labor had when they were in office, to remind the parliament, and-as the re-elected member for Ryan-to remind the people of Ryan, of the debt figures during the Hawke-Keating years. In 1991 there was a Commonwealth net debt of $31 billion. In 1992 it was $55 billion. In 1993 it was $70 billion. In 1994 it was $83 billion. In 1995 it was $95 billion. And of course in 1996 the Howard government confronted over $96 billion of government debt. I think it was very significant that the Howard government was elected to redress that economic crisis confronting the country. In 1997, the first year after the Howard government was elected, the debt was $82 billion. It came down in 1998 to $70 billion. In 1999 it was $57 billion. In 2000 it was $42 billion. It continued to go down. In 2001 it was $38 billion. In 2002, $32 billion was owed. This government has made the tough calls, the tough decisions that only a government can make. Being in opposition it is very easy to have a go at the government, but the decisions do not lie with oppositions; they lie with governments. For the people of Ryan this is very significant indeed. I want to remind the people of Ryan, and indeed the broader Brisbane and Queensland electorates, that Queensland as a state benefits from GST revenues to the tune of $35 billion. Hopefully the state government will get on with abolishing the whole basket of indirect taxes that Queenslanders have been slugged with. I want to call on the Queensland government, while they continue to receive this windfall of cash, to spend some of that money on the roads in my Ryan electorate. Spend some money on Moggill Road. So far it is all talk and no action. I know the people of Ryan are getting sick and tired of the Queensland government reaping in all this money from the GST, which as a Labor government they opposed-although they were the first in fact to sign the document. Now they are receiving all this money and I call on them to spend some money on local infrastructure. Moggill Road is a state road. The Labor government has been in power in Queensland since 1989, bar two years of the Borbidge government. Now it is 2005 and Moggill Road remains in the same condition as in 1989. This is something that I think will be very instructive to follow in the months ahead. I turn my attention now to the tax cut measures introduced in the budget by the Treasurer. The government’s tax cuts are due to be delivered on 1 July, and I hope that they will be, because the people of Ryan certainly deserve their income tax cuts. There will be almost $22 billion worth of income tax cuts in the country. I think the small businesses and the families and the people of my electorate of Ryan are looking forward very much to them, because they deserve them. They deserve them because they have been working hard. They are the ones who loyally pay their taxes, who make a contribution to this community, to this country. With the economy growing very strongly and the country being run tremendously well, it is entirely MAIN COMMITTEE appropriate that they receive their tax cuts as soon as possible-not next year, not the year after and not in the next parliament, as the Labor opposition have called for. What was the Labor opposition’s response to the government’s tax cuts? It was not to support them. The budget has been delivered in 2005 and how have they responded? They have proposed tax cuts in the next parliament-not in the 42nd Parliament but in the 43rd Parliament. That is absolutely astonishing. What are these tax cuts going to do? They are going to boost disposable income. They are going to, as I say, reward the hard working people of Australia. More than anything, they are going to assist low-income earners. I cannot believe that a party that is the so-called friend of the workers will not pass budgetary measures that support low-income earners. That is absolutely astonishing. What the new tax scales mean is that over 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers will face a top marginal income tax rate of 30 per cent or less. Ms HallMr Deputy Speaker, I seek to intervene. way? face a top marginal rate of 47c in the dollar. The top tax rate of 47 per cent will now come in at $95,000, and increase to $125,000 in July 2006. Let me make a comparison with some of the other countries in the world. The US is 43 per cent and it cuts in at $425,000. Japan’s top rate of 46 per cent applies at $A275,000. In the UK it is 41 per cent, at $87,000. The top tax rate in New Zealand is 39 per cent and cuts in at $55,000, and in Canada it is $120,000. This is a major step forward for the Australian taxpayer. However, it is by no means sufficient. I call for further income tax cuts for the people of Ryan and the Australian community. The tax measures that were passed are by no means tax cuts only for the rich, as the Labor Party so spuriously claims. The Labor Party does not even want to pass tax cut measures that will help lower income earners. I can certainly say to the Labor Party that the low-income earners of Ryan will not be sending it any bouquets, that is for sure. These tax cuts are very consistent with an economy that is growing. They are very consistent with the responsible financial stewardship of the nation. But what was the ALP’s response? In the House of Representatives, they voted against the cuts, of course-not only for those on higher incomes but also for those on lower incomes. The Labor Party are supposedly a party that supports lower income earners and only the workers, but they do not want to give them those tax cuts. I think the sheer hypocrisy of the Labor opposition will come home to roost. I think it is very important for the Australian community to know that the myth that the ALP are the workers’ best friend is just that: a myth. The Australian people will see straight through it. Fewer than one in five Australians are members of trade unions. In fact, I think only 17 per cent of the work force is in a union-less than one-fifth of the work force. In the first decade of the 21st century we continue to hear the ALP go on about how it is the party of the worker, but I think those days are gone. They are finished; they are dead and buried. There are more coalition members representing constituents with lower incomes than there are in the ALP. Of course we do have many more members. I do not want to remind the opposition of that too often, but it is important to say that the coalition members are working very hard to earn the MAIN COMMITTEE",192,Appropriation Bill No 2 2005 2006 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2005 2006 Appropriation Bill No 5 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 6 2004 2005

249,Mr Johnson,"I will continue with my speech. Only three per cent of Australians willrespect and the regard of their constituents. In the House of Representatives I think this will show very strongly yet again when the next election is held. The Australian people-and certainly I speak for the people of the Ryan electorate-are only interested in outcomes. They are not interested in outdated, 19th century ideological mindsets. They want outcomes, and our government are delivering them. When was the ALP going to offer its version of tax cuts? In 2008-not even in the life of this parliament. That is absolutely remarkable. We are talking about a budget that was delivered in 2005, a budget that offers tax cuts to the broad spectrum of the Australian community. How does it work that the Labor opposition’s budget reply in 2005 offers tax cuts not in the same year but in a separate parliamentary term? It would be an absolute laughing matter if it were not for the fact that we are talking about policy initiatives from the leader of a major political party, from a man who wants to be Prime Minister of this country, from a man who sets himself up as the alternative Prime Minister. It would be a laughing matter but for the fact that it is so serious an issue. I want to turn my attention to small business, because small business in Ryan is very important to me, to the broader communities in the suburbs of Ryan, to the families of Ryan and of course to those who own and operate small businesses. As I have said, Labor’s tax response proposed to pass its tax cuts not this year but in 2008. Worse than that, Labor are also denying small businesses and small business owners in Ryan the opportunity of receiving the government’s tax cuts. There are some 1.3 million small businesses in Australia, and they are a key to Australia’s strong economic growth. By assisting them to grow, we are going to provide more jobs to the Australian community. The Howard government has been very conscious of the importance of small business in this country, and certainly I am very conscious of that in the Ryan electorate. One of the important measures of this year’s budget was to abolish the three per cent tariff on imported business inputs, a measure which I think adds in excess of $1.3 billion of savings for small business over the next five years. A broad range of business expenses will also be tax deductible and will foster small business growth and profitability. I also want to alert the Ryan electorate to improved access to the simplified tax system. It will provide tax relief to small businesses and is worth some $360 million. As I said, income tax cuts are very significant both at a personal level and also at a business level. I want to conclude by saying that it is very important that the budget measures introduced by the Treasurer in the parliament get passed by this parliament. I want to call on the opposition to pass them very soon. This is a family-friendly budget, a worker-friendly budget, a business-friendly budget, an Australia-friendly budget and a Ryan-friendly budget. The Australian people and the people of Ryan continue to support the Howard government in office because they know that it takes a very strong government to make the strong decisions that will benefit the Australian community, that will benefit the businesses of this country and that will benefit individuals. They took the tough decisions in the 1996 election and in the 1998 election, with the GST reforms and the industrial relations reforms that are about to come through the parliament. I think the Australian people will see through the blatant opportunism that the Labor Party continue to talk about in this parliament. Instead of offering policies, instead of coming up with ideas, instead of coming up with initiatives that will actually improve the lifestyle of Australians, they are only on about blatant politics. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE Ms CORCORAN (Isaacs) (12.31 pm)-The Howard government has failed our society, even by its own liberal values. One of the deepest insights of the classical liberal tradition is that each member of our society is valuable and has potential. I can only paint word pictures for you, but I challenge members of the government to go into the Centrelink offices, the welfare agencies, the homeless centres and the women’s refuges and see for themselves the despair, the frustration and the suffering that some people are going through. Stop your busyness and feel the poverty that is happening right here in this country, a country that should be so good to live in. There is an underclass of poverty-stricken people. There is an underclass suffering from despair. It is growing and has been growing like a noxious weed under this government. The people being ignored or being battered by this government include the unemployed, the underemployed, sole parents, those suffering a disability and people caring for others unable to care for themselves. This government goes from one vulnerable group to the next, stigmatising, denouncing and threatening them. It has been put to me that the government’s actions suggest that it sees these groups of people as valueless and without potential. That person then offered me another thought-that the government deliberately sets up disadvantaged people as a class against which the government defines itself. It has become clear to me over recent years that the government has deliberately tried, and to some extent has succeeded, in setting Australians against Australians, and it is this trend that my constituent is talking about. Today in Australia, on Howard’s watch, it is becoming okay to denigrate those on social security payments, it is becoming okay to denigrate those who come from overseas seeking our protection and help, and it is becoming okay to denigrate those who hold different religious beliefs or even none at all. It is becoming okay to stop caring about our neighbours, both local and global, and just narrow our focus to ourselves. A classic proof of this came the day after the Treasurer’s budget speech. The Daily Telegraph’s headline read ‘Workers 1, shirkers 0: The tax system finally rewards effort and makes the bludgers pay’. The article goes on to talk about workers winning and shirkers feeling the heat. The implication is that anyone on a social security payment is a shirker. This is provocative language and a clear example of whistleblowing-that is, it appeals to those who are already predisposed to think ill of people on welfare and just want an excuse to do so. It encourages the notion that the world is a simple place and consists of people who work hard and those who prefer to lean on others. In this black-and-white world there are no people who have accidents, or, if they do, they have the wherewithal to look after themselves, they recover completely and they return to work without any further problems. In this black-and-white world all marriages or relationships last happily forever or, if they do not, the partners have the grace to continue to live together quietly, providing good care for their kids and not abusing each other. In this blackand-white world no decent people have an alcohol problem or an addiction to illicit or legal drugs. Those that do are seen, firstly, as having wantonly brought their problems on themselves and, secondly, as not worthy of any assistance beyond the recommendation that they pull up their socks and get on with it. These attitudes do not recognise that many people, through no fault of their own, require assistance from time to time and that some people require assistance on a long-term basis. These attitudes do not recognise that, regardless of why MAIN COMMITTEE some people are in need of help, there are often children involved and that we must, regardless of their parents’ actions, have concern for these children and provide adequately for them. This budget is a failure. It fails our society. It is not just and it is not fair. It does not treat the vulnerable as people with potential; rather, it attempts to separate them from others and treats them as a different species. It is my experience, listening to the distressed voices in my electorate, that disabled workers and single parents by and large want to participate in the work force. The trouble is that employers often do not want to employ them. The government’s own track record here is a classic example. The number of people with disabilities who are employed by this government is falling. The government makes a lot of noise about the recent increase in the number of people on disability pensions. The government is trying to suggest that there are a lot of people out there on a pension fraudulently. We hear disparaging comments about all those with bad backs, as though everyone with a bad back is pretending. It is reasonable-in fact, it is desirable-to ask why the numbers of disability pensioners are growing. It is then the government’s job to react properly to the cause, not simply to suggest that those on this support are shirkers or to make life more difficult for them. Those who are on a disability pension fraudulently should be identified and moved off. Those who are genuine should be treated with respect, provided with appropriate assistance to get a job that is consistent with their disability and provided with the assistance they need to live a decent life. Appropriate assistance includes recognising that some people cannot go to work every day, that sometimes they are well and capable and other times their illness means that they cannot work. Appropriate assistance means recognising that some people need assistance in the workplace-physical assistance or assistance that allows them to work at a different pace to others without fear of discrimination. Research suggests that there are several reasons why the numbers of those on disability pensions have increased. One reason is that the population is ageing and that older people are more likely to have disabilities. For example, men who have worked in a physical job all their lives often eventually sustain physical long-term injuries. A number of other social security pensions have been stopped. For instance, the age for which the pension is available to women is increasing to eventually reach 65 years of age. It is likely that in the past women aged between 60 and 65, unable to work because of a disability, went on to the aged pension. Many of these women are no longer able to do that because of the change in the age rules and so move on to the disability pension. Another reason cited by the research is that we are getting better at looking after people who sustain big injuries from accidents. More people are surviving and they need support through the disability support pension. These people should not be the subject of slurs by the government or by the community. They deserve appropriate support and respect. A constituent of mine has told me of the frustrations she is going through trying to get into the work force. Maree has been out of the work force for some time. She was her husband’s carer but they have now separated. Maree needs retraining and her confidence restored. She has had her name down for a place on the personal support program for many months and is despairing of ever getting onto this program. Maree spoke to me before this budget was brought down and said she was worried about having her single parent payments cut. She has one son. Her former husband is a pensioner, so there is not a lot of capacity for financial supMAIN COMMITTEE port from that source. Maree wants to get her drivers licence and to buy a car so that she can improve the range of jobs she can apply for. She cannot do this in the face of a threat of reducing income. If the mooted changes to the disability support pension and the parenting payments are made, those who are currently on these payments will be treated under one set of conditions while those who apply from 11 May for the DSP will be on another set of conditions and those who apply from 1 July 2006 will be on yet another set of conditions again. We are going to end up with groups of people who are operating under similar circumstances being treated very differently. This is going to be an administrative nightmare and, more to the point, it is very unfair to the recipients. The tax cuts proposed in this budget have been described as a welcome and overdue acknowledgment of the tax break hard working middle Australians deserve. I am not sure what middle Australia means in this context, but let us assume it means those on average incomes or in middle tax brackets. If the government was serious about rewarding hard working middle-income Australians, it could have designed a far better tax system than the one proposed. The proposed changes are: a reduction of two points in the 17 per cent marginal tax rate, down to 15 per cent; an increase in the threshold level for the 42 per cent margin rate-from $58,000 to $63,000 this year, with another move to $70,000 next year; and an increase in the highest marginal rate-from $70,000 to $95,000 this year and then on to $125,000 next year. This is on top of the tax break introduced last year for those on $50,000 a year or more. It is also on top of the complete abolition of the superannuation surcharge tax for those on high incomes, from this year. What all this means is that those on $50,000 per year or more had a tax cut last year, they will get one this year and they will get another one next year. Those on incomes below $50,000 will get one tax cut. The tax cuts are roughly as follows: there will be $18 per week for those on $20,000 or less; there will be $6 a week for those under $50,000; and those on $100,000 per year can look forward to $40 a week this year, moving to about $63 per week next year. That again is before we start considering the changes to the superannuation surcharge. Some people think it is okay for those earning more to get bigger tax breaks than those earning less. The argument usually runs along the following lines: those on higher incomes pay more tax in dollar terms in the first place, therefore of course they are going to get bigger tax cuts in dollar terms than those on smaller incomes. I have done an analysis of the proposed tax cuts to test this argument and I have come up with some interesting results. Firstly, as I noted earlier, those on higher incomes are getting a bigger tax cut in dollar terms than those on smaller incomes. Secondly, those on higher incomes are in many instances getting a bigger tax cut than those on smaller incomes in percentage terms as well. The tax cuts in percentage terms over the next two years, to 2006-07, are 13.1 per cent for those on an income of $20,000, six per cent for those on an income of $30,000, 3.8 per cent for those on an income of $40,000 and 2.8 per cent for those on an income of $50,000. So far, so good-the percentage tax cuts are moving in the direction you would expect and in the direction the government has said. However, from here on in the story changes. The tax cuts in percentage terms over the next two years, 2006-07, are 3.8 per cent for those on an income of $60,000, 9.4 per cent for those on an income of $70,000, 9.7 per cent for those on $80,000, 9.8 per cent for those on MAIN COMMITTEE $90,000, 9.9 per cent for those on $100,000 per year and 10.1 per cent for those with incomes of $120,000 per year. We have to move on to those on an income of $150,000 a year before the tax cuts in percentage terms start to fall again-down to eight per cent. I did not take my analysis any further than these income levels. Even so, it is a bit rich to say that someone on $150,000 can have a tax cut of eight per cent or $86 per week, while those on a third of that income, $50,000, get a tax cut of $6 per week or 2.8 per cent. Again, do not forget that the person on $150,000 also gets a tax cut, as the superannuation surcharge is abolished. The alternative plan put forward by Labor is much better. It proposes that from 1 January 2006 there should be a rise in the threshold where the 30c tax rate cuts in-from $21,600 to $26,400-and a welfare to work bonus that will provide an effective $10,000 tax-free threshold for people earning up to $20,000 per year. These would be followed by further tax cuts from 1 July 2006, which would raise the threshold where the 42c rate cuts in from $63,000 to $67,000 and would raise the threshold where the 47c rate cuts in from $80,000 to $100,000. These changes to the tax system will give a $12 per week tax cut for those earning from $25,000 to $70,000-double what the Liberal Party is proposing. They will give the same tax cuts as the government proposes to those earning from $70,000 up to $105,000. The changes will give a tax cut of $40 per week to those who earn $105,000, which is one-third less than the government is proposing and a much fairer outcome across the range. It is interesting to note that the Treasurer has not responded at all to this alternative proposal. He had the details of Labor’s tax policy for some hours before he was required to come back into the House and sum up the tax debate. He did not offer any comment or attempt to discuss the merits or otherwise of our policy. The government promised, in the lead-up to the 2001 election, that it would keep private health insurance affordable. It is a pity that it did not define ‘affordable’. Clearly, this promise is in the same ironclad, never-to-be-broken category as the Medicare safety net promise. I say this because private health insurance has increased by 33 per cent since 2001. This is hardly an affordable rise. This year, the government approved and announced an increase of 7.96 per cent in health insurance premiums. Many of my constituents, however, ended up with a rise of around 15 per cent. One gentleman who rang me was very upset. He joined private health insurance a few years ago. He was not sure he could afford it, but bowed to the pressure. The big push was on. But this latest rise is just too much for him and he is now going to get out. This means he will join many other Australians who are leaving private health insurance. The seniors health insurance rebate was meant to make the private health insurance industry more sustainable, but it is not working. The latest figures show that, so far this year, while 54,000 people over the age of 55 joined private health insurance, 21,000 people under the age of 55 got out. This leaves a lopsided private health insurance industry paying out record amounts in benefits, which is hardly a sustainable trend. Private health insurance is not affordable for many Australians and the latest move to prop up the industry is not working. Clearly there is a lot more work that needs to be done in this area. Child care, or at least the lack of child-care places, is a continuing theme with my constituents. This budget will do nothing to help them; in fact, it may make matters worse. This MAIN COMMITTEE budget does not attempt to match child-care places with need in either long day care or before and after school hours care. The government is intent on forcing parents out to work but has made no provision for the extra child care that this will demand. There is a total of 87,000 new before and after school hours care places in this budget, and this is welcomed. We know from ABS data-the office of the Minister for Family and Community Services does not keep this data-that there is an existing shortfall of around 174,500 places in Australia. We know, because the Treasurer has told us, that he wants 190,000 parents back in the work force. We do not know, however, how the extra child-care places needed to cope with 190,000 parents going back to work, plus the existing shortfall of 174,500 places, are going to be managed with the allocation of only 87,000 new places. Those figures are for before or after school hours care. There is nothing positive in this budget for long day care. There is a negative, however, which is very hard to understand. In the face of all the noise that the Treasurer is making about getting people back to work, he quietly cuts funding for child care to parents on low incomes whilst they undergo training or look for work. The JET scheme is now only available to parents who can do their training within 12 months. If you are interested in doing any training that takes more than 12 months, this scheme, which is aimed at low-income parents, is suddenly not available. Industry has, for some time now, been talking about a shortage of workers with the skills needed by industry. The Reserve Bank, last March, talked about this shortage too, as well as problems with our infrastructure. These two factors were the reasons given by the Reserve Bank to justify its decision to raise interest rates by 25 basis points at that time. The Reserve Bank was concerned that skills shortages would put pressure on wage costs and, therefore, inflation. Despite the fact that skills shortages have been talked about for years, this government has done nothing-worse, it has actually reduced capacity to improve the situation. Since 1998, over 270,000 Australians have been turned away from TAFE. We see that 40 per cent of our apprentices do not complete their apprenticeships. This is clearly unsustainable and needs to be addressed. Labor has announced a completion bonus to encourage apprentices to finish their training. This bonus would be in the form of $1,000 midway through the training, and another $1,000 once the training is complete. This money would be tax free. It is estimated that, should this policy be adopted, it would put another 8,000 trained apprentices into the market every year. We cannot afford to ignore the need for skilled workers. We must train up our own people, who are looking for training and ready to learn, rather than trying to rely on importing skilled migrants. In summary, this budget introduces a new tax schedule which is clearly unfair. It threatens the well-being of many households by moving parents off parenting payments and onto a lower social security payment. It threatens the well-being of many disabled people by threatening their incomes. It does nothing to address the training needs and child-care shortages which exist now and are becoming more acute. This budget is clearly a disgrace. appropriation bills. I am also proud to be a member of this government, delivering real outcomes for the people of Australia. One area that is of concern to me and that calls for greater attention by all governments is that of mental health. The provision of mental health services is one of the foundational issues of any well-governed nation. I am therefore glad to see in our 2005-06 budget that mental health remains one of this government’s health priorities.

250,Mrs Vale (Hughes) (12.50 Pm),"I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak on thebudget reaffirms the Howard government’s election commitment on mental health, with both the continuation of the better outcomes in mental health initiative, at cost of $102.2 million over four years from 2005-06, and new funding of $151.2 million over five years, from 200405, for three priority areas. The priority areas are $69 million for youth mental health, $39.6 million for the national depression initiative and $42.6 million for the expansion of the better outcomes in mental health program. The states have the constitutional responsibility for the provision of mental health services. AlthoughI understand that the Commonwealth takes the lead role in developing the National Mental Health Strategy, it does not provide any day-to-day direct services itself, but it does provide about 65 per cent of the total funds dedicated to mental health in Australia. This high proportion of funding suggests to me that the states are not pulling their weight in the provision of services to the mentally ill. In fact, while the Australian government has increased its contribution to mental health services by 73 per cent per capita, the increase by the states has only been 19.8 per cent. Regrettably, the worse offenders have been the largest states: New South Wales and Victoria. I understand that only about 10 per cent of the money that states have saved from the deinstitutionalisation over the last two decades, following the Richmond report, has been reinvested in services for the mentally ill. What a confidence trick this has been by the states and territories against Australian families: closing down residential care centres for the mentally ill, abandoning the sick to an unprepared community and then pocketing the money saved to curry political favour elsewhere. The whole rationale for closing down mental health institutions-indeed the promise-was to build community care to the point where the acute mentally ill would be better treated. Regrettably, the states have done nothing short of sabotaging government infrastructure and services for the mentally ill. But there is good news in this 2005 federal budget for improving mental health services and I welcome it. In so doing, I would like to address the issue often drawn to my attention by close family members of people with acute mental illness who, in their distress and anxiety, cry out for the provision of accessible and quality residential care for their loved ones. These caring Australians usually have a son or a daughter, a brother or a sister, who simply cannot look after themselves and who are beyond the sustainable care their families are able to give them. I would also point out that, sadly, there are some children-some under the age of 18who care for their barely functional mentally ill parents. These children are, in fact, the primary caregivers. In questioning the policy of deinstitutionalisation of care for the acute mentally ill, I may offend many mental health experts, but it is the people trapped at the coalface who I believe need to be heard. They never have had and still do not have any effective voice in the formation of mental health policy. In speaking to the legislation, I want to address a foundational policy upon which the National Mental Health Strategy has been constructed. I want to question the policy and the wisdom of experts that have focused only upon deinstitutionalised care for the acute mentally ill. I know that back in the fifties and the sixties in the area of institutionalised care there where human rights and other abuses in such institutions. There was a passive attitude towards rehabilitation programs, there was not nearly enough supervision and many people were just admitted to the institutions and, shamelessly, quickly forgotten. They were out of sight and out of mind. The situation then was a disgrace and there was an unquestioned need for reform. MAIN COMMITTEE Over the next two decades state governments of both sides of politics, acting on the advice of health professionals, principally through the Richmond and then the Burdekin reports, decided to close down residential care centres promising a bright new world of future community care. These were well intentioned policies. Sadly, the residential care centres were gradually closed but resources for community care have not lived up to their promise. The closure of residential care centres often forced people to go back to the inadequacies of the community. As a result, many found their way onto the streets and became almost permanently homeless. Many families had their lives disrupted by the closures as they struggled to adequately care for their acutely mentally ill loved ones. This had a domino effect, with many members of the caring family collapsing themselves in the attempt to support the relative they loved. Today they remain unrecorded statistics of suffering and a badly thought-through policy. The discovery of psychotropic drugs was a big help when turning people out of residential care, but even this wonderful medication still has serious and real limitations for many. Rarely does someone with a high profile who speaks out with authority, questioning the policy of deinstitutionalisation, come along. But this was the case when Professor Allan Fels, the former Chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, courageously spoke out about a member of his own family, his beloved daughter, who suffered from schizophrenia. I quote from the Sunday Herald Sun of 31 August 2003. In an article in the Medical Journal of Australia Professor Fels said: Moving those with the illnessthat is, schizophreniaout of the institutions and into the community had resulted in a reduced government-funded support structure and a greater burden on families. He said about his daughter: An attempt by Isobella to live away from home with others, in a house with mental health workers present from 9am to 5pm on weekdays, did not work. He goes on: She has under-developed living skill and her illness is such that she could not live by herself. She basically depends upon family care. A few days later, on 11 August in the Australian, Professor Fels was quoted as saying: We should be very wary of deinstitutionalisation in the light of the mental health experience, where there is inadequate resourcing of community care. For some people with a disability, a communal arrangement is better. There should be a choice rather than a single policy of deinstitutionalisation. Will the experts please note that he said, ‘There should be a choice rather than a single policy of deinstitutionalisation.’ The editorial in the Sydney Morning Herald of Monday, 30 May 2005 commented on the New South Wales Auditor-General’s report on emergency services. It said that, if an acute mentally ill bed is needed, the wait is ‘longer than for other medical patients’. It continues: Some have to be transferred long distances to be admitted, hardly helping their recovery. Others are treated in emergency departments, with all the attendant disruption and misdirection of resources that that involves. Others still-about 9 per cent-never even get that far. They just get sick of waiting and simply leave. What happens to them? It is no idle question. The Cornelia Rau case shows the dire consequences which can follow the community’s neglect of the mentally ill. MAIN COMMITTEE That says more about our mental health policy than it does about our immigration policy. I want to say at this point that it is not only hospital emergency departments and immigration officials that have to deal with people similar to Ms Rau who are suffering an illness. Often it is the police who have to put their lives on the line when the acute mentally ill have armed themselves or are otherwise threatening violence. Police officers’ lives and careers can be traumatically affected by the consequences of a decision that they must make in a split second. As well as police, prison officers are affected. For many disturbed people, our jails have replaced the closed mental residential care centres. This is in part the effect of reducing over a period of several decades the number of acute care beds to 10 per cent of their former establishment. The editorial goes on: More mentally ill patients are turning up to emergency departments now than ever before, they are sicker, and more of them have to be admitted to hospital. The 24,000 patients admitted to acute care beds in 2003-04 represented an increase of 11 per cent over the previous three years. Unfortunately, the mental health professional establishment and the National Mental Health Strategy are bent on reducing what is left of institutional care. They are dismissive of it as the old service model of beds and buildings. I do not wish to be unfriendly towards the professionals, because I do acknowledge their expertise and their genuine commitment, but it has to be said that in my observation and in the opinion of many carers they are obsessed with a 1960s antipathy towards institutional care for the acute mentally ill. In a submission to the Senate this year the Mental Health Council of Australia said this about the achievements of the National Mental Health Strategy: the number of stand alone psychiatric beds has decreased by 60% since 1993. So, according to the mental health professionals, the first ‘achievement’ of the Mental Health Strategy has been to reduce the number of stand-alone psychiatric beds in Australia. Instead of the 60 per cent decrease in stand-alone psychiatric beds being trumpeted as an achievement, there should have been a doubling of the number. The Mental Health Council went on to say: Reduced reliance on stand alone psychiatric hospitals was the major policy driver for the first National Mental Health Strategy. They apparently believe that it has been successful because ‘dedicated, stand-alone mental institutions are regarded as a last-case resort’. However, on behalf of the carers in my electorate and in the general community, let me tell the chamber that dedicated, stand-alone mental institutions are not the last resort for the acutely mentally ill; to date, they are the only humane solution for those who suffer an acute mental illness. The Mental Health Council then goes on to sayMs HallMr Deputy Speaker, I seek to intervene. a question? Ms Hall-All right. We might have a talk later, because I am interested. ... while the institutions themselves have closed, institutionalisation of people with a mental illness has in fact been transferred to prison and detention systems or replaced with isolation within the community, for example through homelessness.

253,Mrs Vale,"I am happy to do that. The Mental Health Council then went on to say:If you shut down the institutions, what else can you expect? However, the closure of more residential institutional care centres is being proposed by the received wisdom of the mental health professionals. In response to the non-existent services in some parts of rural Australia, they are proposing that existing funding for acute care beds be distributed in accordance with population densities and to address unmet needs in rural and growth areas. It should be noted that it is the existing funding for acute care beds that is proposed to be redistributed, not an increase in funding for acute care beds in rural and new areas. They want to reduce the number of beds in existing residential care centres. With all due respect, may I say that, in light of the demand, this is a crazy proposal. From what I can gather, the problem seems to be that mental health professionals, as I have said before, are obsessed with the possible abuse of human rights in mental health care facilities if residential care centres are restored. I believe that in today’s world there is a defeatist attitude of the highest order. I believe that we can have quality mental health residential care centres that are humane and are without the human rights abuses that occurred in some cases in the past. I believe that the successful residential care centres that can be observed in the aged care sector provide an excellent model that could be followed in caring for the acutely mentally ill. It is not rocket science. Despite the cut and thrust of politics, the standard of aged care has improved significantly in our country in recent years. Senior citizens who reside in aged care hostels are residents in their own right. Some are owners of their hostel units. They are not cooped up in a house with five others; they have room to move. They can remain in company if they wish or go off to some other parts of their modern facility or its maintained gardens if they wish to be alone. They have available for their use dedicated recreational facilities and programs. Because of the larger numbers, there is a better staff-to-resident ratio, with consequent better services and resourcing opportunities. They are residents; they are not inmates. AlthoughI have had some hard things to say about the views that have come through the Mental Health Council of Australia, to their credit they argue for about $1 billion per year over the next 10 years to be put into primary and secondary community care, together with the matching of any increases from the states. They highlight the problem and they are about boosting community care in order to reduce the pressure on facilities for the acutely mentally ill. I do not know whether the $1 billion-plus per year level of expenditure is sustainable into the future, but my plea is: do not do it by further reducing and badmouthing residential care facilities for the acutely mentally ill. Learn from the mistakes of the past. Acknowledge the inhumanity that was and still is being inflicted on the vulnerable and powerless because of deinstitutionalisation. Do not shoot, by closing more doors, the acutely mentally ill messenger, who desperately needs more appropriate care. Do not thrust the acutely mentally ill onto their unresourced families and say, in effect, ‘This is your problem. Here’s a form to apply for a couple of dollars.’ My concern is that the problem of mental illness has now grown and will grow further, to the point where it is beyond the financial resources that are needed and will be needed on a sustained basis. We have to address the mental health problem before the primary stage. The deluge of mental illness has got to this stage because we have been in denial about the things MAIN COMMITTEE that can contribute to mental illness. As a community we have done what is easy and convenient. The mentally ill have always been with us but their number has soared in recent decades. We have to have a close look at prevention. Family breakdown is known to facilitate great distress and contribute to depression amongst the young. It may release one or both parents to get on with a new life, but for some children it has a lingering and traumatic effect. Many blame themselves for the family breakdown and suffer emotionally for the rest of their lives. In some cases, family breakdown leaves a trail of many traumas, including child sexual abuse, youth homelessness and suicide. Research has shown that this is a major cause of mental illness. An increasing number of people are suffering dysfunctional and sometimes fatal psychotic disorders as a result of smoking cannabis and using other banned substances. Harm minimisation drug strategies over the eighties and nineties tended, if not to glorify, then to present an image of toleration of illicit drugs, and the legalisation of cannabis for personal use in some states has been a mental health disaster. We now know that substance abuse is a significant cause of youth mental illness. It is only now, with the greater availability of abortion, that its emotional consequences are beginning to surface. The evidence is now beginning to mount about post-abortion trauma that contributes to severe depression in some women. Of course, there are many other important causes of mental illness and depression, but these are just some that have come to mind. In an article in the Age dated 11 April 2004, Professor Allan Fels said, when speaking of his daughter: Unlike many, Isabella has a family that both cares and is in the privileged position of being able to afford to buy better care. Those without such family or financial support are abandoned by a system that doesn’t respond or doesn’t care. He went on to conclude: Although we have had national mental health reform for more than a decade, the experience of the mentally ill and their families is of little genuine progress. As a community, our future health and welfare may well depend on our capacity to respond to the challenges of mental health and well-being. Our present approach of leaving families to cope, largely unseen and largely through their own devices, reflects poorly on our nation. Robbing Peter-in this case, residential care centres-to underpay Paul-in this case, community based care-is not the answer. Blaming institutional care for the mental health delivery problem is just plain wrong. We need to finetune the Richmond and Burdekin strategies in the light of several decades of experience of only doing half of what they recommended and recognise the importance of adequate and good residential care models for the acutely mentally ill while at the same time building better community care. We could effectively adopt the current aged care hostel model for residential care and make it available to the acutely mentally ill. Finally, we could look at broader policies in the community that will help us avoid the consequences of mental illness. I commend this bill to the House. has decided to move back from the digital age.

254,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari) (1.08 Pm),"Let me just make the observation that this chambermittee. partments) Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006 and other appropriation bills. During the Treasurer’s budget speech, he announced new tax thresholds to take effect from 1 July 2005. I am not going to go over what those thresholds are. But what I think is worth talking about is the view that we have adopted in the Labor Party, which is that we believe that the tax cut proposals from the government are unfair. We are not arguing that there should not be tax cuts-let me make that very clear. What we are saying is that, for the majority of the Australian work force, the tax cuts are minuscule. If a person earns less than $55,000 a year, the maximum tax cut they will receive under the government’s proposals will be $6 a week. If they happen to be on $15,000 a year, it is only $3.50. Many people in that tax bracket probably will not pay tax, but the bottom line is that what we have here is a structure that distorts the needs of the Australian community. In my own electorate of Lingiari, 80 per cent of wage and salary earners earn less than $1,000 a week. This means that 80 per cent of those people will receive a maximum tax cut of six bucks a week-enough money to buy a sandwich and a milkshake. As one of my colleagues said yesterday, it is hardly enough to get you a pie and a beer if you are down at the footy at the McG. I know that, in the case of Traeger Park, you would not do any better. Traeger Park is the main oval in Alice Springs, where there is a very good football competition. At the other end of the salary scale, wage earners who earn $1,500 a week or more will benefit by at least $27 a week. If they happen to be members of parliament, who earn in excess of $100,000 a year, they will receive a huge tax cut around $45 or $50 a week. I do not believe that is either fair or reasonable. In the Lingiari electorate, approximately four per cent of wage and salary earners will earn $1,500 a week or more. We note that other electorates are more fortunate. While only four per cent of workers in my electorate will benefit by the tax cut of $27 a week or more, 10 per cent of people in the Prime Minister’s own electorate will get that benefit. In my budget reply last year, I spoke about the electorate of North Sydney. I mentioned that 90 per cent of Lingiari individual tax payers missed out on tax cuts. In North Sydney the figure was 65 per cent. That was the case last year. This year, I notice that, in the North Sydney seat of the minister responsible for human services, 20 per cent of wage and salary earners earn more than $1,500 a week and will benefit substantially from the tax cuts. This is not saying that we do not have a progressive tax system. It is saying that those who most need the maximum tax break are low-income earners on less than $55,000 a year. It seems to me that it is only fair and reasonable that we, as a community, examine what our priorities ought to be. Should our priority be to give an extra 40 or 50 bucks to members of parliament or should it be to give a better deal to those people and families who earn less than $55,000 a year? I know what I think should happen. I would be happy, in my own case, to have this situation reversed. That is why the Labor Party has introduced an alternative proposal to double the size of the tax cuts for those earning under $55,000 a year and taper the MAIN COMMITTEE",205,Appropriation Bill No 2 2005 2006 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2005 2006 Appropriation Bill No 5 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 6 2004 2005

257,Mr Snowdon,"Except in here. We are discussing Appropriation (Parliamentary Detax cuts at the upper level so they are not as gross for those people who earn maximum incomes. It seems to me that, despite the rhetoric that comes from the government from time to time, that is an entirely appropriate course of action. It will say to the Australian community that, while we know the government is going to give us this tax cut of six bucks a week, and while we know this will happen after 1 July, no matter what the opposition does in the parliament, we appreciate the intent of the Labor Party to ensure that we get a better benefit than that which is being proposed by the government. You know the electorate of Lingiari, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley. You have been through it; certainly you have been to the north-west of Western Australia any number of times. You would recognise the disproportionate costs that people in these areas bear in terms of living. They pay for their remoteness; they pay for it very materially in the higher cost of food and the higher cost of fuel. These sorts of things are what we regard as everyday needs. Six bucks in that environment does not go very far. In most instances, while it will provide welcome additional income to most families, it will not be sufficient to shift the burden that has been placed upon them by a series of government decisions over the last little while-for example, increasing the cost of private health insurance and increasing house mortgages. Quickly this $6 will be eaten up. That is why we in the Labor Party say we should double that. The government should adopt our proposition of doing these tax cuts differently, giving a greater deal, a better deal, to those people on low incomes, with us at the top end of the income bracket saying, ‘Well, that’s not unreasonable; that’s a good thing to do.’ We understand that families are struggling and we could hardly say we suffer from the same pressure on our family budgets-even though, in my case, we have a huge number of kids. There are families with an equivalent number of children who earn $55,000 a year or less. I think it is a bloody disgrace, frankly, that we should be countenancing pocketing our 40 or 50 bucks and giving these poor Australians $6 a week. I have spoken in the past in this place about the cost of living in remote communities, but-leaving aside our differences over the tax issue-this budget shows me that this government has no comprehension whatsoever of the needs of regional Australia, particularly remote Australia. It has no understanding-that would be the polite way of putting it-at all of the costs and needs of those communities. I have spoken in this place before about the plight of roads in the bush. Once again, the budget has let us down. The government talks about the need for infrastructure expenditure, but, once again, it has not addressed the infrastructure needs of Northern Australia. There are between 8,000 and 9,000 kilometres of unincorporated roads in the Northern Territory alone. These are largely used by the beef industry, the mining industry, the tourism industry and small communities. It is a severe cost to business and to those community members to travel on those roads. With great respect to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I notice we have in the chamber two members of the National Party, you and one of your colleagues. You understand, I am certain, the cost of transporting beef in road trains over large distances on bad dirt roads. Who bears that cost? Ultimately, the consumer, but directly bearing the cost in the first instance are the road transport industry and the beef producers. I would have thought that, in the context of making MAIN COMMITTEE our industries more efficient, it would not be beyond the wit and wisdom of this government to recognise that, if you want to increase productivity and efficiency in the bush-the real bush; not up and down here on the east coast-you should address those infrastructure shortfalls. But do we get that from the government? No way. Instead we get a very distorted allocation of resources through the Roads to Recovery program. Where does that money go? Of course, in the pockets of National Party seats-and principally that of the member for Gwydir, I might say. In my communities we know the costs that are involved in not addressing this issue. A range of issues confront people who live in the bush, like roads and communication. The government is still going to sell Telstra. You chaps in the National Party understand-you particularly, my friend, Member for Hinkler-the telecommunication needs of people in the bush. In my communities people are underserviced and underresourced. That is not because Telstra Country Wide are not doing their job. In fact, I have nothing but the highest of praise for the Telstra Country Wide people who work in the Northern Territory. But they are subject to budget decisions made by a board. The majority of the decision-making power rests with the government, as the majority shareholder. The board has made decisions which will ensure that there will be no catch-up. Despite the protestations of the government, blind Freddy knows what future-proofing means: ‘We’ll give you a set of standards which we think will work at the time, even though we know you’re behind the eight ball already. You’ll never get to catch up and you’ll never get an equivalent standard of service to people who live in the major metropolitan regions.’ That is what will happen. So we get a major communications disadvantage for people who live in the bush. That is not something which I think is acceptable, and I know it is not acceptable to the people of Lingiari. We deserve and we want something better from this government. The people of Lingiari are the poorest of Australians. However, there are pockets of wealth in Lingiari. There is a large mining operation in Groote Eylandt, and there is wealth at Nhulunbuy and Ranger. There is a lot of wealth being developed, and a lot of taxes are being paid to the government, like company tax. There are a lot of export earnings coming into the Australian community. But we are not getting investment back in those communities or in that region by this government. It is about time we actually got a fair shake. The bulk of the population who live in this community, 44 per cent or thereabouts of the voters in my communities, are Indigenous. They are at the very bottom end of the income scale. They live mostly in abject poverty. I will address this at another time. They are not regarded as being important enough to get the finances that are required to address their poverty needs. We heard the Prime Minister down at the reconciliation conference talking about how he wants to address Aboriginal disadvantage, Indigenous disadvantage, in this country, to meet Indigenous Australians halfway. He could start by addressing the major indicators of poverty. He could start by addressing the $800 million shortfall in Aboriginal housing in the Northern Territory alone, where communities have 17 and 20 people living per house. He goes on about the need for education. As I have said in this place on many occasions, you have to address the health of the whole person and the whole community. That means looking at all those indicators: health, housing, education, primary health care and environmental health. MAIN COMMITTEE All of these things cost money. We are seeing no benchmarking by this government of what it is proposing to introduce to these communities to ensure they get out of this poverty. We get a lot of platitudes and a lot of mutual responsibility, but no acceptance by the government of its responsibility to provide these Indigenous Australians with the rights that every other Australian would regard as fundamental to their living. These are rights which they should have, human rights, rights which are accorded to them by conventions which we are signatory to-a right to education, a right to housing, a right to employment opportunities-fundamental human rights which this government has failed to properly address. Instead, it talks about penalising people. It is about time we got rid of the penalties and started accepting our responsibilities as a nation to address their most vital needs. In the few moments I have left, I want to remind the House that, of course, there is an election about to happen in the Northern Territory, on 18 June. The election will involve the Country Liberal Party, a conservative party which has two members sitting in this place, one with the National Party and one with the Liberal Party, I understand. They cannot make up their minds who they are. But we know they are not a Territory party. not sit with either of them, would they? They might vote with them, but they would not sit with them. But they do. Their comrades-confreres, I might describe them as-in the Northern Territory are seeking election on 18 June, having left office in 2001 after being defeated by the Labor Party. I have to say: that was a great moment in time, one of those moments of history. I was asked to be one of the experts sitting on the ABC panel on the night of the election. We saw those results coming in. I was with Kerry O’Brien, Antony Green and Barry Coulter-who, I am sure some of you will know, was formerly the Deputy Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. Barry was sitting alongside me, Kerry O’Brien was sitting over here and Antony Green was sitting over there. Within 20 minutes, I had the biggest smile. Within 20 minutes of the numbers coming in, I was able to say, ‘I think we’re going to win this. We’ve got these six seats; it will be a Labor victory.’ You should have seen their faces. Do you know why there was a Labor victory? Because the CLP had done a bad job. The CLP then left the Northern Territory with a budget black hole of $127 million, which it did not disclose to the Northern Territory community prior to the election. It is a very different kettle of fish now because the current Northern Territory government is providing a capacity for the government to adhere to a fiscal strategy, to sit in budget 2005, which will ensure that its budget is balanced by 2008-09. The Northern Territory government will make its commitments available to Treasury to be assessed to ensure they will meet that objective. It is inviting the CLP to do the same thing, to have a bit of transparency before polling day to show what the true costs of their promises will be to the Northern Territory community in terms of their budget. We know from past performance what the likely outcome of that will be: there will be no cooperation. They hate transparency and they want to try and hide from the Northern Territory community. I am sure that the Labor Party will be returned and that the CLP will not be returned. I would hazard a guess that that is going to create all sorts of havoc.

They do not represent the interests of the Northern Territory if they are doing that. If they masquerade as the CLP, they should be sitting as the CLP in Canberra and not sitting with either of you guys. (Time expired) Sitting suspended from 1.29 pm to 4.03 pm 2005-2006 and the cognate appropriation bills. In doing so, I would like to compliment the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Brendan Nelson, on some of the advancements and general improvements to be found in this budget. As the member for Kalgoorlie, I remind members that the electorate of Kalgoorlie takes up 91 per cent of the Western Australian landmass and by definition, therefore, it has a most sparsely distributed population. There are some 250 communities, approximately, spread across that 2.3 million square kilometres. When I speak in this place, I speak for genuine regional Australia. Any improvement in the education budget that reflects opportunity for regional and remote Australia is of interest to me, because it is of interest to my constituents. In the 2005-06 budget, the Australian government provides an estimated $28.4 million under the Country Areas Program which will benefit Australian schools and students in rural and remote communities. This is good news. It represents an estimated increase of $6.6 million, or 24 per cent over the previous year, to government and non-government education authorities. Of this $28.4 million, an estimated $23.9 million will be provided to state government schools and an estimated $4.5 million will be provided to Catholic and independent schools. The Australian government recognises that students attending primary and secondary schools in geographically isolated areas often have a more limited access to educational opportunities than do metropolitan students. Isn’t that nice? The Australian government funds for CAP are provided to state and Northern Territory government and non-government schools. The funds are used to support projects which enhance the curriculum through excursions, visits, and attendance at cultural and sporting events; to assist with the transition to further education, training or work; and to provide access to professional development for teachers. In addition to those changes, from 2005 the Australian government has significantly increased assistance under the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme, the AIC. That scheme helps the families of primary and secondary students and tertiary students who are under 16 years old who are unable to attend an appropriate government school on a daily basis primarily because of geographic isolation. The basic boarding allowance and the distance education allowance both received a significant boost from 1 January 2005. The basic boarding allowance increased from $4,446 to $6,000 per year from 1 January 2005 and will help around 7,500 students who have no choice other than to board away from home at a school, hostel or private home. This results in an estimated increase in funding of over $39.6 million over the four years to 2008-09. The distance education allowance increased to $3,000 per year for students who study at home through distance education. The increase-some $1,759 for a primary school student and $1,140 for a secondary student in 2005-reflects the increased cost of new computer technology and communications infrastructure required by students. This results in an estimated increase in funding of $21.3 million over the four years to 2008-09.

260,Mr Haase (Kalgoorlie) (4.03 Pm),"TodayI am speaking to Appropriation Bill (No. 1)The second-home allowance and the additional boarding allowance increased by the CPI from the beginning of 2005. Also, from 1 July 2005, the Australian government will extend eligibility for youth allowance, Austudy and Abstudy payments to eligible full-time new apprentices, who will be able to apply for the same payments currently available to full-time students. This will assist them in the early years of their new apprenticeship, when their wages are generally at their lowest. But my main concern today is not the wonderful increases to government funding for rural and remote education, increases which are seriously and greatly appreciated; it is to highlight the fact that inequities still apply. I have a great concern in particular with the inequities that exist in the allocation of and entitlement to youth allowance. WhatI will endeavour to do today is to point out the contrast between a rural based family having a child who is of tertiary education age and about to leave secondary college, and a city family in exactly the same situation. My proposition is that the rural family, by the nature of their employment, happen to earn more than the allowable ceiling. To start with, the allowable ceiling is $28,850 per annum for the earnings of a family, if they are going to be entitled to the full entitlement of youth allowance for their son or daughter attending a tertiary institution away from their home. The Youth Allowance program is primarily designed to support young people, but it ought to include country families whose means may be above the current threshold but whose income is not sufficient to enable them to rent or buy a metropolitan unit for their children to attend university. By making youth allowance available to this demographic, not only will the additional costs traditionally shouldered by country students be alleviated but a greater equity in access to educational opportunities will also be achieved. I commonly hear from families of country students who have no choice but to meet practically all of the costs of independent living for their child, while city families merely hand over a few bus or train fares. If the high level of parental support is not available, accessing youth allowance for a regional student will entail at least a year of full-time work so that he or she can be classed as independent. Compare this to city students, who have the option of going straight to university, comfortable in the knowledge that they can live with their parents for as long as required or desired-or, possibly, permitted. In terms of access to youth allowance, the parameters of independence represent an anomaly. Students from the city can be classified as independent when in fact it is regardless of whether they live at home or not; whereas, a student from the country has to leave home to study. If they have not taken a gap year to earn eligibility for independence, they do not qualify for youth allowance. This means that a city student can be eligible for youth allowance whilst living at home, whereas a country student has no such luxury. Compounding this inequity is the fact that these payments can be spent on socialising-and are very often spent on socialising-and mere discretionary expenditure. By comparison, country students living in the city have to make ends meet and almost always have a part-time job to cover extra living expenses that youth allowance does not cover. The amount for independence must be earned in 18 months. Therefore, the student does not receive payments until halfway through the first year of study. They must rely on their parents’ income or part-time work to cover their living costs in the first five months, a difficult task when studying full time, with some of the biggest expenses, such as books and general MAIN COMMITTEE setting-up fees, presenting themselves during the first semester. A student can easily be left having no means by which to pay for them. Further, as most university courses cannot be deferred for more than a year, if a student needs youth allowance while studying, and is not eligible due to his or her family’s means, they cannot participate in programs like Rotary Exchange, or even take that gap year off to travel, because there is a need to spend a year and a half earning the money to shore up their ability to pursue tertiary education. I note that there is assistance available to children under 16 under the Isolated Children scheme, as I have just mentioned. It seems reasonable to me, because of the inequities I have pointed up, that this provision be extended to older tertiary students if they are from country areas where they are not able to live at home whilst accessing tertiary education. This was certainly the case for my own children in Karratha, where we lived for 20 years. Like hundreds of families in my electorate, I experienced first-hand this inequity. It is part and parcel of country students pursuing a tertiary education. It is with these hundreds of families in mind that I rise today to underline this anomaly to the House. We are doing a great deal and achieving a great deal in this area, but still the inequities exist. In the 2000-01 budget we changed the situation so that from 1 January 2001 the government would disregard 75 per cent of the value of a family’s interest in assets such as a farm or business. We changed that from the allowable 50 per cent, increasing the eligibility or the number of those that would be eligible for youth allowance. Those changes, although they are greatly appreciated, simply do not go far enough. I say again that the federal Youth Allowance system aims to support young people financially if they are unable to completely support themselves. But, with the anomalies that exist, eligibility for the allowance is very difficult to attain. Parents must have a very low income for their children to be automatically eligible for the allowance. As I have said, young people must work for 18 months and earn $15,950 in that period to be declared independent. The strict limitations on that allowance make it very difficult for students from regional areas who must leave home to study. Obviously they require some form of financial assistance if their family has an income which is above the minimum threshold for eligibility but is unable to support their child. Young people are then forced to take at least that year off from study to become eligible. The current system states that, unless the annual family income is below the threshold for automatic youth allowance, students intending to study higher education must either rely on their parents for assistance during their course or work for that 18 months and earn the required amount. When you analyse the very restrictive, very narrow terms that make that allowance absolutely available, it becomes obvious that a large number of issues highlight the anomaly and increase the frustration of the families and students that find themselves in this situation. If the regional students’ parents cannot support them, or if they already receive a youth allowance, country students must take at least a year off and earn the money for the independence. Alternatively, city students have the option of going straight to university. The comfort that they gain from living with their parents simply highlights, once again, the anomaly that exists. Country students are not able to have their university places held for more than 12 months. This is yet another hurdle in the road for a country student to achieve that diploma or that graduation certificate from a tertiary institution. MAIN COMMITTEE The youth allowance payment is not enough to cover college fees. College is an option taken by country students in order to meet new people and have the comfort of acclimatising with more ease to a city situation. That city environment is often most alien to country students. Unless they have the opportunity of the camaraderie that is offered by a university campus college, the achievement of that tertiary education is made more difficult than it ought to be. Because the youth allowance payment, if they are entitled to it, is not enough to cover college fees, the students need to work 10 to 15 hours a week in order to cover the fees. But the system does not allow students to earn more than $118 per week. As a result, the student does not have anywhere near enough funds to live a reasonable existence. If a country student is awarded a scholarship for course fees, they must attend university or TAFE the year after high school graduation. Scholarships cannot be deferred. These students are not supported for living costs and therefore must either rely on their parents for support or reject the scholarship and spend that year working to entitle them, eventually, to a youth allowance. It is an unfair burden, as I have said, for parents to have to support the living costs of their offspring at university or TAFE. It is often much more than the family can afford. It is not reasonable to suggest that a family income of $28,850, which is in excess of that allowedthe base limit that starts to disqualify payment of that youth allowance is as low as $28,850infers that these families are from some great wealth belt and can set up a son or daughter in a metropolitan or other area where they may attend a tertiary institution that exists. It costs a great deal of money. They will have to meet a weekly rental fee and will have to do something about the cost of food. Many people see that, in the long-term cost effectiveness, they have to go into a mortgage situation and purchase some sort of real estate in the metropolitan area to accommodate their student child. There is ample evidence to suggest that country families do not need this additional hazard to remain loyal residents of regional Australia. In my 2.3 million square kilometres, I have but one centre-Broome, in the Kimberleythat has an increasing population. All the rest are declining. They are declining because of the tendency to empty out rural centres and migrate to city centres; if not city then certainly coastal. This is causing a problem. I am often heard to say that if we allow it to continue to happen we will have the eventuality that when Australians from the leafy suburbs decide to have their once a year, or once a lifetime, sojourn to the outback they will find no-one left to pour the beer or the petrol. It will change, for all time, their impression of the wonderful outback of Australia that has been so much our heritage. I have, for six years now, contemplated solutions to the demise of populations in the bush. In this place, I have spoken frequently on the topic. I have illustrated today just one hurdle that exists for families residing in rural areas-that is, the inequity that exists for a family that does not qualify for youth allowance in a rural area, in comparison with one that exists in the city and has all that public infrastructure in place to assist them. The main solution, as I see it, is a dramatic increase in the taxation zone rebate system that was introduced back in 1945 and has undergone, for the last 10 years, no reasonable review or increase. I call again on my government-my Treasurer-to seriously consider the increase in taxation zone rebates and do something now to change the situation of hurdles in the bush. the government’s budget for 2005-06. It is now three weeks since the Treasurer brought down his 10th, and the Prime Minister’s 16th, budget. This budget does not serve Australia well.

261,Mr Wilkie (Swan) (4.23 Pm),"I rise to speak on the appropriation bills in response todoes not serve Western Australians well and it does not serve my constituents in Swan well. This is a lazy budget. It depends on the rivers of gold from vast, unanticipated streams of company tax revenue emanating from the resources boom to fund a tax giveaway which is all about rewarding those on high incomes in the Liberal Party’s natural constituency. In my response last week to the government’s legislation on the tax cuts, I outlined many reasons why these tax cuts are so inequitable and provide so little to help those families in Swan and the rest of Australia who continue to struggle to make ends meet. I do not propose to canvass those arguments again. It is sufficient to remind members of the House of the innate injustice of those tax cuts and of the fact that Labor’s tax policy is fair and provides a far better deal to those families in Swan on average incomes. The fundamental question is: why doesn’t this budget serve Australia well? The fundamental answer is because it fails to use this revenue bonanza to put in place policies which will ensure Australia’s future prosperity. We are enjoying the benefits of our abundant natural resources, particularly those from my home state of Western Australia, and a commodity price boom the like of which this country has not seen since the Korean wool boom in the early 1950s. According to the Treasury, Australia’s terms of trade-the relative value of our exports over our imports-are forecast to rise by 12.25 per cent in the 2005-06 year alone to reach their highest level since the wool boom of the early 1950s. Perhaps members of the House who are senior enough might remember those glory days. Certainly it has become part of the historical record that we received  for each pound of wool. I am sure the squatter from Corangamite will remember those days well. Just as the good luck which Australia enjoyed then fuelled prosperity for some time so the current good luck we are enjoying could secure higher rates of economic growth and higher living standards into the future for our children and grandchildren. But, no-put simply, the government failed to put in place the necessary policies to dramatically increase infrastructure spending. This is not to say that tax cuts should not be part of this budget-all Australians deserve a tax cut as part of this fiscal dividend-but those tax cuts should be fair and focused more on improving incentives for lowto middle-income earners. There is no doubt that government coffers are oozing with revenue, which could have been used to fund tax cuts and to lay the groundwork for increased infrastructure spending, paving the way for a higher rate of economic growth than we would otherwise enjoy. As the Leader of the Opposition announced in his budget reply, Labor plans to use the interest earned by the future fund to pay for national infrastructure projects. Unfortunately, the Liberal Party is obsessed with the public service’s unfunded superannuation liabilities and has earmarked the future fund for those. According to the Productivity Commission and the government’s own Intergenerational report, the superannuation liability of the Commonwealth Public Service is actually in decline as a share of GDP and will continue to decline over the next 40 years. The Liberals have created the superannuation liability argument as a straw man to stymie the attempts by the National Party to turn the future fund into a slush fund for traditional pork-barrelling. I can well understand the Liberals’ efforts to keep the funds away from the profligate and irresponsible National Party, which regrettably has ministerial control of infrastructure spending. The examples of rorts and unaccountability in programs administered by the National Party are so legion as to be totally embarrassing. I can hardly bring myself to repeat the alarming MAIN COMMITTEE examples which have come to light in this parliament just since the last election. I know that the members from the Liberal Party back bench squirm almost as much as we do when the current Deputy Prime Minister is forced in the House to account for his dodgy ministerial practices. When the current Minister for Veterans’ Affairs is called on to explain her administrative misdemeanours it really seems kinder to just turn the microphone off at the dispatch box. For those reasons, I have a kernel of sympathy for the more responsible Liberals trying to keep those funds away from their coalition colleagues. But that does not negate the fact that a much greater focus on infrastructure was sorely needed in this budget, and that is where the government unambiguously failed to deliver for the future of this country. While the Nationals like to shore up their own electorates with rort-ridden programs and funding allocations which would not pass any objective assessment of worth, many of these projects do not provide the real impetus to infrastructure across Australia that is sorely needed. It is vital for all Australians that our infrastructure, transport, communications, energy, water and so on are as efficient and effective as possible to ensure our international competitiveness. The framework used by the National Party in allocating such projects is not based on economics or sensible public policy; in fact ‘framework’ is too strong a word. The National Party approach is traditionally not rigorous as it has at its origins some of the flagrantly misspent expenditure of the Bjelke-Petersen government in Queensland. Under Joh, if you were a white shoe brigade friend of or a donor to the National Party-often with the appellation of ‘ Sir’ being put before such names as Bruce, Justin or Bazza-then you could have the hereto unsealed road to your property surfaced at taxpayers’ expense. That is the type of approach the National Party apply to spending programs they administer. They allocate funds to projects involving their mates, bully local communities to make sure that only National Party members are associated with these projects-just ask the member for New England-and often do the paperwork assessing the project’s eligibility for funding after the project has been approved, not before. How many reports have been published over the last 10 years of this government which have highlighted the infrastructure gaps and the bottlenecks which our businesses and exporters have had to deal with to sell their product? Today the government released a long-awaited report by an eminent prime ministerial task force on ways to remove infrastructure bottlenecks that harm Australia’s economy. This report has confirmed what the Labor Party has been saying: that the current transport infrastructure programs are a joke. The worse joke, of course, is the AusLink program. As eminent economic commentator Alan Wood of the Australian commented the day after the budget: Under AusLink, a lot of money is likely to be wasted without the check of any rigorous cost benefit analysis. It started in the election campaign and will continue, as will the now notorious Roads to Recovery program. As a Western Australian, I have long called for a better deal for Western Australia in terms of transport road funding. Unfortunately, my calls have fallen on deaf ears with this government. It is of little surprise that we in the west call the AusLink program ‘EastLink’, given its focus on the eastern states. I have been calling for federal assistance under the national highway program for the upgrading of a section of the Great Eastern Highway in my electorate of Swan. The stretch that requires urgent widening and upgrading is between Redcliffe and Rivervale. As those who MAIN COMMITTEE know Perth well will understand, the stretch of road not only is a major link between the Perth CBD and Perth Airport but also is the major arterial road linking Perth to the eastern states and therefore clearly forms part of the national highway. As I informed the House earlier this year, it is not overstating matters to say that this section of the highway is the lifeblood of Perth’s transport industry. Yet, again, this sensible, costeffective project, which ultimately would benefit not just those in my electorate but all Western Australian businesses and indeed national businesses and tourism, has been ignored. As the local member for the area, if the government were to approve this project I would be the first to recognise and acknowledge the wisdom of its doing so. But, yet again, Western Australians have been cruelly disappointed by a government which seems to believe the national border ends at the Nullarbor. Unfortunately it does not, but I am sure it thinks it does. To add insult to injury, much of the revenue bonanza which this government has received comes from Western Australia in the form of company tax receipts from the mining boom. Is it too much to ask that some of this windfall gain be passed on to the state of origin for the benefit of its citizens and businesses in terms of better infrastructure? I am becoming very concerned about the lack of any advocate for Western Australia in the federal cabinet. While I know that Senators Ian Campbell and Ellison are ministers, I have to say that, if they are arguing as they should be that Western Australia is generating the bulk of the wealth on which Australian prosperity is riding and that therefore Western Australia deserves a better deal, they are being demonstrably unsuccessful in doing so. Another vital aspect of infrastructure is telecommunications. Unfortunately I have previously had occasion to raise in the parliament the issue of the appalling standards of Telstra services in my electorate. In February and again in MarchI raised the issue of inadequate services and the broken promises of Telstra in regard to the access of several of my constituents to broadband services. On 17 March this year I wrote to the CEO of Telstra, Dr Ziggy Switkowski, and called on him to come to my electorate to see for himself the inadequacies of Telstra services. I explicitly asked for him not to palm me off onto one of his staff but to come and see these problems for himself. Lo and behold, on 24 MarchI received a letter not from Dr Switkowski but from Bill Scales, one of Dr Switkowski’s underlings, informing me that Dr Switkowski had no plans to visit Perth and therefore would not be able to meet with my constituents or me to discuss these problems. I was disappointed that the CEO of a still majority public owned company would treat the genuine concerns of the current majority owners of Telstra-for example, my constituentswith such disdain and disregard. Imagine my surprise, therefore, when I noticed a few days ago in the social pages of the West Australian newspaper a picture of Dr Switkowski, dressed to the nines, tripping the light fantastic at a business school soiree at the University of Western Australia. It turned out that not only was Dr Switkowski in Perth, when I had been informed that he had no plans to visit the west, but, to add insult to injury, his presence at this function with the top end of town was advertised in November last year. I believe that my constituents deserve better than this blatant disregard from the CEO of a company still owned in a majority sense by the people of Australia. I wrote to Dr Switkowski again on 12 May and explained my disappointment with him regarding the misleading information I had been given by Telstra about his travel plans. Last week on 26 May I was honoured to receive a reply from Dr Switkowski himself, telling me: MAIN COMMITTEE A useful step might be for me to call you and discuss further your views-I will set this up for the days ahead when convenient to you. I must admit that I am a bit bemused and a little amused that so much planning and setting up is involved in the head of Telstra contacting a federal MP-particularly by phone. In the time that it would have taken for Dr Switkowski to sign the letter, he could have just dialled my number. Let me give the House yet another example of Telstra’s failure to meet and satisfy customer demands in Swan. In early April this year, Lynda, a constituent of mine who lives in Bentley, was contacted by Telstra, offering her Telstra’s latest promotion: a new fixed phone service with 50 free phone calls a month and 50 free SMS messages a month. Under her previous policy, Lynda was receiving a fixed number of free phone calls but, notwithstanding this, Lynda told the Telstra representative that she would convert to Telstra if she could also get broadband internet connection. Having received assurances from the Telstra representative that this would be the case, Lynda decided to subscribe to Telstra for a fixed home phone service and provision of internet services. She signed the necessary paperwork. After not hearing from Telstra for some time, Lynda contacted the company herself, querying the delay. She was told that her phone service had been transferred to Telstra around 22 April, but they could not give her any information on the broadband connection. So, on 11 May, Lynda again phoned Telstra and was told that she would not be able to get broadband connection until mid-July, as there were no ports available to the local exchange-and, because she did not have two or more Telstra services, she could not get the 50 free calls a month and the 50 free SMS messages that were originally offered as part of the deal. In other words, my constituent is currently financially disadvantaged, compared to her original arrangements with another carrier, because of misinformation given to her by Telstra. Despite Telstra’s promises, Lynda will not get broadband internet access until mid-July. That is the date, I suppose, when Telstra will finally have signed up enough people in Lynda’s street to warrant the cost of adding another port to the exchange. She has now been belatedly promised that all discounts and free calls will be backdated to April. I wait with great interest to see whether this promise eventuates. I believe the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman had to get involved to make that happen. This is but one of many similar issues raised with me by constituents. It is clear to me that many of Telstra’s broken promises to those in my electorate are due to the company’s reluctance to invest in new networks and technologies because of its corporate desire to minimise expenditure and boost the sale price. I urge all of my colleagues in this House to take a serious view of Telstra’s behaviour and to document their constituents’ complaints so that, like me, they can use the opportunities of this House to try and impose some scrutiny on Telstra. Mark my words: although it is difficult to imagine, if Telstra is fully sold it will become even less responsive to customers’ needs. And once again-they are at it again-the National Party will have caved in and sold out its own constituents and all Australians. Given its ineptitude, it is not surprising that since 1996 the number of National Party members of this House has been reduced from 17 to 12. Little wonder that we have seen the Independent members for New England, Kennedy and Calare returned handsomely. As I have mentioned in this House on other occasions, the current leadership of the National Party is bereft of political skill, basic competence and administrative ethics. Members MAIN COMMITTEE of this House have only this week and last witnessed the unedifying spectacle of the Deputy Prime Minister trying to argue in this place that national transport security has not been undermined by the fact that Mr Mick Palmer and his staff from the Office of the Inspector of Transport Security have been transferred to other duties-namely, to investigate the appalling case of Cornelia Rau and many others who have been wrongfully detained or deported. The Deputy Prime Minister is wriggling like a rat in a trap on this issue. Almost daily he demonstrates to the House and to the Australian public his unparalleled incompetence both administratively and politically. Yesterday in the debate on a matter of public importance it was not surprising that only 11 of his coalition colleagues were willing to sit in the House and witness his confusion. You can bet they were press-ganged into attendance by the National Party whip. In fact I think I only saw one or possibly two Liberal members there. I think one of them might have even had to speak, so he was stuck. Another alarming failure of the Deputy Prime Minister concerns drought policy. It is almost beyond comprehension that the second most senior minister in the government actually sat around in the cabinet room in recent weeks and agreed to a budget falsely premised on an optimistic outlook for rural Australia. The Deputy Prime Minister, who, while he looks like a stockbroker from Double Bay, claims he has such an affinity with the bush-on our side of the House we call him the Liberal in gumboots-failed in the most fundamental way to inform his Liberal colleagues that the drought was getting worse. He has also agreed to a budget devoid of any additional measures for the drought. Within three weeks the government was forced to confront reality and change budget policy. The truth of the matter is that the Deputy Prime Minister got well and truly rolled by the Liberals on the nature and scope of the drought measures. This is the same Deputy Prime Minister with the glass jaw who will soon roll over on the sale of Telstra. As someone who was once a farmer and who has lived in regional Australia, I know how important access to efficient, reliable and state-of-the-art telecommunications services is to regional Australia. As the federal member for an inner city electorate in Perth, I know that these issues are vitally important to urban residents as well. Country residents will ask themselves: why vote for the National Party when the National Party has sold Telstra and in so doing has reduced further the service quality in telecommunications? The simple truth of the matter is that the most profitable telecommunications services are located in Sydney and Melbourne and along the eastern coast and if you live elsewhere you are a marginal customer to Telstra, meaning they do not really give a toss about you. As I draw to a close, I would like to leave the House with one clear message: this budget is a missed opportunity that fails all Australians. In years to come, we will look back at 2005 and know that, if only we had invested wisely in infrastructure now, we would be equipped to sustain higher economic growth. The Hawke-Keating government commenced the process of reforming the Australian economy through tariff cuts, tax reform and more flexible labour markets. They modernised the Australian economy and strengthened it to better compete in global markets. Those substantial and genuine reforms have stood the economy in good stead. The coalition has implemented some further policy reforms which have received the support of the opposition. This budget is not an example of the government grasping the nettle and implementing much-needed reform. We should have used our good circumstances to secure long-lasting investment in our infrastructure, which would enable us to sustain higher ecoMAIN COMMITTEE nomic growth rates for the future. Unfortunately the coalition has squibbed this opportunity, to the detriment of all Australians, and in particular to the detriment of Western Australians, who have contributed so much to the national good fortune. I call on members to reject this budget and to put pressure on the government to address our infrastructure deficiencies as a matter of urgency. Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (4.43 pm)-The member for Swan joins all those opposite in saying how he would spend the surplus. If they had been in government for the last 10 years, there would not be one. They would be scrabbling around having interviews with Middle Eastern money men, looking for some way of meeting expenditure. They would be grossly overspent. They are the ones that hollowed out the logs. They sold Qantas, they sold the Commonwealth Bank, they sold CSL and they want to come in here bleating about the sale of Telstra. If the member for Swan had represented his constituent in that Telstra matter, he would have gone straight to the telecommunications ombudsman and had it fixed immediately and had her returned to her situation prior to taking up Telstra’s offer or got Telstra to deliver. All of this reform of the regulatory environment of telecommunications has come about since Telstra has been partially privatised. When they owned Telstra and were running it, there was no telecommunications ombudsman to complain to. It was an appalling service. Everyone agreed about that. It was absolutely shocking, and there was nothing you could do about it. Now we have a responsive telecommunications giant. There are still some issues but, partially sold, it is a heck of a lot better than it was. Just imagine what it could be like if it were fully sold. The member for Swan then continued to slur my good colleagues in the Nationals about their Roads for Recovery-the programs that they support that deliver infrastructure into the bush. Maybe that is the reason the coalition actually took seats in Western Australia-Hasluck and Stirling were returned to the government. If the ALP’s representation of the rural constituency is so great, where are the extra seats for the ALP in this parliament? Our Nationals colleagues, compared to the ALP, are expert rural representatives. They do a great job representing the bush and its interests against the state governments that universally ignore their issues and do not deliver the infrastructure they need. The response to AusLink-a very responsible national program about connecting our capitals and dealing holistically with the transport of goods and people around this country-basically ended up being Labor councils and Labor states squeaking out for federal funding for what are basically local government roads and state infrastructure. For goodness sake: not only do we have to fix all the major issues like industrial relations reform, waterfront reform and tax reform; now the state governments are calling on us to fix their hospitals, their roads, their police forces and their schools. The list is endless. Surely, if we were doing such a bad job at the federal level, the ALP would have picked up a few more seats in Western Australia, rather than having Stirling and Hasluck returned to the coalition. Quite clear from the member for Swan’s speech is the fact that the opposition is about axing the Roads to Recovery program. It is about squandering any surplus in incredible ways. Where are the moneys they got from the sale of the CSL laboratories, Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank? This is the same party that rolled over DFRDB contributions of members and government into consolidated revenue. Now, when the members of our military forces MAIN COMMITTEE come to call on their pensions-and eventually this pension fund will have as much money exiting it as entering it-they will find that there is no DFRDB fund to finance that liability. Those opposite want to say, ‘That is all right. The current taxpayer can do that. We do not need a future fund. Let us blow this future fund on a whole bunch of things that the state and local governments should be doing but, because of their economic responsibilities, are not doing.’ The member for Swan was talking about the Nationals’ support for our Deputy Prime Minister. The backbench of the ALP, behind the Leader of the Opposition at question time, is the most enervated, bored, restless, unmotivated group of individuals in any parliament anywhere in Australia. They are totally used to opposition. They totally lack ideas. They have nothing but a mantra of ‘Sixty-five dollars is too much for politicians but $40 is okay.’ If they really object to this tax cut for higher income earners, then they should negate the lot. They should have the courage of their convictions and say so. The taxpayer is not buying Labor’s fiddling with the fringes. They understand that this government has consistently delivered tax cuts to the vast majority of Australians over the last 10 years. They understand that we stand for tax cuts. The message that they are getting from the ALP through its opposition to these bills is that the ALP stands for high taxes and huge expenditure. They do not see the benefit of that. Just look at the New South Wales state government’s budget, introduced a week after the introduction of this budget into the House. Clearly people can see that Labor governments take money from the taxpayer and we return it. This 2005-06 set of budget bills builds on nine years of strong economic performance. We have had strong growth, low interest rates for home owners, record low unemployment and more incentives for people to benefit from our economy and contribute to our society. This budget now focuses on returning people to the work force. It addresses trade shortages. It seeks to improve parenting in separating couples, with a focus more on their children and a parenting plan rather than on the issues that that couple may have with each other. It delivers targeted funding to two of the most mysterious and devastating diseases in our population: dementia and cancer. It also delivers on my election promise of $7 million for a library at US at Kingswood, for which I have received a thank you letter from my vice-chancellor, Janice Reid, which I appreciate. I hope this library will improve the experience of learning for students at the Western Sydney campus. It is particularly important that we have the types of resources that Sydney and New South Wales universities do. I am known to be a strong critic of US, but that is because I want it to be one of the sandstone eight. My vision for University of Western Sydney is a premier university, a university that will be top of the pick no matter what for every student in Western Sydney. It should not be a university of which students think, ‘IfI don’t get the TER to get into New South Wales, Macquarie or Sydney, I will go to Western Sydney.’ It is not acceptable. It is the only university in Western Sydney, for two million people in Sydney. It needs to start lifting its game and delivering to the section of people that it represents. It is far easier for students to stay at home in Western Sydney and go to university than try and attend one of the other universities where they have to make living arrangements away from home. MAIN COMMITTEE The other election promise that I have delivered on in this budget is $10 million for the Panthers stadium. While that stadium will predominantly still be for league, the new surface will mean that other sports, such as soccer, union and hockey, and non-sporting events, such as showjumping for horses, gymnastics and festivals, can all be held in that stadium with increased sitting capacity. The western grandstand will be upgraded to include an extra 2,500 undercover seats, and the corporate facilities will be upgraded to include an additional 300 seats, which will bring additional opportunities for sponsorship to the various sports. I understand Panthers have recently chosen the architect and that work will begin at the end of the league season this year in September. The work should be completed by June next year. I understand the NRL has agreed to a delayed series of games for the Panthers next year so that Panthers will get its fair share of home games in the new stadium when that facility is ready at the end of next season. I fully supported the Panthers submission by lobbying the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Arts and Sport to provide those funds. It is a project that the club has been working on for many years. Full credit to them for achieving that goal. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the great contribution of Roger Cowan, the CEO of Panthers for the last 30 years, who is retiring. He has a life of extraordinary achievement with Panthers. He has brought a number of facilities-sporting, cultural and otherwise-and forms of entertainment to Penrith at a time when the private sector failed to deliver to the citizens of Penrith. Roger did nothing that was not allowed within the clubs act. If the New South Wales government want to destroy the club industry, do not take it out on Roger and Panthers. Regulate appropriately if you do not feel that it is appropriate for the club industry to extend itself with Panthers. I would like to remind everyone that Roger at all times saved clubs that were going into receivership and closing. At no time did Panthers take over a club that was already financial and that was not asking for assistance from Panthers. We have rescued a number of clubs that would otherwise have closed. If the state government has issues with that, there are other ways of dealing with it rather than opening up pokies into the hotels sector and populating gaming throughout an industry in the private sector. For all of the tragedy and social ills that gaming causes, it has no returns to society. The club movement was, I think, an excellent and admirable worldwide example of how to control and contain gaming and to deliver some great outcomes for the community. I think that the state government could have worked better with the clubs industry for other outcomes rather than set about dismantling the clubs industry by arduous taxation, targeted inquiries and increasing competition in the private sector with the hotels. Roger has seen the club industry through some very hard and challenging times. I wish him the best in retirement. I know he and his wife will retire in our local area and will be active in a number of things in our local community. I wish them all the best and acknowledge the great job they have done. Miss JACKIE KELLY-I wish them all the best in the west, and I acknowledge the great job that Roger has done for our community. This budget also saw the setting aside of $8 million over four years for the National Community Crime Prevention Program in Western Sydney. The centrepiece of this initiative is a national community grants program, providing funds for grassroots projects, designed to enhance community safety and crime prevention by preventing or reducing crime and antisocial MAIN COMMITTEE",213,Appropriation Bill No 2 2005 2006 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2005 2006 Appropriation Bill No 5 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 6 2004 2005

I believe the closing date for the first round of grants in the Western Sydney program was 29 April. I hope that many community groups I approached did put their applications in and will be soon benefiting from those grants. The other election promise I made was the offer of $1.1 million for a vermin proof fence on the ADI site. I am very concerned that the New South Wales government has failed to take up this offer. I received a letter from the New South Wales Minister for Environment, Bob Debus, proposing a macrofauna fence to restrict the movement of dogs and foxes. A macrofauna fence does not gel with all the environmental issues we looked at in that parkland and all the environmental issues that the residents’ action group fought hard to deal with. There is no point having parkland in the middle of what is essentially an urban area without a vermin proof fence. There are houses all around that ADI site. The reason it is in such pristine condition is that it has been fenced, and once further housing encroaches on that site it really will need a vermin proof fence that will prevent cats, particularly feral cats, and other introduced species from harming the flora and fauna, particularly the bird life. If we can get the Cumberland Plain forests back to their pristine condition, the bird life that goes with that community should come back too. That will only be possible if their nesting areas are preserved from cats and whatnot. In that way a vermin proof fence that goes two feet underground and has wires and barbed wire at the top, to stop that entry, is critical for preserving that site, for all the reasons that we fought so hard to preserve it. It does not appear that the fence is in any way included in the plan of management. The last meeting of this plan of management is tomorrow night and so far nothing has come out of it to indicate that the state government is taking the R and E values of the site seriously. They are really not protecting the Cumberland Plain woodland and the flora and fauna on that site. Again we are relying on the state government to pick up where the federal government has left off, and again we are sorely disappointed. The state government has also failed the people of Lindsay by so far refusing to provide an after-hours clinic at the Nepean Hospital. This is something that I lobbied to have in this year’s budget, but it is not accounted for in this year’s budget because the state government has so far failed to say where this clinic could go. In their budget, the Carr government budgeted $900 million in extra funding for hospitals but half of that would have had to have been spent anyway to cover wage increases for existing staff under new awards. So for $900 million we are not getting any more staff; we are just getting an increase in the pay of existing staff. With the extra 4,000 patients admitted to emergency wards across the state this year-and that figure is quite consistent with expectations: you can imagine that emergency wards would see more and more people each year; that is a natural normal increase-the remaining money will barely cover increasing admissions and administration costs, let alone improving existing services at the Nepean Hospital. When the Carr government introduced the pokies tax, they ran around quickly-not at the time they introduced it but two weeks later-and said, ‘We will spend all this pokies tax on our hospitals.’ I do not see that, I do not see anything in the state budget that remotely says there is an increase equivalent to the pokies tax revenue going to our hospitals for improved services and new services and more staff and more beds. There is nothing in this budget exMAIN COMMITTEE cept normal increases, which any responsible state government would have had to fund. There is no real increase at all. In August the federal government offered the New South Wales government the opportunity to establish an after-hours GP clinic located near the emergency ward of the Nepean Hospital to take some of the heat out of the emergency centre, which gets quite busy. We have seen a number of cases recently where Western Sydney hospitals have been on code red and patients have travelled many miles to be treated. Again, no effort has been made to take up this offer. This budget has also established some health priorities, namely dealing with dementia and cancer. All too often we get the terrible news that someone we know has been diagnosed with cancer. It has deeply affected this side of the parliament at this time, with the death of Gary Nairn’s wife, Kerrie. Her funeral is on Friday, and I know that a number of people from this House will be attending. I believe Kerrie was diagnosed with cancer no more than five months ago. It is the number one killer of Australians. Everyone knows someone who has been affected by cancer. I am proud that this government is delivering $189 million to strengthening cancer care over five years to try to lessen the impact of this devastating disease. The funding includes $4.1 million to develop and implement training courses for cancer nurses, $1 million to improve the support for women newly diagnosed with breast cancer and $4 million to improve the early detection of breast cancer. There is $17.6 million into cancer research, $21 million for cancer clinical trials, $5.5 million to establish a national research centre for asbestos related disease and $23 million to enhance palliative care programs. These are just some of the ways the money will be spent. There is also $5.5 million to raise national awareness of skin cancer and $25 million over four years to discourage young people from taking up smoking. I am very disturbed by the fact that 25 per cent of 18to 25-year-old females in my electorate in Western Sydney smoke-well above the national average. This campaign will be targeting those young women and the reasons they take up smoking. Through a national awareness program, this campaign will be trying to deter them from taking up smoking. In Lindsay there are about 7,000 in this age group, meaning that about 1,750 young women in Lindsay are endangering their health. I am always disappointed to see young women smoking. I grew up in an environment where we knew that smoking kills. There were big efforts by our parents to discourage smoking. It is quite disappointing to see it on the increase in young people. As a habit smoking really does not have much going for it. It is detrimental to your health, it is expensive and there is already sufficient pollution in Western Sydney without having smoking contributing to it. It is the largest preventable cause of premature death and disease in Australia. I hope that these initiatives will have some impact on the young women in my electorate to give up smoking or to never take it up. I commend these bills to the House. They are yet another example of good economic management and strong reinforcement from a reforming government. They are a tribute to our Treasurer and to our leader. The ALP should be ashamed of the statements that I know the members opposite will be jumping up to make about how they will spend the budget or a surplus that they seriously would not have had. They certainly did not have one in 1996. There is MAIN COMMITTEE no state budget anywhere in Australia demonstrating a surplus. This is the only government that has consistently demonstrated a surplus. (Time expired) Ms KING (Ballarat) (5.03 pm)-In this debate on the appropriation bills I want to focus on the attempt by the Howard government to laud itself as the friend of working families. It is true that since 1996 the Howard government has used a range of tactics to capture the votes of lowand middle-income families. It has revived this pitch recently in the Prime Minister’s address to the Menzies Research Centre and the constant mantra at question time. The Prime Minister knows that to keep government he needs the votes of lowand middle-income Australians. He knows that, were this group to return to Labor, he would be out of office. At the same time the Prime Minister remains beholden to a set group of interests in the community, largely dominated by big interests but also those of independent wealth. Everything he does and says should be seen through the prism of these two interests: capturing the votes of middleand low-income families and servicing his interest groups. It has been a fine balancing act, but when you bother to actually study the detail of what he has done and his policy approaches, you see that that is exactly what it is: an act. Far from being the friend of working families, this Prime Minister is more like the wolf in sheep’s clothing. In this debate I want to examine some of the key policy challenges facing families at the moment and the reality behind the myth generated by the Howard government that they support working families. The self-proclaimed workers’ friend in this year’s budget failed to deliver any real package to address skill shortages-to train more Australians and to provide opportunities for the kids of lowand middle-income families to acquire a trade. He failed to actually assist people from the lowest income families from welfare to work and has presided over a growing inequality between high-income and low-income families. He failed to seriously tackle the propositions put by Labor for real tax reform, preferring to give the highest income earners a tax cut while not seriously tackling those in the middle. He has overseen a further erosion of the social wage through both his backflip on the Medicare safety net and now the introduction of his extreme industrial relations agenda. I turn firstly to the issue of skill shortages. The most recent figures clearly show that the Howard government has presided over a massive skills crisis. Far from improving, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations skilled vacancy index shows the shortage of skilled workers is getting worse. As with infrastructure bottlenecks, the shortage of skilled labour is restricting the economy’s productivity and its capacity to grow. In regional Australia we face a shortage in both the traditional and the professional trades. However it is in the area of traditional trades that the crisis is most acute. The Howard government’s new apprenticeship program is not offering a pathway to traditional trades to the unemployed. The only path many Australian companies can now take is to look overseas for skilled labour. Australia is already ranked third in the OECD for reliance on skilled migrants to address skill shortages. The effect of this policy failure is that we now have around 200,000 teenagers not in education or full-time work. Government members may well point to the increase in the number of new apprentices in the retail or hospitality industry. Despite the government’s rhetoric, many of us on this side of the House value the skills and experience gained in these industry sectors. In fact many of us on this side of the House have worked pretty extensively in those sectors. However, these industries are characterised by part-time casual work and predominately emMAIN COMMITTEE ploy kids after school. It is an important thing to do, but they are not trade apprenticeships. We know that 40 per cent of apprentices who commence an apprenticeship in a traditional trade drop out. The government has done nothing to actually provide incentives for apprentices to complete their trades. This means that of the 580 apprentices who commence a traditional trade in Ballarat each year 230 are dropping out. The government has dropped the ball on this issue. This is just another example of its complacency. OECD studies consistently indicate that failure to make an early transition to permanent work or full-time study is associated with long-term risks of marginalisation, helping to trap people in a cycle of unemployment, part-time work and government schemes-which many of my constituents are, sadly, all too familiar with. This is also one of the reasons why Labor proposed providing more vocational options as part of school based apprenticeships. Nine long years of Howard government failure has created a skills crisis that is hurting Australian businesses and families. The Howard government has dropped the ball on training, and this year’s federal budget clearly showed it has no idea how to pick it up again. Instead the Howard government’s response to the skills crisis was a quick fix, short-sighted approach. The only new skills initiative in this year’s budget is an increase in skilled migration, with an extra 200,000 skilled migrants instead of focusing on training Australian kids first. This government has created not only a nation of unskilled workers but a nation living on the margins, struggling to make ends meet. A study carried out by the St Vincent de Paul Society has exposed the reality of John Howard’s Australia-or perhaps to be more precise I should say ‘Australias’. We have become a more unequal society under this government, a chasm that will widen after the government implements its new tax cuts. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer continuously boast about the fact that their government has presided over the strongest growth in private incomes and that they have created the miracle economy. The Howard government has been trying to brand itself as a great friend of the average Australian worker. This is about as believable as saying that Tony Abbott is the best friend of Medicare or even that Brutus was the best friend that Caesar ever had. The claim that the Howard government is a friend of the Australian worker is a myth. The Howard government showed in this year’s federal budget that it was no friend of the ordinary working family and especially of those low-income families struggling to move from welfare to work. Over the last few weeks, the Howard government has laid claim to creating a more equal Australia. However, nothing could be further from the truth. The Howard government has cited NATSEM figures showing a 163 per cent increase in private incomes for the bottom 10 per cent of households over the eight years to 2002-03 compared to 38 per cent for the top 10 per cent. Suddenly, after years of denigrating NATSEM, the Prime Minister is out there discovering the ‘good’ Ann Harding. However, the St Vincent de Paul report The reality of income inequality in Australia highlights the fact that the actual increase for the bottom group was $26 a week, from $16 to $42, compared to $762 a week, from $1,989 to $2,751, for the top group. I can imagine speaking to a teacher, cleaner or child-care worker in my electorate and telling him or her that if they receive an income rise from $10 to $50-500 per cent-it is better than a CEO income rise from $1 million to $1.5 million. It really does not add up. After nine years of unbroken economic growth, far from making the lives of average Australian families more comfortable, the Prime Minister has plunged 30 per cent of households MAIN COMMITTEE into poverty, and middle-income families are relying more and more on debt to keep their heads above water. In the electorate of Ballarat, over 14,000 people, including over 4,000 children, are living in poverty according to Commonwealth census figures that show huge wealth disparities across Australia. The research also showed that rural Australia has much higher rates of poverty than cities, with almost 12 per cent of rural people living in poverty compared with 7.6 per cent in inner suburbs. It is widely acknowledged that work is the best way to get people out of the cycle of poverty and to re-engage them with the mainstream community. We know that many of the people on Centrelink payments such as the disability support pension and single parenting payments require additional training to move into the work force. A government serious about helping struggling families would not be spending three times more on compliance in this budget than they are on training measures. A real friend would give such people a hand up, but the Howard government has gone for the handball, shifting them from one welfare payment to another that is punitive and provides a lower level of financial assistance. It is also a package that provides more cuts than carrots. While the $1.5 billion invested in child care, wage subsidies and employment assistance for people with disabilities is welcome, that is almost totally offset by the $1.4 billion of cuts to payments and employment assistance. We cannot actually get the figures on this because, despite the fact that the government has put its measures in the budget and it has calculated those measures in the budget, it is refusing to provide that information to one of the Senate estimates committees that has been holding hearings this week. I ask the government what it has got to hide. Five hundred million dollars has been cut from Job Network employment assistance, which means that the level of help, training and work experience available to people who need to skill up to get back to work will be inadequate. The Australian Council of Social Service already considers the current level of assistance for training and other assistance for most job seekers as inadequate. Cuts to employment services will affect the most disadvantaged Australians, who have low levels of skills and education and who have little more than $200 a week to live on. It is not only the lack of adequate skills training but also the lack of incentives to move from welfare to work that is such a shame in this budget. Raising the lowest marginal tax rate from 17 to 15 per cent will not be enough to move people off welfare and out of poverty into work. In fact, the Howard government’s Welfare to Work scheme actually decreases incentives for welfare recipients to engage in paid work. This is despite yet another OECD report highlighting the fact that stronger incentives are needed to move people from welfare to work. This shines a light on the true motives of the Howard government’s move to force single parents from the single-parenting payment to enhanced newstart or the new dole, which will begin to be withdrawn earlier and at a higher rate than existing payments. Parents who move from the lower newstart payment will face higher effective marginal tax rates than they otherwise would have on the pension income test. That means that, under the new scheme, welfare recipients keep less private income earned than they would have under the existing system, robbing them of the incentive to work and the opportunity to become more independent of welfare payments. Again, as with tax reform, the opportunity for welfare reform has been squandered in this budget, as has the opportunity to assist low-income families into meaningful work. MAIN COMMITTEE Nothing shines a light more clearly on the true colours of the Howard government than the tax cuts contained in the budget. The tax cuts were for the top end of town, not for the nurses, policemen, teachers and tradespeople of Australia. The budget exposes the masquerade that the Howard government is the friend of ordinary Australian families. It openly celebrates the growing divide in household incomes in our communities. After becoming Australia’s highest-taxing government, the Howard government has decided to provide $22 billion in tax relief, but it is unfairly skewed towards the top end of town and it is still the little people who are going to be carrying the burden. This is a budget for the Liberal Party heartland, not a budget for the ordinary men and women of Australia. The Treasurer has been unable, in either his commentary in the media or the consideration in detail on those bills, to give any reason for not supporting Labor’s fairer tax package. He has never substantially addressed the amendments moved by Labor, preferring to hide behind a procedural debate rather than account for why he has skewed the tax cuts in this way. The reality is that, while the government knows that it needs to keep middleincome earners happy, two years before the election it is not that worried about wearing some flak over providing a small amount of tax relief to middle-income families while also providing substantially larger tax cuts to Liberal Party interest groups. At the same time as providing tax cuts skewed to families on higher incomes, the ‘worker’s friend’ has been busy eroding the social wage. What Howard has given in cash advances to lowand middle-income families he has taken back in increased medical costs. We have seen the Medicare safety net backflip-the safety net that was supposed to fix up the mess that the Prime Minister had made of Medicare. He has gone back on that as well. Private health insurance premiums have been increasing. There is also the GST, which was the pride of the last two elections. There are also issues with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and petrol prices are increasing. Not satisfied with this, the Prime Minister wants to further erode working conditions for Australian families through an extreme industrial relations agenda. History is a great teacher. The Prime Minister’s record of opposing every minimum wage case since coming to office tells us how much the Prime Minister’s friendship means to lowincome families. In 1997 the government sought a wage increase that was $2 a week less than that awarded by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. In 1998, it was $6 less; in 1999, $4 less; in 2000, $7 less; in 2001, $3 less; in 2002, $8 less; in 2003, $5 less; and in 2004 it was $9 less-totalling $44 a week, or $2,300 a year, less if the government’s view had prevailed. Are these the actions of a friend? I do not think so. Under the government’s new reforms, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the independent umpire, will be stripped of its powers in setting the minimum wage and award wages. The Howard government has reduced the role of the AIRC to that of merely a spectator of industrial relations. Can you imagine the umpire Dickie Bird being told that he had to sit in the stands and let the Australian and English cricket teams sort things out? That is basically what the Prime Minister has done in terms of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The Prime Minister stood up in parliament yesterday and defended the independent umpire of the politicians’ wages, the Remuneration Tribunal. The federal government wants to abolish the independent umpire for low-wage workers, and it is currently arguing against a $26.60 a week minimum wage rise in front of that umpire, the Australian Industrial Relations ComMAIN COMMITTEE mission. Why does the Howard government hate the independent umpire for minimum wage workers, the Industrial Relations Commission, but seem to think that an independent umpire is perfectly okay for politicians? These are double standards. Patrick Gourley summed this up well in yesterday’s Canberra Times: Let’s be clear: the Government has knackered the Industrial Relations Commission because it has, since 1996, given those on a minimum wage $44 a week more than the Government wanted. The entire rationale for the FPC, about which the Government will not be frank, is to dampen the rates of increase in minimum wages so that pay for 1.5 million people dependent upon awards will increase at a slower rate than those on higher wages. It is not just the Australian Industrial Relations Commission that the Howard government is setting about dismantling with the awards system reforms. The number of allowable matters is being reduced from 20 to 16. Gone will be shift penalties, annual leave, long service leave, bereavement leave and jury leave, just to mention a few. While the impact of the Howard government’s reforms are unlikely to be felt by the Australian worker in the short term, there is no doubt that over time the Australian Fair Pay Commission will leave workers worse off, a fact confirmed by the Prime Minister’s refusal to say otherwise-his absolute inability to give a guarantee that no Australian worker will be worse off under these changes. I want to talk briefly about a case example from my electorate and about some of the things that can happen. In my electorate, Telstra Country Wide has a large call centre which is fantastic. It provides great employment for people in my district. However, Telstra has contracted out the employment for that call centre to a labour hire company. All of the workers under that labour hire company are not employed by Telstra and they are not subject to the EBA conditions to which other Telstra workers are subject. Quite recently Telstra Country Wide wanted to change the shifts at the call centre. Without any consultation with the work force, which is what the EBA for Telstra workers required, Telstra decided to extend and change a shift, which would have required people who are now working a fairly reasonable amount of time during the day to work fairly late into the night. A large number of women in this industry work part time while their children are at school. They are supplementing the family income. The changes that were going to be forced on them by the labour hire company at Telstra’s behest meant that the workplace was no longer going to be family friendly. If this government thinks that implementing those sorts of changesforcing people onto individual contracts, not allowing them to be part of enterprise-bargaining agreements and particularly agreements that cover companies such as Telstra, and allowing companies to suddenly change workers’ shifts without any consultation or without allowing them to put a case as to why it would be very difficult for that type of work force to comply with those changes-is being family friendly and being the friend of Australian families then the government is kidding itself. The industrial relations reform agenda that the Howard government is bringing to this place is not friendly to families. If the government thinks it is, it needs to go out to Australian work forces and talk to people about their living conditions and their expectations of balancing work and family. If the government does that, it will see that its reform agenda is not family friendly. The self-proclaimed workers’ friend has targeted lowand middle-income families as systematically and doggedly as he went after the Liberal Party leadership. It was a long-term MAIN COMMITTEE agenda. He sees them as a group that has to be captured-families that have to be wooed and votes that have to be bought. He sees them as a commodity that is of use to him to be bought for the highest price. When we examine the Howard government’s record closely, we see that its claims and commitments to the Australian worker are little more than clever, deceptive marketing and spin-and it is spin that has worked: the broken promises, the Medicare safety net, interest rate rises, the never-ever GST, the unfair tax package, tax cuts for lowand middle-income families and larger tax cuts for high-income families, the erosion of the social wage and now the extreme industrial relations agenda. This government is not a true friend to Australian families. Its friendship stems from political opportunism and self-preservation. As Australian families start to wonder why, despite the trappings of material wealth with which they have surrounded themselves, they find they have a creeping despair about their level of debt, the future of their children, whether their jobs are secure and whether they will have the resources ever to retire, perhaps it is time for them also to wonder whether the self-proclaimed workers’ friend, this wolf in sheep’s clothing, has all the time just been pulling the wool over their eyes. gional Services) (5.23 pm)-When I came to this place we still had a debt of almost $40 billionMiss Jackie Kelly-It was $90 billion. by the time. I got here they had reduced that by $50 billion. When you consider the difference that made to the perspective of a small businessman, like me, who has owed money for most of his working life-and still does-and who is paying interest, you appreciate what it means to have a government that was an active participant in the borrowing market. Think about what that $96 billion debt did to the rates around Australia-and, I guess, beyond that, the world. When you have got a $96 billion debt, it has to be funded by interest repayments. The Treasurer has informed us that in another 12 months we will be down to a debt of around $6 billion. You have to be a borrower in the market to realise what an incredible difference that makes, not just as a borrower but as a person who continually deals with a market where interest and inflation are incredible factors. That affects people who borrow for business and people in the housing market-anybody who owes money. That involves virtually all of us at some stage in our lives, especially when we are younger-unless you are in an incredibly lucky position, in which case you thank your parents very much. Most of us are not in that position; most of us are borrowers. Those of us in business-not just farming but small business all around Australia-have incredible reason to be wary of high interest rates. This is the fourth or fifth budget that I have been involved in, and I am pretty proud to be part of a government that in another 12 months will reduce the debt it inherited from $96 billion to $6 billion. That is one hell of an achievement which every one of us-whether we are borrowers like small business people or simply people who work and have a mortgage-has to be incredibly thankful for. That can happen only because the government makes hard decisions and makes tough decisions and because it by and large makes decisions not for the moment but for the future of the country, decisions with long-term aspects to them.

264,Mr John Cobb,"It was actually $96 billion when the government came to power, butIt is only because of that situation-because we do have an economy that is strong because those decisions have been made-that we are now able to make the decision to add another $250 million to the government’s $1 billion cost for the current drought. You cannot do those sorts of things when you owe $96 billion, as our predecessors very kindly left us to deal with. You simply cannot do it. Neither can you make one of the greatest foreign policy investments that we have made. Following the tsunami disaster, we will make available over the next five years $1 billion, in probably one of the biggest foreign policy decisions this country has made. We are part of South-East Asia. We are a nation that is part of a very distinct area of the world. That investment is something that upstaged countries with far bigger economies than ours, such as the US, which contributes one-third of the world’s gross domestic product. For us to do that shows not only how much a part of this region we are but how much we accept our responsibilities within the region in which we live. I think that is one of the best policy decisions that have been made in my lifetime. But we are only able to do it because of the state of the economy and the way in which it is being run. To have a $9 billion surplus says that we are running particularly well. When you measure it against the rest of the OECD, it is incredible. Most of them are running budget deficits and are certainly not in the situation that we are in. It means that the nation as a whole can start saving for the future. The only reason we are able to look after our ageing population, the only reason we are able to make forecasts about where that is going, is that we have put ourselves into that situation. I would like to talk for a while about what has happened in my patch, the Parkes electorate in western New South Wales. I know the member for Lindsay next to me is probably thinking about Western Sydney. I too have a strong leaning towards that area, as I have driven through it for many years-over the Blue Mountains, down through Penrith et cetera. It is always a good place for St George to win the football. I would like to talk about the parts of the budget which are particularly relevant to my electorate of Parkes. AusLink is going to put nearly $100 million into the Newell Highway. Almost $20 million of that is going north of Parkes up to around Alectown, and $11½ million of that is going to be spent in the coming financial year. I am talking about an area between Parkes and Dubbo which, on a good day-if you can put it that way-carries more trucks than the Pacific Highway. It is quite obviously an area that must receive that spending. The highway gets incredible haulage usage and we are doing our best to increase its capacity so that people can still use it as safely as possible. The introduction of the rural medical infrastructure fund, a $15 million program through Regional Partnerships, means that medical centres in regional Australia that can show need can get up to $200,000 to help with outfitting. In my electorate, places like Tottenham and Tullamore could benefit from that. One would hope that if places like Cobar and Narromine, which are putting up medical centres, are unable to do it in their present circumstances the rural medical infrastructure fund would be relevant to them. The whole of the Orana region of the west is incredibly pleased to see that provision has been made in the budget for the operation of a Medicare-licensed MRI machine for Dubbo. This means enormous things to our region. People from as far away as Bourke will not have to travel as far as Orange or Sydney to have access to an MRI machine. People all the way from Moree through to Ivanhoe and Condobolin will have access to an MRI machine in an MAIN COMMITTEE area that is much cheaper for them to travel to. Dubbo is a natural centre for them. The Aboriginal population of western New South Wales in a lot of situations do not like travelling any further east than Dubbo. They see Dubbo as a natural hub. It does not seem to matter whether they come from Moree, Wilcannia, Walgett, Condobolin or wherever; they naturally gravitate to Dubbo. Our government has recognised this and has accepted the argument that Dubbo does need an MRI machine, from a geographical point of view and because it is a natural hub for western New South Wales. The water-saving issues, while not specifically targeted just to our electorate, have huge ramifications. Think about the towns out there that in some cases are only a few months from having to deal with water situations they have not had to deal with before. The water infrastructure fund, with $2 billion in various sections and departments, must go a long way-one hopes with state, local and business money going with it-towards dealing with some of those issues. While this country can never protect itself entirely against drought, I do believe that with judicious use of that money and cooperation with state, business and local people, we will turn that $2 billion into far more money and to some extent proof ourselves against situations such as the one we are in at the moment. There is obviously the urban side of better water use, and there is money there to experiment with more efficient usage. It is a big thing for my electorate and it is a big thing for Australia. For those of us in agriculture, the tax cuts may not be of enormous advantage today. One does hope it will rain again and we will return to profitability. Labor have the opportunity over the next couple of sitting weeks to pass the legislation in the Senate and make that which is inevitable come true on time on 1 July, as the Treasurer has drawn to our attention. There are many people in my electorate who will take advantage of the threshold changes in that legislation. There is almost $20 billion in savings involved for taxpayers there. It is not, as some people have pointed out incorrectly, just a $6 tax cut to low-income earners. Most people earning up to $45,000 with two children are not, as we have heard, really paying a net tax at all. In addition, what a lot of people forget is that it is not really in the interests of people who are currently on $50,000-and that is a lot of people-to earn any more at the moment. When these thresholds are raised, it certainly will be. Most of them will go to a 30c in the dollar tax level, and suddenly their whole attitude will change. They will have a reason to do overtime. They will have a reason to get ahead more and, obviously, they will take advantage of that, as indeed one would hope they would. I mentioned the ability of a good, well-run economy, in the firm control of a government, to help. Having the most drought-affected electorate in Australia-it gives me no joy to say that, but I have every reason to point out that fact, as I have done before in this place-I am very grateful, as indeed all of us with rural electorates should be, that the government have listened. They have only been able to do that because of their good economic management: the extra $250 million that has come out has been made possible by the budget situation the Treasurer drew to our attention three weeks ago. As well, in an area such as mine, there are towns, particularly ones like Cobar, Dubbo, Parkes and Forbes, where there are incredible skills shortages. Given that scenario, the Australian technology colleges-one of which, I am happy to say, is going into Dubbo-will allow people from all those regions to be able to make use of the enhanced youth allowance, MAIN COMMITTEE living away from home allowance, apprentices allowance and other allowances that are all part of this budget. It is a great problem to have, if you think back to the time 10 or 15 years ago when there was no shortage of skills in country areas like mine. That was not so much because there were people there. It is simply that now a demand for them exists that did not exist before. A budget like ours underlines the fact that we have made possible the decentralisation of industries in areas like the ones I have spoken about. It is a great problem to have this need for skilled people, a need that did not exist 10 or 15 years ago. Like a lot of others I am very critical of the way in which academia got hold of the education curriculum in New South Wales-and around Australia, but I know more about what is happening in New South Wales-and seemed to encourage people to think that if they did not go to university they were dumb. That has been recognised by this government-by Brendan Nelson. What we are doing about the problem of skills shortages is recognising the problem and allowing industry to say, ‘This is what we need,’ rather than have TAFE colleges or someone say, ‘This is what is here. Get used to it.’ Now that we are listening to industry, I believe the 300 places we can have as a maximum in Dubbo can be accessed. We can get people from places like Cobar, Forbes, Parkes, Condobolin and wherever it might be-out at Nyngan, perhaps-and they can come to Dubbo and make use of the allowances that have been enhanced, particularly the living away from home allowance. People from Broken Hill could go there, or they could go to Adelaide. But we need to train our own, and that is what our measures are designed to do, in conjunction with business. They are targeted and specific. In our region, it is obviously the heavy industrial and the heavy mechanical skills that are needed. Instead of having to go to New Zealand or elsewhere overseas to get them, one would hope that in another three or four years we will be able to get them locally. Also, to my surprise-not having any argument with the restaurants we already have in Dubbo-in that town in particular I am told that chefs are in short supply. So perhaps the catering industry may have some influence in where we go with our technology college in Dubbo. Another thing that came through in the budget that was of particular relevance to the seat of Parkes and also to all of regional Australia was Bank@Post servicing-266 post offices around Australia will receive Bank@Post. This gives people an opportunity to carry out financial transactions in areas where there is a lack of banking services that people can use. Over the next 18 months Bank@Post services will be introduced in 266 post offices, including those in Tullamore and Tottenham in the electorate of Parkes. The Roads to Recovery funding is once again being put out, with another $1.2 billion over the next four years; and the black spot road safety program is also being extended, with another $340 million in 2005-06 in partnership with councils. There are also projects of strategic regional importance to make our roads safer, which is certainly relevant to those who live in those areas. Funding for two new Sustainable Regions was announced in the budget, one of which involves all of the western division of New South Wales plus the Shire of Nyngan, in conjunction with south-west Queensland. There is $21 million to be spent over the next two years. I do appreciate those people like David Boyd, Steve Radford, John Williams, Howard Laughton and Jeff Wise, who have taken on responsibility in our region for sitting on the board, helping MAIN COMMITTEE the government and the region to work out ways we can increase employment in western New South Wales. In closing, there is nothing so important to a country like ours, with its growth rate and its population, who are so export orientated and small business orientated, for the government, whatever it does, to be as much as possible a debt free government that does not push interest rates up, that keeps inflation down and that makes it possible for those of us involved in small business to go ahead and borrow with confidence and expand with confidence. When you couple that with an industrial relations policy that allows you to employ people with confidence, I think the country can do nothing but go ahead further. I would add that I am very proud to be part of a government that is ensuring that that happens. discussion and development of public policy at the moment are regrettably littered with instances that display short-term vision when we should be displaying long-term vision; which display good politics rather than good public policy; and which display lack of balance on a whole host of levels. One example of that sort of outcome is this year’s budget. Given the economic circumstances that Australia presently finds itself in within the global marketplace, this year’s budget could have held so much promise. But it is an opportunity that has been squandered, for much of the reasons that I outlined from the commencement of my speech. Regrettably, this government’s actions over the course of its journey have been characterised by looking at what is just around the corner rather than thinking things through in the longer term. It has been characterised by the use of devices such as wedge politics and every form of political device that you can think of, rather than actually sitting down and talking about mechanisms that could ensure we are developing good public policy. When it comes to the lack of balance, it can be either not getting the balance right between expenditure and revenue on a financial spreadsheet, which is the budget; or it can be getting the balance wrong between the way in which people with different power and circumstances can operate together within the Australian community. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Parkes, talked about the prospects for small business. It strikes me as strange if we look at industrial relations that what we are seeing from the Howard government is progression towards a scenario that puts people into conflict. The whole basis, especially for small business, in the change of the relationships between the power of the employer and the power of the employee dictates that that is what is going to happen. We have a set of principles for industrial relations which so emasculate the protections that employees have had that it makes it very difficult for them to enter into relationships of trust, which are very important in small business, between the employer and the employee. A strange notion that has been rattled on about by this government over several years is that the panacea for continuing job growth is to ensure that unfair dismissal laws are struck from the law book. In fact, when you push this point and ask for any evidence that this is so, you find that there has been one study and nobody even now can suggest where the footnote comes from. One of the greatest urban myths ever is a magical figure that is from time to time plucked out of the air in the context of these types of discussions that says, ‘This is what will happen.’ MAIN COMMITTEE",229,Appropriation Bill No 2 2005 2006 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2005 2006 Appropriation Bill No 5 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 6 2004 2005
265,Mr Jenkins (Scullin) (5.42 Pm),"There is no doubt that the political landscape and theI am interested when there are debates about small business. If we look through a number of the studies and reports that have been mentioned, there are two that are very important to the Australian parliament. The first is the Reid report and the second is the report of the Baird committee. I happened to be an opposition member of both those inquiries. On the first occasion some people thought that I was a strange appointment but I was put on the committee for various reasons. I found that inquiry one of the most interesting inquiries that I have been involved in. It assisted me in my understanding and education of the problems that surround small businesses throughout Australia. If you look through the submissions and the body of evidence, you will see that unfair dismissals and unfair dismissals laws are a very low order problem when presented by small business. Small business will always be concerned about issues that surround fair balancetheir ability to negotiate themselves, whether it be small business against big business, retail small business people against landlords in large shopping plazas, small business people that find themselves in difficult situations because of the imbalance of power by those that hold the licences for franchises; franchisees against the franchisor. The Australian parliament has progressively tried to address these types of issues through amendments to the Trade Practices Act. That culminated early in this parliament following the election. We had the ludicrous situation whereby in amendments to the Trade Practices Act the Howard government recognised that one of the advantages that small business could have was if they were allowed to go forward under the Trade Practices Act and use collective action. Ah ha! The light switch is on and there is an indication of an understanding from the government that, in situations where there is an imbalance of power, if we are to assist those in a weaker position and if they are encouraged and allowed to take collective action that is something positive for them in advancing their cause. When the legislation was reintroduced, there was one difference between the piece of legislation presented in this parliament and that which was presented in the last parliament before the election. What was that? In the particular amendment that talked about collective action there was one group of organisations that was unable to be involved in actions taken under the proposed amendments to the Trade Practices Act-and they were organisations registered under industrial relations law: trade unions and organised labour. Why did the government have to pursue its ideological hatred for organised labour in that manner? There were examples going on at the time the parliament was discussing this amendment to the Trade Practices Act which showed that, through the cooperation of organised labour with employer groups or industry groups, action could go forward. But, in that first blush of this parliament, we saw the government give an indication of its ideological bent against organised labour in the emergence of that piece of legislation. We now have the principles set down for the proposed changes to industrial relations. AllI can say is that they are simply based on winding the clock right back-not to last century, not to the 19th century but right back to the time of the Industrial Revolution. That might be overly dramatic, but that is a way in which you can look at the principles. You have to ask: is that really the intention? It is simply wrong to suggest that, even over the length of time that the Prime Minister has been a member of this parliament, organised labour has not changedas all other areas of society have changed-and that the way we do industrial relations has not changed. It would be a different matter if in fact nothing had happened and it was all based on MAIN COMMITTEE conservative action and the protection of the past. But that is a nonsense. There have been changes in the way in which production in workshops et cetera is carried out. There have been changes in managerial practices and administration. There have been changes in the relationships between employers and employees. In an overwhelming majority of cases these have been positive changes for all. Last night in a contribution I reminded the House that in the Hawke-Keating years, especially in the early years under Prime Minister Hawke, the great revolution that occurred in the restructuring of the Australian economy-something that from time to time the HowardCostello government wants to completely ignore-was only achieved because there was consensual agreement of a tripartite fashion between employers, employees and the government to move things forward. There was the give and take and the balance that I have talked about. To throw that away simply because people have a blinkered view of the way in which the world works is wrong. If there are excesses by any section of the community, we should deal with them. But, please, do not brand-as I believe the government is-the majority on the basis of the actions of a minority. It does not make sense for me to come in here with a few horrid examples of the behaviour of employers and suggest that that is the way all employers act. IfI illustrate the actions of some employers over which employees obviously need protection, I do it on the basis that it should be sensible legislation that enables appropriate protection in those cases. The principles set out in the industrial relations vision that the Howard government has just too dramatically change that balance. To suggest otherwise is to not really look at the way in which this has been put to the Australian community. There is a need to have that underpinning-an underpinning that has been very important for the way in which Australia has moved forward and for the way in which Australia has been able to be a cohesive society. Let us not just say, ‘It’ll make us more competitive,’ and assume that in some way the industrial relations flick of the switch backwards is going to make us more competitive. Our competitiveness, as we know through the changes over the last 20 or 30 years, is more complex than that. Let us do it in a balanced way. Let us recognise that we will not continue to go forward if we do not have the necessary investment in physical infrastructure-belatedly acknowledged by the release of the report into the infrastructure requirements for Australia’s export efforts today by the government-and if we do not invest in the skills of our people through appropriate training and understand the way that fits into our economy. If we do not do that, we will get swamped by our competitors. Again, it is about balance. Look at the way this government is developing its trading relationships. It has decided that the way that it will do this is by negotiating free trade agreements with individual countries. It is a much different approach to the multilateral approach of Labor in government and the approach which the opposition continues to support. We see a greater advantage in concentrating our efforts on a multilateral basis, looking at blocks of countries and looking at ways in which we can cooperate at a regional level. If we think it is going to be simple negotiating a ChinaAustralia free trade agreement with China, I think we are kidding ourselves. There is a lot of nonsense going on now in the assessment of what has happened since the start of the year when the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement came into force. There is a body of evidence that suggests that, at this stage, overwhelmingly the advantage has been to American interests over Australian interests. One would hope that that is not to continue, but that was the warnMAIN COMMITTEE ing that many people gave in the debate about that free trade agreement. Once again, it is trying to get the processes right. When we are talking about pieces of public policy believed to be for the long term, we need to get the balance right to go forward. Look at the differences between the opposition and the government about tax cuts. Simply, what the opposition is putting forward is that the tax cuts be distributed more equitably. If you look at the comparison in a graphical manner, the tax cuts that are given under Labor have a much flatter gradient. We have tried to ensure that larger cuts at the bottom end of income levels are offset by making smaller tax cuts to the higher level. There is one element that the government has been strangely silent on when we have debates about tax levels at the federal level. The debate always concentrates now on income tax. It is as if that great phenomena, the goods and services tax, never happened. What we really should be doing when comparing tax levels at different income levels is layering the effect of a flat tax-the GST-because, regrettably, on the basis of the very sparse study that has been made of this phenomena, the impact of the GST is greater for those on lower wages than those on higher incomes. Supposedly the GST was the ‘great revolution’, the ‘great reform of our tax system’. Let us not forget that. We have this hokey-pokey about it being a state tax: ‘That doesn’t have to be in our books, because that goes straight to the states.’ Let us compare apples with apples. At the start of the Howard government, it was pure income tax. Since then, the GST has been introduced. So, if we are going to make the right comparisons, we should be looking at the combined impact of both those taxes. As I said, I hope that at some stage we will be able to look at a number of the questions that confront this parliament in terms of its long-term impact, in terms of what is good public policy as opposed to good politics and in terms of a more balanced approach. I will give one further example, because it was something that struck me. When we looked at the budget this year and were told how much money was available to be distributed, the squandered opportunities were clear-opportunities like reinstating the Commonwealth dental health program. I will continue to challenge this government to have a direct involvement in the provision of public dental health. It is allowable under the Constitution. In the late forties, I think it was, there was a constitutional amendment that allowed it, and the Constitution specifically mentions it. That is not the only reason I will state; the other reason is a point I will continue to return to. I have before me a national dental update from May 2005 from the Australian Dental Association which indicates that indirect expenditure by the Commonwealth government, through the 30 per cent rebate for private health insurance, accounted for 6.81 per cent of total dental expenditure in the year 2002-03. (Time expired) Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006, because I am a proud member of a government that has done more for the Australian people in the last nine years than the previous Labor government did in 13 years. How do I know that? I know that because wages under this government, in real terms, have grown by 14.7 per cent, but under Labor in 13 years they grew by only 2.1 per cent. So who has done more for the Australian taxpayers? The Howard government, because it is delivering in so many respects. You only have to look at these milestones: the lowest unemployment level in nearly 30 years; record low interest rates on home loans; low inflation; and high investment.

266,Mr Randall (Canning) (6.02 Pm),"I am delighted to rise in the cognate debate on thetry is booming, but countries do not boom by themselves-just look at New Zealand. Today New Zealand announced that it is concerned about its growth and the downgrades in the forecasts. Yet Australia is booming, because it is being managed well by a strong and capable government led by Prime Minister John Howard and a good team in the Treasurer and the executive. I will also add that members of the government make a solid contribution. I often look across the chamber and wonder to myself how long the Labor Party, as the commentators say, can continue to thrive on dead wood. However, I should not really go into that. This budget was a post-election budget, but what did it do? It gave tax cuts at both ends of the spectrum: it gave tax cuts to compensate for bracket creep in the higher brackets, and it gave tax cuts at the lower end of the spectrum. When I was first elected as the member for Canning, I said I would make it my business to make sure that the so-called working poor got to keep more of their money. Here is a genuine, gilt-edged case of those who are working being able to keep more of their money. This is important to those who work at both ends of the spectrum but, because of the relativity of their wages, it is particularly important to those at the lower end. If they get to keep more of the money that they earn, the working poor, as they are called, are better off and as a result their families are better off. That is why, combined with low unemployment so that more people have a job and with low interest rates and low taxation, Australia has never been better off since the glory days of the sixties. I could go into so many aspects of this great budget which my electorate of Canning has received warmly. I know the Australian people have received it warmly. The only people who have not received it warmly are those opposite, and that is because the budget is too good. They cannot match it. They complain and they talk about $12 tax cuts, yet Mr Beazley knows that when he was in the previous government, led by his great mentor Mr Keating, they promised things such as tax cuts in law which were never delivered. So the Australian people just do not trust them. clear in my electorate as I went around doorknocking before the last election that people were very concerned about what would happen should Labor ever regain the Treasury bench in this country because they know that Labor do not keep their word. Not only do we keep our word but we actually build on it as a government. Clearly, we are a government to be trusted, and that is why the people endorsed us in droves. DareI say it about myself and others of us whom we may wish to mention, our margins went from very low margins to much greater margins because the people believed that we were in a government that would do more for them. One of the aspects of the budget which was heartening to see was the fact that AusLink was again in the forward estimates. The funding will now flow to the states, although only if they sign the bilateral agreement on the construction code and the road funding code. This code, as we know, has currently been taken up by Victoria. South Australia is in the loop, and I am told that Mr Beattie and Mr Carr are heading that way. In Western Australia.

269,Mr Randall,"They just do not trust the Labor Party on economic issues. It was veryhairy chested since he won the election in February and he thinks that he can take until the last moment, but I have inside information that they are about to sign. It is cute, really, isn’t it, because they are about to sign the code which, again, takes contracts on these roads in the AusLink program out of the hands of the union thugs and places them back in the hands of productive small businesses, contractors who want to get on and employ people and local people who want work. So, at the end of the day, Western Australia will sign before the end of the month. In a very surprising development, I have been able to glean something from the Western Australian state government budget papers about one of the main projects that I have been pushing for ever since I have been the member for Canning, the Mandurah bypass. This is the extension of the Kwinana Freeway and the building of the Mandurah bypass, essential infrastructure-and there is much talk about infrastructure-for the south-west and for the Peel region. In the lead-up to the last election the state government were continually asking the federal government to cofund this. ‘We want 50 per cent,’ they kept saying. They originally asked for $150 million, and that was committed through AusLink. The then minister for roads, Senator Ian Campbell, was happy to announce that in the Peel region in Mandurah. With much fanfare, my opposition opponents on a number of occasions turned up with the then transport shadow spokesman, Mr Martin Ferguson-not Mr Laurie Fergusonnents announced that they would match that funding if they were elected. Then the state government got a bit cute and said, ‘Look, it is $170 million now, and we want an extra $20 million.’ So the Prime Minister announced in Perth, with many present, that we would contribute the extra $20 million to build the Mandurah bypass. But he did put a condition on that extra $20 million, which was that construction would begin in 2006. He did that because, like me and the rest of the people in the region, he is suspicious about the state government not getting on with the job. We are suspicious because Alannah MacTiernan, the transport minister in Western Australia, is building a railway from Mandurah to Perth. We applaud her for doing that because it was an initiative of the coalition under the previous Court government. However, she changed the route and has done a number of other things that have now seen the cost of the project blow out from $900 million to $1.5 billion. What does that tell you about her ability to fund something like the Mandurah bypass? It makes it difficult, obviously, because the moneys that should be going into road infrastructure are being sucked into this rail infrastructure. I would like to put on the record that the $1.5 billion being used to build this 100 kilometres of railway is more than the cost of building the Alice Springs to Darwin railway-I think that was $1.25 billion and this is $1.5 billion. You could call it the gold-plated Mandurah railway line. You can see that its cost is absolutely blowing out and as a result they are having trouble funding it. So the condition is that they start in 2006. However, I have been made aware that before signing the bilateral agreement the state government have put a few conditions on it. They want to commit to ‘50 per cent funding’ as the wording when they sign the bilateral agreement. Naturally they want to do that. Why? Because if it blows out and blows out and they do not build it until something like 2012, it will cost much more. If that is the case, it will cost MAIN COMMITTEE",237,Appropriation Bill No 2 2005 2006 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2005 2006 Appropriation Bill No 5 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 6 2004 2005

271,Mr Randall,"I refer to the member for Batman, not the member for Reid. My oppomuch more well into the future, and if the federal government agrees to pay 50 per cent it will be paying much more than it expects to. My understanding is that the project has already been assessed by main roads and, while it is over $340 million already, it is going to cost an extra $100 million-so it will be $440 million. Of course they want to set funding at 50 per cent rather than having a set figure. But in the state budget the state government so far have only allocated $4 million-$3.3 million spent to 30 June 2004. The state government have allocated $82 million towards this project over the period from 2004-05 to 2008-09. Just understand this: if they have only allocated $82 million for that period which finishes in their forward estimates in 2009, they are only half funding it to 2009, given the fact that they have to start by 2006 to get the extra $20 million of federal government moneys. So they are not serious. If they were serious they would be allocating the whole lot. They have a sign on the end of the freeway saying construction will begin in 2007-not 2006 by the way-and yet they are only half funding it. Do they want to build half the freeway or the bypass or are they just putting it there so that they do not have to really start work until 2008-09, which is the time that Alannah MacTiernan has been talking about? What is even worse is that the second tranche of funding of $82 million, which takes the total to $167 million, does not mature until the period 2009-10 to 2010-11. So that is the real time that these people want to build this road: in 2010 or 2011. I am going to expose them through their own budget papers in the local media and the Western Australian media. I am going to show that the state government are not serious about building the Mandurah bypass, because their own figures show that they are not funding it completely until 2011. Mr Laurie Ferguson-Ooh! you have to keep a promise. If you promise something like that, you have to deliver on it. We are a government that deliver on our promises, unlike those opposite. Ms Bird-I am seeking to intervene the intervention? state government funding on this is that the state government say that they have not had a decent response from the federal government. I have said this in this place a number of times, and I will do it again-just very briefly, because I want to move on to something else. Minister Alannah MacTiernan says that we have been tardy in responding to her requests for funding for this essential piece of infrastructure-the Mandurah bypass. YetI have a letter sent from John Anderson, our Deputy Prime Minister, to Alannah MacTiernan, dated 13 February 2002, where he says in essence that the Peel deviation should be determined and there should be decent planning and infrastructure. His letter says: Further planning and design activities you propose for the Peel Deviation should provide necessary evidence for the Commonwealth in determining whether this project should be declared a RONI or not. In particular, detailed planning of these sorts of proposals allow the Commonwealth to prioritise projects with the largest benefit to the nation and provide an appropriate level of certainty in cost estimates for the Commonwealth to be confident of requiring funding levels.

274,Mr Randall,"No, because I have a lot to say. One of the other elements of the lack ofWhen he wrote that we were still on RONIs, so of course he could not respond under the Roads of National Importance program, because she did not reply until 29 June 2003, some 16 months later. So who is tardy in responding? A letter to me from John Anderson 16 months later says: I note your desire for funding for the Peel Deviation West Australian freeway. The West Australian freeway is not a Road of National Importance now because obviously that program has finished and it is a state responsibility. To date, the Western Australian government has not responded to my previous requests for a detailed project proposal and has not allocated any funds for this project. I rest my case. They have not even done the preliminary work. They took 16 months to respond. Is it any wonder that the project changed from Roads of National Importance to AusLink? The state government have had record income through taxes and royalties. Their budget a few weeks ago showed how well-off they are. Yet the people of Western Australia cannot get this decent piece of infrastructure. As we know, if you can take their word for it, their half share is $170 million, yet their estimated bonus GST payment this year was over $200 million. They can get on and build it, and that is what I urge them to do. Taxation is always an important issue to do with budgets, collecting moneys et cetera, but I am always very concerned when the tax office oversteps the mark, and it has overstepped the mark again. People in this House will know that I have been concerned about the way the tax office has treated people involved in schemes that it gave private and public rulings for. We went through the mass-marketed schemes exercise, and there are still people bleeding from that. They lost their houses, their families broke up and some even committed suicide. We have just recently gone through the latest exercise-where the tax office has retrospectively applied rulings to employee benefits arrangements. It is the same story-people’s lives have been destroyed, because they have been retrospectively visited with EBAs. Currently, the taxation office is looking at being retrospective over a 20-year period. It is looking at service trusts established in 1983. There are companies that established service trusts in 1983 that are now under scrutiny from the tax office. Last week, Mr Mark Konza, the Deputy Commissioner, Small Business, at the ATO, and Mr Michael D’Ascenzo, the Second Commissioner of Taxation and Chief Tax Counsel, visited us. When we asked these two gentlemen how they could start visiting operations such as service trusts that have been established for more than 20 years, they said, ‘Look, some of them are out of hand.’ If that is true, we do not want anyone to be rorting, but at the end of the day there is no ruling. They admitted themselves that the Tax Commissioner has only mentioned this in a speech and an article. There have been no rulings and no appropriate guidelines put out. They even admit that it is a grey area and there are no parameters or benchmarks that people can base their assessments on. There was a ruling some time ago called the Phillips ruling which somewhat addressed this. Most people operating in this area believe that they have a 50 per cent deduction and that there is a six per cent to eight per cent mark-up per annum on these service trusts. We know that they are usually used by tax accountants and professionals such as lawyers, doctors et cetera, where they run their office at arms-length. It is absolutely indecent behaviour by the tax office to visit people in a retrospective manner. So when we asked these two gentlemen last week: ‘When are you going to start your retrospectivity? When does the clock start ticking?’-under the new guidelines for selfMAIN COMMITTEE assessment you are not meant to go back more than four years-they could not say whether it was from Mr Carmody’s speech or whether it was from his article, which was apparently only a one-paragraph article, or whether it was meant for some time in the future. How do these people know how to put their affairs in order? It should be prospective, not retrospective. To that end, recommendation 6 of the tax office, in the ROSA report, states: Where the tax office changes a public interpretation or long standing practice to the detriment of taxpayers, that change should become effective prospectively and, where necessary, from a future date that allows affected taxpayers reasonable time to become aware of, and act upon, that new interpretation. The ROSA case is currently taken as future direction. Yet one of the reasons why we have had trouble trying to convince the succession of ministers of this disgraceful behaviour by the tax office is that in some respects they seem to be prisoners of the tax office. I will not name him, but one of the current minister’s staffers was a tax partner in KPMG; his position was national tax director of KPMG. In 1997 KPMG issued tax advice for two mass market arrangements, namely, Freedom Express and Interest Recount, and he was their head man. So why would he then be giving contrary advice to the minister if he has had that position? to get him to address it. Originally he showed good signs in comparison with the previous minister, but currently he has again decided to be manacled by the tax office. The situation is very dangerous when you are taking advice from somebody who seems to be compromised. At the end of the day, I think the tax office is getting above its station in life when it decides to get involved in these sorts of rulings that affect so many people’s lives. In the case of this service trust there are 70,000 taxpayers involved. Seventy-thousand Australians thought they were doing the right thing, some of them for 20 years. Now they are going to be visited by the tax office, who do not even know what the parameters are. So we should be bringing these issues back into the House to be dealt with quite properly as legislation. (Time expired) realities of this budget was presented in the Sydney Morning Herald of 11 May when Matt Wade wrote an article with the headline ‘They’ll be feasting at the top end of town’. Alongside the article was a photograph of a hysterically laughing Peter Costello, obviously pleased with the inequitable taxrefer to members by their title or their electorate, not by name. cally laughing at the realities of the inequities in this budget, a Treasurer who, in his past life, had been a very important activist in reducing the ability of workers to negotiate collectively against employers. The same newspaper contained an article in which the contrasting view was presented, entitiled ‘Painting the town red is out for full-time mum’. That was about a woman with six children who had been unable to obtain child support payments from her husband and who was living on $460 a week. The article was looking at the situation she would be in when her youngest child turned six years of age. That is the contrasting situation in the budget.

280,Mr Laurie Ferguson,"The photograph was of a highly amused Treasurer, hysterihere-that Labor has put up an alternative to the government’s proposal that the Prime Minister and members of this parliament should receive tax cuts of $65 a week. Under Labor’s alternative, large numbers of Australians would receive $12 a week rather than $6 a week. For some people that kind of figure-which seems paltry to members in this House, who are getting the $65 reduction-is indeed very important. We are all aware that under the government’s proposed package 45 per cent of the value of tax cuts go to the top 10 per cent of taxpayers while the remaining 90 per cent of taxpayers share the other 55 per cent of tax cuts. It is a question of tax cuts, a more equitable proposal by Labor so that the vast majority of Australians get a better deal and we do not have this elitist proposal by the government. I hate to offend those on the other side by quoting the ACTU, but they said: As a result of the last two Budgets high income earners stand to gain more than $130 a week in tax and superannuation relief while more than 75% of working people-everyone earning less than $58,000 a year-gets between zero and $6 a week. They also talked about the way in which these families have been hit by higher interest rates under the current government-there has been a major effort by them to increase interest rates since the election-higher petrol prices, and increased medical and education costs. And of course we know of the particular changes on pharmaceuticals and Medicare that have occurred since the election. with children aged six to 16 who apply for parenting pensions will be put on Newstart payments and lose $20 a week over the next three years and that 70,000 people with disabilities will be deemed ineligible for DSP and lose $40 a week in payments. These people are already struggling on payments of just $200 to $240 a week, and they will receive even lower payments under the proposals of the people’s friend, John Howard. We should remember that 88 per cent of sole parent families are headed by women and 92 per cent of parenting payment single recipients are women. That is the reality out there. It is not the conventional picture of the stereotypical analysis by people in backyards across Australia that it is all 15-year-old or 18-year-old teenagers who are having children. The reality is that single parents in Australia, predominantly women, are essentially in their 30s and 40s. That is borne out by the federal government’s own statistics. That is the reality out there: people on very low incomes trying to survive and look after their children. And now we are going to have a situation where they are essentially forced to go out to work as soon as their children turn six. We know there are going to be very unfortunate social consequences of this policy, because many of those people are concentrated in suburbs of very dense housing, transient population areas and housing department areas where virtually everyone has the same problem and social support is minimal. We are going to have very real social problems arising from this government’s policy. It is very interesting to note this thrust against children and parents. One of the crises this country faces is the fertility rate. We lament the decline in the number of children in this country. We look at the overseas experience of countries like Japan and Germany which is much worse than ours. We complain about the ageing of our population. This policy is guaranteed to go further down that road. Rather than having a society which essentially encourages women to move in and out of the work force-to not lose their employment but be able to return to MAIN COMMITTEE their status in organisations-and which supports them in bringing up children, these changes will worsen the situation. In 2002, 49 per cent of children under 12 years of age, or 1½ million children, spent some time in child care. There is a chronic child-care shortage. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates that 175,000 miss out on child care needed by their parents. And what we are going to have is the offer of 84,000 out of school hours places, 2,500 day-care places and 100 athome places, which is going to continue the chronic shortage. We are going to have a situation where there is no funding for long day care places. This means that parents with young children under five years of age will be unable to return to the workplace in a practical sense. We will have a situation where nearly 160,000 sole parents are forced to work and need child care. They will be competing for a minimal number of child-care places in this country. I think the obvious outcome for this is extremely negative. The Treasurer criticised the claim that some welfare recipients were ‘shirkers’. He also questioned the growth in the number of Australians on disability pensions, declaring: Have we really had an outbreak of disability? In contrast, his brother Tim Costello of World Vision Australia said: I think that notion there’s a whole big group out there who are taking taxpayers for a ride is actually profoundly untrue. I think when you are trying and you are really giving it a go, that people assume when there’s low unemployment that you must be a shirker, is disempowering. Those are contrasting views on these changes. The government argues some statistics, such as unemployment rates and interest rates et cetera. But all is not merry in the kingdom. I refer to an article by Tom Bramble in issue No. 54 of the Australian Journal of Political Economy which made a few other points about the reality in this country. He looked at part-time and casual employment. Whereas in 1984, 16 per cent of the Australian work force was casualised, today we see 27.9 per cent in casual employment and a further 28.5 per cent in part-time employment. Thirty-five per cent of new jobs are casualised. While everyone in this country is allegedly so happy, the Australian survey of social attitudes indicated with regard to working hours that two-thirds of people, who because of the power of employers have very little choice in life these days, said that they were working too many hours. In 1992, executive pay in this country was 22 times greater than average weekly earnings. A decade later, in 2002, it was 74 times greater. In the housing market, we have a situation where, in 1996, 43 per cent of people in Australia owned their own house and 28 per cent were paying it off. Now the amount of people owning their own house has declined to 38 per cent of the population. Amongst people aged 25 to 39 years there has been a decline of 10 per cent in home ownership. In the period 1999 to 2004, total earnings in this country of $77 million have been countered by a consumption increase of $110 million. I turn to the household debt to income ratio. In 1996, it was 35 per cent; in 1990, 50 per cent; and, in 2004, 150 per cent. AndI do not need to accentuate the foreign debt or the decline of Australia’s trading situation in elaborately manufactured goods. An article by Kenneth Davidson in Dissent magazine in the summer of 2004-05 made a few points about the great contrast with regard to the export of elaborately transformed manufactures from this country. There was an expansion in their growth rate over the decade to 1996 of 18 per cent. What has the figure been since 1997? Against that 18 per cent rise, there MAIN COMMITTEE has been a rise of 1.7 per cent. The trade deficit has markedly blown out. We have seen a situation where: Behind the smokescreen supplied by the $8 billion budget black hole, Costello slashed $2 billion of R&D, business and export development programs plus funding cuts to universities and training programs. Talking about training, we have come to a very sad situation in this country. Today’s figures from the NCVER on Australian apprentice and trainee statistics note that sad situation. In the 12 months ended December 2004, there were 133,000 withdrawals and cancellations compared with 139,000 completions of apprenticeships. The number of cancellations in the three months ended last December was the highest on record. Those statistics also indicate that the number of apprenticeship commencements fell from 277,000 to 263,000 over the 12 months to December 2004. So what we have in this country is a very serious problem with regard to training in the conventional trades. I recently had the pleasure of attending Granville TAFE College in my electorate, the second oldest in the country and the second largest in Sydney. With the support of the CFMEU, the support of the state government and the interest of local employers and community groups, people were trying against all obstacles-against inactivity and lack of interest by this government-to sponsor young people and get them involved in conventional apprenticeship areas. But it is going to be to little avail because of the stark lack of interest by this government in training. I have to admit: the government do have a solution. Since they have been in government, they have brought in over 400,000 people under the skilled migration category. They have brought 400,000 people into this country to fill the skill absences which they have created. That seems to be the limit of their thinking on this matter. What do we see with the migration intake? When Labor went out of government the current Prime Minister was out there with subliminal messages to the electorate that Labor was a high-migration party, that Labor was dictated by ethnic vote buying, that this is what dictated immigration in this country. A decade later, the man who subscribed to views of a lowmigration future for this country will have an intake next year of 137,000. If you look at the figures, you will see that the total of 137,000 is markedly higher than in most of the Labor Keating-Hawke years. intake? Next we have seen a decline in the refugee humanitarian intake in this country. When the Prime Minister came to power, this country’s concern, involvement and interest in the world was such that 16 per cent of the intake was refugee humanitarians. In the coming year it will, sadly, decline to nine per cent. At the same time family migration has been starkly slashed back. In the current intake, out of that 137,000 next year, 97,000 will be part of the skills intake. If you are an employer, are you going to bother? Are you going to be interested in training anyone when you could just ring up the federal government minister a few days after you have been to the party fundraising function and say: ‘It’s dreadful in Australia. We can’t get employees. It’s really dreadful out there. It’s so hard. When you advertise in the papers there’s no interest. No-one’s skilled enough. Please, please help us.’ The government is so uninterested in our skills future that it thinks it can just turn on the tap.

282,Mr Laurie Ferguson,"I think that is correct. What has been the reality inside thating to do any training under this government, because it is so inclined to see the short-term solution of migration. If we had any hope that it was going to improve under the Howard government, the last budget was very interesting. The initiatives are very minimal. I will develop this more in the exploration of the budget in detail. Most of the expenditure in this budget in the immigration portfolio is for various aspects of the skills intake, which is understandable. But this government has come up with a new and brilliant solution to how we are going to solve skills shortages in this country. It has come up with a new initiative. We are going to import not only labour but also people to do apprenticeships. This is the giant idea that has come out of this government. It will solve our problems by bringing in people to do apprenticeships here. We cannot encourage Australians to do it. We cannot give incentives to employers to make sure they do it. We cannot give benefits to people to finish apprentices. So now we are going to Timisoara in Romania and Timbuktu in north-west Africa to look around for people to come and fill these skills shortages in this country. What future does that indicate for young people in this country? That the government is so uninterested that it sees the future as bringing apprenticeships into the country. They have talked about other initiatives such as these new colleges, which will not produce anyone with a trades degree until 2010. This government say: ‘Things are so desperate that we have to bring in an extra 20,000 people in the skilled intake next year. It’s so desperate this moment-not next week, not in two years-that that we have got to increase the intake at this level now.’ They are bringing in a scheme that is going to bring in more apprenticeships in 2010. If you want any reason why this is happening in this country, look to the sad state of payments to apprentices. It is bad enough that the media promote competition with regard to the lifestyles of other people. It is bad enough that some areas of this employment have been decried and turned down for years by public debate. It is worsened by the amount of money that is paid to these people. It is a concern to people that this is the government’s response. There has been very little research done. We know that one of the initiatives of the government when it first came in was to close down the independent research body which looked at settlement in this country. We have got no real evidence of the connection between the trades, occupations and supposed proficiencies of the people we import and where they actually end up in the labour force. We in Australia are asked to have faith in this budget, to have faith that the skills shortage of this country are going to be solved by a proposal which will bring out tradesmen in another five years time. We are asked to say that this government is going to solve the problem by bringing in people as skilled migrants, with great uncertainty as to whether they will actually work in that occupation. We face the reality that migration processing in these areas takes a year or so on average. So the chronic, immediate crisis which has to be solved tomorrow afternoon is certainly not going to be solved by this initiative. With regard to immigration, I will also briefly talk about the refugee and humanitarian intake. Last year there was great fanfare about an increase in the money spent on the settlement of immigrants under the refugee and humanitarian intake. In reality, if you look at the figures, you see that per capita there was no increase. The only reason that there was a rise was that there was an increase in the intake from 12,000 to 13,000. This coming year we will see a focus on Africa in regard to our refugee and humanitarian intake, a government initiative that MAIN COMMITTEE I support totally and absolutely. However, these people will cost the Australian taxpayers more money per capita because many of them have had very disrupted education, if any education. They have lived in dire circumstances in rural areas, and they have very major family dislocations. If you treat them with the same level of assistance per capita as before, it will not go very far. In conclusion, there is an initiative by the opposition which encompasses a far more equitable tax option for the Australian people. It is a thrust towards doing something about the collapse of infrastructure in this country. There are measures that encourage people back into the work force. There is no stick; there is no persecution. There are no punitive measures to force them back but, rather, there are measures that give them incentives to empower themselves to become part of the work force. I commend Labor’s amendment. 2005-2006 and related bills, and I congratulate the Treasurer on presenting his 10th budget and his eighth budget surplus, which for the 2005-06 year provides an underlying cash surplus of some $8.9 billion. Developing budget surpluses and paying back debt have helped to lower interest rates and to lower inflation. Economic reforms have made our tax system and our economy more competitive and have created some 1.6 million new jobs since 1996, bringing unemployment down to its lowest level in 28 years. This outcome has been achieved because of this government’s outstanding economic management and policy decisions that affect the lives of all Australians. The budget builds on previous budgets which sought to give particular support and assistance to families and small business in order to create greater productivity. It builds on the government’s record of being able to pay off Labor’s massive $96 billion debt, a debt that was costing the budget some $9 billion in interest payments. Australians deserve the lowest possible tax, consistent with responsible budget management. This budget rewards hard work by delivering some $21.7 billion in personal income tax relief over four years, on top of the $14.7 billion delivered in last year’s budget. These tax cuts will increase the reward from work force participation for all Australian taxpayers, assist low-income earners, boost disposable income and improve the competitiveness of our personal income tax system in comparison with those of other developed nations. From1 July this year, the 17 per cent marginal tax rate will be cut to 15 per cent. The 42 per cent tax threshold will increase from $58,000 to $63,000 on 1 July 2005, and to $70,000 on 1 July 2006. The 47 per cent threshold will increase from $70,000 to $95,000, and on 1 July 2006 it will increase again to $125,000. These changes will ensure that more than 80 per cent of taxpayers will face a top marginal rate of 30 per cent or less over the next four years, and from 1 July 2006 the top marginal rate will apply to only three per cent of all taxpayers. Superannuation savings will also be given a significant boost with the abolition of the surcharge on superannuation contributions and relevant termination payments made or received from 1 July 2005. This measure will save taxpayers $2½ billion over the next four years and, together with the co-contribution scheme announced in the 2004-05 budget, demonstrates this government’s commitment to encouraging voluntary savings and boosting retirement incomes.

283,Mr Prosser (Forrest) (6.41 Pm),"I rise in support of the Appropriation Bill (No. 1)There are also additional benefits for seniors. Those who are eligible for the senior Australian tax offset will now pay no tax on their annual income up to $21,968-up from $20,500for singles and on a joint income of $36,494, up from $33,612, for couples with equal income. The Medicare threshold for senior Australians will also be increased to ensure that they do not pay the Medicare levy until they begin to incur an income tax liability. With unemployment at its lowest level in 28 years, when more Australians than ever before are participating in the work force, it is now time to spread that participation further. We want to encourage more people to join the work force. The introduction of the largest ever Welfare to Work program designed to assist moving people who are capable out of welfare and into work is a commendable initiative and will further strengthen our economy in the longer term. Although costly in the short term, this $3.6 billion package provides more incentives for people to work. These are the long and hard decisions that the government is prepared to make for the future of all Australians. If more people are able to move from welfare to work, this will help them with higher incomes and better participation in mainstream economic life. It will also reduce the obligation on other taxpayers, whose taxes pay for welfare support. There are many people of working age who receive income support without any obligation to look for work. I believe that those who are working deserve to know that others who are capable of work are at least looking for work in return for income support. I am sure they agree that the best form of income is from a job. We need to encourage as many people of working age as we can to join the work force. At a time when unemployment levels are at their lowest and in fact businesses are crying out for more workers, it is essential that we invest in higher skill levels so that employers can obtain the skilled labour they need. This is important for the business sector, as upskilling our work force will increase the abilityquestion.

A further $12.6 million has been allocated for an extra 5,000 New Apprenticeships Access Program places that will assist job seekers who experience barriers to skilled employment to obtain and maintain a new apprenticeship.

This will allow young Australians an opportunity to learn the best trade skills. It will enhance the prestige of technical education. I believe we should recognise and value trade training as highly as we recognise other forms of postsecondary education. This government has demonstrated that it is serious about catering to the needs of the 70 per cent of students who do not go on to university. We currently have 394,000 new apprentices in training in this country. The vocational and technical education system has grown by 35 per cent since 1995-from 1.3 million students to more than 1.7 million in 2003. This represents more than one-ninth of the Australian working age population. At a time when we have such low unemployment and an exceptionally strong economy, we will need to meet immediate labour shortages by increasing our skilled migration intake by 20,000 places to 97,500 places in 2005-06. Business will be supporting and identifying their needs for skilled migration and identifying those who can provide it. This initiative will assist businesses in the mining and construction industry, metal trades and fabrication, earthmoving companies and abattoirs in my electorate in the south-west of Western Australia to immediately attract more workers with experience and skills to meet the growing demand for production. In recognition of such areas of skills shortages, this government has demonstrated its support to strengthen efforts to address the current skills needs in some of our key traditional trades and will provide $106 million over four years for trade-learning scholarships in trades experiencing skills needs. This will provide a $1,000 tax-free scholarship from 1 July 2005 through the Commonwealth trade-learning scholarships and will ease the financial burden faced by new apprentices in their first years of training. This, coupled with the allocation of $120 million for new apprentices starting in specific trades experiencing skills needs to obtain tool kits to give them a financial head start in their new career, further demonstrates this government’s commitment to ensure a clever, skilled work force and our future prosperity. It is estimated that around 34,000 new apprentices will benefit from this tool kit provision, valued at some $800 per kit. Along with our $5 billion investment through vocational education and training agreements, these initiatives represent a comprehensive approach to meeting Australia’s skills now and in the future. This 10th budget has allocated record funding of an estimated $8.5 billion to Australian schools and students for the 2005-06 year, an increase of a staggering $589 million or 7.4 per cent over last year. This increase continues the trend of the past nine Howard budgets and highlights the national leadership shown by this government. This budget also commits over $635 million for school capital works, representing an increase of 29 per cent over the previous year, largely due to the roll-out of the Howard government’s $1 billion initiativeInvesting in Our Schools program. A total of $163 million will be provided from the program in 2005-06 to fund state schools’ capital works that school communities have identified. Capital funding for Catholic schools and independent schools in 2005-06 will consist of an estimated $113 million provided through the capital grants program, plus an additional $80 million injected from the Investing in our Schools program. This is a great boost for many of our local public, Catholic and independent schools and addresses the needs that our state governments have tragically failed to address. The Howard government is strongly committed to MAIN COMMITTEE ensuring that every child is given the chance to find and achieve their potential through choice and opportunity in education. I commend this government’s 2005-06 budget initiatives for schools that continue to strengthen the Australian government’s leadership role in schooling across Australia. Last year the government introduced a $19 billion More Help for Families package. In continuing its strong commitment to families, this government will again increase family benefits. It is estimated that around 400,000 families will get an average boost of $24 a fortnight to their family tax benefit part A payments from 1 July 2006 as part of this budget. This boost is the result of an increase in the lower income threshold level to allow low-income families to increase their earnings without affecting family assistance payments. The threshold will be increased by $4,139 to $37,500 from 1 July 2006. It will not only put more money into the pockets of low-income families but also play a significant role in the government’s welfare to work policies and is a key part of a total budget package aimed at removing the barriers which are keeping welfare recipients out of the paid work force. In recognition of the extraordinary effort and contribution carers make by providing constant and daily care for their relatives, friends and those who have disabilities or are frail aged, this government will once again provide a one-off carer’s bonus payment. A bonus of $1,000 will be provided to 90,000 current eligible recipients on the carer’s payment and a bonus of $600 will be paid to 300,000 people receiving the carer’s allowance. We value the work they do and they deserve this recognition. It will cost some $317 million in this year as a bonus is tax free and will not be treated as income when calculating the carer’s social security entitlements. This year’s budget measures continue the Howard government’s strong commitment to carers and builds on last year’s budget initiatives when carers were given more flexibility and support in their care arrangements. Included in the budget is a commitment to Western Australia’s transport infrastructure of over $223 million. This confirms that the Australian government has kept its election promise to contribute an extra $20 million to the Peel deviation, more commonly known as the Mandurah bypass. But the Western Australian state government must come to the party and start major construction works in 2006. I note that it has confirmed that the timetable is achievable. This government will contribute $170 million to the Peel deviation over five years, including $3 million in 2005-06 to continue preconstruction and planning. The extra $20 million has been allocated for 2007-08. When complete the 48 kilometre Peel deviation and the 23 kilometre extension of the Kwinana Freeway will provide a fast freeway link from Fremantle through to the south-west regional cities of Bunbury, Busselton, Margaret River and of course further south to Manjimup, Pemberton, Northcliffe and points south. It will provide better access for producers in the south-west to markets in the city and to export destinations. It will also provide faster access to boost tourism and allay the concerns of residents travelling to and from Perth. Our Roads to Recovery funding program has been renewed for another four years as part of this year’s budget with Western Australian councils receiving $45 million in the 2005-06 period and $76 million in untied local road grants. The Roads to Recovery initiative is important and has been a very successful program. The reason for its success is that it provides funding direct to councils-money that they did not have before and money that is spent on worthwhile road repairs which otherwise they would not have the financial ability to do for quite MAIN COMMITTEE some time. The budget confirms that $1.35 million will be spent on extending the Roads to Recovery program for Western Australia until 2008-09. It is a vital funding injection that the councils need. South-west shires in my electorate of Forrest will benefit from some $13.8 million in funding to address problems with local roads over the next four years. Allocations are as follows: Augusta-Margaret River will receive $1,444,000; Bridgetown-Greenbushes, $1,095,000; City of Bunbury, $1,458,000; Busselton, $2,041,000; Shire of Capel, $818,000; Collie, $865,000, Dardanup, $724,000, Donnybrook-Balingup Shire, $1,000,071; Shire of Harvey, $1,516,000; Shire of Manjimup, $2,121,000; and Nannup, $709,000. To ensure that we minimise dangers on our roads, a further $5 million of federal government black spot funding for the program in 2005-06 will be provided to support Western Australian shire councils and to fix approximately 54 black spot crash locations. This is a key part of the national strategy to reduce Australia’s fatality rate by 40 per cent in 2010. In conclusion, I can reiterate this outlook from the government’s forecasts: solid economic growth, low unemployment and low inflation within the Reserve Bank range. A strong economic performance is no accident. It requires sound economic management and a commitment to ongoing reform. It results in business and consumers that are confident about Australia’s future. It requires prudent policies that lock in our achievements for future generations. All indications are that there is confidence in the business community and an expectation that our economy will provide sustainable profits and employment opportunities for Australians, with an unemployment rate expected to remain around its 28-year low. I commend the appropriations bill to the House. the Labor Party and the Liberal Party. You occasionally hear it said that there are no differences anymore between Australia’s major political parties, but this budget shows that there are real, stark differences. I listened to the debate in the House on the budget and the appropriation bills with some interest. The government have tried some of their favourite tactics. The government members have not defended the skewed nature of the tax cuts, instead they have tried to paint a misleading picture of the opposition’s role. They say the Labor Party is engaging in class warfare or the politics of envy. The hypocrisy of this government never ceases to amaze me. If it were a crime, they would all be in jail. They introduce tax cuts which massively favour one segment of society over another and when the Labor Party dares to point this out government members cry ‘class warfare’. The other tactic is to portray the Labor Party as being opposed to tax cuts or being opposed to tax cuts for high-income earners. Both of these allegations are untrue. In fact, Labor’s plan delivers tax cuts of up to $40 a week for people on upper middle incomes. If you earn $80,000 or $90,000, the tax cut under Labor’s proposal and the government’s are exactly the same. In fact, the tax cuts are the same under both packages up to an income of $105,000 per annum. Indeed, people who earn $125,000 per annum and above will receive a substantial tax cut under Labor, but not one which is 10 times as big as that received by people on average weekly earnings. Under the government’s plan an individual on $125,000 a year will receive a tax cut of $65 a week whereas someone on average weekly earnings will receive just $6. Under Labor’s proposal an individual on $125,000 would receive a tax cut of $40 a week whilst someone on average weekly earnings would receive $12 a week. In fact just one in 35 people across the country will receive substantive tax cuts under what the government proposes.

291,Mr Bowen (Prospect) (7.00 Pm),"This budget shows the real, stark differences betweenI have a particular interest-as you would understand, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins-in Western Sydney. In my own electorate of Prospect, 70 per cent of taxpayers would be better off under Labor’s proposed tax cuts than under the government’s plan. I have no hesitation in, and make no apology for, coming into this House and arguing that the government’s tax cuts are not in the interest of the economy or in the interest of my constituents. There is a very interesting picture in other Western Sydney electorates as well. Two electorates neighbouring mine have an even starker portrayal of how badly tailored the government’s tax cuts are. In the electorate of Lindsay, 75 per cent of taxpayers would be better off under Labor’s plan. Labor’s plan than under the coalition’s. As I said, I followed this debate quite closely. I followed the debate in the House and I thought, ‘It’ll be interesting to see these two members in particular come down and defend the skewed nature of these tax cuts.’ Alas, I was disappointed-neither of them came to the House to defend their position. I must say in fairness that the member for Lindsay did speak on the budget in an adjournment debate. But she did not come to the House to defend the government in the debate on the tax bills and she certainly did not defend the skewed nature of the tax cuts in the adjournment debate. The member for Greenway did not come into the House at all to speak on the budget. I thought I had better double-check in case I missed something as a busy member of parliament going to meetings et cetera. MaybeI missed the members coming into the House to defend these tax cuts. SoI double-checked. I found that in fact they did come down and make a speech about tax-only it was not income tax and, in fact, it was not a federal tax; it was the New South Wales land tax. So the honourable member for Greenway and the honourable member for Lindsay came into the chamber and spoke about a tax they could do nothing about. They condemned a tax they could do nothing about-a tax which has absolutely no policy basis in this chamber. They made an impassioned plea for tax relief for their constituents-the only thing they did not do was talk about a tax cut that they could actually do something about. They did not come down and say to their government colleagues: ‘Sorry, we’re not with you on this one. We’re voting with the Labor Party. We’re looking after our constituents.’ We have seen a bit of that from the government in the last few days. We have seen a bit of courage from some honourable members-the honourable members for Kooyong, Pearce and Cook spring to mind; it is late, but nevertheless it is a bit of courage-but we have seen none on these tax cuts. I do not have a problem with the government’s political tactics. We all have to engage in a little politics from time to time. At the government tactics meeting, they said, ‘We know what we’ll do. The New South Wales government is about to change land tax. They have got a budget coming down next week. They are about to soften it, so why don’t we put a motion on the books calling on them to do it and then we can claim a bit of credit.’ I do not have a problem with that. That is a cute little political tactic. But why didn’t they come into the chamber and talk about a tax cut that they could actually do something about? Why didn’t they come down and say, ‘Seventy-four per cent of taxpayers are better off under Labor in Greenway and 75 per cent are better off under Labor in Lindsay, and we are going to vote for those tax cuts’?

295,Mr Bowen,"In the electorate of Greenway, 74 per cent of taxpayers are better off underAlternatively, why didn’t they come down and explain why they would not? The reason they did not is because they cannot defend the indefensible. They could not come down and recognise that over 70 per cent of their residents, their taxpayers, were better off under the Labor Party. They were not going to listen to them. They both hold marginal seats and they could not bring themselves to come down and defend the indefensible. I was drawn to an article in the Blacktown City Sun, which I read regularly and which covers a very small area of my constituency-although it covers the area where a lot of the constituents of the honourable member for Greenway live. I was drawn to the headline ‘A smirk and a snub’. I wondered who that could have been about, knowing that the Treasurer had recently been in town. The opening paragraph of the story reads as follows: On his first visit to Blacktown, Treasurer Peter Costello dashed the hopes of a rise in the proposed $6 tax cut for people earning $60,000. Mr Costello told the Sun last Wednesday that people would benefit in higher payments in family and disability benefits, child care and welfare to work schemes. So he dashed the hopes of a tax cut and then he said, again, that people would be better off, with higher payments in family and disability benefits, with child care and with welfare to work schemes. It sounds great, but it is wrong. People who are moved from a disability support pension and the sole parenting allowance onto this so-called enhanced Newstart allowance are actually $80 a fortnight worse off. There is no increase in payments. They are $80 a fortnight worse off-and the taper rates are worse. The honourable member for Forrest talked about how wonderful the welfare to work reforms were. I attempted to ask him a question, which he declined to take, which is his right. I was going to ask him how he felt about the increase in the effective marginal tax rates for people moving from welfare to work in this budget-the fact that the taper rate, the withdrawal rate for the parenting allowance, is 40 per cent but on the Newstart allowance it is 60 per cent. They have increased the effective marginal tax rates and reduced the incentive for people to move from welfare into work, but not only did the honourable member for Forrest decline to take a question, it appears that his Treasurer does not understand that people are actually worse off. The other interesting point is that the $6 a week tax cut that people in Western Sydney will receive will be more than eaten up by the next interest rate increase, which is coming as sure as night follows day. These tax cuts will have done more than a little to create the next interest rate increase. It always pays to go back and check the words of the Prime Minister. On 23 September 2004, not that long ago, the Prime Minister had this to say-again I quote: ... and you can promise a few extra dollars here and there but those few extra dollars a week, extra that some people may think they will get from Labor, will be more than swallowed up by an interest rate rise-an interest rate rise of one per cent would add about $125 a month to the average mortgage bill of a family in Australia. So there is no issue that symbolises the importance of economic management more critically than that of interest rates. Here we have the Prime Minister saying that a tax cut which creates increased interest rates is not worth it because the interest rate increase will more than swallow the tax cut. Do not take my word for it; take the word of the Prime Minister of Australia: low interest rates are more important than tax cuts. For once I find myself in agreement with this Prime Minister. It would not be so bad if the people who were going to be hit hardest by the interest rate increase actually got a decent tax cut. If the people who were struggling with mortgages in FairMAIN COMMITTEE field, Blacktown and Penrith actually got a decent tax cut and then interest rates were increased, at least it would not be so bad. But what we see instead is what I call the Prime Minister’s pincers: higher interest rates and lower tax cuts. People who are struggling with mortgages will be hit by higher interest rates and lower tax cuts. What is more, the government’s cuts will lead to higher interest rates. They will increase consumption. Because these tax cuts are so badly skewed and badly targeted, they will increase consumption in a most pernicious manner, and we will see the people hardest hit by the interest rate increase getting the lowest tax cut. That is what we will see happening with income tax, but the members on the opposite side, the vast majority of whose electors would be better off under the Labor plan than under the Liberal plan, refuse to come into the House and justify their position and refuse to vote for Labor’s amendments. They refuse to show any courage. But the problem is not just income tax. We have heard a lot about infrastructure in recent weeks and months. We have heard the government and many other people talk about the massive lack of investment in infrastructure that we have seen in this country in recent times. However, this budget, frankly, does nothing for infrastructure. The government have created a future fund, which could have been used for infrastructure. The capital or the interest could have been used to spend on infrastructure, either of which would have been an improvement. What we see instead is the capital locked up-I think the Treasurer calls it a locked box-and the interest and the revenue returned to be spent on paying superannuation. We need to pay superannuation, but this is all a matter of balance. This is a matter of assessing what is more important in the national interest. The crisis facing our infrastructure, I would submit to the House, is much more important than the relatively small levels of unfunded superannuation that we see in this economy. But it does not finish there. What we also see is the government refusing to act on the tax disincentives for investment in infrastructure. This problem has been around for years. The Fraser government, when the current Prime Minister was Treasurer, brought in a section of the tax act which is now known as section 51AD. It was a perfectly legitimate amendment to make at the time-in 1983. It was designed as an anti tax avoidance measure, to stop people pretending to invest in income-generating projects which were really not income-generating projects. That was a worthwhile thing to do. Since then the world has moved on. Now we see a great increase in public-private partnerships across the country. They are entered into mainly by state governments but also, partly, by the federal government-and also by a few of the larger local councils around the country. Section 51AD of the tax act has been interpreted by the tax office-I think correctly-as saying that a private company investing in an infrastructure project is in many cases not able to claim the expenses that they put into that project for tax purposes. So you have a situation like the one involving the Eastern Distributor freeway, for example, in New South Wales. The freeway was built by the Carr Labor government several years ago, in a private-public partnership with Leighton. It is a very good road and everybody recognises that. However, the tax office ruled that for taxation purposes Leighton could not claim all the expenses-from concrete to reinforcement and everything else-that had gone into building that very expensive freeway, although Leighton would be taxed on the income from the tolls. That was a pretty extraordinary ruling. Eventually the tax office changed its mind and said, ‘Yes, we’ll let you MAIN COMMITTEE claim the expenses.’ The basis of its original ruling was that in fact the New South Wales government was in control of the asset, because the New South Wales government determined the phasing and the sequence of the traffic lights-a pretty amazing ruling. The tax office eventually overturned that ruling, but not until some six months later. Here we have a situation where we are desperate for infrastructure, and we are desperate for private sector investment in infrastructure. The government cannot afford-and no government could afford, no matter what side-to put in all the money that is required for infrastructure investment in this country. No government could afford to do that. We are seeing more and more governments moving to private sector partnerships, and yet this government refuses to act on the biggest single tax disincentive to private sector investment in this country. The Australian Council for Infrastructure Development says it is the biggest single problem for infrastructure investment in this country. The government, to their shame, acknowledge that there is a problem. They acknowledge that something should be done, and they do nothing about it. They acknowledged four years ago that this section of the tax act needed to be amended. They acknowledged four years ago that this needed to be dealt with. They put out a discussion paper. Three years ago they gave us their preferred option, and since then it has sat in the big round filing cabinet underneath the Treasurer’s desk-it is called the garbage bin. It has gone absolutely nowhere. They have abrogated their duty to amend section 51AD of the tax act. They recognise that it is a problem and they refuse to do anything about it. I suspect it will take a Labor government to come into office and do something about it. In the same way, despite all the rhetoric we hear from the government about how they are the friends of business and they are the people who can make things happen and they are the can-do government, it is the Labor governments across the states-particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, but also in Queensland-who have entered into partnerships with private industry to see infrastructure actually being built. We have seen the New South Wales government enter into private sector partnerships to build the Eastern Distributor, the M5, the Sydney Harbour tunnel, the Cross City tunnel and the Lane Cove tunnel. That is just in New South Wales and that is just in the last few years. Major roads are being built in partnership with the private sector and with no assistance from the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth is making the situation worse by refusing to amend section 51AD of the tax act. So in two areas-in income tax and in a much more specialised and esoteric area, section 51AD of the tax act-we see this government being completely out of touch with what is needed. What is needed on income tax is real and proper tax relief for the hard working Australians in the middleand low-income brackets. We all like a tax cut. Everybody likes a tax cut. People at the upper end of the income scale like a tax cut, and they deserve a tax cut. Under Labor they would get one. What they do not deserve, frankly, is a tax cut 10 times bigger than that received by people on average weekly earnings. This government should hang its head in shame for bringing in a tax cut which gives a massively skewed benefit to those at the upper end of the socioeconomic scale. Under Labor’s plan people at the upper end of the income scale would get generous, worthwhile, necessary and deserved tax cuts, but they would not get obscene tax cuts, which is what this government proposes. This government proposes tax cuts of $65 for people at the upper end of the income scale-10 times the $6 tax cuts they propose to give people on averMAIN COMMITTEE age weekly earnings. That is a matter of some shame. Again, I call on the member for Greenway and the member for Lindsay to explain themselves and to justify their position. I call on all government members who represent seats with lower income constituents-and there are quite a few such members-to explain why they refuse to vote for Labor’s amendments under which tax cuts for people on lower incomes are greater than they are in the government’s scheme. I again call on the government to finally do something about section 51AD of the tax act, so that we can get some private sector investment in infrastructure in this country.

300,Mr Hockey,"The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the follow(5) Is the Minister aware that where one member of a couple is a pensioner they feel they are discriminated against because they only receive half of the TAL although a single pensioner receives the full TAL amount. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Government does not believe that there are any anomalies in the Telephone Allowance legislation. (2) Telephone Allowance is paid to assist pensioners and certain beneficiaries with the costs of maintaining a telephone service. Part 2.25 of the Social Security Act 1991 requires that a person be a ‘telephone subscriber’ to receive Telephone Allowance. Some telephone companies may offer a service that enables a person to only receive incoming calls, however people with such a service are still regarded as being telephone subscribers for the purpose of Telephone Allowance. (3) Where members of a couple are separated due to ill health, each customer is treated as an individual. Where both partners of an illness separated couple have separate telephone services connected in their names, the full rate of Telephone Allowance may be paid to both partners. (4) and (5) Telephone Allowance is paid to eligible telephone subscribers to support a single telephone service. Where both members of a couple are eligible for Telephone Allowance, each receives the partnered rate (equivalent to half the allowance). This ensures that the same amount of Telephone Allowance is paid to support a telephone service for both couples and single people. Where one partner is not eligible, and does not receive an income support payment from either Centrelink or the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, the partnered rate is still payable to the eligible partner. These payment rules are consistent with a range of other supplementary payments. Honey Imports (Question No. 1209) Mr Gibbons asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, in writing, on 10 May 2005: (1) For the period April 2004 to April 2005, what proportion of imported honey was tested for nitrofurans and what were the results of the testing? (2) What guarantee can he give that imported honey arriving in Australia is free of chemicals and, in particular, free of nitrofurans? (3) What steps has he taken to ensure that imported honey containing nitrofurans is not blended with Australian honey to help preserve the clean green image of the Australian honey industry? (4) Can he provide information on proposals to test all imported honey to ensure that it is chemical and pesticide free and that it meets the same standards as Australian honey? (1) The proportion of imported honey tested for nitrofurans in the period April 2004 to April 2005, was 79 out of 350 consignments. Only one consignment was found to have a level of nitrofurans that exceeded the level of detection and failed. (2) Imported honey arriving in Australia must meet the requirements of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code (FSC), which applies to all food available for sale on the Australian market. Imported honey is subject to inspection and testing on arrival at a rate of 10% of all consignments to verify compliance with the FSC. Honey is tested for a range of residues in accordance with the requirements of the FSC, including nitrofurans and its metabolites, chloramphenicol, pesticides listed in the FSC, sulphonamides, streptomycin and tetracycline. A very high level of compliance is evident.",259,Questions In Writing

302,Mr Truss,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) Imported honey found to contain nitrofurans is prevented entry into Australia. Further, knowingly importing foods that do not comply with requirements under the Imported Food Control Act 1992 carries significant penalties, including fines and/or a term of imprisonment. (4) All imported honey is currently tested according to a risk-based testing program to ensure compliance with the FSC and hence, the same standards as those required for Australian honey. Given the evidence of high levels of compliance of imported honey with the FSC, imposing an increased testing regime would be unnecessary and difficult to justify.
