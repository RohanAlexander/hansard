It appears that i d . per able member for Newcastle, or with queston is charged for the carriage of New South Wales coal, and f d . per ton for the carriage of Victorian coal. Will the Prime Minister be good enough to inquire into this tion involving a point of law to be put matter, and see whether the arrangement is not a breach of the Constitution? few moments ago, that the question was to be asked, and therefore, I am not prepared with the requisite information.

I understood the right honourable gentleman to reply that the matter would no doubt be [REPRESENTATIVES.] Railway Rates. dealt with by the Government of .New South Wales, t wish to ask him whether, under the Constitution, the Commonwealth Government is not empowered to deal with that or any other matter which involves a derogation of trade, or a preference to any one State over another? If that be so. 1 desire to ascertain what action the Government intend to take with a view to preventing a continuance of the practice of charging differential rates, and of entering into different arrangements in respect of^ the carriage of various commodities as between State and State? Mt. REID -The honourable member must know that I cannot remember one-half of his question. whether there is not a provision in the Constitution empowering the Commonwealth Government to deal with matters such as that which was referred to by the honortions arising out of the extension of a preference to any State? to some legal authority other than myself; but I do not think that we require any legal education to know that the Constitution provides remedies for abuses of the principle of equal ' trade throughout the Commonwealth. The honourable member certainly was correct in saying that he did not hear my reply. I did hot at all question the power -of the Commonwealth .to ferred to. I merely said that I had no information whatever upon the subject, and therefore felt under a serious disability in replying to the question. I did refer to the Government of New South Wales as a power, which, I suppose, would be specially interested in any infraction of ""the provisions of the Constitution affecting its own. particular industries, .but in no sense did I question the right of the Commonwealth to take the proper course. Sir WILLIA M LYNE Following upon my previous question, I desire to ask the Prime Minister, who admits that the Commonwealth is empowered under the provisions of the Constitution, to deal with matters similar to that which was raised in the question of the honourable member for Newcastle, whether he will take action in connection with certain cases which have engendered a great deal of irritation, not only in New South Wales and Victoria,",12,Setup

I do not know that it is necessary to appoint an Inter-State Commission just yet. I think that I shall shrink from the multiplication of billets in the Commonwealth, so far as I can, but I shall certainly endeavour to remedy existing anomalies without recourse to the expensive proceeding to which reference has been made by the honourable member. it is the duty of the Government to take notice of any infraction of the provisions of the Constitution, and to do its utmost to prevent it. position to have all the papers in the Departments bearing on such complaints brought under my notice.

A t present a great deal of confusion exists by reason of the fact same name. I am.' aware that the matter has already been looked into, and I shall be glad if the honourable gentleman will inform the House what action he is taking in regard to it . a good deal of confusion has arisen owing to the fact that there are in the various States several post towns of the same name, and as far as possible the Department is trying to rectify matters. I have the matter in hand, and I hope before long to make arrangements which will remove the difficulty. flicting statements in the press to-day in regard to the consecration of the banners presented to the Australian Light Horse, one being that the Minister of Defence has refused to allow them to be consecrated in any cathedral, and the other that they are to be consecrated at Albert Park on the King's Birthday. What is the intention of the honourable and learned gentleman ? MrM c CAY It was stated in one of In reply to the honourable the newspapers that it had been arranged to consecrate the banners in rhe Melbourne Anglican Cathedral, but that statement was incorrect. No such proposal has been I do not know whether any made to me. I am endeavouring to have the banners consecrated at a parade, by chaplains of the Commonwealth Forces. The consecration is a religious ceremony, which is invariably followed in fhe British Army, and is provided for in the King's Regulations. and learned gentleman think that it is time that we did away with such a ceremony ?provide a form of prayer, which is to be At the same time.

I would also ask, as the senior chaplain, if a Protestant, belongs to a Christian denomination, whether the Minister will permit representatives of nonChristian denominations, who are citizens and taxpayers of the Commonwealth, to be represented and take part in the ceremony ? learned member's zeal is a little puzzling to .me. When I saw the paragraph in the newspapers a few days ago with regard to the proposed consecration of the colours in the Anglican Cathedral, I bore in mind the fact that we have no State church in Australia. I sent to the Barracks for information as to whether the statement was correct, and drew attention to the fact that there was no State church in Australia, and that, therefore, I did not think it desirable to have the ceremony nerformed in :he church of any particular denomination, whether the Church of England or otherwise. I believe that it is the proper thing for us to follow the practice that has been pursued in Great Britain for centuries. The ceremony of consecrating the colours is not an elaborate one, but consists practically of a prayer, or what else? and I think that it is a very proper thing to ask for a blessing upon the colours of such an organization. in connection with the Defence Bill to make the force an aggressive one.

I further assume that he is a Protestant. T believe that he belongs to the Church of England. I have asked the General to arrange that the chaplains from each denomination which has chaplains in the Forces shall be asked to join in the service. I have no reason to suppose that there will be any refusal.

I hope that honourable members will not interject further questions which mav possibly prevent the Minister, in some cases, from giving the replies he desires. If honourable members desire supplementary information they can seek it by asking further questions after the Minister has resumed his seat. there are, in the Victorian Forces, chaplains representing the Church of England, the Presbyterian Church, the Methodist Church, and the Roman Catholic Church. There may be others, but I do not know of them. Probably there is also a representative of the Congregational Church.

I think I have taken every reasonable precaution that could be observed to insure that no procedure shall be followed that could give rise to any just criticism on the ground of preference or injury to any one church. was in no spirit of levity that I just now asked the Minister a question by interjection. It was with the f u l l recognition of the value of prayer that I submitted the question, and I again ask it, because it seems to me improper to talk of consecration under such circumstances.

Of course, if he refuses to reply, I have no remedy. to give an answer. Minister had any objection to allow any denomination which is not represented by a chaplain, or any denomination which, representing taxpayers, is non-Christian, to be present at the consecration of these banners ? MrM c CAY I do not propose to invite any denomination to be officially represented at the consecration of the banners, except those which have chaplains in the Forces. MrM c DONALD ster correctly reported in the following paragraph, which has appeared in the Melbourne AgeI made inquiries recently in connection with the rolls in relation to a Federal election, and I found that-especiall y with regard to the rolls oE New South Wales and Victoria-ther e were an enormous number of changes necessary. It is estimated that there are in the two States 300,000 lo 400,000 alterations necessary, owing tn removals and other causes. This means that there are 300,000 or 400,000 persons who, if an election was held now, would be off the rolls, or in a place which is equivalent to being off the rolls. When members clamour to the Government to dissolve in consequence of the narrow division of parties, Ministers have to remember their responsibility lo the people. but I was careful to understate, rather than to overstate, the figures furnished to me by the officers of the Electoral Department. It is only fair to say that the present state of the rolls is due to the incessant changing of residence.on the part of a large por-. tion of the population. It has been esti1 have seen mated by a competent authority that 30 per cent, of the electors on the rolls change I do not know, but I their place of residence during the course of a year. not move out of the division for which they are enrolled, and, therefore, would not be disfranchised. a certain extent; but it was impossible for me to go into details. Of course, if a man merelv moves from one part of a division to another, his right to vote is not affected, because his name remains upon the roll for that division. The statement in the Age, read by the honourable'member for Kennedy, understates the information supplied to me. South Wales rolls practically up to date? i'he house-to-house collection of names by the police was begun last July, and was completed before the last Government left office. Of course, the insertion of the names thus collected in -the rolls will take some little time; but is not the work nearly, if not quite, finished now? to the honourable member I may say that the collection of the New South Wales rolls has only been completed within the last week or two. The work was largely completed previously, but not absolutely. The present rolls are the old rolls with all their I s the Prime Minierrors and defects, and if they are to be altered Revision Courts must be held. altered? the intention, but Revision Courts must be held, and the alterations must be made by those Courts after due notice has been given. As things stand at present the imperfect rolls would be used with supplementary rolls, correcting as far as possible the errors in the original rolls. Steps are being taken to have collections made as quickly as possible, but my honourable friend will recognise that in this matter a delay in one State keeps back the work in other States. That is to say, while we may make progress in one State we cannot have the whole of the rolls for the Commonwealth put right until the collection in all the States is completed.

They are being dealt with by the Department for the purpose of making preparations for the holding of Revision Courts, and issuing the new rolls. Minister of Home Affairs whether he can afford the House any information as to the time which will be necessary to make the electoral rolls anything like complete? I understand that the work was commenced some time ago. I know that the honourable member for Boothby, while he was Minister of Home Affairs, set it going. That was several months ago. If the Department is not ready to bring matters to an issue by having the rolls 'revised, it seems to me that that fact is a serious reflection upon it. say that there has been no slackness whatever in dealing with the matter since I have been in the position lately occupied by the honourable member for Boothby.. But although before the honourable member left office initial steps were being taken,the collection had not been arranged for in some of the States, owing to difficulties which had arisen in those States. attention has been given to-the matter, and every effort has been made to complete the collection preparatory to the revision of the rolls, with the object of creating new and correct ones. The time that will be occupied, after the collection has been made, in producing the revised rolls will be, roughlyspeaking, about three months. After the collection is complete, 'Revision Courts have to be held, after legal notice, throughout each State. Then the rolls have to be revised for printing purposes. Then the printing has to take place. Those processes cannot occupy less than three months. They may even occupy four months. Sir tell us anything about the state of the rolls in Western Australia ? If he has any information I should be glad to hear it. that honourable members ought to give notice of such a catechism as has been launched upon me; but I can tell the right honourable member for Swan that one of the States in which the collection had not been arranged for was Western Australia. culty with that State has only recently been overcome, and the work is proceeding.

The Department has no information as to the number of boys selected in South Australia. 2. Entries are made by the Imperial officers i i accordance with the Regulations prepared by the Commander-in-Chief on the Australian Station; and, as far as possible, the number is alloted in proportion to the population of the various States. Candidates must be British subjects of European extraction, of good character, able to read and write the English language, and must have resided for at least three years in Australia or New Zealand immediately prior to entry. of the required standard, which, for boys, isAge, between 15 and 17.

That message relates to a motion carried in the Senate in reference to the tobacco monopoly, and providing in effect that in order to provide the necessary money for the payment of old age pensions, and for other purposes, the Commonwealth Government should undertake the manufacture and sale of tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes, and that a Select Committee, consisting of six members of the Senate, with power to confer with a similar number of members of the House of Representatives, should be appointed to inquire into and report on the best method of carrying the resolution into effect. It would be to some extent inconvenient for me to move a motion in those terms, because honourable members would necessarily be debarred at this stage from discussing the nationalization of tobacco. All that I ask the House to do is to agree to the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into and report upon the present position of the tobacco trade, and to consider whether it is desirable for the Government to . take over the business, deal It may be asked why I shouTd move this motion, instead of waiting until the message of the Senate is reached in the ordinary wav. Mv chief reason for adopting this course is that I desire that something shall be done this session, and that T do not think for one moment, that this House would be likely to pass a resolution providing for the nationalization of the tobacco industry, in The absence of some kind of preliminary inquiry. I also (Boothby) I think thai it is now too late for a Select Committee to make any proper inquiry. The appointment of a Royal Commission must necessarily be made if any inquiry worthy of the name is to take place. I should prefer to see the Royal Commission appointed .while the House is in session, instead of the matter being left over tor the Government to deal with after we have gone into recess. The toBacco trust is the first of any importance that has been formed to deal with a business of any large volume in Australia, and it is desirable that the Parliament of the Commonwealth should now indicate what view it takes of the creation of such monopolies. It would certainly be interesting to ascertain how honourable members are disposed to regard anything in If honourable members the shape of a monopoly in this direction. I ask whether it would not be wise, at the very earliest moment-befor e the monopolistic octopus can fasten its tentacles on the industries of Australia--for the Parliament to determine whether some better method of conducting the business cannot be adopted. I intend to confine my remarks not to the advocacy of the nationalization of the tobacco trade, but to the desirableness of a Commission being appointed to inquire first of all as to the existence of a monopoly, and its effects, so far as they can be ascertained, and then, as to what shape any legislation, if necessary, should take, in order to deal effectively with the matter. On the 14th March, 1903, the Age announced that, with a view to fight the American Tobacco Company, which had extensive ramifications all over the world, and intended to compete for the control of the Australian trade, the two largest tobacco manufacturing companies in Australia-Dixson' s and Camerons' had amalgamated, and about the same period they issued a circular, stating that the object of the amalgamation was to fight the American Tobacco Company. A few days afterwards it was announced or to that the amalgamated company, which was with it in some other way. called the British-Australian Tobacco Manufacturing Company, had acquired the Australian business of T. C. Williams, of Richmond, Virginia, an American tobacco manufacturer who had perhaps the largest sale of aromatic imported tobacco in Australia-that is, that they had acquired the sole right of distributing their tobacco. A little later the company also acquired the business of David Dunlop. who manufactured chiefly the "" D e r by "" brand of",18,Export Of Produce

He cannot sell at what price he likes. There are no competing travellers. There is no competition amongst the manufacturing firms for the leaf grown in Australia. The advertising has been lessened very largely. There is now no possibility of the tdoacco-grower being able to place his goods hi the best market, because there is but one market.

The one object of the combine is, of course, to get the greatest amount of profit by controlling the industry.

The principal point is that all the retailers, and the growers, and the employees of the companies are now servants of the combine. They are not free agents any longer. They depend entirely upon the combine for their living, and must accept the conditions imposed upon them, or go entirely out of the business.

Similar combinations are doing exactly the same all over the world, wherever they have an opportunity. It is of no use for honourable members opposite to endeavour to raise side issues. In reference to the growers of tobacco being In some cases they have in the hands of the combine, I should like to point out that the Wangaratta and KingI do not intend River Growers' Associations, and some other associations, have appealed to this Parliament, and have passed resolutions asking that the tobacco industry shall be nationalized.

It would be extremely interesting if we could ascertain the extent know that it is difficult even for a Royal to which the cost of production of tobacco has been reduced by the operations of the combine. cost of production has been lessened, because the duplicating of machinery has been done away with, travellers have been dispensed with, and there is no longer any necessity to indulge in expensive advertising. tute arguments in favour of the nationalizain regard to this industry is necessary or tion of the industry. are arguments in favour of monopoly.

That a monopoly does exist is beyond question, and the fact that it places the whole industry in the hands of a few persons, whose interests may not always be in harmony' with those of the public-and who may therefore find themselves in a position in which they would not carry on the trade to the best interests of the public --show s that it is at all events a matter that only when good cause is shown.

I presume, Mr Speaker, that I have, by rising now, prejudiced my right to speak on this motion at a later stage ? honourable member has begun his speech. this motion has emanated from the honourable member for Boothby, we may be quite sure that it is the desire of those who support his request that the inquiry for which he asks shall be as fair and open as possible. We all know that the Prime Minister will be charged with the appointment of the Commission, and that both he and those honourable members who mainly wish to see an inquiry held, having put forward the honourable member for Boothby to move this motion, are actuated only by a keen desire to get at the facts. Honourable members opposite do not wish to nationalize the industry if any other means, more profitable to the people of Australia, can be devised. So much information was given by the honourable member for Boothby that I cannot at present deal with all the phases of his speech. I very much regret another task during portion of the time occupied by him in placing his views before the House, and that consequently I was unable to follow him with that degree of attention necessary to enable me to do him anything like justice in replying to his argu1 ments. I thought that the honourable member would perhaps have no objection to the adjournment of the debate; but I find that other honourable members are now prepared to carry on the discussiona fact that certainly was not evident when I rose. I I can hardly conceive think, therefore, that I can safely leave the matter in their hands. They will be in quite as good a position as I am to carry on the debate. The question must, of course, be fully discussed before the House is asked to authorize the considerable expenditure involved in the appointment of a Royal Commission. I hope that other Honourable members will be prepared to take up the cudgels of economy, and to urge that a Royal Commission should be appointed cerely hope that if tbe Commission be appointed it will be only after strong proof has been adduced that it is necessary that the State should incur this expense, and that it will be such an impartial body as I am sure the honourable member for Boothby would desire. be a tendency on the part of honourable members to ask for the appointment of Royal Commissions, and if this tendency is to go on increasing we had better consider the desirableness of abolishing Parliament, leaving Royal Commissions to deal with every question that a Legislature might otherwise be called upon to consider. I would suggest that tbe motion be amended so as to provide, in the interests of economy, for the appointment of a Select Committee rather than a Royal Commission. appoint a Select Committee. statements which have been made by the honourable member for Boothby, but it must not be forgotten that they are ex -parte. No Government should be expected to appoint a Royal Commission simply because of lurid statements made by an honourable member.

I am aware, however, that the position of sellers of tobacco is a very serious one. The tobacconists are fast being placed in a position similar to that of publicans in tied houses. Those who sell tobacco and tobacconists' goods, are practically at the mercy of the trust, which can demand what it likes for its goods while the retailers have to be satisfied with the minimum of profit, which is so small that they are not as well off as decently-paid employees would be. They have to pay their rent, and all the expenses of their businesses, while nearly all the profit is obtained by the trust.

179,Mr Groom (Darling Downs),"The Secretary to the Department, saysfrom ,£50,000 to £75,000 in connection with the exportation of apples. If proper regulations had been in force with regard to the shipment of fruit, that loss would probably never have been experienced, and the reputation of our fruit-growers and our produce would not have suffered. We know that in the United States great savings have been effected by reason of the prompt treatment of diseases in plants and animals, and that the material wealth of the community has been considerably enhanced by the inquestion of oversea freights, with the troduction under the advice of the Agricultural Department of better classes of fruit, timber, and cereals, and of various plants which have been found to thrive in \hat country. In all these matters an Agricultural Department can work great changes for the better, and I am sure that it would not be long before we reaped the advantages of such an institution in the Commonwealth. It would become a great educational centre. We all know that with regard to agriculture, there is hardly a discovery in science, or an advance made in chemistry that has not some practical effect upon primary production. We know that every advance made by inventive genius tends to assist the producers to obtain better returns for their produce. From whatever stand-point we view the matter, it is exceedingly desirable that a Department of Agriculture should be established. During the course of this debate the honourable and learned member for Indi suggested that if the Government could not see their way to establish such a Department, even upon modest lines, they might at least .appoint a Standing Parliamentary Committee of Trade and Commerce. Personally, I am of opinion that the subject of immigration should also be included. I have taken the trouble to examine the Canadian system, and I find that it constitutes an exceedingly healthful adjunct to the Legislature of the Dominion. There, the Standing Parliamentary Committee, which meets from time to time, considers all matters put before it in respect of agriculture. It also inquires into the work performed by the High Commissioner in the old country, with a view to advancing the material interests of Canada, and securing a good stream of immigration to the Dominion. The advantage to be gained from the appointment of such a Committee is that it can be established at ""the present time without involving the Commonwealth in any very heavy expenditure. It would have before it a lot .of work, the carrying out of which would render great assistance to this Parliament. Only the other day the fruit-growers met in conference, with a view to considering their position generally, ancl of approaching the Commonwealth Parliament with a request that it should place their industry upon a better footing. That conference dealt with the question of bills of lading under the provisions of the Navigation Bill, with the inspection of fruit between port and port, with the important handling of fruit between State and State, and with various other matters. In Canadai : would have been quite open to the members of that body to come personally before the Parliamentary Committee, and to supply it with definite information.' It would then have been competent for the Committee to submit a report to Parliament, ancl practically to initiate legislation upon outside advice ""of the very best description. I find, also, that in Canada this Committee is used for the purpose of disseminating information, which is supplied by the various branches of the Department of Agriculture there. For instance, I notice that in the course of one year, the Committee took evidence in regard to cereals and root crops from the Director of the Dominion Experimental Farms, and, in regard to insect and fungus diseases from the Government Entomologist and Botanist of Experimental Farms. It also examined witnesses upon the composition of manures, soils, &c, the selection of dairy cattle, and the care and growth of fruit for market. Those engaged in these industries were able to appear before the Committee in person. The officers of the Department speak very highly of the Canadian system. In discharging their various duties, in their own particular way, they did not previously come into contact with members of the Legislature. But, under the system at present in vogue, they are able to appear before the Standing Parliamentary Committee, and to supply information relating to the nature of the experiments which they have conducted during the previous year, to the diseases in plant and animal life which exist in the community, and to the expansion and growth of various products. As a result they become better acquainted with the need which exists for legislation in regard to any particular industry. Official reports are also supplied as to the growth and expansion, of various industries, and, acting under instructions from' the Committee, these are widely circulated. The public are thus informed of the nature of the experiments which are being conducted under the auspices of the Department, and in many other ways those who are engaged in production are assisted. Committee's reports upon the subject of immigration. Parliament with the causes which militate against immigration, and it thus places the Legislature in-a position to combat them. In Australia we have not a Federal Department of Agriculture upon which such a Committee could work. point out that these Departments, in addition to agricultural colleges, exist in six of the States. mentary there is not the slightest reason v hy it : should not call before it the experts of the various States, and thus afford them an opportunity of federalizing the results of their Departments. Bvthat means we could accomplish much that is being done in Canada at the present time. We should be able to do this, without involving the Commonwealth in any great expenditure. At an early date I think that we should establish a Federal Department of Agriculture. Of course, there is no need to adopt the lines which have been followed in the United States. But there is great need for the creation of such a Department, in order that we may give effect to the legislative powers vested in the Commonwealth. many powers which were formerly exercised by the States have now passed to tt.e Commonwealth. and Telegraph. Defence, Meteorological, ancl Statistical Departments, as well as the subjects of quarantine and'the payment of bounties, have been transferred to our hands. In the past the States have used these Departments to assist their primary producers. It seems to me, therefore, that by superseding certain services which already exist in six different States, we might make a beginning in the establishment of a Department of Agriculture. We already control the Post and Telegraph Department, and in connection with it, we should establish our Meteorological Department. In the United States, it fulfils a most important function in connection with the Department of Agriculture, though originally it was a branch of At the present time, we have in Australia Mr Groom. several Meteorological Departments. These are practically duplicating their work; but their operations are restricted to a. certain area within their respective States. If the Commonwealth established a Meteorological Department, it should be Equally important are the one worthy of the name, and one in which great reliance could be placed, because its It is able to acquaint sphere of operations would embrace the whole of Australia. By creating a central office, weather reports from all parts of the Continent could be received twice a day. We should thus obtain sounder forecasts than we at present receive. We could also But I would secure information from outside our own shores which would greatly enhance the value of those forecasts. Indeed, a DepartIf a standing Parliament of Meteorology is one of such importCommittee were appointed, ance that I marvel we have not made more progress in that direction. In one year the saving to shipping alone would more than compensate for the cost of its establishment. As honourable members are aware, very great reliance used to be placed in the forecasts which were issued by Mr Wragge before his department was abolished. It is admitted that they were of very material assistance to mariners and others. We know also that in certain parts of Australia, considerable injury is caused by early frosts. A reliable forecast in matters of this kind would effect a great saving to us. I recollect reading a letter from a Tasmanian farmer, in which he declared that by watching the forecasts which were formerly issued by Mr WraggeA great in Queensland, he was able to reap his harvest at the proper time, and thus to save it. It is so obvious that substantial gain would For instance, the Post result from the establishment of this department that it seems unnecessary for me to dwell further upon the point. I maintain that its creation would be the essence of true economv, because the work which is at present being carried out by the various States, 1 would be more efficiently performed. For example, the services of the telegraph operators throughout Australia could be requisitioned to assist in making this institution exceedingly valuable. Another important branch which should be created in connection with a Department of Agriculture is a statistical branch. In the United States a Statistical Bureau has been established to collect the figures 1 elating to its imports, and to agricultural production. At the present time we have six different Statistical Departments in Australia, and we know the Army Service Department. the difficulty that is experienced in obtaining reliable statistics, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. properly organized department, I claim that we could secure very much bet:er results. We should have uniformity of system, regularity, and, what is"" above all things necessary, reliability. A statistical branch is absolutely essential to a Department of Agriculture. It would enable us .to see in what directions our production was weak or strong; it would reveal the nature of goods consumed in the community, and so enable the Department of Agriculture to direct the producers .to any leakage that might be taking place. In this way, fhe Department would be able to advise the producers as to the consumption in the markets of Australia, and such information would be absolutely invaluable. In Queensland we have no accurate knowledge at the present time of what is the consumption of goods in the southern States, and I dare say. that those engaged in the producing industry in Victoria are not generally familiar with the consumption in tlie northern State. A proper statistical branch', issuing bulletins from time to time, would direct public attention to these matters, and the result would be a considerable gain to Australian production. Another matter that might well be undertaken by the Commonwealtha matter which is at present dealt with by the States-is the uniform supervision of exports. To give the House some idea of the importance of this question, 1 shall quote from a paragraph which appears at page 4 of the report of the Queensland Department of Agriculture for 1903-4, an extract from an article on trade with Natal, written by Mr R. Farrell, and published in .the Sydney Mail, on 1st June. The writer saysThis is no exaggeration; and I greatly regret to state that Australia was not represented, except by the writer, and when aslted the reason"" Why, we cannot depend on your meat (New South Wales). We like your Queensland beef in handy sizes, no waste ; but if some of the people knew it was Australian they would not have it. We do not want anything or anybody Australian.""

Because they are sold office in England under the High'Commis under the United States of America bureau cersioner. The Government are making a. 9s If we had a tificate, and are always sought after, and it is found that Australia has no such hall-mark to guarantee her products. We have now accomplished Federation; in the eyes of the world Australia figures as one nation, and any deficiency in the exports of anv State operates against the whole of the produce of Australia. This fact is clearly demonstrated by the quotation that I have just read. It is therefore necessary that the Federal Parliament should deal at the very earliest date with the question of the preservation of a proper standard in the export of Australian goods. I have before me the views of an expert who has 'been through the Department of Agriculture in the United States, and has also had experience in the Australian Departments. I wrote to him for an expression of opinion as to the value of a Department of Agriculture for the Commonwealth, having regard to the fact that each of the States had such a Department in existence at the, present time, and in his answer he wroteI shall leave it very largely for you and others to determine to what extent the conditions of Australia would justify the establishment of a Federal Department of Agriculture within the Australian Commonwealth, bearing relations to our State Departments of Agriculture in the way that obtains in the United States of America. This much, however, I will say, because it must already be evident to all, that a Department or Bureau, even if it is of a limited nature for the present, must be established in order to control the relations of primary production of the Australian Commonwealth with other countries. In the matter of markets, and of the supervision of vegetable and animal diseases, it appears that there must be one Central Bureau, which must have charge of these matters in the name of the Commonwealth. Other countries, since the consolidation of the Australian States, no longer in the same sense think of those States severally and individually as before. Great Britain, America, and the countries of the European Continent are now dealing with us, not as several units, but as a whole, that whole being known as Australia, and it is Commonwealth. It is already necessary, and will become increasingly so, that the Commonwealth shall also make ready to deal as an entity with those several countries, and this' can only be done, I think, through a Federal Bureau, which may finally develop into a Federal Department of Agriculture. mistake in delaying the appointment of a High Commissioner. I. think that they would have acted wisely in the interests of Australia as a whole if they had accepted our suggestion, passed the High Commissioner Bill this session, and have submitted to this Parliament the name of the gentleman proposed to be appointed. Such a representative is urgently required, and under him officers should be appointed to deal, in co-operation with the States, with matters relating to foreign markets, and also with Under the supervision of the Federal Department of Agriculture, a small central bureau for the purpose of centralizing the experience gained at the various experimental farms should also be established. Such a branch should correspond with the bureau of experimental farms in the United States of America. All our experimental farms are at present carrying out experiments under varying conditions in the different States, and the inforto rely on one central administration. That mation so obtained is embodied in a few official reports which have but a limited circulation. It is essential that the information so obtained should be disseminated amongst the. various experimental stations, and, above all, it is absolutely desirable, in the interests of the growersand producers themselves, that it should be supplied to them in a handy and simple form. Department of Agriculture in the United States does valuable work through the agency of the Bureau of experimental farms, by collecting information as to different experiments, and publishing it, together with various interesting comparisons, broadcast throughout the States. valuable assistance to the people through the agency of the post-office, which carries information of assistance to the producers issued by the Department absolutely free of charge. I think that the Commonwealth Postal and Telegraph Department might take a lesson in that direction. established a Federal Department of Agriculture, and a Department of Meteorology, all weather information should likewise be sent free to those who desire it. carrying out of this proposal might lead to a little debit balance in the bookkeeping accounts, but that would be amply compensated for by the saving in production which the country would in that way secure. Another matter which the Department might take up .without involving great expense to the Commonwealth is the investigation of the various Mr Groom. diseases relating to plants and animals. Australia suffers from some very serious pests, some of which have come from across the sea, and each State has power to deal with them only within its own specific area. What is desired is that there shall be. a central administration to grapple with any local outbreak of disease in plants, or of any plague of insect pests, such as the fruit-fly, in order that it may be prevented from spreading from' State to State. These are a few matters which the Department might the question of immigration. take up with advantage in a practical way without involving the Commonwealth in any serious expense. I trust that the Government will consider the proposal as favourably as they have promised, and that they will see their way clear next year to make a beginning by establishing a few of the branches to which I have referred. They would really result in a saving to the States. They would offer an inducement to the States to do away with their separate branches and would accord with the true object of Federation. There is no desire that the Commonwealth shall supersede the work of the States. This motion has not been submitted with a view to the work of the various States Departments being superseded. In the United States of America each State has its DepartThe ment of Agriculture, its agricultural colleges, and its experimental farms and stations ; but the Federation co-operates with them according to the truly Federal idea. That is the principle underlying this motion. There is no desire to take away from the States any of the powers they possess. It also renders There is no wish to reduce the efficiency of the States Departments or to interfere with the work ordinarily performed by them. All1 that is desired is to centralize, to federalize, this work-to enable the experience of one State Department to be used for the assistance of another State; to allow the farmers If we in one State to learn what is being done with advantage in any other part of the Commonwealth. What we really desire to do is to nationalize the information obtained The by these Departments, and to spread it broadcast throughout the Commonwealth. If this be done, I think we shall realize that which is expected of us. We cannot escape from the fact that this Parliament, so far, has done very little for the primary producers of Australia, and that they are_ entitled to come to the door of"" this Legislature to ask for and to receive something. If we can, by means of a Federal Department of Agriculture, assist them to secure better returns from their investments, to make their labour more productive, and their work more efficient-if we can assist them by inducing them to take up highly profitable branches of agriculture, in which they do not at present engage-w e shall confer a national benefit. I believe that a great America, and Russia, by a freight of 6d. deal can be accomplished in these directions, and I trust that the Ministry will see their way to accept the proposal made by the honourable and learned member for Indi, as one step towards the realization of our ideal-the creation of. a Federal Department of Agriculture. The honourable and learned member for Darling Downs is to be congratulated upon having delivered an intensely practical and able address. I am afraid that I cannot pretend to a speech of the same kind, inasmuch as I have risen on the spur of the moment to take part in the debate. One rises with the greatest diffidence to speak off-hand on a question of this kind, but there are two or three matters to which reference was made by the honourable and learned member which I ' desire to elaborate, and I hope perhaps to be able to furnish one or two practical illustrations of the advantages of some of the measures that he has so earnestly advocated. question of facilitating the process of agritification of the establishment of such a culture, and of conserving our primary industries in general, is an intensely practical ness in the way of agricultural mapone. It may be fitly summed up by the expression used last night by the right honourable member for Swan, when dealing with another matter-it is indeed a question of making two blades of grass grow where only one grew before, of making two ears of corn spring up where but one appeared before. It vitally concerns the whole of the people of Australia. One has only to look at the statistics dealing with the subject, in order to realize its importance. We read in the newspapers that the wheat yield for the current year is expected to average only seven and a half bushels to the acre., and when we remember that in Canada and the mother land, for instance, the average yield is two or three times greater, we must recognise that we are called upon to face the question of intense production in a very earnest manner. We cannot afford to allow this matter to slip out of our grasp, inasmuch ""as it means all that is contained in the words "" prosperity 9s2 for Australia."" We are here at the antipodes of the world, and our handicaps in the race for life are very much greater than are those of the people of other countries -in those countries which are nearer to the markets of the world. For example, we are handicapped in connection with our wheat harvest, as compared with Canada, per bushel. As the average price of wheat in London is about 3s. per bushel, that handicap is .1 very serious one. Buti f Australia is to take that place among the world's producers to which her climate, the extent of her virgin lands, and her other advantages entitle her, we must try to overcome that handicap. There are many ways in which it might be overcome, and the establishment of a Federal Department of Agriculture might assist us to discover them. In the first place, a way might be found to get a greater yield of wheat to the acre than is obtained now: What is suggested is to crvstallize the action which is now taken by the States individually. Only last week-the matter has been referred to already in this Chamber-ther e was a conference of fruit-growers from all the States. Year by year the States Ministers of Agri-r culture meet to discuss their common interests, ancl it is sought by the motion to recognise this community of interests by the The establishment of a Federal bureau. In jusbureau, I might mention our backwardping. In other countries the agricultural areas are clearly defined and mapped, and I read the other day that in Canada the extent of the wheat-producing land is known very definitely. It has been surveyed, and the soils have been tested, and the information thus obtained is available to intending immigrants. If we wish to attract immigrants to our shores in a steady stream, we must place authentic information of this kind before them. It is true that the Governments of the States have a hazy idea as to the area of land available for agriculture; but there has been no systematic compilation of information in regard to it, such as would show to any degree of completeness the character of the soil in any locality, and its extent and possibilities. AH the States have been mapped geologically. In New South Wales, for instance, we know now where 10 look for copper, where gold is to be found, ancl where coal lies; and similar information should be obtained for the",28,Federal Department Of Agriculture Material Wealth
180,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"benefit of agriculturists. As the inducement of immigration is a matter which concerns Australia as a whole, this subject could be best dealt with"" by a Federal Department. Such a department might also assist our farmers by showing ihem which is the best seed to sow in particular climates and localities. Some years ago, in New South Wales, the cultivation of the Steinwedel wheat was recommended. That wheat is an excellent bearer, yielding in some cases .40 bushels to the acre; but it will not carry its grain, except in a mild climate. If the crop is swept by a strong wind, it is impossible to reap it afterwards. Therefore, to advise people to sow that wheat indiscriminately is. in many cases, to ask them to court absolute failure. A Federal Department ^vould make it its business to ascertain what wheat suits certain climates, ancl to acclimatize wheals which are likelv to be useful here. It might also set itself to produce a wheat which would be peculiarly adapted to our climate ancl soil. This problem has ""been successfully dealt with in other countries, and particularly in Canada; and in New South Wales excellent men are engaged upon it. By placing information of the kind to which I refer in the hands of our primary producers, a central bureau would confer benefits upon .the community which would far exceed in value its cost. Tnen there are questions relating to the export trade which it might consider. Our distance from the markets of the world makes these questions of peculiar importance to us. matter to send the best fruit from Italy, and to land it in London in the pink of condition ; but it is very difficult to land our ters could be set at rest, and the best method best fruit there in a satisfactory condition. Such fruit is more delicate than second quality fruit, and consequently does not carry so well. When a shipment of oranges was sent to London from New South Wales at the time that the Postmaster-General was administering the State Department of Agriculture, it was found that, while the second quality fruit arrived in good condition, and realized moderate prices, the best fruit arrived in an unsatisfactory condition. Our problem is, therefore, how to send our most delicate and luscious fruits to the markets of the world in a condition in which people will buy them. When I succeeded the honourable member in the administration of the Department, a conference of fruit growers was held to discuss with the shipping agents the failure of the experiment. Mr Joseph Cook. Knowing a little about ventilation in connection with mining, it did noftake me long to see that the whole trouble was caused by the ineffective ventilation of the chambers in which the fruit was carried. Fruit in transit gives off carbonic acid gas, which, if not carried away by proper ventilation, destroys its condition. It may happen, as it sometimes happens in this chamber, that a.i immense volume of pure air is being pumped through a ship's cool storage accommodation without completely ventilating the fruit which is packed there. I do not know that the matter has been remedied since the time. I speak of; but what is necessary is to provide, not only for the pumping of a sufficient quantity of cool air, but for the proper distribution of that air through the fruit, from top to bottom. Unless that is done, the fruit practically stews in its own juice, and becomes rotten. After that conference I had a consultation with the chemists of the Department, who are very capable men, and we agreed to try some experiments, with a view to extracting the juices and gases from the rind of the fruit by artificial drying before shipment. I therefore put £600 on the Estimates for the purpose of erecting a heating chamber, but, although the amount was voted, the money was not spent, so that the problem remains uninvestigated. tried here, but with very little success. which should be taken in hand in the interIt is a"" very easy ests of the fruit growers of the Continent, who are unable to help themselves in this respect At very little expense, these matof treating our fruit for export could be communicated to those who are directly interested. Another matter of supreme importance to Australia has been mentioned by the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs. I refer to the diseases which afflict our stock from time to time. For instance, there is the very serious question of the spread of the tick-that fell disease which has worked such havoc amongst the stock of Queensland. The question of the best method to be adopted to check the ravages of that disease could be investigated with advantage by a Department such as that contemplated. There ought to be a very clear and definite relationship between the Health Departments and the Agricultural Departments of the various States. For instance, in connection with the investigation of the",33,Federal Department Of Agriculture Material Wealth
181,Mr Hum E Cook,The experiment was,34,Federal Department Of Agriculture Material Wealth
182,Mr Joseph Cook,"It is a mattertick disease, it would first of all be necessary to secure the services of a medical expert, with a view to conduct investigations. This could best be done by a central bureau, which would possess greater prestige and greater authority than any State Department, and which could place itself in communication with the States Health Departments, and co-ordinate their work in the treatment of stock diseases. At present there are varying and conflicting opinions amongst the officers of these Departments, ancl a central bureau would be able to bring these gentlemen into touch, and from the conflict of opinion, evolve some common action against our common foes, which now work such havoc in our midst. There is no reason why there should be the slightest conflict between the Commonwealth and the States Departments. We might with advantage assist some of the work now carried out in the various States. For instance, the States Agricultural Departments possess elaborate scientific apparatus, and have adopted certain scientific curricula. Something might be done in the way of bringing about uniformity in regard to the scientific instruction given to our agriculturists. There should be no obstacle in ihe way of a Federal oversight being exercised in this matter. A common form of examination, and common scientific standards might be adopted, and in that way very much help might be given in the direction of perfecting our system of instruction. The great aim should be to dovetail the -work which the central bureau would perform in with that now carried on by the States Departments I believe that if a proper system were adopted enough money could be saved in connection with the States Departments to more than cover the expenditure that would be entailed in maintaining a Federal bureau. Therefore I regard the proposal as not necessarily involving additional expenditure. There is no mistaking the fact that we are piling up our new expenditure to an extent that ought soon to give us pause. I do not wish to play the part of an alarmist, but, having regard to the straitened finances of the States, and to the effect of Federation on those finances, we ought to be very chary of incurring new expenditure. Therefore, a proposal of this kind should be very seriously considered from the economical stand-point, and with a view to enabling the States to make such savings as would more than defray the cost of maintaining the new Department. Although, in the absence of the mover, I hesitate to suggest any alteration in the form of the motion, I am not sure that we might not with advantage refer this matter to a Select Committee, which could formulate suggestions in the direction I have indicated. Some proposal might be made upon the same lines as that put forward in connection with the appointment of a High Commissioner. I feel very strongly upon this point, l f I thought that the proposed Department would grow into a costly concern, and that the expenditure entailed would be an addition to the cost of maintaining existing institutions in tbe States, I should hesitate to support the motion at the present time; but 1 believe that an investigation would show that the cost of setting up the proposed bureau could be more than saved by"" practising economies in the States. The question as to what Australia should do to promote the interests of her primary producers is a very serious one. I have spoken of the great handicaps to which we are now subjected, owing to our geographical position. In connection with our wheat exports, we have to pay an extra 6d. per bushel for freight, and our fruit exporters are handicapped to the extent of from 2s. to 2s. 6d. per case. supposing that it can be carried to the home market in good condition, there is still the handicap of the extra expense of carriage. ruined any chances that our fruit-growers might have had of converting their fruit into pulp for export. to Rome, and according to the honourable and learned member's idea, all roads should point in the direction of the adoption of a free-trade policy. I am not. 'however, now dealing with that aspect of the question, but with the desirability of affording our producers every facility for reaching the markets of the world. That question is one which, more than any other, affects our prosperity as a people. We can put round Australia Tariff walls as high as we like, and we shall not achieve any good results unless our producers are enabled to Rnd a profitable outlet for their produce. The first problem we should endeavour to solve is how we can most profitably dispose of the surplus produce that must be raised in a country where there are few people.",34,Federal Department Of Agriculture Material Wealth

No amount of specialization of our secondary industries will bring us prosperity, so long as our primary industries are neglected. I a those parts of the world which are nearest to the great centres of civilization, and to the markets which they afford, it is an easy matter to specialize secondary industries.

Is nonsense to the honourable member, and therefore I am addressing only sensible people. fact one which should at least arrest our attention-that £ 7 worth of every £ 1 0 worth of our produce has to find a market abroad. ' Therefore, the question to which I have been referring is one vitally affecting our national existence, and whether we are free-traders or protectionists, the problem we have to face is how we can best reduce the natural handicaps to which our primary producers are now subjected. hope that the Government will give their serious consideration to this proposal, and also to my suggestion that a Select Committee should be appointed. I prefer that the matter should be referred to a Select Committee rather than to a Royal Commission, because Select Committees cost nothing, whilst Royal Commissions, which seem to be multiplying exceedingly, are generally rather costly. Select Committee could do useful work, and make suggestions that would lead to the co-ordination of the work now done by the various States Departments. If we could take over some of the work now performed in the States, we could save more money than would be sufficient to defray the cost of maintaining a Federal bureau, and we could make the work now performed-ex cellent as some of it is-of very much more importance, and of very much more value to those who are engaged, year in and year out, in building up what we hope will be the permanent prosperity of Australia. orable member for Parramatta, I feel that For instance, it is easy for Great the House is indebted to the honourable and learned member for Darling Downsf o r his able address upon this subject, and particularly because he has somewhat widened the original scope of the proposal under In this proposal we have prediscussion by adopting the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Indi. The honourable member for Parramatta has gone a step further-and I entirely agree Buti f we with him-by proposing the appointment of a Select Committee, which, without taking a very great deal of evidence, might obtain a grasp of what is being done by the various States in connection with agriculture, and subsequently make some recommendations to this Parliament. I am thoroughly in accord with that proposal, because I realize that education is the great feature which distinguishes all advance in modern time. I know that it education in a much wider sense than that in which it was formerly regarded. I need scarcely remind honourable members that Coghlan points out the startling at one time education was taken to cover only the three R ' s ; but to-day it is interpreted to mean the instruction of persons who are engaged in industry in the best means of utilizing the experience of those who 'have been most successful. The State disseminates information, so that every beginner has the advantage of knowing what has been done by others. We find that any nation which succeeds to-day does so chiefly I because it has paid attention to technical instruction-becaus e the boys and girls in its schools may acquire a knowledge of farming and many, other industries into which they enter in after years. The States have done something in this direction, though not so much as they ought to have done. But at any rate the foundation has been laid.

It may be possible by arrangement with the States for the Commonwealth to take over some of the duties of national import which they are at present discharging.

189,Mr Spence (Darling),"With the honof a Meteorological Departmenta suggestion which I desire strongly to support. I claim that we are neglecting an important branch, which, as was pointed out by Mr own particular line. As a member of the Wragge some time ago, should be controlled toy the Commonwealth. have a central authority, which would be able to make the necessary arrangements for the collection of information over the widest possible sphere. In most of the capitals, at the present time, weather forecasts ""are daily issued. The work of these departments is thus being duplicated. Surely we ought to adopt some means for centralizing the information relating to weather conditions, if only with a view to avoiding shipwrecks. Indeed, the study of these conditions in Australia is absolutely essential to the development of our country. We possess great areas of magnificent land, but unfortunately we have not a sufficient rainfall. I believe that we shall yet see the day when we shall be able to make rain f a l l , just as we obtain it from underground, and if so, Australia-so far as its central areas are concerned-wil l become one of the richest countries in the world. The people should be supplied with the latest information in regard to the weather. In my own electorate, I can assure honourable members, that if it had not been for warnings received by telegraph, immense losses would have been sustained by reason of floods. I have known of sheep being lost from one flock whose value would more than cover the cost of weather telegrams for a whole year. I repeat that, as far as possible, it is desirable that we should centralize our work. feel sufficient interest dn Australia to induce them to contemplate settling here cannot gain any information from a Commonwealth Department as to where settlement is advisable. There is no Department whose duty it is to collect data of that character, and to have it on tap. Consequently, we cannot expect any very great stream of immigration. A statistical branch might reasonably be established by the Commonwealth at a very early date. Fortunately, in New South Wales we have a very able statistician, who provides information, not only in regard to the Commonwealth, but also in regard to New Zealand. The Commonwealth should have a Statistical Department under its control. At the present time we secure statistical information for Australia only because of the enthusiasm of Mr Coghlan. The various States have now fa'irly perfect machinery f n r the collection of statistics in regard to agriculture, stock, &c. They also employ officers of high standing and ability-specialist s in their Western Lands Commission, I have a very We should then vivid recollection of the examination of a practical botanist, who is connected with one of the Government departments in Sydney. He was able to lay upon the table certain essential oils and perfumes which had been made from plants which grow in unlimited quantities in the back country. The product of these plants, he asserted, would find a ready market. He discovered their composition by analyses, which were conducted in hislaboratory. But I would point out that there is no means by which those who might desire to embark upon an enterprise of that sort could have become acquainted with the facts, as I have stated them, unless they had been published in that very excellent journal, the Agricultural Gazette. In a centralized Department at the outset we should not need to engage a large staff. The officer to whom I have referred has never been given an opportunity of exploring the country for himself, but he has found that quite a number of plants which grow very plentifully in portions of Australia, possess a commercial -value. From some of our woods, too,we can obtain valuable dyes. The tree from which one particular dye is obtaineda dye for particular shades of colour grows very abundantly in New South Wales. We have millions of them. I saw samples of that dye which had been taken from the stringy bark tree, and Those who which were admitted td be of the very best. It is generally acknowledged that this industry could be made payable. I claim that we should have some means of circulating information of that description. It is well known that in modern times our successes are chiefly due to technical training, and the diffusion of information. I remember the time when it was generally agreed that it was impossible to grow wheat beyond Dubbo. When a certain individual came there, ploughed his land, and commenced to sow wheat, the wiseacres declared that he was a fool. But what is the position to-day ? There are miles of farms beyond Narromine. Some of the farmers have more than 1,000 acres under wheat. Under the up-to-date method which has been adopted in America, no doubt would have been entertained of the possibility of growing wheat in that locality, because an analysis of the soil would have dispelled it. sessed of much capital takes up land, and his first crop is a failure, he is almost ruined. understood from the beginning whether the land was suitable for the purpose to which he intended to put it, if he knew ought to plant, and was familiar with the prevailing weather conditions, he would have some assurance of success. Although we have no control over the lands of the Commonwealth, we should take up the duty of supplying the producers with all the information calculated to be of assistance to them. In some of our highly socialistic States, a prospector, who discovers what he believes to be stone containFreights are becoming lower every day, and ing gold, or some other valuable mineral, may take it to the Mines Department, and have it assayed. That course is frequently followed, and often with highly successful results. Many fields have been opened up as the result of assays first made by the Mines Departments of the States, and, in the same way, I think that we should be able to do a 1 vast amount of good by the creation of a Federal Department of Agriculture. I have no desire to traverse the wide field covered so ably by other speakers; but shall content myself with saying that I strongly approve of several of the suggestions emphasized by the honourable member for Parramatta. If a Department of this kind were established, it might enable us to ascertain from the States Departments the direction which Federal legislation should take in order to cope with such matters as diseases in stock. Great difficulties were experienced some time ago in dealing with the tick pestder the control of the States. ments might obtain information bearing on such questions that would be of value to us. matters are dealt with, by agreement with the States, by means of a Federal Executive regulation. tion in reference to these and other matters of interest to our primary producers should be centralized, so that experiments which have proved successful in certain districts, but are not generally known, mav be brought within the knowledge of the people of all the States. Reference has been made by the honourable member for Parramatta to our export trade. As honourable members.are aware, by far the greater If a man who is not posproportion of Great Britain's food supplies are obtained from foreign countries, while only a small proportion comes from AusButi f , on the other hand, he tralia. That is a remarkable state of affairs, considering that our territory is extensive enough to enable us to supply not only the requirements of Great Britain, but the kind of crop that he of half the world. A great part of the Commonwealth remains undeveloped, and we cannot expect it to be developed unless .external markets are opened out. A t the present time, we produce more than is sufficient to satisfy local requirements, and we must turn our attention to the work of opening up fresh markets for our primary producers, and enabling them to secure cheap and easy means of access to them. it remains for the Commonwealth Government to look into the best means of conveying not only fruit, but other perishable products to the markets of the old world. That is one matter that should receive special attention. Produce that may be safely carried from the United States to Great Britain cannot be sent from Australia to the old land, and there is much room for improvement in this direction. Roughly speaking, the value of certain food-stuffs consumed in Great Britain is £ 1 8 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, and of that quantity at least £13,000,000 worth comes from countries outside the Empire. I have no desire to deal with the question of preferential^ trade; but would point out that it is because Great Britain imports her food-stuffs so largely from foreign countries, that many of the people of the mother land fear that preferential trade would increase the cost of living. I merely mention this matter as showing how important it is that we should endeavour to secure this trade. We have a right to. it, and I believe that the people of Great Britain would prefer to give it to us. The question of How best to convey our produce to the markets of the world is one of great importance. It is necessary that we should obtain th<s fullest information in regard to developments in agricultural and pastoral pursuits in all parts of the world. I desire to emphasize the point, that whilst it is desirable that the bureau should collect information from all parts of the Commonwealth, it is doubly important that it should secure information relating to primary production in all parts of the world.

The whole question was very thoroughly discussed by the honourable member for Lang when he moved this motion some weeks ago, and is so important that it deserves to be treated as a Government matter.. Dr. Paton, the celebrated missionary, has brought prominently before the people of Australia the unsatisfactory results which have followed what has been termed the co-dominion of these islands, and the French newspapers have drawn attention to what the French people consider the most illogical state of affairs which prevails there. The New Hebrides should be the warden of British interests in the Pacific. We should regard them as an outstanding citadel, because French, German, and American interests in the various groups are now so strong that the position of Australia might become a dangerous one if Great Britain were embroiled with one of the larger Powers, and did not hold a commanding influence in the Pacific. The honourable member for Lang showed the strategical importance of these islands, and he also dwelt upon the commercial advantages which would be obtained by increasing our influence there, by improving our trade relations with them. He also had a great deal to say as to the beauty of Havana Harbor. I understand that he is personally acquainted with its .soundings and formation, and is of opinion that it should be under British control. The present leader of the Opposition at the time regretted that he did not know more about the New Hebrides, and expressed the opinion that the late Minister of Home Affairs would be able to enlighten the House very considerably in regard to them; but up to the present we have not had the advantage of his information. Government will inquire into the matter very closely during the recess. trip there? Mr Wilks. or two ago, that the members of the Federal Parliament should make a trip to New Guinea, and if such a journey were undertaken, it would, no doubt, be well to go on to the New Hebrides. In considering this question, we may with advantage bear in It is stated in this afternoon's Herald mind our experiences in connection with New Guinea. It is generally recognised that Great Britain made a mistake when she failed to. acquire the whole of the island instead of only a portion of it. The occupation of New Guinea by three powers is likely to lead to complications in the near future, and we should endeavour, if possible, to avoid the establishment of similar conditions in the New Hebrides. The whole question should be well threshed out, and I should like the honourable member for Hume to give us the benefit of his opinion. I trust that he will have no further complaint to make with regard to important matters being hurriedly disposed of. No doubt this is a most important question', and I had hoped that the honourable member for Dalley would have made some practical proposal in regard to it. With the permission of the HouseI should like to continue my remarks upon another occasion. Leave granted; debate adjourned.

200,Mr Spence (Darling),"Before dealfavour of the honourable member for Eden Monaro. It has been the practice for a Government, upon assuming office, to take up the public business at the stage at which it was left by its predecessors in office, and in view of the unwillingness of the Watson Government and of the present Government to take up the Bill, it might with perfect propriety have been allowed to remain in the hands of the honourable member for any blame to the honourable member now I desire to express mv strong disapproval of t h i action of the Government. The fact that the honourable member for Hume did not ask the Government to permit him to retain charge of the Bill affords' no excuse for the change that ""has been brought about. An honourable member should not be expected to go to the Government cap in hand and ask for their favour in such a matter. Eden-Monaro stands in the peculiar position of having made a speech as if he were introducing the Bill for the first time, and of being prohibited from speaking in reply. I presume that that right is retained by the honourable member for Hume, who introduced the Bill. exercise his right. the Government that they should have adopted the course they have followed. They ihave set up certain high ideals, which they are not acting up to. No personal feeling should have been allowed to operate in a case of this kind. The right honourable member for Swan, when speaking last night, adopted what appeared to me to be an extraordinary line of .reasoning. He stated that we did not possess much power as a Parliament to pass legislation for the good of the people, and that, therefore, we ought to take advantage of the opportunity presented to us by this Bill to do something for their benefit. The same line of reasoning might be adopted to justify a proposal for voting a large sum of money to every citizen in the Commonwealth. The argument that because we are in a position to do a certain thing we should forthwith set about doing it, seems to me to be entirely beside the question. The right honourable gentleman also said that the iron industry would not necessarily become a monopoly, because the offer made under the Bill was of an open character, and twenty companies might compete for the bonus. But the merest glance at the report of the Commission will show that there is absolutely no room for competition in connection with the industry. It has been pointed out that 30,000 or 40..000 tons of pig iron are sufficient to meet the annual requirements of the Commonwealth, and that this quantity could be turned out from one large American furnace. Therefore, notwithstanding the right Hume. I am not attributing honourable gentleman's long experience as a public man, and the good work he has done in charge of the Bill, but as a Ministeri n Western Australia,, lie has spoken in this matter without due consideration of the facts of the case. What we have to discover is whether there is likely to_ be competition, and I think we have sufficient information to truide us to a right conclusion in that connection. It seems to me that some honourable members have indulged in a great deal of exaggeration. I wish to approach this proposal The honourable member for with the utmost fairness. I do not object to the State according assistance to private enterprise. As a matter of fact, all over the Commonwealth we have endeavoured to assist our own people. The exaggeration to which I refer arises from the fact that honourable members have not looked too closely into the proposal which is under I hope he w ill consideration. They urge that anything which will give increased employment'to the community must of necessity be good. I contend that it is our duty before we pass a measure of this character, to be sure that the expenditure which is contemplated will produce the anticipated result. I claim that the passing of this Bill will not afford any appreciable increase of employment. On the contrary, it seems to me that the expenditure of £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 in connection with the iron industry would provide less employment for labour than would be provided by that expenditure upon any other industry. The Canadian experience clearly demonstrates that. There is no justification whatever for taxing the poor of the Commonwealth for the benefit of any company which may embark upon this enterprise. ' The total consumption of pig iron in Australia-as "" was stated by various witnesses who were examined by the Royal Commission which investigated this matter-is between ""30.000 ford declared that at Lithgow he has erected a plant which will consume 15.000 tons of pig iron annually, or more than one-half of our total consumption.

203,"Tons And 40,000 Tons Per Annum. Mr Sand","of this Bill will not cause all our iron imports to be manufactured in Australia, although that is the assumption upon which the advocates of the Bill base the whole of their arguments. If that assumption were correct, there might be something to be urged in favour of the measure. But the experience of Canada induces me to conclude that there is a very great danger indeed that the experiment proposed will prove unsuccessful. iron works were established in our midst Australia would supply all the iron manufactures which she now imports, is based upon an utter fallacy. Mort's Dock Company stated before the Commission that in his opinion the quantity of iron likely to be consumed in Australia was 90,000 tons annually. Mr Jamieson, the chairman of the Blythe River Company, set it down at 450,000 tons. That estimate is based upon the assumption to which I have already alluded*-a n assumption which is altogether unwarranted. We could not possibly hope to manufacture all our requirements, especially within the period during which it is proposed that the bonus shall operate. It has been stated that this industry, if established, would employ 10,000 men. orable members that, according to the report of the Royal Commission which visited America, one branch of Carnegie's works in America, where the furnaces are capable of turning out 640,000 tons of iron per annum, employs only 477 hands, inclusive of clerks. ments in Glasgow, about twenty men turn out 20,000 tons annually. markable features of modern times is the displacement of labour by machinery. If honourable members will compare the returns for the decades ending 1891' and 1901, they will see that in very many industries there has been a large reduction in the number of hands employed, notwithstanding that the capital invested has been considerably increased. I remember one or two instances in which the capital invested had been doubled during the period in question, but-in which the hands employed were less by 1,000. I claim that if we are to hold our own in fhe keen competition of the world, we must face the fact that before another decade a still further development will have taken place in machinery, with a consequent reduction in employment. The statement that the establishment of iron works in Australia would largely increase employment is altogether misleading to the working classes; and I , for one, will not be a party to deceiving them. Mr Jamieson also stated that one American blast furnace w ill .turn out 700 tons of pig iron per day. As a matter of fact, many of them are producing 500 tons and 600 tons daily. That is more than sufficient to supply the needs The belief that if of fhe whole Commonwealth. I wish to impress upon honourable members the danger of instituting the system which obtains in Canada and America, of bolstering The chairman of the up, by means of bonuses, private capitalists. It is interesting to note the developments which have taken place in the legislation dealing with this subject in Canada, and I think that after I have dealt with it, honourable members will be able to form an idea ot the influence which must have been at work. In 1883, the Parliament of the Dominion passed an Act offering a bounty of $1.50 per ton for the production of pigiron. In 1889, that bounty was reduced to $1 per ton; but in 1892 another Act was 1 passed increasing the bounty to $2 per ton, and providing that it should terminate in 1897. The parties concerned, however, May I be permitted to remind hontook good care to secure themselves before that time expired. In 1894 they secured! the passing of an Act providing for the payment of bounties of $2 per ton on pig-iron, $2 per ton on puddled bars, and $2 per ton on steel billets made from Canadian pigThis Act was to remain in operation for five years; but without waiting for that period to elapse, the Dominion Parliament, in 1897, repealed the Act, increased the bounties to $3 per ton on steel in gots made of not less than 50 per centCanadian pig. and made other changes. From 1883 until 1897 bounties were given to encourage the manufacture of pig-iron from local ore, but the manufacturers found that it suited their purpose to use ore obtained from parts beyond the Dominion, and they were then successful in securing the passing of an Act providing for the payment of bounties of $3 per ton on steel ingots of not less than 50 per cent, of Canadian pig, $3 per ton on puddled bars, $3 per ton on pig-iron, and $2 per ton on the proportion made from foreign ore. In 1898 another Act was passed declaring that the provisions of this measure should be' retrospective, and come into force as from 1897. These facts show that we are now being asked to take a",41,Manufactures Encouragement Bill Second Reading
204,Mr Reid,In one of fhe big establish,42,Manufactures Encouragement Bill Second Reading
205,Mr Spence,"On e of the most restep which may possibly give rise to a similar state of affairs in Australia. In 1899 an Act was passed by the Dominion Parliament, fixing a diminishing rate of bounties, the final payment to be a bounty of only 10 per cent.; but in 1003 an amending Act was passed providing for additional bounties. of $6 per ton on rolled' wire rods, $3 per ton on other rolled shapes, and $3 per ton on rolled plates from steel, with 50 per cent, of Canadian pig. It was then decided that the bounties should be paid in the following proportions:-9 0 per cent, in 1904; 75 per cent, in 1905; 55 per cent, in 1906; and 35 per cent, in 1907, when they are to cease. what has taken place in Canada, we may fairly assume that before the year 1907 is reached, fresh legislation will be passe i providing for further bounties. also to remember that the Parliament of the State of Ontario-whic h is the laincipal iron-producing State of the Dom-iiion -passe d an Act in 1894, setting arart $.125,000 to be paid by way of subsidy, at the rate of $1 per ton on pig-iron produced within the limits of the State. limit was fixed, but up t'o the 31st October, 1903, a total of $109,741 had been paid on this account. gain some idea of what would be the effect of the payment of bonuses for the produc tion of pig iron in Australia, as evidenced by the experience of Canada, I have secured a table showing the whole of the bounties paid on pig-iron by the Dominion Government from 1884 up to and inclusive of the year 1903. The figures are as follow: 1884, 44,090 dols.; 1885, 38,655 dols.; 1:886, 39,270 dols -; 1887, 59,576 dols. ; 1888, 33,314 dols.; 1889, 37,234 dols.; 1890, 25,697 dols.; 1891, 20,153 dols.; 1892, 30,294 dols.; 1893, 93,896 dols.; 1894, 125,044 dols; 1895, 63,384 dols.; 1896, 104,105 dols.; 1897, 66,509 dols.; 1898, 165,654 dols.; 1899, 187,954 dols.; 1900, 238,296 dols.; J901, 351,259 dols.; 1902, 693,1.09 dols.; 1903, 670,340 dols. Total, 3,087,833 dols. bers should recollect when looking at these figures that the amount of the bounty has been trebled within the last few years; and if we examine the returns showing the value of the material on which that bounty was paid, we must see that the industry has not been stimulated by this means to the extent that some honourable members would have us believe. Whilst the bounties have been increased from time to time, the companies engaged in the industry-and for the most part these bounties have gone to only eight companieshave not increased their output in the way that we have been led to believe. Taking the total sum paid by way of bounties on It provided for.a bounty steel ingots, we find that the .result has been very much the same. We have also to remember in this connection that ihe highest bounties were paid in 1903, mdar the Act recently passed, and that the figures show thai' the increased production of steel ingots has nod been as great as has been suggested. In respect of puddled bars, bounties representing $87,992 were paid But, having regard to between 1896 and 1903, while on steel billets $89,906 were paid by way of bounty during the year or two in which this practice was in force. The bounties paid We have on steel ingots represent a total of $1,100,008. On turning to tlie totals, we find that $3,087,830 have been paid byway of bounties on pig-iron, $87,922 on puddled bars, and $89,906 on steel billets, in addition to which $109,741 have been paid by way of bounty by the StateA Government of Ontario. This makes a total of $4,475,410 subscribed by the people of Canada in order to bolster up private In order that the House may enterprize. The companies which have chiefly participated in these bounties are interested in many other works. They are interested, for example, in railway construction, and by means of these bounties, have been enabled to obtain cheap steel rails for use' on their lines. The people of Canada have subscribed nearly $4,500,000 to help these capitalists to carry out their railway works at reduced cost, and in that way, to secure big profits from other ventures, such as coal mines, in which they are interested. These great capitalists do not confine their attention to one branch of industry. They may make a loss in one' direction, but they reap a profit in another. I now wish to deal with another important phase of t'he experience of Canada. I refer to the imports and exHonorable memports of iron and steel, and of iron and steel manufactures. The figures vary considerably. In 1883, the value of these exports went up to $138^.775, but in 1894, it dropped down to $9,026. In 1902 there was another change, the value of these exports increasing to $1,320,845, the highest point that has yet been reached. Last year they went back again to $736,013. Last year the total amount paid by way"" of bounties on pig-iron produced from Canadian ore was $125,415, while the bounties paid $2,000,000. The total export in the varion pig-iron produced from foreign ore, ous lines of production has increased amounted to $494,534, or more than three steadily, the aggregate exportation in six times as much as was paid on pig-iron years amounting to $9,895,338. produced from local ore. Thus, instead of now look at the imports. the bounties having led to the production years, 1894 to 1898, both inclusive, the of iron from local ore, they have had an value of iron and steel, and goods manuopposite effect. experience in Australia ?

I should like to know why that particular class of machine has been selected for special treatment. no: an equally good claim be made out for the encouragement of the manufacture ot harvesters? We are already that class of machine, and it is very largely taking the place of reapers and binders. Therefore, I do not see any reason why we should offer any special temptation to turn out reapers and binders. better if the Bill had dealt with tlie iron industry only. I am led to the conviction that if we grant a bonus for the production of iron we shall have to follow it up by imposing protective duties. The bonus may be sufficient to start the industry, but undoubtedly further assistance will be required at the expiration of the bonus period. haps it would have been preferable to commence with duties. So far as I can see, only two parties will benefit from the proposed bonus, and they are prepared to form a company if a duty of 15 per cent, is imposed. Surelv this new Protectionist Government would not hesitate to proceed that far. The Postmaster-General would no doubt be frightened if duties of from 40 per cent, to 80 per cent, were proposed, but he preserves an absolutely calm demeanour when I mention a 15 per cent. duty. I have no doubt the Prime Minister would be equally complaisant. I notice that a statement has been published in a protectionist organ that the Prime Minister has proclaimed himself to be practically a protectionist, and that he has stated that if any anomaly in the Tariff can be pointed out it would be remedied straight away. I must congratulate the better half of the Minister-who better halves dt>-upon having won over the Prime Minister, ""who has hitherto been the chamjjion of free-trade, to their own side of the fiscal question. I should like to direct the special attention of the Post-master-General to the fact that a 15 per cent, duty has been declared by those who are specially interested in the proposal, to be sufficient to protect the iron industry from outside competition. extensive iron deposits which exist in the electorate represented by the Minister, it would be well for him to consider whether it would not be better to impose a moderate protective duty, rather than to make a free gift of £250,000 to those who are prepared Mr Spence. to invest their capital in establishing the iron industry. I am quite convinced that the imposition of a duty will be asked for sooner or later, and I venture, further, to prophesy that it will be granted. The priCould vate companies which have engaged in the industry in Canada have been able to exert sufficient influence to secure an alteratiton of manufacturing the law year after year as required, and I am sure that our Government would not allow an industry to be wiped out for the sake of a slight increase in the protective duty. The majority of honourable members It would be far decided when the Tariff was under discussion that our industries, which had been established under protection, could not continue to live if the protective duties were abolished, and the iron industry certainly could not exist except behind a substantial Tariff wall. The iron-masters of Canada have not been able to carry on without the Peraid of protection, supplemented by bounties amounting to as much as $4 per ton. Even this assistance has not been sufficient to protect them altogether against outside competition. I would urge upon the Prime Minister the desirability of considering whether we should not impose a protective duty instead of granting a bonus, and I hope that the new Protectionist Government will declare their policy in this matter before we go much further. I have been making inquiries with regard to the extent to which the freights which have to be paid upon imported iron would afford protection to local manufacturers. In the first place, we have trading to Australia a number of magnificent steam-ships, which are highly subsidized by the German Government with the express object of encouraging them to dump down German goods upon our shores. These subsidies, to has succeeded as all a great extent, reduce the natural protection afforded by freights in the ordinary course. It has been stated by Mr Jamieson that the freight paid upon pig 'iron varies considerably. Sometimes it is brought from Glasgow in timber ships at freights ranging as low as from 2s. to 3s. per ton. I would commend that fact to the attention of the honourable member who is in charge of this B ill . Practically it is equivalent to In view of the annihilating the distance between the two places. The freights by ordinary vessels are variously ios., 12s., and 13. 6d. per ton. The average is set down at ios. per ton. The freight upon iron between Lithgow and Sydney is about equal to the average freight between the old country and Australia. occupy the same position in relation to Sydney as does England. purposes those works are as far removed from Sydney as is the mother country. That is a point which should not be allowed to escape our attention. posal of the Blythe River Company has been well thought out, If a i l to see how that company can reasonably expect to compete with the powerful companies in Amelica, England, and Germany. points which is almost invariably overlooked is that in Great Britain immense royalties are paid upon coal and iron. If these commodities could be obtained there free of royalty-as they can be in Australia-the English manufacturer would be able to compete against the world. the cost of oversea carriage is so small, in order to insure the success of iron works in Australia, it would be necessary for us to bolster up our industries by the imposition of a heavy protective Tariff. wise they could not hope to live at all. I would further remind honourable members that the' cost of water carriage is decreasing every year. steamers prove a success-as they appear to be doing-the distance between Australia and foreign countries will practically disappear. limited market, it seems to me that there is no need of an explanation as to why capitalists have not embarked upon the iron industry here. that the inducements offered are not sufficient, while the risks are very great. my thing to indicate that success will attend the efforts of any company which chooses to take this matter up. that two gentlemen have declared that they know where they can obtain the necessary capital to establish iron works in Australia if this Bill be passed. we look beneath the surface, what do we find ? The fact that the works controlled by Mr Sandford are located ninety-six miles from the coast, shows that he cannot successfully compete with the world's iron production. great industries have found it necessary to have access to water frontage. The works at Lithgow will not pay unless they are removed to the coast, and I doubt whether they will pay even then. I have the utmost respect for Mr Sandford personally. think that the offer which he recently made Consequently the Lithgow iron works to the New South Wales Government was a very liberal one, and certainly it deserves For all practical every consideration. I remember visiting the Eskbank iron works with a large party of trades unionists in 1885, and I recollect seeing splendid steel rails turned out there. Although the proBut when Mr Sandford started operations, he was able to purchase large quantities of scrap iron at a very cheap rate-som e of it as low as 5s. per ton. After a time, however, the supplies began to shorten, and as One of the a consequence he now finds it difficult to conduct his enterprise at a profit. Naturally he desires to make a change. He declares that capitalists are prepared to invest money in the establishment of iron works in the Commonwealth. If they did so, he would form a new company, and thus reAs lieve himself of both the risk and the very heavy responsibility which he at present has to face. On the other hand, the Blythe River Company openly admit that if the Bill be passed, they will go into liquidaOthertion and form a new company. In both cases it is proposed to erect a furnace, at a cost of ,£125,000, whereas the Commonwealth is asked to grant a bonus of just Should the new turbine double that amount. Both parties propose to secure the necessary capital from the same market. That means that we are to do a little more borrowing, because, if any When we bear in mind our dividends are earned by the proposed works, they will be swallowed up by capitalists in the old country. That is' equivalent to borrowing more money and paying interest The fact is patent to all upon it. I am altogether opposed, upon the evidence before us, to granting this To bonus to private persons, so that they may mind, there is at present nobe enabled to float new companies. Eveni f it could be shown that the proposed expenditure would result in the establishment I admit of the iron industry, it is an absolute certainty, based upon the experience of Canada and America, that it would result in a monopoly. One firm could supply all the But when wants of the Commonwealth, and if two started operations, they would soon amalgamate. Judging by the remarks of honourable members, we are all agreed that the formation of trusts is very undesirable. Proposals have been made that they should It is significant that all these be dealt , with by legislation/ There is no doubt that they are a menace lo the well-being of the community. What is the difference between a trust arid a company which is a monopoly? I for one can see no distinction. If we place the I control of the industry in the hands of one man, he must exercise a monopoly. The mere calling of a trust a company does not alter the fact that it is a trust.

It would be impossible for the Australian industry to compete with the great iron works of Canadaand the United States, in the absence of a protective duty. In the United States they have huge blast furnaces, and such wonderful labour-saving appliances, that the cost of production is reduced to the lowest point.

I started off with the conviction that a number of honourable members were not cognisant of many of the facts which I had collected, and I have put them before the House. I am anxious that the whole question should be thoroughly understood. The attitude I take up is similar to that which I adopted when the B ill was before the last Parliament. I am in favour, however, of giving the proposed bonus to any State Government that' may be willing to enter upon the industry, and I justify that action on these grounds: It will be said, ""We have In the nature of things, the manufacture of We iron and steel from the ore must be a monopoly. The Australian market is too small to allow more than one controlling interest to enter upon the enterprise. I 'recognise, too, that it would be a good thing for the workers in iron and steel throughout the Commonwealth to be able to get their raw material at a very low price. Probably, if the price, of pig iron and bar iron were reduced, the local production of iron and steel goods would be increased. But it would COOK -The object of the not be fair to expect one State to go to the expense of establishing iron works for the production of iron for the benefit of the whole Commonwealth-becaus e I think that in order to compete with iron founders elsewhere the locally-manufactured iron would have to be sold virtually at cost price. Therefore, the State which entered upon the industry might reasonably ask fche ComCOOK -No; it would cost monwealth to provide the money necessary to make a start. Then, if a good manager were obtained, and there were no political interference, it could produce iron and steel, providing merely for working expenses, at It a price which would defy competition. The evidence of Mr Sandford and others goes to show that iron could be produced in Australia very cheaply. In any case, the Commonwealth will get no direct benefit from the proposed expenditure. It makes a free gif t of the bounty, and I think that the money, if given, should be given to a State. I am therefore prepared to vote for the second reading, but I intend, in Committee, to move for the amendment of the B ill in such a way as will make the bounty available only to a State. I would never vote for the payment of money to private individuals for the establishment of a monopoly, because my study of the trust fiend in I thought that the honorAmerica shows that there is no crime which its agents have not committed.

I would rather the country should remain as it is than start a monopoly ""here. The bonus, if paid to private individuals, would go, in the first instance, to help two parties to successfully float a loan on the London market, and at least one-fourth of it would be paid to the British money lender, who has already done well out of Australia, because he has had from us more money than we have ever borrowed from him, while we are as much in debt as ever. BeforeI sit clown I should like to quote paragraph 12 of the majority report of the Commission, though I would point out that the members of the Commission were almost equally divided, and, in my opinion, it was the minority who came to the correct decision. Paragraph 12 of the majority report is as follows : The existence of powerful rival vested interests elsewhere, and the novelty of the enterprise, so far as Australia is concerned, induce some hesitapared to grant them, in a straightforward tion in investing on the part of capitalists. That, I think, exactly recognises the position. Capitalists are interested in securing profitable returns for their investments, and the great iron masters of the world have sufficient to occupy their attention elsewhere without coming to Australia to build up an industry for us. To summarize my arguments, I am opposed to the granting of a bonus to private individuals, because I think that the investigation of the Commission does not justify it. The Canadian experience has shown that it is not likely to tempt capitalists to invest their money in the industry here. If it did, however, it would establish a monopoly which would bring in its train the notorious evils against which they are striving so hard in America. Government has already promised to introduce legislation dealing with trusts and combines, and it would not be wise to establish under private enterprise an industry which must, in the very nature of things, be a monopoly. industry^ if established, would not give a great deal of employment. established at all, I think that it should be taken up by a State under independent management. duced were sold at cost price, it might be a good thing for the local manufacturers of iron and steel goods. no doubt, that may come about, and I would rather wait for the increase Mr Spence. of population and the ripening of public opinion which would justify it.

If we hacl a capital superintendent, we should have some guarantee of success. For these reasons I intend to vote for the second reading of the B ill .

My attitude is a very simple one. I am utterly opposed to the Bill, and I intend to vote against the second reading and the third reading, I opoose it in every shape and form, and I think I have very serious reasons for taking that course. The honourable member who preceded me made one of the strongest speeches that could be made against the B ill , but in view of the statements he made, many of which I think are entitled to very great weight, I could not appreciate the conclusion at which he arrived to vote for the second reading of the measure. I was very much struck by one remark of the honourable member for Darling, and I heartily sympathize with it. If we are to be moved by feelings of consideration in reference to proposed enterprises on the part of private individuals, I agree with the honourable member that we should adopt as objects of our solicitude, not rich syndicates or speculators, but those struggling persons who are trying to make their way here in developing equally valuable industries throughout the length and breadth of our interior. If the principle of the Bill is a right and proper one, and public money is to be expended in large sums to promote private enterprises, I should infinitely prefer to devote; those large sums to assisting our struggling I hope that this most afsettlers of the bush, who are laying the foundations of the true nation under all sorts of difficulties. I would sooner help 10,000 of such persons than assist the rich syndicates who are ready to risk their money if the State will guarantee them to the extent of £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 or £300,000-becaus e that is the proposiA l l this affectation of symtion now before us. Most people, whenever they enter upon an enterprise, however genuine it may be, and however much it is to be encouraged, have to fight their own are the least capable of any way. Their enterprise is exposed to the risk of mistakes and misfortunes, and if they make mistakes, or misfortunes overtake them, they have to pay the penalty. Under the proposal embodied in the Bill, however, the country would have to bear Passing from the the burden in other words, the unfortunate struggling settler, who is endeavouring to lead a life of industry and enterprise. The principle of the Bill should not be made to apply specially to the production of iron, or spelter, or reapers and binders. If it be a proper one, it would be infinitely better to apply it to other industries. That is the view taken by my honourable friend, with which I heartily sympathize. No one wishes to underrate the importance of the great iron industry, and any one would, I am sure, rejoice to see it well founded and flourishing. But can there be the slightest doubt that, in conferring a bonus, the State would give the benefits of profit to a syndicate, with a certainty that if there were no profit, the country would have to bear the burden to all eternity.

228,Mr Reid,"granting a bonus of £250,000. If that were to be the end of it, the amount involved would demand serious consideration at the present time, even if the object were a good one. But what this proposal means is that, after the bonus has been expended, a burden will be placed upon all the manufacturing and producing interests of Australia, in the way of duties of Customs, upon an article which is the basis of all industrial expansion. There are two aspects to this matter, and I think I might fairlyeven if I were a protectionist-hesitate to handicap our great factories, our foundries, and our ironworks, by exposing them to the danger of greater difficulties than they already experience. What is the cry now?. For more protection and for higher duties, to save certain industries from ruination. turers if we limited their freedom in the choice of the raw materials, without which they could not run their factories? Would it help them to place Tariff restrictions upon the articles which they must buy in order to carry on their businesses? Is it not a fact that most of the manufacturers of Australia look upon this'' Bill with great suspicion and uneasiness, because they know that, whilst it has as good an object as the encouragement of a new industry, it will inevitably in the future, so far as can be seen, place further difficulties in the way of establishing other industries on a sound foundation. If anything would make one hesitate in regard to a Bill of this kind, it is the singular fact that twelve most intelligent members of this House, as members of the Iron Bonus Committee, met, carefully considered this matter, heard a great deal of evidence, and as a result were equally divided. Six of them took a much more cautious view of this matter than when it was first broached, whilst the other six, induty, as, pending a local supply sufficient for cluding the present leader of the Opposition-who is a sincere protectionist-reported absolutely against the Bill, and absoshould be avoided. lutely against this bonus system. As for the six who had reported in favour of it, they expressed an opinion in favour of bonuses as a necessary encouragement, and in paragraph 15 of the report, took up an extraordinary position, which puzzles me. I have always understood that the object of a protective duty was to bridge over the time whilst an industry was being planted, and was struggling in the earliest phases of is to accomplish any good whatever? But its existence. That has generally been the Mr Reid. argument which has appealed most to the sympathies of the great mass of the people. "" Here is a valuable seed, which may grow up into a stately tree. In the moment of its germination, and in the moments of its first struggles for existence, whilst it is acquiringfirmnessof root in the soil-dur ing those trying periods-w e want to impose a duty in order to shelter, encourage, and protect it . "" That has been said again and again. But the five protectionist members of the Commission, whilst they are in favour of granting a bonus for the encouragement of this great national enterprise, deliberately deprecate the establishment of a duty to assist it, until it has overtaken the requirements of the home market. What more strength does this plant of industry want than the strength of existence Would it help our manufacwhich has enabled it to overtake all the wants of the Australian market. WhatI wish to point out is, that the industry will have risen to that strength and vigorous life which will have enabled it to overtake the whole demands of Australia. That is not the time at which it should need a protective duty. It will have arrived at a period when it needs no protection and no shelter. But the protectionist, section of the Commission gravely made the following observation in paragraph 15:Your Commissioners do not lose sight of the fact that the bonus system in Canada was accompanied by a duty on imports. As the other section of the Commission has pointed out, the Canadian experience, when closely examined, is not a very encouraging one. But let us assume that it was. The Canadian offer was one of a bonus and a duty, which is not the present proposal. Speaking of that question, the protectionist members of the Commission sayYour Commissioners, however, do not recommend the immediate imposition of a Customs Australian requirements, the result might be to temporarily raise the price to the consumer, which That is the free-trade talk I like to hear. These gentlemen shrink even from temporarily increasing the price to the consumer in the. early days of this industry. Do not the protectionists frankly tell us that in the struggling days of a protected industry there must be an increase in the price of the commodities which it produces, owing to the operation of the duty, if that duty the effect of the evidence given before the Commission was to drive my protectionist friends from their chief position, and to compel them to take ujp the attitudewhich, from their point of view, is an exceedingly weak one-that in the early and struggling days of the iron industry no duty must .be imposed, because its operation would temporarily increase the cost to the consumer. I think the reason for that expression of opinion is, after all, a very good and a very wise one, altogether apart from fiscal consistencies or inconsistencies. These honourable members realized what we all know-withou t going to the trouble of collecting evidence-that if we increase the cost of iron and steel in Australia, we are not encouraging native industries, but hurting them in their most sensitive and vital part. There is not an industry-irrespec tive of whether it be a primary or manufacturing industrywhich is not concerned in obtaining a cheap and plentiful supply of these materials. members of the Commission realized that so keenly that they shrank from the task of further handicapping our producers even on behalfof a grand industry like the iron industry. We know that that industry is one of the most difficult to establish. Honourable members talk about producing pig iron, bar iron, and steel as if we merely had to turn out some simple article of ordinary use. which steel and iron are employed the most scientific care has to be exercised as to the precise quality of the iron and steel used. One would think that we had only to tap an iron deposit, rush the ore into a furnace, and employ some of the methods of industrial change to turn out the very article which our manufacturers require in all their varied enterprises. the fact. A large number of our factories have to obtain the best material in the world. turers declare that even the best American steel is not good enough for them. They have to import a special class of steel from a particular portion of the United Kingdom. Consequently this is one of the most critical enterprises in which any individual can embark, despite the advantages which we enjoy in possessing vast quantities of the raw material. question of freights. In the first place the project is that this industry shall be established in New South Wales. I must admit that that is a feature of it which puts a certain glimmer of satisfaction into the minds of representatives of that State. What1 am about to say, however, makes the location of the works immaterial to my argument. As has been pointed out, the freight from London to any port in Australia is less than the freight from one port in Australia to another--man y times less. Minister would remember that fact when we are considering the Tariff. bering it upon the present occasion. If I had to remember everything about the honourable member I should lose my reason. The moment the proprietors of the projected great national iron works had to send their iron from Sydney to Melbourne, Fremantle, Adelaide, or Brisbane, they would have to struggle with the difficulty that they would be called upon to pay three times as much freight as is charged for conveying English iron from London to Adelaide. Is not that Even, the protectionist a big handicap to Australian iron ? It is a tremendous handicap, and it is destined to increase, because we are about to pass legislation which will make the navigation of the Australian coast dearer than ever. It is a remarkable thing that rich ship-owners, who have made large fortunes on the Australian coast out of the producers of the Commonwealth, should desire to see this poor, struggling industry nurtured by furWhy, in the finer manufactures in ther public Bounties, whilst they offer one of the most serlious obstacles to the development of Australia. All these things seem to .hang together. Here we have an industry which is so inseparably intertwined with all the industries of Australia that if we increase the cost of its raw material, whilst we shall be doing a good thing in one direction, we shall be bringing into existence a The very reverse is multitude of difficulties in regard to all the other industries that we possess. The report of the protectionist members of the ComSome of the Victorian manufacmission-as I have said-put s forward one of the strongest reasons why we should hesitate to engage in this enterprise at the present time. The other half of the Commission, including my honourable friend the leader of the Opposition, were opposed to the passage of a Bill providing for the payment of bonuses to assist in the establishment of the iron industry. Half of the Let me deal briefly with the Commission were opposed to the Bill without any qualification. They sayThe ""Bill provides for the payment of ,£324,000 of the people's money to private individuals engaged in an enterprise for their private gain.

Is the House likely to allow that gieat undertaking to go down and perish? No, we shall have to keep it alive. If we plant this great enterprise it is a guarantee on the part of this Parliament that we will not allow it to perish, if only to prevent the waste of this public money. I cordially agree with those members of the Commission, including the honourable member for Bland. He is the only protectionist amongst the six members who signed the particular report to which I refer. The rest were free traders. I cordially agree with him that if 'this syndicate is to be given different terms from those which people have to endure all over Australia we shall not only be required to grant a bonus of £250,000, but to become an insurance against difficulties for all time to come. That is a big contract to enter into, considering the difficulties to which our people, who are not members only one syndicate. of a syndicate, are exposed from day to day.

In July of this It is worthy of considerayear the Dominion Government decided to postpone the operation of this sliding scale for one year, which practically means a further increase in the bounties paid.

Then the CommisNearly all the witnesses examined before the commenced the liability of the Commonwealth will not be limited to The sum proposed under the W'j see exactly what that means. We cannot place upon the manufacturing industries of Australia further difficulties and burdens. I am sure that no one wishes to do that. As one of the witnesses said, "" We do not mind a duty upon iron if you will impose a higher duty upon the articles we produce, because we shall have to pay more for our raw material."" Consequently, this proposal amounts to the imposition of a burden in one direction, which will have to be equalized by levying a burden in another direction, and one which will handicap all the industries in Australia in which certain manufactured articles are used. This enterprise is a noble enterprise. The iron, industry is a grand industry. But we have other grand industries.' Surely our natural industries come within that category-industrie s which were begun and which are being carried on by private enterprise without any bonus or State assistance whatever. Surely they are worthy of as much sympathy and help as are those gentlemen in a large way, who desire to indulge in a national speculation.

M.r. WATKINS -That remark does not apply to the Commonwealth. and Mr Middleton came before the Commission as the representative of a Victorian industry. not even impose a revenue duty on pig iron. Why? local production. that revenue duties are put on. But the State Parliament did not even impose a revenue dutya perfectly legitimate one in the opinion of all of us-o n iron. The Victorian Legislature knew that if they were to do their best to assist their manufacturers in the State, the raw material should not be made unduly expensive by any action on their part. The passing of this Bil l would create a condition of things quite the reverse of the policy of the Victorian protectionists in reference to this material. If the duty is to be eventually imposedafter the bonus has worked out-w e know that it must tend to hamper to some extent all factories using iron as their raw material, and that they will require a higher duty upon their manufactured products, to put them in something like the same position that they occupied before. I believe that a bonus of £ 1 a yard was once offered in Victoria for the local manufacture of 5,000 yards of worsted. The 5,000 yards were made, and the bonus, amounting to £ 5 , 0 0 0 , was paid, but not another yard of worsted was ever made in Victoria after the bonus was exhausted. bonus of £ 5 , 0 0 0 was offered in Queensland for the establishment of the cotton industry. to earn the bonus? the parties in question obtained the bonus, I do not know anything they did not make another yard. the rate of bonus proposed to be given under this Bill is such that it would secure the absolute establishment of these works. It is only fair to admit that with a bonus of 12s. per ton. it would be necessary for those engaging in the industry to have really Iron was admitted free good works in existence before they could secure much of the money proposed to be paid away in this manner. But once we start these works, practically under our I am speaking of Victoria, guarantee , we shall have to run them for 1 all time. The suggestion that 10,000 men would find employment in the works to be The Government of Victoria did established is the wildest rubbish in the world. Labour-saving appliances have been brought to such a high state of perfection that a man. visiting one of the great ironworks of the world can see a boy touch a button, and in that way exercise It is in such circumstances a force equal to the strength of 100 men. Factories employing twenty men and boys are able to turn out 2,000 or 3,000 tons of steel rails every day. The machinery does all the handling, the transferring, and the lifting. Mr Mephan Ferguson, who, I think, is regarded as an eminent engineer, told me that he went all over the great foundries in England, and he was the first to open my eyes to the absurdity of the suggestion that the manufacture of 10,000 or 20,000 tons of steel rails per annum would set a local factory going. He said that he visited works in Glasgow where a mere handful of men and boys, so to speak, were able, owing to the perfect machinery employed, to turn out immense quantities of steel rails. evidence before the Commission that a factory in Germany gave employment to 13,000 persons. mous factory.",55,Manufactures Encouragement Bill Second Reading

284,Mr Reid,"That is all right, but weof our doing business. I have spoken, I hope, with perfect frankness, because I wish to absolutely clear myself from any responsibility for this great experiment. I desire my position to be clearly understood. I believe that if we pass this Bill we shall have to take the factory established under it into our own hands for all time, either by taking it over as a State concern, or by increasing the duties on the raw material of order to make it a profitable business. opinion of the other half of the Government on this question ? position is speaking, my honourable friend does not ask such an idiotic question about the honourable arid learned member for Indi. I am beginning to understand him, however. I have long ago lost any personal feeling in regard to him, because I know that, although his manner is rather crude now, it will improve with time. honourable member for Gippsland on this subject. member will hear him. the measure thoroughly and clearly, I hope, I wish to say that I have always made a distinction in favour of a bonus as against a protective duty. posed bonus would be the end of the matter, that no protective duty would afterwards be asked for, I should not feel half the opposition to the Bill that I now feel, because if by the payment of a bonus we established a flourishing industry which would not require further help, we should have made what would not be a bad investment."" Buti f in the future, there is to be a perpetual drain upon the people, in the shape of a duty, the matter will be much more serious than the proposed bonus. The distinction between a bonus and a protective duty has been drawn scores of times, and is as obvious to every honourable member as it is to me. of a bonus is that it is known, first, how much money is -to be paid; and, secondly, where it is going. haps, where the proposed bonus will go, because it is uncertain who wil l take the matter up. be a great consolation to me should a man like Mr Sandford obtain the bonus. Worthy citizen as Mr Jamieson may be, I draw a great distinction between the promoter of a ford, who has been engaged for twenty or thirty years in developing the iron industry in the State of New South Wales. There is a third respect in which a bonus differs from a protective duty. If the establishment of an industry is a national concern, requiring national assistance, the expense should be paid for out of the .national pocket, and not out of the pockets of those who all the industries of Australia in patronize the industry by using what it pro-: duces. My most serious objection to protective duties has been that they take toll of those who are encouraging the protected factories by buying their productions, whereas it is the nation which ouffht to bear the cost of the protection. If a man buys galvanized iron from a protected Victorian or New South Wales factory he should not be specially taxed; the burden of protecting that factory should be borne by the nation. Therefore, in my opinion, if an industry is a national one, and requires national assistance, it is better to establish it by means of a bonus, which will be paid for by the Commonwealth, than by means of a protective duty. My strongest objection to the B ill , however, is that, although in form it is a bonus Bill, we shall find that after the Having criticised bonus has been paid, we shall be committed to the imposition of a protective duty upon' iron. gentleman say how the money required to pay the proposed bonus is to be raised ? the Minister of Trade and Customs.

331,Mr Salmon (Laanecoorie),"I regretat this early hour. words upon this B ill , but my remarks would not have occupied many minutes, because I am anxious to see the measure pass, and I do not intend to assist those who wish to block it. It is a B ill upon which honourable members have already made up their minds; I therefore regret that the Government have allowed a curtailment of the time which could have been occupied in the discussion of this important matter. I trust that when we meet to-morrow, an effort will be made by the supporters of the Bill to secure its passage through this House by allowing those who are opposed to it to do all the talking. me that the Government, having abandoned the B ill , now wish to lecture those honourable members who desire that the same privilege shall be extended to them that has been extended to Ministerial followers. hour when it is reasonable to adjourn the discussion. Laanecoorie states that he was ready to continue the debate, and was anxious that it should proceed. No one denies the accuracy of his statement, but the honourable member for Bourke was also ready to go on. It now appears that the Government desire to apply the gag. the adjournment of the debate, how can the honourable member make such an assertion? concessions which deserve no thanks. think that the request for the adjournment ot the debate was granted with a very ill grace. member thinks that the Opposition is going to submit to a lecture at the hands of the Government majority he makes a mistake. I trust that the conduct of this important debate will be marked by that courtesy which has characterized the action of the Government in connection with discussions of far less importance.

It is quite refreshing to hear the honourable member for Wide Bay The honourable member for lecturing the Government for transferring so important a measure as the Manufactures Encouragement B ill to the charge of a private member of the House, when, as a matter of fact, the Ministry of which he was a member, laid down the precedent which is now being followed. Why did the leader of the late Government give the honourable member for Hume the right to deal with a measure of this importance ? wrong in saying that we created a precedent for this action; the Barton Government exI tended a similar privilege to the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne.

The honourable member for Wide Bay has lectured the Government for doing that which his own Ministry was prepared to do. I think that the Government ought to take a firm stand.

When tlie Bill was re-introduced to the House a few nights ago, by the honourable member for Eden Monaro, no one was prepared to continue the debate. Personally, I do not desire to speak on the motion for the second reading, because I realize that we had a second reading debate on a previous occasion. I am prepared to vote without speaking to the motion, and those who support the Bill are taking an unjustifiable risk in occupying so much time in discussing it at the present stage. If the Government are. going to allow the debate to be adjourned at this early hour, night after night, and to refrain from bringing forward other business, they will place their supporters in an unfair posimember in charge of a BillI recognise that tion. I made an appointment-the first I have ventured to make for a considerable time-for to-morrow, but I now find that, owing to the want of decision on .the part of the Government, I shall have to break it. AmI to be compelled to remain in this House, week after week, for twelve months in the year? When I sought the suffrages of the electors, no one contemplated that I should be compelled to sit here day after day all the year round, and that I should ibe debarred fromdevoting any time to my private business. It may be all very well for those who have wealth and leisure to sit here day after day, but I have neither. It is the duty of the Government to insist on the reasonable despatch of public business. This is the second occasion on which I have entered my protest, and if the conditions to which I object are allowed to continue, I shall take the very first opportunity that presents itself to express by my vote a very decided opinion about the matter -* I have no hesitation in saying that if such an occasion again arises, the Government should not allow the Opposition to determine, so to speak, the hour at which the consideration of public business shall cease. With this clear and distinct statement of my position, I shall conclude by saying that I look upon the present method of conducting business in this House as an absolute waste of time. 9T External Affairs) I regret that the honourable member for Moira should have assumed this tone on the present occasion. I have had to draw attention to the matter. slenderness' of the majority that I possess, but I absolutely refuse to occupy the position I do if I am to be spoken to in that way. I would remind the honourable member that I have given over this week to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for the express purpose of dealing with the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, and that a little while ago he asked me, in the interests of the measure, to consent to an adjournment of this debate. I am not in the position in which the leader of a Government generally is, when conducting Government business. My honourable friend forgets that. EitherI have made a mistake in giving time for the consideration of the Bill, or I have not. But when I do give a week to an honourable I must study' his wishes in connection with the matter.

It is not correct that the usual time for adjournment is half-past .ten o'clock, when measures of first-rate importance are before us. The usual time is eleven o'clock, except on Tuesdays, and the Prime Minister intimated that we should adjourn at that hour. I admit that the late Government, in its easy complaisant way, did adjourn much earlier than previous Governments. The honourable member for Bourke has made an unreasonable demand in an unreasonable spirit I hope the Government will see that they have a sufficient number of supporters to prevent a repetition of what has occurred to-night; because we ought not to allow this gloating on the part of the Opposition, who are already clamouring indecently for the seats from which they were so lately deposed. surprised at the turn taken by the debate on the motion for adjournment. I must express my admiration at the stand made by the Prime Minister in regard to the remarks of .the honourable member for Moira. We appreciate in public men, as in private citizens in high positions, a readiness to take responsibility, and to resign their posts if they cannot continue to hold them with honour and dignity. For that reason I admired the manner in which the right honourable gentleman replied to the threat of the honourable member for Moira. I think that no COOK -Which is very unleader of a Government who was worthy pf his position would tolerate any dictation of that kind.

Some of us, who represent distant States, are prepared to attend at all hours to do the duty for which we were elected.

Apparently he seems to think that he aione honhas a right to dictate to the head of the Government as to how business should be transactedOnly the other night he said that the Government were not exercising that firmness which he There would like to see.
