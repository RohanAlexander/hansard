Following upon such a review recently the Government decided that because it -was not possible constitutionally to continue to conduct the industry its property should be disposed of. It was decided to give to the States concerned an opportunity to acquire the -property as a going concern. If they declined the opportunity, then to give spinners and others interested an opportunity to acquire it.

The allowance was based :iipon .the needs of a single man, .and provision, was made for additional payments to trainees with wives and dependent children. The scheme is not 'ungenerous, aud it compares favourably with similar schemes da any other part of the world. Theso payments have been made for over four years. At no t me has the basis of them : been criticized in this Parliament. Since the inception of the scheme, the allowance has been increased on 'two occasions. The most recent increase -was one of '5s. a week, which was made in conformity with the .promise made in the budget speech. In considering the allowances that are .paid to ex-servicemen' generally, it is necessary to hear in mind that, after all, the 'community has to pay them, The honourable member for Richmond has continually advocated the reduction of taxes. He cannot have it both ways. He canhot with any hope of suecess advocate a reduction of taxes and at the same time advocate the increase of an allowance whioh is, I believe, fairly generous.

Tn answer to the first portion of the question, however, at least two unions involved in the prosecutions made under the Victorian Government's emergency legislation are registered with the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. Whether the powers of the State and the Commonwealth clash as a result of the operation of the Essential Services Act of Victoria, I shall leave to the Attorney General or his advisers. In reply to the second portion of the question, it is trueand here I can give only the facts-that the leaders of two of the unions involved in the prosecutions who are well known mcmbers of the Communist party were not prosecuted. I have no knowledge that they are members of the Communist party, hut they say so themselves. It is also true that most of tlie unionists prosecuted are members of the Australian Labour party and therefore not members of the Communist party. I do not know why a discrimination was made by the Government of Victoria. Dame ESTID LYONS.^Has the Minister seen a statement made in Adelaide on Sunday morning by Mr not seen the article, I should like to make W. B. Darker, who recently returned from a conference in Johannesburg, to the effect that there were great possibilities of developing reciprocal trade between Australia and East Africa? Js the Minister .aware that East Africa is anxious to import from Australia such commodities as wheat, butter, canned foods, hardware, knitting wool, tinned meats, jam, dairy products, powdered milk, and cheese; and that in return East Africa could supply to Australia sisal, cotton, oils, coffee and tea? Can the Minister give an indication of any plans which his department may have for developing this important new market? statement referred to but I know that there are opportunities for reciprocal trade between East Africa and Australia and that advantage has been taken of such .trading opportunities in respect of wheat, which goes to the African continent .and, on some -occasions, to East are under contract to the United Kingdom to sell to that country the bulk of our exports, hut of ivhich we will have small quantities available to other markets.; and of wool, which exporters are allowed to export to Africai f they so desire after the home-consumption demand in Australia has been met. Australia has a Trade Commissioner and staff in South Africa. The Trade Commissioner was recently allowed to tornAfrica with a delegation that went to that country ancl I have seen published accounts of his activities and of the work he is doing. I consider that the service performed by the Trade Commissioner in Africa at the moment is wide enough in scope to enable contact to bc maintained with East Africa.

27,(In,"Mr LANG -Has the attention of theregulation it is necessary to keep export control? In view of these statements, will the Government ask its High Commissioner in Ceylon to forward a report regarding any evidence of the existence of a world"" tea cartel ? Will the Government consider the abandonment of tea rationing in Australia? Will it review its present tea subsidy policy to ascertain whether that policy is not merely subsidizing the tea cartel at the expense of Australian taxpayers ? this morning to read a very long report about the position of tea production which dealt not only with tea production in India and Ceylon but also with the possibility of its further development and expansion in the Netherlands East Indies. I do not know whether, in some cases, combines operate for the sale of tea, but generally speaking there has not been sufficient tea production in the world to meet world consumption requirements. Last year, the world demand for tea exceeded production hy approximately 15 per cent. However, it is expected that when tea-producing areas have heen restored and developed in the Netherlands East Indies there will he ample tea to meet requirements, but we do not know when those plantations will resume full production. A large number of trees, which have been allowed to overgrow, have had to be, or will have to be, pruned heavily. After that operation, the trees will not produce fully again for two years. To-day, the Tea Controller, Mr Bennett, has indicated that we may have to make representations to the Netherlands East Indies in order to ascertain whether we shall be able to obtain additional quantities of tea from that area. Because of the shortage of that commodity, and the need for ensuring that we receive our allocation, the Government has controlled the purchase of tea and rationed supplies to Australian consumers. The honorahle member for Reid should remember that the Government is paying a subsidy of approximately 2s. 6d. per lb. on tea. There is a small tax of about 3d. per lb., but that is only a contra in the subsidy account. Eveni f ample supplies were available, the Government would not he prepared to permit purchases in excess of the necesment is that both of the new aircraft sary requirements of the community while it was paying such a heavy subsidy. 1 assure the honourable member that the matter has been examined very closely. A majority of tea merchants favour abolishing the rationing of this commodity and increasing the price, but the Government, has not yet been able to accept their opinion. We have not yet fixed a date for the abolition of tea rationing, but the matter is always receiving consideration. I am not able to guarantee whether rationing will be abolished six months or even twelve months hence. for the Navy inform the House when the two new aircraft carriers for the Royal Australian Navy will be put into service. Is it proposed to alter from time to time the types of aircraft that will be based on those carriers, and will any Australian industry be established for this purpose? Is it proposed to make any base in Western Australia capable of servicing these vessels? that the first aircraft carrier will reach Australia early in the new year and will enter upon service with the Royal Australian Naval Squadron immediately. The second aircraft carrier has not yet been built. Steps will be taken during its construction to ensure that only the most modern equipment is fitted. It is impossible to forecast when this aircraft carrier will he completed. At present aircraft carriers are being equipped with Firefly and Sea Fury aeroplanes, although from time to time the taking into use of jet-propelled aircraft for that purpose has been considered by the Royal Navy. This aspect of the matter is also being closely watched by the Australian Government in association with the authorities in Great Britain. If the use of jet-propelled or other modern types of aircraft is found to be expedient by the British authorities, the Royal Australian Navy will immediately consider the advisability of their use in conjunction with aircraft carriers attached to the Royal Australian Naval Squadron.

The possibility of the development of the Australian aircraft production industry in connection with this matter has not been overlooked.

AlthoughI do not know whether such works will be established in Western Australia, the manufacturers of aircraft to be provided for use with the aircraft carriers have already taken action to establish works in the eastern part of this country. EICE. requested the Prime Minister to look into the matter of the export of rice from Australia. Will the right honourable gentleman inform the House whether he has yet had an opportunity to discuss this matter with the-British Government, and, if so, with what result? I point out that due to drought conditions operating in various parts of Australia, the price of vegetables has risen considerably. In the three years that have elapsed since the termination of World War II . , every effort has been made by rice-growers in Australia to increase their production, in order to make as much rice as possible available for the peoples of other countries of thc world who desperately need it. During that period, however, those countries have had ample opportunity to again develop tlieir rice-fields. I Tikewise draw attention to the fact that large quantities of this commodity aro still, apparently, being supplied to Chinese cafe proprietors in Australia. Will the Prime Minister examine this matter thoroughly with a view to having supplies of rice released for purchase by the working people of Australia, who would welcome the opportunity to obtain a substitute for vegetables at present? merce and Agriculture will answer the question. people, particularly members of the Parthe Prime Minister a question about the liament, knew that, with the ardent suppractice that is followed in the Public port of tha United Kingdom', Australia Service when a senior position has tohe was exporting rice to help prevent, millions of eastern, people from dying of starvation. ago.. present. The honorahle memberwill appreciate that Malaya generally, and .Singapore particularly, have a close association with the British Commonwealth of Nations. At thestrongly expressed wish of the Government of the United Kingdom,, the Australian Government in order to help the people of eastern countries, is depriving its. own people of. rice, grown in this country. By doing this, Australia is not only rendering a great humanitarian service to hundreds of thousands of Asiatics who are literally starving, but also is assisting the United Kingdom considerably. While starvation conditions exist in eastern. Asia, it is unlikely that, the honourable member for Moreton, or those for-whom he speaks in this Parliament, will be able to get rice in the quantities that they desire. At the outbreak of the Pacific war, an allowance of rice was made to Chinese residents of this country. That ration continues, but supplies are not made available to cafes. No doubt, in some cases, Chinese cafe proprietors deprive themselves of rice and sell it to Europeans and, to that degree, there may be some black marketing in rice. In the rationing of rice to the Chinese community, we have had the whole-hearted co-operation of the Chinese Consul General, who, through his officers, issues rice coupons to Chinese residents in this country. Each receives his own. supply, but -probably some of them hand their rations over for sale in cafes. That, however, is no condemnation of Australia's gesture in exporting rice to assist unfortunate people in other parts of the world. Upon the production of a medical certificate, rice is made available in this country to Europeans who are invalids and require rice in their diet.

42,Mr Chifley,"The strengtheningnow considering methods of strengthening Commonwealth buildings, particularly in the foundations. The problem was recently discussed with the eminent British scientist, Sir Henry Tizard. The decentralization of industry is a difficult problem. That has been proved hy the British Government, which is endeavouring to persuade British industrialists to move their factories from cities to less densely populated areas. The problem is made difficult by the shortage of men and materials apart from the great cost involved in transferring factories from cities to outer areas. We have encouraged manufacturers in Australia to establish their industries or subsidiaries in country areas. If a new industry is being established, we try to induce the company concerned to avoid metropolitan sites. We bave to a degree succeeded. The Burlington Mills and, I understand, other firms are being established at Rutherford in New South Wales. The factories of Electricity Meter and Allied Industries Limited, better known as "" Emco "", and California Productions Limited are also to be established outside Sydney. The same policy is being applied in Victoria, where new factories, including one owned by an English firm, have been, or are being, established at Ballarat. Assistance is being given, not directly, but indirectly, to firms prepared to establish their factories in country areas. All State governments, regardless of their political colour, are endeavouring to persuade large industrial concerns contemplating enlargement of their enterprises to transfer to country areas. The honorahle member may rest assured that the matter is being closely watched. The British Government subsidizes firms prepared to establish themselves outside cities. We are encouraging Australian firms to do the same thing. negotiations at present pending between the Prime Minister and Mr Cunliffe, managing director of the British Aluminium Company, and the probability that Tasmania is likely to lose the aluminium ingot production plant already planned for that State can the Prime Minister indicate what other type of industry it is proposed to establish in Tasmania in consideration of the withdrawing of .that State from the agreement made with the Australian Government under the Aluminium Industry Act? raised some days ago and I indicated then that any proposal for altering the agreement would have to ibe satisfactory to the Tasmanian Government. Otherwise the present agreement between the Australian and the Tasmanian Governments must stand. The Australian Government will not be responsible for breaking the agreement. I have spoken to Mr Cosgrove, the Premier of Tasmania, about the matter and I do not desire to commit either him or his Government to any views upon it. I gathered that if any re-arrangement were suggested which would involve the repeal of the present agreement to permit the Commonwealth to join with other concerns for the produetion of aluminium on a much larger scale, the Tasmanian Government would ibe prepared to consider it provided that Tasmania was 'assured of the volume of industrial activity originally contemplated for that State when the agreement was reached. A leader of the British aluminium industry arrived in Australia last week to consider the whole subject, and in view of certain developments he has now left Australia again to consult with his principals. The chairman of the Australian Aluminium Production Commission has sent me a letter the contents of which I propose to communicate to Mr Cosgrove. I shall indicate at the same time that any new proposals would not in any way reduce the volume of industrial activity that was originally intended should take place in Tasmania. Any variation of the original scheme might result in greater industrial activity in that State than was contemplated under the original agreement. No proposal will be made that will reduce the degree of industrial expansion originally intended for Tasmania, when the agreement was entered into. representing the Minister for Health",19,Atomic Energy Decentralization Of Industry

In regard to the were possible to import all the petrol we action taken, by Australia's, representative require in Australia from sterling areas, on the specific matter, mentioned by the honorahle member, I shall havo a statement prepared for him. In answer to requests made by the honourable member for Franklin and the honourable member for Warringah from time to time, I hope to present to the Parliament within the next day or two a statement on international affairs,, and if honourable members are brief enough on other matters there may he an opportunity to discuss it. aware that an Australian petrol company has claimed that, it can supply about half of Australia's require^ ments of petrol by shipping petrol to Australia from non-dollar areas in its own tankers? bonorable gentleman know anything of that claim, and. of its merits? Can he also indicate when the Australian people may expect some, relief from the present petrol rationing system ? when similar questions have been asked previously, I would require considerable time to furnish a proper explanation of the considerations involved in the restriction of Australia's consumption of petrol. Q have heard of offersby certain companies to supply petrol from sterling areas, but, like the honourable member for Parramatta, I do not propose-to. mention any names. Of course, some of the claims are completely exaggerated. From my knowledge of the overall picture, I am aware that the supply of petrol to Australia from sterling areas would involve the Tjnited Kingdom in the purchase of considerably more petrol from dollar areas. The supply of refined petrol throughout the world tliisyear is estimated to approximate 430,000,000 tons, and during' the next few years it is hoped to-increase the supply to-530;000,000 tons Mvnually. The biggest obstacle in the way of increasing production of refined petrol is the lack of sufficient machinery and refineries. To overcome the difficulty the British Government'proposes to establish, a number of refining plants, in addition to-those-which will be erected in the NetherlandsEast Indies. Eveni f it the United Kingdom would still have to pay dollars for the petrol it purchases. Since all the petrol used by Empire countries comes from the Empire petrol pool, every gallon saved means that a gallon Jess has to be purchased from the dollar area. The honourable member has mentioned a specific claim by a certain company. I have seen similar statements made by one or two companies. In each instance I ' doubted, the soundness of the claim. In any event, even if it were possible to import all our requirements of petrol from thenondollar areas, it would not, as I have endeavoured toexplain, improve the overall position.. An increasa of supplies of petrol depends largely on refining capacity. The consumption of Does the right petrol in the United States of America has increased over the pre-war consumption of that country by approximately 70 per cent., and similar increases are occurring in other countries. The greatest expansion of production of refined petrol which I can imagine-is from. 25 to 35 per cent, of the present production,, but even that, rate of increase will become possible only if all the projected refineries are constructed according to time-table.

I desire, Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Australian Country Party, to welcome you hack to the Parliament and to express the hope that you had a very pleasant sojourn on the other side of the world. This bill proposes four amendments to the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945. The first of these is to increase the maximum housing loan from £1,250 to £1,750. Honourable members on this side of the House have no objection to this amendment, which is obviously designed to meet the increase of housing costs which has occurred since the end of the war. ManyI movefactors have contributed to this increase. Not the least of them has been the premature introduction of the 40-hour week",23,Petrol

Other factors have heen low production per man-hour, the slow turnround of ships, the ever increasing cost of transport generally, and the increase of freights which has been brought about hy the Government's removal of subsidies following the recent referendum. The removal of those subsidies affected not only shipping freights but also the hasic wage. All those factors have increased building costs, and that is recognized in this measure, which, as I have said seeks to increase the maximum housing loan from £1,250 to £1,750. Although there is no objection in principle to this amendment, there is some objection to the action of the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) in giving ministerial approval to it as far back as last June, in anticipation of the Parliament passing this measure. That was an undue use of the powers of the Executive. Although the amendment has merits, I direct attention to what is, in the opinion of honourable memhers on this side of the House, a violation of the Government's constitutional authority and a neglect of the Parliament. bonorable gentleman that, in regard to tax matters, for many years Treasurers have acted in anticipation of legislation being passed by the Parliament. are some circumstances under which it may be necessary to do so, but I consider it to he a bad principle to take undue Executive action in anticipation of parliaGovernment in the past but for some of mentary authorization. The second amendment seeks to increase the maximum Mortgage Bank Department loan to an individual borrower from £5,000 to £10,000. There is no objection in principle to this increase. It is well known that production costs in the primary industries have increased sharply during the last few years. Land values have been pegged, but the prices of tractors, agricultural implements and so on have been increased by the present inflationary trends to such a degree that the present maximum loan of £5,000 is no longer adequate. The third amendment is designed to remove legal doubts which have arisen regarding the authority of the Bural Credits Department of the Commonwealth Bank to secure its advances on a government guarantee. This instrumentality is used tofinancethe marketing of primary products. Consequently, if there is any legal doubt about the extent to which security could be obtained or the functions of this department could be carried out, obviously those doubts should be removed, and so the Opposition has no objection to the amendment. The fourth amendment is designed to bring the definition of "" efficiency"" in relation to Commonwealth Bank officers, into line with the definition in the Public Service Act, and naturally there should not he any variance between the definitions. The widening of the definition, and its application to banking oflicials to the same extent as it applies to public servants, is a machinery matter to which the Opposition does not object. sire to supplement the remarks of my leader, and to say that the House is bound to take notice of the fact that the Government has considered it necessary to increase the permissible maximum loan for the building of houses from £1,250 to £1,750. Honourable members cannot proceed to adopt such an amendment without paying some regard to the causes which have rendered it necessary. I consider, as does my leader, that the results intended to he achieved hy some of the clauses would have been achieved by the its own actions, not the least of which was the introduction of the 40-hour week. I am sure that every honourable member on this side of the House, and no doubt every honourable member on the Government side, desires to institute shorter hours of lahour for workers. Buti f we had heen asked to conduct a competition to choose the most inopportune time to introduce shorter working hours, without prejudicing the national interest, I am. quite sure we could not have chosen a more inopportune time than the Government chose.

The honourable member's own leader set the question out very clearly and saw no necessity to go into those details. not going to have the novel situation "" novel situation"" is that the honourable member must obey the ruling of the Chair. There is no reference to the 40hour .week in the bill. to the speech of my leader in the bill. honorahle member should get on with his own speech. that it Is an extraordinary state of affairs that the Parliament should increase the permissible loan without the Government having justified or explained the circumstances that make such an increase necessary. Buti f I am obliged to pass that point without enlarging upon it I shall refer to the increase of permissible -loans upon mortgage and say that it has now become quite evident, and apparently it has been admitted by the Government, that the maximum permissible loan upon mortgage on rural land was previously inadequate at £5,000, as many honourable members claimed at the outset of the scheme. the Government is forced to admit that that maximum is inadequate and to raise it to £10,000. The necessity for the increase 'has nothing to do with an increase in the price of land, hecause rural land prices are still pegged by this Government at the same level as when the legislation that established the mortgage loan section of the Commonwealth BankI was introduced. That legislation has ing farmers of 'this country. It is extraordinary that the Commonwealth Bank, which is held up -to us hy the present Government as such an admirable institution that all other hanking institutions in the country should be abolished, cannot charge .as low .a rate of interest for mortgage .loans as the State banks can afford to do. The Credit Foncier branch of the State Savings Bank of Victoria charges a lower rate of interest for rural mortgage loans than the Commonwealth Bank charges. I should have expected that the Minister introducing Che bill would have made some reference to this discrepancy. Time and again honourable members on this side of the House have asked why the CommonThe wealth Bank could not reduce its interest rate on rural mortgage loans to at least the level charged by the State Savings Bank of Victoria. Time and again the Prime Minister .and Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) has stated that he would examine the position. Although .he has said on a number of occasions over a The period of years fhat he would do so, be has .never done anything about it. I do not know whether he haa actually examined the position or not. TJnder this legislation, upon which honorahle members are invited to vote, loans upon rural lands will bear an interest rate varying from 4 per cent, to 4^ per cent. Private mortgagees charge -as low a -rate of interest as that, and the rural credit section of the State Savings Bank of Victoria charges 3$ per cent. It seems curious that this magnificent Commonwealth Bank, which, in the opinion of the Government, should be given a complete monopoly, has to charge a higher rate of interest than a State instrumentality charges. It also seems curious that the Government has Now taken years to recognize that £5,000 is not :a high enough maximum permissible loan for rural land.

75,Mr Mcewen,"I intended to saythe number of successful applicants for rural mortgage loans, the last time 1 spoke on this matter in the HouseI was able to quote figures that showed that in the previous year only 416 applicauts had been successful in their applications for rural mortgage loans under the act. Very many more had made applications, but the incredibly conservative attitude of the Commonwealth Bank had prevented them from being successful. The truth is that whereas the rural mortgage loans provision was intended to enable the working farmer to get a loan of up to, as the statute provides, 70 per cent, of the value of his property, the attitude of the Commonwealth Bank under this Government has, as a matter of fact, converted the 70 per cent, valuation to, on an average, about. 50 per cent, of the true valuation. According to instances which have been repeatedly brought to my notice, the maximum loan that the bank will make upon rural lands is approximately 50 per cent, of the purchase price permitted by the Commonwealth Treasury. An incredible state of affairs has thereby arisen. The Commonwealth Treasury is the authority which approves of the purchase price. The act provides that the Commonwealth Bank may advance up to 70 per cent, of the value of the land, but the bank disputes the validity of the purchase price permitted by the Commonwealth Treasury, and writes down, the valuation to about 50 per cent. One piece of land, which I know very well, has changed hands three or four times in twenty years at approximately the same price. The value has not been complicated by improvements other than some fencing. When the Commonwealth Bank is asked to make an advance upon the property, it places a value upon it of about 60 per cent, of the amount which four successful practical farmers have been prepared to pay for it, and which the delegate of the Treasurer has approved of in the last sale. Yet the highest advance which the Commonwealth Bank will make is less than 50 per cent, of the purchase price. The only conclusion which I can reach is that persons who need a loan representing a reasonably high percen[121] tage of the value of the land in which tbey are interested, have no chance of gettingit from the Commonwealth Bank. The only people who have any prospect of being granted a loan at 4 per cent, or 4$ per cent, repayable in 20 years or 40 years are those who c-.n obtain a loan with equal facility elsewhere. In operation, the Mortgage Bank Department of the Commonwealth Bank has been a convenience to wealthy people, because they are able to get loans at 4. per cent, and 4J per cent, repayable in 20 years or 40 years. Because of the extreme conservatism of the valuers of the Commonwealth Bank the Mortgage Bank Department has not been of any use to the small farmer. I put it strongly to the Government that it is in an indefensible position when the delegate of the Treasurer approves of a price and the senior valuers in the Commonwealth Bank completely disregard his assessment and place a much lower valuation upon the property. This matter is one of. administration and the Treasurer himself must accept responsibility for it. TJnder the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945, the Labour Government abolished the Commonwealth Bank Board, which had previously exercised control over such matters. The Government claimed, at the time, that the substitution of ministerial control for the control which the Bank Board had exercised would be advantageous. In practice, that forecast has not been realized. If only 400 loan applications by farmers and pastoralists to the nation's own hank have been granted in a year I am satisfied that the administration of the institution is not satisfactory. Last week, the Government announced the appointment of the Director-General of Post-war Reconstruction, Dr. Coombs, as the new Governor of the hank. I am now discussing the proposed amendments of the Commonwealth Bank Act, and I contend that Dr. Coombs is not a banker in the ordinary sense. may not be a banker in the ordinary sense, but the honourable member for Indi is not in order, in debating this bill, in referring to the appointment of Dr. Coomb as Governor of the bank.

If the honourable member were permitted to forecast any conceivable amendment during the second-reading debate, his -scope would be unlimited. scope is not to be unlimited. I bow to your ruling, Mr Speaker, as I always do. In my opinion, increases of the amounts of permissible advances have been too long delayed, but the rate of interest on advances is higher than it ought to be. In arriving at this judgment, I have used as my measuring stick the rate of interest charged by the State banks. The land valuations of the Commonwealth Bank are unbelievably conservative. I challenge anybody to produce evidence that any other instrumentality in Australia is as conservative as is the Commonwealth Banki n that respect. It is not only curious but also improper that the Government should have one authority functioning under the Treasurer, namely, the delegate of the Treasurer, to place valuations upon land, and another authority, also operating -directly under the Treasurer, namely, a -senior valuer of the Commonwealth Bank, who usually makes conflicting valuations. ln discussing this bill to amend the -Commonwealth Bank Act 1945, I draw attention in particular to the amendment proposed in clause 5. That clause will add a new sub-section to section 165 of the principal act, which reads165 (1.) In the selection of an officer tor promotion to a vacant position, consideration shall be given first to the relative efficiency of the officers available for promotion and, in the event of equality of efficiency of -two or more officers, then to the relative -seniority of those officers. (2.) For the purposes of this section(a) ""efficiency"" means special qualifications and aptitude for the dismany officers of the Commonwealth Bank charge of the duties of the position throughout Australia. A young man who to be filled, together with merit, diligence and good conduct, and, in the case of an officer who has at any time been engaged on war service I emphasize the reference to war serviceincludes such efficiency as, in the opinion of the Bank, the officer would have attained but for his absence on war service; and (6) the seniority of officers shall be determined as prescribed. The bill will amend that section by adding the following sub-section:(3.) Notwithstanding anything contained in the last preceding sub-section, "" efficiency"" sliall, in relation to promotions to such senior I stress the word "" senior "" executive positions in the Service of the Bank as are prescribed, include not only special qualifications and aptitude for the discharge of the duties of the position to be filled but also for the discharge of the duties of positions of higher status in that Service. That means, in effect, that an officer of the bank will not be entitled to the benefits of the existing act for promotion hy reason of efficiency and seniority and that, if a vacancy occurs in a position higher than the immediate grade standard above that which he occupies, he may he debarred from appointment to it. Clause5 has two objectives. The first is to enable appointments by political patronage. That must he the interpretation of the provision. The second ohjecr tive is to remove the impediment created by the preference sections of the Re-establishment and Employment Act. This apparently innocent clause at the end of the bill will strike a blow against the law in relation to preference for ex-servicemen as it affects the promotion rights of Commonwealth Bank officers. AVhen the bill becomes law, ex-servicemen employed by the bank may still be translated from messengers to lift operators or from first-grade clerks to second-grade clerks, hut they may be debarred from promotion to such positions as that of senior inspector or even Governor of the bank. The bill will open the door wide to political patronage of the worse kind, and there is reason to believe that patronage of that sort is already being exercised in a way that is resented by enters the service of the Commonwealth Bank is led to believe that, provided that he is diligent and efficient in the performance of his duties, the highest offices",28,Chifley

I am pointing out that, in this respect, the bill which we are considering opens the gate to all kinds of abuses. It will amend an act which is only three years old and was introduced and proclaimed by the present Government. I cannot see any necessity for amending that legislation so soon after its enactment. The bill will strike at the principle of preference to ex-servicemen and will provide means for the exercise of political patronage, which has already been gratified to the utmost degree by . recent appointments. I add my criticism of this clause to that of Harrison). It is not so innocent as it appears, and I am sure that its provisions are resented by many Commonwealth Bank officers throughout Australia. They believe that, by virtue of the experience which they have gained in the service of the Commonwealth Bank, their intimate knowledge of the internal working of the bank, its exchange system, its currency system, its advance policy and everything else pertaining to its operations, as well as hy virtue of their loyalty and devotion to the service, they are entitled to be rewarded in due course, if their qualifications are adequate, with appointments to the highest positions in the bank. I agree with them. They cannot so believe today. Their doubts must be accentuated by the introduction of this bill so soon after the appointment of a new Governor of tlie Commonwealth Bank. They must now entertain grave doubts.

It is expressly aimed at defeating the prosigned to ensure that the "" little "" officers of the bank, who have stuck to it through thick and thin, would be rewarded with senior jobs. The amendment before the House deals only with the promotion of officers within the service. The honourable member is entitled to discuss that matter only.

In my opinion it would result in political patronage influencing the service.

I point out that this amendment seeks to increase the amount that may be lent on mortgage, from the present amount of £5,000, to £10,000. Despite the honourable member's criticism of the proposed increase, I remind honorahle members that in the past he has said that the amount which may be lent on mortgage should, at the outset, have been fixed at £10,000. As a result of inquiries that I have made in this matter f find that 2,158 advances have been made to primary producers, totalling £4,385,000, or an average of approximately £2,000 an applicant. These figures do not support the honourable member's contention that the Mortgage Bank Department has been used only to help wealthy graziers. An applicant who requires a loan of only £2,000 in connection with his grazing activities could, by no stretch of tbe imagination, be regarded as a wealthy grazier. talist honourable member now admits that he chargeable to local governing authorities. completely misled the House.

109,Mr Dedman,"I accept your ruling,certain, observations about the provisions of this bill relating to the promotion of officers of the Commonwealth Bank. First, I make it quite clear that the Commonwealth Bank is bound by the preference provisions of the Re-establishment and Employment Act, just as all other Government instrumentalities and private employers are bound, and that those provisions will be given effect by the Government. Secondly, section 165 of the principal act, which is to be amended by clause 5 of this bill, does not apply to the appointment of the Governor of the bank. The Governor is appointed under section 23 of the 1945 legislation, which was copied from earlier legislation brought in while the present Opposition parties occupied the treasury bench. In other words, the Governor of the hank The Minister is not entitled to refer to the Governor of the bank. That matter does not come within the scope of the bill. was endeavouring to make. Clause5 has no relation to the appointment of the Governor. I turn now to the other point that was made hy the honourable member for Richmond. This bill merely brings the Commonwealth Bank Act into line with the Commonwealth Public Service Act. There can be no question whatever of political patronage. The object of the amendment is to ensure that, in considering the appointment of an officer to any vacant position on the staff of the Commonwealth Bank, not only shall the efficiency of that officer in relation to the position to he filled be taken into account, but also his capacity for promotion to still higher rank will be considered. That is quite natural. I do not think that any opposition was raised in this chamber to the amendment of the Commonwealth Public Service Act in this way, and surely, if the provision is considered right for that act, it should also be considered right for this legislation. However, if there is anything in the argument used by the honourable member for Richmond, I remind him that the Commonwealth Bank Act provides for appeals If an officer believes that he is particularly qualified for a job that is vacant, and for higher positions, but that job has heen given to some one else, he may appeal to the tribunal for which provision is made in section 166 of the 1945 legislation. I contend, therefore, that there is no real substance in the arguments of the honourable member for Indi and the honourable member for Richmond. The honorahle member for Indi misrepresented the facts, particularly relating to interest rates and, as 1 have said, the provisions of this bill relating to promotions, merely bring the principal act into line with the Commonwealth Public Service Act, which, in this respect, was not criticized when it was before this chamber not long ago. question is that the bill be now read a second time. I wish to speak to this measure. The Minister has closed the debate. second reading of the bill was moved by the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley). parently an error has been made. I understood that the Minister now in charge of the bill ( Mr Dedman) had moved the second reading. However, I remind the House that it is the established practice that when a Minister, who is in charge of a measure, and is representing the Minister who introduced it, speaks, he closes the debate. If other members wished to speak on this occasion, they should have risen before the call was given to the Minister in charge of the hill so that he would have an opportunity to reply to the debate. However, as there apparently has been some misunderstanding, I now call the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr McDonald). It has been said that I had the opportunity to rise before the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman) spoke, but I did not intend to speak. I fose after he had spoken because of something he said.

129,Mr Spender (Warringah) [5.5],"it. was a contribution towards tbe independence and impartiality of the judiciary. Anything that directs itself towards that end is to be supported, particularly since, in these day3, there is sometimes a suspicion that judges are tempted by the hope of other preferment to be not always completely impartial in the discharge of their duties. In the light of that occasional suspicion, which I am not suggesting is well founded but which could be well founded, having regard to what has occurred in other countries, it is important that members of the judiciary he placed beyond any expectation of any Other position and that as compensation they be given adequate pension rights for themselves and their families. So, this bill, in principle, receives the approval of this side of the House. Certain of its aspects, however, require some information from the Minister. The bill does not interfere with the existing pension rights of the Commonwealth judiciary. It proposes to give different pension rights to future appointees to that office and to their widows and children. At the same time, the bill gives an option to present holders of judicial office to elect to take the benefits of this measure. In order that my point may be understood, I direct the attention of honourable members to section 48A of the Judiciary Act. It applies for the purposes of my argument to all other Commonwealth judges. The section provides for the payment of pensions to judges on retirement from the judiciary but them alone. no provision for the payment of pensions to the widows or children of judges. By virtue of this bill, pensions are to be paid to judges on different conditions and are to be less than tliose paid under the existing legislation, but provision is made for the payment of pensions to the widows and children of judges. The first point to which I direct my attention is the option given in clause 13 of the bill, sub-clause 2 of which statesThe provisions of sections six to eleven (inclusive) of this Act shall not apply to or in I put that submission notwithstanding relation to nny Judge who is serving as a Judge at the date of the commencement of this Ur. Spender. Act unless, by notice in writing to the Minister within six months after the com mencement of this Act, he elects to come within the applies tion of tliose provisions. My point can be placed before the Minister fairly simply. It is whether it is good' or not, as a matter of public policy, to provide for the widows and children of judges. I support the provision of pensions for widows, and I applaud the Government's approach to the matter; but I cannot understand why the Government, having, decided that the widows and children of Commonwealth judicial officers ought to be supported, refuses to extend the same principle to the widows and children of the existing holders of the office, or why it should be made dependent upon the election of a judge wliether they should or should not receive these pensions. Under the bill the Government, in effect, says to a present judge, "" You must determine not for yourself only, hut for your widow and children "". In other words, he must make an election within six months and thus decide whether his widow and children shall receive any benefit under this measure. That provision is indefensible. I believe thaf existing rights should not be interfered with. It is true that an anomaly arises as the result of the fact that existing appointees to judicial office will receive a sum of money in their own right by way of pension in excess of that provided for under this hill, hut if it is right that: the widow ought to receive support in the form of pensions provided by the Commonwealth, that support should he prothe pensions are payable to vided regardless of any election by a The legislation makes judge. After all, he would have to make an election, having in mind his own age and expectation of life and his wife's age and expectation of life, and, probably persuaded by other factors also, make what is substantially a mathematical determination in the matter. His determination ought not to affect the right of a widow or children to receive pensions. Therefore, I urge not only that existing rights he preserved, as this hill does preserve them, but also that it ought not to be the subject of election by a judge whether his widow or children receive the pension which the bill otherwise provides. the fact that I can see that an initial anomaly will thereby be created. I apprehend that the matter may need to be dealt with between the time the bill is disposed of in this chamber and in the Senate. My second point arises in respect of clause 15. I know of no provision under existing legislation similar to that clause, f f I am wrong I shall be glad to be -corrected. It readsA pension or allowance under this Act shall --ot, unless the Governor General otherwise decides, be payable to a Judge, or to the widow and children of a Judge, who has been removed under section seventy-two of the Constitution. tt is well to see how wide that clause is. f believe that it ought to he omitted. Section 72 of the Constitution provides that a judge may he removed upon resolution of both Houses of the Parliament on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. At the moment I direct my attention to incapacity. Incapacity may arise from many causes which have no bearing whatever upon the moral standing or conduct of a judge. could arise through deterioration of his mental faculties through no cause of his own to a stage when he is not capable of discharging his judicial duties. It has been a pleasant and signincant feature of our judges that despite their ages they have been able to discharge their duties with distinguished ability in dealing with the difficult problems which have -come before them. However, I direct myself to the principle involved in this matter. If a judge, in fact, was removed on the ground of incapacity, whether or not through his own fault, no pension would be payable to him or to his widow or children unless the Governor General, that is, the Executive or the Minister administering the measure, otherwise decides. Clause6 provides that when a judge attains the age of 60 years and he has heen a judge for ten years, he may retire upon a pension when those two conditions are fulfilled, equal to 27^ pei' cent, of his salary ; and if he continues in office until he reaches the age of 65 years, that is, for a further five years, in that went his pension increases by 2^ per cent, in respect of each additional vear until the maximum is reached. When he reaches the age of 65 years in those circumstances he has qualified for the maximum pension payable under this bill. But reading clause 6 with clause 15, one draws the inference that the latter is intended to act in terrorem against existing judges so as to hold over them a stick -unles s they elect to come under this bill and then, in effect, accept the pension and get out, there is always the possibility that they will be removed on the grouud of proved incapacity; and if that does happen they lose pension rights completely both for themselves and for their widows and children. I do not like clause 15. When a man has qualified for his pension and could retire the day after he reaches the prescribed age, 1 see no reason why, hecause he remains on the Bench and subsequently is by motion retired on the ground of proved incapacity, he should lose one penny of the pension for which he has already qualified. For example, a man does not lose his pension if he has retired and, subsequently, through old age has become incapacitated. Why, therefore, should he lose his It pension if, in fact, he has already qualified and could retire, but from a sense of public duty or a desire to give his experience to the country remains for a further term of ten years on the Bench .and is then met with a resolution to remove him on the .ground of proved incapacity? Furthermore, why should his removal, whether or not it be on the ground of misconduct on his part, and after he has qualified for a pension for himself and for his widow and children, disentitle his widow and children to what the bill provides for them? I should like to know why this particular clause has been inserted. I sbould like to know precisely what actuated the Government to insert this particular provision. It appears to me to he a new type of legislation. Why sliould it apply, in any event, in the case of incapacity to a man who has already qualified for pension under clause 6; and why, finally, in any event, .should it apply to disentitle his widow and children to what otherwise they would he entitled to under the provisions of tlie bill ? I regard those two matters as being of some importance and as marring what otherwise seems to me to bp a good bill. Another point to which I wish to direct attention arises from clause 12 which reads as follows:Where a Judge has, prior to liis appointment, served in any judicial oflice under a Statefa) the period oi his service in that oflice; or (6) the period of ten years, whichever is the less, shall, for the purposes of sections six and seven of this Act, be added to, and be deemed to be part of, his service as a judge. It is well for us to ohserve the great distinction between judicial office under the Commonwealth Constitution and "" any judicial oflice under a State "". A person who is appointed to a judicial oflice under section 72 of the Commonwealth Constitution cannot be discharged from office except in certain circumstances. Normally, he is appointed for life. That is the ruling of the High Court and, in a case which went to the Privy Council, although it did not decide upon that point, the Privy Council seemed to share the view of the High Court. Under the Commonwealth Constitution, persons appointed to discharge judicial functions of importance in the community are appointed for life. That is not so in the States. Under clause 12 a judge who, prior to his appointment, has served in any judicial office under a State, is entitled to count his State service as part of his service as a Commonwealth judge for the purpose of determining his pension rights. Such a judge may have served for a period as a magistrate-a n important office hut one in which the duties performed hear no comparison with those performed hy a justice of the High Court or a judge of the Arbitration Court. A person who serves in such a minor judicial office before his appointment to the High Court or to the Arbitration Court, may, under this clause, have his service in such minor office classed as service in a ""judicial office under a State"" and accordingly taken into account in assessing his pension. Frankly, I cannot understand why service in such a minor office should count. So that my argument may be seen in its true setting, I shall repeat the words of sub-clause 1 of clause 6. The sub-clause reads(1.) Where a Judge who has attained the completion of service as a judge for ten age of 60 years retires after serving as a years. Under the provisions of clause 12. Mr Spender. judge for not less than ten years he shall, on retiring, be entitled to an annual pension at the rate of twenty-seven and one-half per centum of his salary and at the additional rate of two and one-half per centum of his salary for each completed year of service in excess of ten years, but so that the rate of pension shall not exceed forty per centum of his salary. This extraordinary provision of clause 12 requires more consideration than has apparently been given to it by the Government. What is the -reason for its inclusion in the hill? Why was it so worded ? If it is intended to apply only to those who have served under a State in a high judicial office, why does it not specifically say so? As the bill is drafted, "" any judicial office under a State"" will apply to and qualify for the provisions of clauses 6 and 7. man should remember the position of the widows, about whom we have heard so much in this House. honourable gentleman returned to the chamber, I had made some observations on that point which I hope the Government will consider. It does not satisfy me for government spokesmen merely to say that such a provision can be justified because I conceive that under it two things might happen. First, a judge who has qualified for a pension under a State law may be entitled to draw a pension under this provision. The bill does not contain any qualifying provision to prevent such a judge from drawing two pensions in that way. Secondly, since service is one of the conditions under which a judge qualifies for a pension, why should service in any judicial oflice in a State, which may bear no comparison with service as a justice of the High Court or a judge of the Arbitration Court, be taken into consideration ? matter before in a hill. may have done so, but not in a bill of this setting. I have already pointed out that a justice of the High Court or a judge of the Arbitration Court is not entitled to a pension unless two things co-existthe attainment of an age of 60 years and",33,Judges Pensions Bill 1948 Second Reading

133,Mr Spender,"The Governmenthowever, any judge who, prior to his appointment, served in any judicial office under a State-hi s service might merely have heen in the office of a minor magistrate-is entitled to have such service counted as qualifying service for a pension. He is entitled to the same credit for such service as is a justice of the High Court who has served in that higher office for a similar period. Nothing can justify that is drawing a rather long bow. for this Government. Some of the appointments made or suggested by this Government could easily come within the provisions of clause 12. If it is not intended that the clause shall cover service in such minor offices it should be amended to provide that it shall apply only to those who have served in a judicial office under a State of a status equivalent to that of a Supreme Court judge. So that it may be understood that my point is well taken, I remind honourable members that the term "" judicial office"" has, at least on one occasion, been considered by the Privy Council. In the Shell case, the Privy Council held, if I may express the matter in general terms, that a man who has authority to mete out justice as between the subjects of the King discharges a judicial office. That decision shows how widely drawn is the clause. Finally, I draw attention to the proviso even more than I do, the difficulty which to clause 7 which stipulates that if the widow of a judge who dies before retirement remarries her pension shall thereupon cease and determine. If the widow of such a judge remarries, there is no cogent reason why, during the period of her second marriage, she should have the support of her husband, and at the same time draw a widow's pension. But what of her position should she survive her second spouse? It is well known that with the possible exception of the honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), women over the aSe of 70 years have a greater expectation of life than have mere male members of the community of equal age. I cannot understand why such a disqualification should extend beyond the period of the widow's remarriage. Although that is a minor point it should receive consideration by the Government. I trust that the Minister will furnish more information than has so far been furnished concerning the points of criticism which I have sought to make. Minister for Labour and National Service) [5.30] -in replyI am happy that on this occasion I can assure the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) that the matters that he has .raised will be considered hy the Goevrnment before the measure is transmitted to the Senate; but that does not mean, of course, that the Government has no answer to the criticisms he has made. The honourable member protested against the principle contained in clause 12 that a judge who has had, prior to his appointment to a Commonwealth court, judicial service under a State government should have his period of service with the State government taken into consideration in ca^ulatina; his length of service with the Commonwealth. The honourable member mentioned the possibility that many State judicial officers who were not actually regarded as judges by the States, might claim to be covered by clause 12. I realize the force of the criticism made by the honourable member that we may be going too far, and his criticism will be considered. However, as a lawyer, the honourable member no doubt realizes, confronts a government in obtaining applications from really able lawyers for appointment to the bench. It is, of course, particularly important that appointees to various Commonwealth courts, and particularly the High Court and the Arbitration Court, should be of the utmost competence and professional eminence, and, therefore, if we are to attract lawyers with the requisite qualifications we must make proper provision for their social security sidered that any one who accepts appointment as a judse should not expect to receive any further advantage, judicial or otherwise. grees, even amongst judges, and the",36,Judges Pensions Bill 1948 Second Reading

138,Mr Holloway,"There are destatus of the judges of the several courts varies considerably. Weall know the difference in theirdegrees of precedence. When-a government has to fill judicial vacancies, prospective^ appointees always inquire what guarantees of security the Government proposes to give. Many years ago, legislation was passed by the States to provide pensions and reasonable security for State judges. As I understand the complaint of the honourable membpr, he does not so much criticize the Australian Government's intention to do likewise, but he fears that the provision contained in clause 12 of the measure may involve the Commonwealth in a commitment to pay maximum pensions to a larger number of judicial appointees. The next point made by the honourable member related to make an election, and the possibility of their widows and children being deprived of any rights except those which accrue from elections made by the judges. that the honourable member extended his argument to cover the cases of widows and children of judges, and that he considered that the judges should not have any right of election. judges' existing rights ought to be preserved, and that the rights of widows and children to pensions should not he dependent upon election by individual judges. provision is made that judges shall still exercise the right of election is that successive governments have entered into contracts with some of those who are at present occupying judicial positions. Prior to their appointments those judges naturally insisted on receiving certain assurances of their future conditions, and they were given definite assurances. In the light of those assurances members of the present Government consider that they would be guilty of a breach of faith if they altered those conditions without the consent of the judicial officers concerned. TJnder the present measure a judge is offered a free choice between the kinds of pension to which he may contribute. The next point made by the honourable member is that, if a judge remarries after the decease of his first wife, the children of his subsequent marriage should be properly protected. I shall ask the Acting Attorney-General to review that provision in the measure. The honourable member complained of clause 15, which readsA pension or allowance under this Act shall not, unless the Governor General otherwise decides, be payable to a Judge, or to the widow and children of a Judge, who bat been removed under section 72 of the Cou stitution. No new principle is contained in thai provision. The legislation under which pensions are paid to officers of the armed services provides that an officer who is dismissed from the service, or is suspended in certain circumstances, shall not be entitled to payment of any pension, notwithstanding that he may have completed as much as 99 per cent, of the period of service necessary to entitle him to payment of a pension officers not receive a pension? As a matter of fact, before I became a member of the Government I introduced deputations to Ministers protesting against such a provision. However, when we consider the terms of section 72 of the Constitution, which provides that a. judge can only be removed by decision of the Governor General in Council after presentation of an address by both Houses of the Parliament, we realize that he must be guilty of some striking and extraordinary misconduct. vision he imported into this bill?. wisdom of members of the Government it is thought necessary to retain that provision, although every honorable member must realize that it is extremely unlikely that any judge will be guilty of such misconduct as would lead to his removal from office. I do not consider that there is much likelihood of the Government accepting an amendment to clause 15, hut I think that the Acting Attorney-General may give serious consideration to the other two amendments suggested by thp honourable member.",37,Judges Pensions Bill 1948 Second Reading

Clause 12 presupposes that judges of the High Court or of any of the other Commonwealth courts may have served previously in another judicial office. T believe that it is exceedingly bad to hold person who is appointed to a judicial oflice. My experience as a Minister proved to me that there are some judges and people holding magisterial positions very pleasant to those in power in the important judicial positions. In my very agree with the remarks of the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender). Any one with experience of courts of law knows that this is a very dangerous principle to introduce into legislation. There are no party implications in this question. The clause involves an important principle, which the committee should examine. In a State, a judge is appointed to the Supreme Court either as Chief Justice or as a puisne judge. If he be appointed as a puisne judge, the principle, which has sometimes been departed from although it has, until lately, been well accepted by governments and by those who make a study of jurisprudence and legal principles, is that, having been appointed to that position, he should stay there and should not look for further advancement. It may be asked why not. The essence of judicial should be impartial and should have nothing to hope for from any government. If a judicial officer, having been appointed to a junior judicial position, thinks that at some future stage of his career he may, by following a certain course of conduct, be able to obtain advancement, he may act accordingly. We should do our utmost to prevent such a state of affairs from occurring and to put out of the reach of any holder of a judicial office the hope that he may be able to benefit from his decisions. It should not matter one jot or tittle to a judge or a magistrate what happens when a case is decided. In the Commonwealth courts, the judges are appointed for life, and in some of the State courts they are appointed until they are 70 years of age. Their salaries are large, although they are",38,Judges Pensions Bill 1948 Second Reading

Clause 15A pension or allowance under this Act shall not, unless the Governor General otherwise decides, be payable to a Judge, or to the widow and children of a Judge, who has been removed under section seventy-two of the Constitution. 1 do not propose to repeat what I said in my second-reading speech, but notliing said by the Minister( Mr Holloway) in hi9 reply has convinced me that there is any justification for this clause. The honourable gentleman said that the possibility of an address from both Houses of the Parliament praying for the removal of a judge under section 72 of the Constitution is so remote that we may as well dismiss it from our minds, ff that is so, we may as well dismiss this clause from the bill. This provision has never before been applied to judicial appointments, and it could be used as a form of intimidation of judges. present, judges who have qualified for their pensions have rights established by law; but, under this legislation, which seeks to make a vital alteration of the existing position, if they are removed under section 72 of the Constitution their pension rights will disappear overnight. I asked the Minister whether this was something new, and he conceded that it was. saying that a similar provision applies in respect of high military officers, but that is no reason why this provision should be applied to judges. Military officers are subject to ministerial control, and the Executive can direct them as to what they shall, do. TJnder the Constitution, judges are a part of the government of this country. They are not, happily, the subject of direction by the Executive. The Executive, the Parliament, and the judiciary. liament is, in effect, saying to thejudges that, although they may have qualified for their pensions by virtue of many years of service to the country, if , following an address from both Houses of the Parliament, they are removed from their positions on the ground of incapacity, they w ill forfei t their pension rights and, in addition, the rights of their widows or children to BD allowance. I see no justification foT such a provision. I feel so strongly about this matter that I shall, if necessary,, divide the committee upon it . Ministerf or Labour and National Service) [5.49] -It is not proposed to put into this measure anything in relation to an offence that is not in the Constitution. under the Constitution, for a judge to be removed for misbehaviour or incapacity. To that degree, this bill does not propose anything new. It seeks, however, to add that a pension or allowance under this legislation shall not, unless the Governor General otherwise decides, be payable to a judge or to the widow and children of a judge, who has been removed under the provisions of the Constitution. If the lionorable member considers the At point that he has raised is of serious moment I promise him that the Acting Attorney-General (Senator McKenna) shall examine it .

Notwithstanding the good service that that individual had already rendered, he wou\d lose all his pension rights, and his wife and children would suffer. The Government must have some particular instance in mind. It ought to he able to lay before the House the circumstances in which a person who had rendered valuable service to the community might transgress and bo the object of action taken under section 72. The Minister should be able to say, "" In such and such circumstances we would consider that such and such penalties would he justified"". I ask the Minister to give to the House an illustration of the circumstances that would apply. Let him tell the House what he has in mind. If he can do that he may justify the inclusion of the clause. Otherwise, its inclusion is not justified in any way. Minister for Labour and National Service) [5.54] -Al l I desire to say, in addition to what I have already said, is that the Government is simply acting in accordance with the Constitution. Under section 72 of the Constitution, a judge is treated the same as anybody else; if he so misbehaves as to justify punishment he shall be punished. The punishment that already exists for offences will apply also Houses may, by appropriate resolution, to the pensions now heing granted to judges-pension s that they were not entitled to before. I regret taking up the time of the committee, but I am moved to do so hy the unsatisfactory nature of the Minister's reply. The provision in the clause is a new departure as applied to the judicial office and no reason has heen advanced for its inclusion in the bill. Who prepares the legislation placed before this Parliament? Are bills to be brought before us and the Minister in charge of them to be unable to give the reasons behind a particular provision to which we are asked to give our approval? Under any responsible government is not a measure of such importance as the present one, a matter of policy? This limitation on the provision for pensions for judges. Surelv some one on the ministerial level is responsible for it. Whoever is responsible for it must have a reason for it. I am compelled to believe that there is a reason that has not heen disclosed. I shall indicate how the provision contained in the bill could work in respect of existing members of the High Court. Honourable members know the views of the Labour Governinent about some of the present High Court justices. I do not desire to introduce a controversial note into the debate, but the fact is that here is a clause which says, in effect, to the present justices on the High Court Bench, "" Under existing legislation you have a right to receive a certain pension. But you can lose it by government regulation "". Under section 48A of the Judiciary Act judges are entitled to a pension when they have completed fifteen years of service whether they are removed under section 72 of the Constitution or not. The Minister has said that nothing is heing changed by this provision. He has said in effect, "" It is all very simple. After all it is only a clause of four lines and we should not bother to hold up the business of the chamber over four lines. We are doing nothing more than the Constitution provides "". It is true that the Government cannot add to the Constitution, and under section 72 of it both ask that any judge shall be removed from judicial office. But it is not true that clause 15 will not alter the existing rights of the judge. I took the pains to point out that, under the Judiciary Act, whether a judge is removed from office or not, once he has qualified for his pension nothing can be done by any government to deprive him of it. But this bill may deprive judges of their pension rights in certain circumstances. Clause 15 readsA pension or allowance under this Act should not, unless the Governor General otherwise decides, be payable to a Judge, or to the widow and children of a Judge, who has been removed under section seventy-two of the Constitution. Of course, one gets the impression from such verbiage that the Governor General sits down and says, "" Is it right or not",40,Judges Pensions Bill 1948 Second Reading

We know that, as a matter of constitutional practice, the Governor General accepts the advice of the Minister, which means that in practice the Attorney-General of the day makes the decision. I am not speaking of to-day but of any day, perhaps of 50 years hence, because this legislation w ill endure indefinitely until it is amended. member agree that a judge who had committed an offence such as to cause both Houses of Parliament to dismiss him, should still draw the taxpayers' money in thn form of a pension? incapacity be the ground he should draw his pension if he had already qualified for it . That has been so ever since Commonwealth pensions for judges were introduced. Persons entitled to pensions have retained their pension rights irrespective of what happened. The Minister mentioned in his second-reading speech the preservation of the impartiality of the Bench, where fearless men would give their judgments without fear of consequences to themselves. Yet judges are told in effect by the Government, "" If we remove you under section 72 of the Constitution your rights are gone "" . I do not know whether the Governnient intends hy this clause to suggest to the H i g h Court judges that they had better get out now apply only to those appointed in the future ? Mr .SPENDER -No. It would apply to the present judges and to judges appointed in the future. All pension rights of a judge, his wife and children will be dependent on a resolution of both Houses of Parliament. It is symptomatic of the corruption of democracy that we have a Government whose w ill both Houses of the Parliament w ill follow to the letter because it has the necessary numbers in each House. Under section 72 of the Constitution a judge may not he removed solely because of misbehaviour. There must also be the ground of incapacity. I took pains to point out that "" incapacity"" might refer to a number of factors. Sitting Government's reason for including this clause in the bill, I move That the words "", miless the Governor General otherwise decides, be payable to a judge, or to the widow and children of a judge, who has been removed under section seventy-two of the Constitution "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:"" be payable to a judge who has been removed under section seventy-two of the Constitution on the ground of misbehaviour being proved misdemeanour or felony under the law of the Commonwealth or of a State "". The clause w ill then read, as follows:A pension or allowance under this Act shall not be payable to a Judge who has been removed under section seventy-two of the Constitution on the ground of misbehaviour being a proved misdemeanour or felony under the law of the Commonwealth or a State. I submit the amendment because i believe that the clause, in its present form , w ill be, in effect, a weapon which the Government can use in terrorem against judges. The clause w ill permit the Government, at its discretion, to have a judge removed from office on the ground of incapacity. I point out that the word "" in c a p a c it y "" is of very wide content. I cannot see any reason why the Government should refuse to accept the amendment. The Opposition agrees that the Government should have power to remove a judge from office on the ground of misbehaviour being a proved misdemeanour or felony under the laws of the Commonwealth or a State and that penalties should flow from that misbehaviour but my argument is directed to the word "" incapacity "". Under section 72 of the Constitution, a justice of the H i g h Court or a judge of any other Commonwealth court may be removed from office by the Governor General in Councilon an address from both Houses of the Parliament in the same session, praying for such removal on the grounds of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. As I have stated, the word "" incapacity "" is of such wide content that it may be a powerful weapon in the hands of the government of the day.

161,Mr Spender,"In order to elicit theon the ground of his incapacity. After a judge has given excellent service to the Commonwealth for many years, incapacity may arise from causes completely beyond his control. Members of the Opposition are prepared to concede that a pension should not be granted to a judge who' has been proved guilty of a misdemeanour felony under the law of the Commonwealth or a State. We consider that the discretionary power in the clause should be removed. In our opinion, certain objective facts should determine the right or otherwise of a judge to receive a pension. We consider that the reference to the widow and children of a judge should he left out on the principle that an action of a judge should not penalize his widow or children. The clause in its present form may make the widow and children punishable for an act of the judge himself. This clause embodies a principle. I bave endeavoured to ascertain from the Minister for Labour and National Service, who is in charge of the bill, the reason for the inclusion of the clause. So far, the honourable gentleman has not offered, an explanation. I should also like to know who is responsible for the drafting of the clause. If the Minister, or Cabinet as a whole, was responsible, I invite the honorable gentleman to explain the reason for it. Why does the Government propose to penalize a judge irrespective of the degree or causes of incapacity? Why are the widow and children to be made responsible for the degree of incapacity in respect of which a judge is removed from office under section 72 of the Constitution? may rest assured that the clause was drafted after a very -wide consultation. the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) intrigues me greatly. Perhaps the right honourable -gentleman will give, in clear language, the explanation that the Minister for Labour and National Service has been quite incapable of conveying to the committee. I do not criticize the Minister in that respect, hecause I do not believe that he has been told, the reason for moved from office on the ground of misthe insertion of this clause in the bill. But some Minister, on behalf of the Government, should give the reason, and it will need to be an overwhelming reason before I shall be satisfied. The independence of justices of the High Court and judges of otlier Commonwealth courts should at all times be upheld by the government of the day. or a I have made it perfectly clear, in dealing with this subject, that I am not concerned in any way with party politics, and I am certain that those honorahle memhers who have heard my speech will agree that I have approached the matter from a purely objective stand-point. I have dealt only with principles. The clause should certainly be amended, so that it will not he left to a Minister to determine, after a judge has been removed from office, whether he or his widow and children should receive a pension. In any event, the widow and children should be completely absolved from any act of the judge if he is otherwise entitled to a pension. No disqualification should be imposed to deprive a judge or his widow and children of a pension, unless upon the grounds stated in my amendment. The clause, as amended, will go as far as it should go in point of justice, hut beyond that I am totally opposed to the provision. If the Governnient does not accept my amendnient, I shall divide the committee in an endeavour to elicit the principle upon which this clause is based. support the amendment. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) has clarified the position admirably. A judge earns a pension by virtue of the services which he renders in Commonwealth courts for many years. But a judge may suffer an apoplectic seizure, or degeneration of the nerves, so that he is unable to take his place on the Bench, and the Governor General in Council, on an address from both Houses of the Parliament in the same session, may remove him from office on the ground of proved incapacity. In such circumstances, a judge should not be debarred from receiving a pension. I urge the Government to re-examine the clause from that stand-point.

Nobody desires that a judge should he given a pension if he has been corrupt, for instance. If he has prostituted his position in that way, it would be wrong to pay him a pension. Therefore, I agree with that part of the proposed amendment which would eliminate the claims of a judge who so misbehaved. But why should his wife and children be penalized? They would not he guilty of corruption and, by reason of their dependence upon the judge, they should be entitled to a pension. Surely it is not the obligation of this Parliament to pursue the wife and children of an unfortunate judge who may suffer a lapse. His misconduct would not justify such extraordinary action. It would be neither wise nor just. When a man is found guilty of an offence by ordinary criminal process, we do not declare that his wife and children shall be ineligible for superannuation, pensions or other benefits. This subject must be treated realistically. The pensions payable to judges are to be reduced so that provision may be made for their wives and children. Therefore, it seems to me to be a very reasonable proposal that wives and children should be excluded from the provisions of this clause. Leader of the Opposition) [8.12] I for life.

This provision seeks to strike not only at judges who might be found guilty of misbehaviour or be proved to be incapable, but also at their wives and children. I want to dispense with all forensic subtleties in this matter and approach it merely as a layman. It seems to me that a justice of the High Court or a judge of the Supreme Court who is found guilty of a misdemeanour or a felony should be punished, and that this clause should be drafted in such a way as to provide for his punishment.

168,The Chairman ( Mr Clark),"be entitled to reply, but bonorable members are not entitled to attack tbe judiciary in discussing this measure. the reasons underlying the inclusion of this clause in the bill because the Minister will not do so. He is absolutely silent on the subject. What purpose lies behind the clause? Why should the Government declare, at this juncture, ""We propose to take action that will enable us to remove all pension rights of certain justices""? proposes the infliction of penalties which have never previously been provided in law. I am seeking to find the reason for such action. As I have said, I do not approach the subject 'with the forensic subtlety of the lionorable meniber for Warringah and other learned legal gentlemen in this chamber. I am trying to discuss it from the common-sense point of view of the layman in order to find out the true reason for the insertion of the clause. If tliere is no substance in what I have said, the Government could easily accept the amendment. It would preserve the rights of wives and children of justices of the High Court or judges of the Supreme Court, and of those who, upon reaching a certain age, might be declared by honourable members on the government side of rhe chamber to be incapable of carrying out their judicial duties. Let us be blunt. The Government says to the justices of the High Court, "" When you reach an age at which we consider that you can no longer carry out your duties with capacity, you must retire. If you do not retire, we shall penalize you, because we shall pass a resolution in the Parliament to declare that you are incapable of carrying out your duties "". If the they be widowed. This matter came up Qovernment carries out that threat, it will for consideration a couple of years ago. not only penalize the justices but also will pursue their wives and children and deprive them of the rights that their husof the High Court were already fairly bands and fathers have established over a lifetime. honourable member has a had mind. to the Minister that, if the Government takes away from the wives and children of judges the rights that they have hitherto enjoyed, unless it has some reason for that action children of judges have never had pensions. children of judges have uot had pension rights bnt judges have had them. By means of this clause the Government may deprive not only the judges but also their wives and children of the benefits that should flow from the bill. The clause This clause implies intimidation. Therefore, if the Government has no intention of imposing some form of intimidation upon judges, it should readily accept the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Warringah. If it refuses to accept the amendment, the Minister should clearly state why it will not do so. He should also explain why the clause has been drafted so that it will apply in the event of incapacity and enable the Government to take action that has never been taken up to date against a justice of the High Court. I ask the Minister for an explanation because I repeat that I am very much aware of the attacks that have been made upon the judiciary by members on the other side of the chamber. Minister and Treasurer) [8.20] -The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) said that he could not imagine that the Government would reject the amendment. He has a very poor imagination. That is all I have to say about the matter. The story of this provision is simple. I understand that justices of the High Court have considered for many years that provision ought to be made for their wives should A number of honourable members on this side of the committee felt that the justices treated. The Government, however, decided that provision should he made for their widows and children. AnxietyI am afraid that the must be felt by a judge if adequate provision has not been made for his wife and children.

174,Mr Chifley (Macquarie,"Prim eThat is all nonsense. 1 recall the case of a judge, who had not been appointed by this Government, who was forced to retire, due to a physical disability. He was not in the best of circumstances. The Government dealt with that case sympathetically. Previous justices of the High Court have said that there should be some provision for the widows of judges. AlthoughI am not prepared to go into great detail at this stage, I can assure the committee that this hill has heen introduced only after inquiries over a very wide field. Consultations have taken place with eminent legal authorities in regard to its provisions. Althoughi t has been suggested that the bill does not cover all possible contingencies, the Government was not prepared to deal with any one specific case. I point out that the present judges will be able to elect whether they desire to come under the provisions of this bill. There are no grounds for the sinister suggestion that was made by the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Harrison) in this regard. In effect, each existing Commonwealth judge will himself decide whether be wishes to avail himself of the opportunity to provide for his widow, in the event of his death. All persons appointed to the High Court Bench in the future will automatically come under the provisions of this measure. Because of the varying circumstances of the present justices of the High Court, it has been suggested that in some instances they may not wish to take advantage of these provisions, because they do not consider that it would, be to their material advantage to do so. As I have already said, it will uot be compulsory for them to come under this scheme, if they do not wish to do so. bent on me to point out to the committee As honourable members will readily understand, it would be a difiicult matter to obtain opinions on this measure from all those who may be affected. Although High Court justices do not, generally, form deputations to the Government on matters of this kind, there are other ways of ascertaining their mind. their investments? gentleman would be well advised to leave that aspect alone, because it would not stand airing. Due to the different circumstances of the High Court justices, in some instances this measure will prove of no advantage. The At.torney-General (Dr. Evatt), Professor Bailey and others have considered those aspects. It was decided finally that the judge himself would be in the best position to decide whether he should come under the provisions of this measure. In future, of course, Commonwealth judges will be appointed under these conditions. They will thus knowprecisely the terms of their engagement. The honourable member for ""Warringah raised some technical and legal points relating to the measure, based on the equity of law. Whilst an examination of those aspects will be made by the Acting Attorney-General and legal officers associated with the department before the bill is transmitted to the Senate, I poinl out that it is unusual for those for whom provision is made in a measure to be allowed the option of deciding whether they shall accept the advantages offered. One rather senses that the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Harrison) has a very suspicious mind in these matters. The Government is not prepared to accept any amendments, because this matter has been given a great deal of thought and has been examined carefully by eminent legal minds. The Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) has treated the committee to an all-time classic high in his rambling around the mulberry bush. I remind the committee that although we are dealing with clause 15, the Prime Minister dealt with every clause except it. I feel that it is encumexactly how the provision of the clause will work in practice. When the right honourable gentleman said that judges had been more than fairly treated, I assume that he means that judges who have been on the Bench for twenty or 30 years are so treated because they will receive a pension equal to about half their salary. I do not agree that that is fair treatment. I know something of High Court work, and I say without hesitation that the pension to be provided for such justices is not over-generous, having regard to the fact that they have spent, not only the prime, but, indeed, the evening of",45,Judges Pensions Bill 1948 Second Reading

177,Mr Beale (Parramatta) [8.29],"their lives performing the arduous duties of their office. The Prime Minister has merely drawn a red herring across the trail. I point out that all High Court and other judicial appointments under the being so removedI stress again that thf Commonwealth are for life. Paragraph i i of section 72 of the Constitution proand his widow and children wilvides that persons so appointed cannot be removed from office except for proved 1 misbehaviour or incapacity, or by votes of both Houses of the Parliament. The paragraph contains the words '""proved incapacity or misbehaviour"", and it is obvious that any Parliament that was called upon to pass a resolution for the removal of a judge, would have to act as both judge and jury. That is bad enough, but at least Lt is what the Constitution provides. But now there is to be added a new provision which is not in any other legislation. We are being asked to provide that any judge who is so removed is to be deprived of certain rights w hich are conferred upon him by the Constitution and by the Judiciary Act. Therefore, an additional threat is to be hild over the heads of judges. There is now before the chamber an amendment limiting the grounds for removal to proved felonies or misdemeanours. It is unfortunate that we have had to draw attention to this matter because no such case has even occurred in this country, nor is it likely to occur. However, that exception is made in the amendment, therefore, we are left to consider the question of "" incapacity "". The right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) pointed out, that incapacity could take many forms. A judge may be growing old and, although under the Constitution he has been appointed for life, a particular government may not like him or his judgments, and may deem his age to constitute incapacity. It may well happen that, with the trend of political events in this country, some future governmentI do not say this Government-wil l seek to remove a judge from office on grounds which both Houses of the Parliament, in other words the executive of any government which controls both Houses, may consider to be incapacity. I do not like that because I consider that it is in the nature of n threat hanging over the heads of judges. Now, we find that there is to be added tf it a provision never contemplated hy tin Constitution, that in the event of a judge Executive is both judge and jury-In lose all his pension rights. That is something which, I contend, this Parliament should not stomach. The Prime Minister has said that the Government will not accept any amendments, and I realize that the amendment now under consideration will be defeated, but I hope that the people of Australia who are listening to-night, as many memhers of this committee are listening, will come to the conclusion that the Government is taking an unreasonable and dictatorial attitude on this matter. The Prime Minister said that this clause would apply only to judges who elected to participate in the new system. r That is misrepresenting the bill entirely. Under the Judiciary Act as it now stands, a judge is paid a certain salary, and is entitled to a pension of half of his salary when he retires, regardless of the reason for his retirement. It is true that he may elect to come in within certain provisionof this measure; but even if he does not so elect he will still be caught by this clause. That is to say. whether he is one of the present judges now entitled to receive a pension of half his salary with no special allowance for his widow or children, or whether he is a judge appointed under the new scheme envisaged by this bill, be will still be liable, if he is removed because of incapacity, to be deprived of his pension rights. I say, therefore, for the Prime Minister to state that the matter is entirely one for the judges themselves to decide, is wrong. As I have said, they will all be caught by this clause whethei they like it or not. A case could perhaps be made out for depriving a judge of his pension rights should his removal resuli from some illegality such as corruption or fraud on his part, and that contingency is covered by the amendment. The word "" incapacity "" is as long as the chancellor'? foot,' to use a common legal saying. Its meaning is vague and nebulous. It is a matter to be determined by the government of the day which may well hold ideas of which nobody else in the Parliament will approve. The provision is much wider than the one now in existence. It constitutes a threat to judges which may be used to prevent them from heing impartial in the future. I believe that every honourable member should vote for the H mendment. Minister for Labour and National Service) [8.36] -Laymen naturally are usually rather dubious about crossing swords with legal giants, hut sometimes it is unavoidable. Of course, we cannot expect the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Harrison) who is not a lawyer to know very much about technical matters of this kind. He eould only speak of cheating, robbing, and sinister motives. Ihis provision is more generous than the one now in existence. It does not take anything away from members of the judiciary and it offers to them certain additional benefits. We cannot take seriously the feeble, hypocritical references by honourable members opposite to depriving widows ancl children of their livelihood. I do not think that any High Oourt justice to-day has children under sixteen years of age, nor is that contingency likely to arise except in isolated cases. I emphasize that nothing is being taken away from the dependents of High Court justices, because no provision is made for them at present. No provision has ever been made for the dependants of High Court justices, and there will not be any such provision unless this legislation is passed. Therefore let us get back to some of the serious aspects of the measure. The Constitution provides for the payment of pensions to High Court justices and other judges upon retirement, but does not make any reference to the payment of pensions to judges who have been removed from office under section 72. This clause deals with the removal of judges from office for an offence such as bribery, corruption, or murder. by this legislation, but not by the existing law. This measure is more generous from every point of view than the existing legislation. This clause provides that judges who are removed from oflice shall lose their pensions. That is the law to-day. At present, a judge who retires is entitled to a pension, but a judge who is removed from office is not. Now, the Government is proposing to provide something which has not been provided hitherto. I refer to allowances for the dependants of deceased judges. The bill > provides that if , because of some offence a judge is removed from office by a resolution of both Houses of the Parliament,, sitting in the one session, he shall losehis pension, and in addition, the further benefits that this legislation provides shall be lost to his family. Should that happen, no child will lose its pension., because the provision applies only to existing judges. The fears of honourable members opposite that there is something sinister in this legislation, can only apply to present judges. The Acting Leader of the Opposition seems to believe that the Government wishes to rid the High Court of certain justices. He would not suggest that the Government would want to remove any judge whom it appointed in the future. I remind the committee that one judge, not of the High Court, but of the Arbitration Court, was removed from the bench on the grounds of incapacity, at his own request. Legal members of this chamber will know the gentleman to whom I am referring. He felt that he was incapable of carrying out his duties because of a physical disability. He was Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court. I shall not mention his name, but he was a very fine gentleman. This Government treated him more generously than he expected. He did not think that he would get better. He did get better and is carrying on a business. To his credit he has refused to accept the pension. I sbould not have mentioned that but for the fact that the Prime Minister forgot to do so. That was a case of incapacity. This clause providesA pension or allowance under this Act shall not, unless the Governor General otherwise decides, be payable to a Judge, or to the widow and children of a Judge, who have been removpd under sectiou seventy-two of the Constitution. Surely no one suggests that the Government, which, under this legislation, proposes to give to Commonwealth judges an advantage they have not hitherto enjoyed, would treat unfairly a judge forced into",46,Judges Pensions Bill 1948 Second Reading

180,Mr Holloway,"That is coveredretirement by physical incapacity. The legislation proposes to give to the widows and children of judges pensions, which no previous legislation has ever given to them. Judges, because of their position, have to live at a high standard. They spend thousands of pounds on the education of their children. Those facts were given to us as a reason why it would he a good thing to provide pensions for the widows and children of judges. These are days when it is regarded as essential that every one, regardless of station, shall be provided with security. It is not true to suggest that we are taking anything from any one. for the benent of the Acting Leader of the Opposition, the promise given by the Prime Minister that the logical and wise points made by the honourable member for Warringah will be referred to the Acting Attorney-General for examination before the bill passes through the Senate. The Acting Leader of the Opposition was either not present when the promise was made or was too "" dopey"" to understand it. We did not mean the bill to be harmful to our judges, and, should there be anything harmful to them in it, it will be removed. Section 72 of the Constitution does not make any provision for the payment of pensions to judges removed from office. Happily, I cannot remember any judge liaving been removed and probably no judge ever will be removed, but section 72 is in the Constitution and must be observed. We did not put it there and we cannot take it out. I do not think that the taxpayers of Australia should be expected to meet the cost of pensions for judges who render themselves unfit for office and so have to be removed. Nor should the public have to provide for pensions to the dependants of such judges. Our High Court justices are treated fairly, though perhaps not so well as they should be treated. The justices are almost the final arbiters of the meaning of the laws that we pass, and so are among the most highly placed persons in the community. Few cases go beyond tbem to the Privy Council. The amendment cannot be accepted. I am reluctant to take up the time of the Court were appointed under the Judiciary committee, but the Minister representing Act, which, from 1926, gave them certain the Acting Attorney-General( Mr Holloway) is apparently quite uninformed on the real issue. I propose to deal with certain matters that he has referred to in order to demonstrate that what he has said was quite wrong. He said that the clause gave something that was not given before and did not take anything away. That is obviously wrong, hecause clause 5 providesThe Acts specified in the first column of the Schedule nre amended as respectively specified in the second column of thc Schedule and, as so amended, may be cited as respectively specified in the third column of the Schedule. I repeat once more, The schedule provides for the repeal of section 48A of the Judiciary Act. That means that the provisions of the Judiciary Act under which the High Court justices were appointed, and by the sole virtue of which they receive pensions on retirement, are to go. The CHAIEM AN ( Mr Clark) Order! The honourable member must confine himself to the clause. self to the clause. The CHAIEMAN -The honourable member is speaking on the schedule. that the bill proposed to give something and to take nothing away.

When this bill becomes law, High Court justices wil] have no rights to pensions under the Judiciary Act, and their rights will stem from the proposed Judges' Pensions Act. Therefore, it is clear that if that is correct-and the Minister's legal advisers may check this-the whole pension rights of judges, past, present and future, will stem from the new law. I answer the Minister by saying that this bill takes from judges the terms under which they were appointed. Justices of the High",48,Judges Pensions Bill 1948 Second Reading

183,Mr Spender,The Minister said,49,Judges Pensions Bill 1948 Second Reading
184,Mr Spendee,"I am answering the rights in certain events. Those events are now affected by the clause now before the committee, which must be read with clause 13 (4), which providesA Judge who is serving as sucli at the datn of commencement of this Act and who does not malce any election in pursuance of subsection (2.) of this Section shall retain any .right to pensions to which he was entitled, immediately prior to the commencement of this Act, under any provision of an Act specified in the first column of the Schedule, and that provision shall continue to apply to and in relation to that Judge as if the Act so specified had not been amended as provided in this Act. Pensions, or allowances, payahle under this measure include those payable to both appointees, and the clause which the committee is considering provides that, unless the Governor General otherwise decides, judges shall, in the event of incapacity or misbehaviour, be deprived of rights to which, otherwise, they were entitled. The Minister said that, if the Governor General should decide otherwise, the matter would be left to the Government ancl the Government would do the right thing. I am not prepared to trust any government to do what is called the right thing, because ideas as to what is the ""right according to the views of tbe people exercising power. If , in fact, the Government decided to-morrow that any existing judge was, because of age, or some physical or mental infirmity, incapable in its opinion of discharging the duties of his high office, it conld carry a resolution of both Houses of the Parliament and automatically under this provision the judge would be deprived of any claim. Then, whatever pension he might get, if he got any at all, would be granted at the discretion of the Government. That is the whole vice of the clause. This clause, as I have been at pains to point out, applies to all present judges and all future appointees. Et is clearly beyond dispute that the provision will apply in respect of future judges. If the bill is passed, pensions of existing judges will stem from this measure. This clause provides that in certain circumstances, depending upon the decision of the Executive, pensions or allowances under this measure shall not be payable to a judge. ilr. Spender. Secondly, the provision, "" unless the Governor General otherwise decides "", is purely a matter of discretion. It gives no legal right to a judge who will have over his head at all times this provision, which could operate against his fearlessness and independence, and these are of prime significance to the preservation of democracy. Judges will have held over them this provision that a government, which has control of both Houses of the Parliament, can remove them from oflice on the ground of incapacity and say to them, "" If we do that, you will lose all your rights. Could anything be more calculated to destroy the imparexisting judges and future tiality and independence of our high judicial oflieers? As to the widows or children of judges, the Minister said that nothing is being done to affect them. That is obviously wrong, because whether a judge's widow or children will receive any pension at all will depend upon whether a motion of both Houses of the Parliament is passed to remove a judge from office on the ground of incapacity or otherwise. The Government, in its social services legislation, provides that when a man is convicted of a criminal offence and is sentenced thing"" vary largely to gaol, his wife shall nonetheless be eligible for social service benefit. But, in relation to judges the Government is prepared to deprive their wives and children of any pension. We stand steadfast against any proposition that this Government, or any government, to-day, to-morrow or 30 years hence, shall have in its hands a weapon to say to judges, "" Retire or else "". That is the best way I can sum up the matter. When I asked the Government to advance a reason for the inclusion of this clause, which the Minister said was new and novel, iu its application to judges' pensions "" novel"". tially means "" novel "". At all events this provision is new; it has not been applied before in resoect of the pensions of judges. Therefore, I should like to know why the Government has included this provision in the hill. I have invited the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley), since the Minister for Labour and National",49,Judges Pensions Bill 1948 Second Reading
185,Mr Hollo Wav,I did not say it was,50,Judges Pensions Bill 1948 Second Reading
186,Mr Spender,""" New"" substanService would not or was incapable of telling tbe conimittee-no t because he is mentally incapable, but because he has not assimilated the instructions of his legal officers-to give a reason for the inclusion of this provision. I invited the Prime Minister to'give that reason, hut he dealt with every clause of the bill except this one. My whole point is that this clause places in the hand of any government a weapon which it will be able to apply against any judge. ""We are not unaware that certain members of the Labour party hold the view that certain members of the High Court ought not to be there. Here is a political weapon which enables them to say to any judge, "" If you get off the Bench now you will enjoy pensions for yourself and, if you elect, for your widow and children; but if you do not get off the Bench now you may lose all. because under this provision, if we pass a resolution of both Houses of the Parliament to remove you from office, you will be left without any pension at a l l "" . I regard this provision as 72 of the Constitution. My amendment one of the most serious infringements of judicial rights that one could imagine. It is the obligation of every honourable meinber to uphold the judiciary. Regardless of who constitute it, it represents a primary and separate function of government; and it should not be left in the hands of the Parliament to remove any judge with the penalty of loss of his rights on the ground of incapacity. [ have not denied that the Constitution gives to the Parliament power to remove judges upon the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity, but when the Minister says that that ends the matter he is completely misstating the position, because the right to pension still remains to judges under the Constitution whether or not this clause is agreed to; but this provision enables the Government not only to exercise that power under the Constitution but, as the result of doing so, also to deprive the judges of otherwise vested riehts. All existing judges were appointed on the basis that they have the right presently given to them by existing legislation. This clause takes those rights away. The Minister shakes his head to indicate disagreement with that view, but it must be obvious that this provision means that a government which has a majority in both Houses of the Parliament may not only remove the judges, but, as the result of removing them, may deprive them of their rights under existing legislation. the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) that something is not true conveys nothing to either the people or the Parliament. Perhaps, the Minister, who is an expert on everything, will tell us why my statement is not correct. Should he do so, he might direct his attention to these observations: Eirst, if this clause be not passed, all existing pension rights of judges will continue; secondly, if the bill is passed the only right of a judge to pension of any description will stem from this measure; and, thirdly, under this clause, judges can be deprived of pension, or allowance if they are removed on any of the grounds providedin section is designed to make those penalties apply only in the. event of a judge being removed from office on the ground of misdemeanour or felony. I cannot imagine that any other ground could be advanced to justify depriving a judge of his pension. As a judge grows old he may be held to be incapable of continuing in office as the result of causes over which he has no control. If he is removed because of incapacity he should not, and certainly his widow and children should not be penalized and made subject to the charity of this or any other government. Minister for Labour and National Service) [9.1]--This afternoon and earlieT to-night, the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) debated this measure in a very dignified way; but after I had addressed the committee on this clause and suggested that his legal knowledge appeared to be a little astray he descended from that high level of debate and'became excited and was even a little more coarse than was the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Harrison).

203,Mr Falkinder (Franklin [9.20].,"it provides that international law must be observed in the destruction of whales in the southern seas. As a representative of Tasmania, I voice the sentiments of Tasmanians and also, I believe, of the Tasmanian Government, when I deplore the failure to give more attention to re-establishing whaling bases in Tasmania. At one time, as is well known, Tasmania was the most outstanding whaling base in the southern hemisphere, and it was regarded as of considerable importance. However, from the terms of recent pronouncements made by the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) it would appear that the base3 for the industry are to be located in New South ""Wales and Western Australia. I should have thought that it was obvious to any one that Tasmania was best suited geographically as a base for the conduct of whaling operations in the southern seas. One naturally assumes that the Australian whaling industry will expand, and some attention should be paid to Tasmania's claims to resume its former importance in the industry. Those concerned in whaling are apprehensive about the part proposed to be taken by Japan in the industry, and there is a feeling that Australia is ""missing out"" compared with Japan. The hill provides that the minimum lengths of whales that may legally be caught shall be fixed by regulation. Parenthetically, C may observe that such an eminent piscatorial authority as Sir Izaak Walton would probably have been amazed had be been obliged to throw back into the sea a blue whale of 70 feet which he had caught. In conclusion, I again appeal to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) to consider Tasmania's claims as a whaling base. Question resolved in the affirmative.

Falkinder. principal purpose of the bill, which proposes to amend the Social Services Consolidation Act, is to authorize the commencement of a scheme of rehabilitation training for people who are physically handicapped. During and since the war we have had considerable experience of rehabilitation training. I believe that approximately 10,000 people, many of whom suffered from severe disabilities, have passed through the training centres, and the success which has attended their training is a good augury for the future. The Department of Social Services has had considerable experience of certain classes of invalid civilians, of whom approximately 5,000 have received treatment which has benefited them considerably. In the course of his second-reading speech, the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) that 1,000 such persons had been rehabilitated to ordinary civilian life. The passage of the measure now before us should achieve two great purposes. It should conserve man-power and effect economy hy saving the community the expense of paying benefits to those who are unable to function economically; and, secondly, it should improve the lives of the unfortunate persons concerned. The second consideration is, of course, the more important. Undoubtedly a person who suffers a grievous disability, from whatever cause it may arise, feels himself out of touch with his fellows, is deprived of a great deal of ordinary social intercourse, and, in consequence, often becomes depressed and unhappy. Therefore, any measure which will have the effect of restoring such an individual to his proper place in society must command the support of every honourable member. As pointed out by the Minister, the Government is undoubtedly confronted with certain difficulties in implementing such a scheme as that proposed. In the first place, sufficient buildings are not. available for training centres, and we all know how difficult it is to acquire 'buildings even for housing accommodation. tation training. The Government, there-",53,Chairman Mb J Clabk Duthie G WA Kusfell E H D
204,Mr Ryan (Elinders) [9.25],"Th elimited, at first, to invalid pensioners who are trying to provide for reciprocity beare in receipt of, or are eligible for, social service benefits, and to those who are unemployed or are receiving sickness benefits. Later it is proposed to extend the operation of the scheme to cover all persons who are physically incapable and to include the victims of industrial accidents. I think that everyone agrees with that provision. However, another class of persons to whom I believe the scheme should be applied when the time comes, is age pensioners. Quite a number of age pensioners who are unable, possibly because of their age, to continue their ordinary avocations, might usefully be trained to carry out handicrafts which would add considerably in the aggregate to the wealth of the community and would enrich their own lives immeasurably. That is a suggestion which the Government might well consider, not from the stand-point of its application now, but at some later time, when greater numbers of trained personnel and more accommodation are available. The bill clarifies the provisions of the principal act with regard to the twenty the bill, and wish it a speedy passage. years' residence in Australia that is necessary to qualify for an invalid pension. There has apparently been some doubt I support this bill, which seeks to whether the twenty years' residence in this amend the principal act in several imcountry must have been subsequent to the portant respects. I am pleased to note date on which the disability was incurred, that civilian widows with children over or whether it is sufficient to have resided the age of sixteen years will benefit by in Australia for twenty years, irrespective this measure. Cases of hardship suffered of the date when the disability was inby such widows are continually being curred. The position is now made clear. brought to my notice, and I am pleased I have never understood why it is necesthat, by clause 12, the position of this sary to insist upon a qualification of class of persons will he improved. 3 twenty years. I believe that the period should have been more pleased if the could well be shortened. Doubtless many improvement were greater than it is, but honourable members have had cases it is to be hoped that that further imbrought to their notice in which hardship provement will be made in the near has been inflicted upon an individual future. because he has lived in this country for a few years short of the period that is about limbless civilians who were unable necessary to qualify him for an invalid to provide themselves with artificial pension.

Why is it necessary to have this benefit these persons. Is it intended that long residential qualification? It has limbless civilians shall be provided witb been said that it is necessary because we artificial limbs? I understand that an tween Australia and the United Kingdom in regard to pensions. The immigrants who are now coming from Britain to Australia can be counted in tens of thousands, but very few people are leaving Australia to live in Britain. Therefore,, we are not likely to gain anything from an agreement with the United Kingdom in regard to pensions, if and when it is concluded. In the meantime, the people who are coming to Australia from the United Kingdom under present arrangements must live here for twenty years before they become eligible for invalid pensions. If a man settles in this country and becomes an Australian, why should not the fact that he is an Australian citizen entitle him to all of the rights and privileges that are enjoyed by Australian citizens who have lived here for twenty years? Why is a long residential qualification necessary? I suggest that this matter should be reconsidered, because we desire to encourage people to come here in great numbers. We on this side of the House welcome Mrs. BLACKBURN (Bourke) [9.35]. Some time ago I asked certain questions artificial leg may cost £80. Will the full amount be borne by the Government? If not, how much of it will be? Stump socks are now not obtainable by civilians. Is the proposed section 135K intended to cover the provision of stump 3ocks and similar articles? I understand that such firms as T. Eoper and Denyors Proprietary Limited have no stump socks for civilians and that the only place from which these articles can be obtained is the Commonwealth factory, from which all supplies go to ex-servicemen. am informed that the factory is not but it might be possible for it to do so if the provision of these articles were a service and not a sale, and if the persons needing them could apply, under the provisions of this proposed section, for them to be supplied. I have received many letters recently regarding hearing aids. Does the proposed section 135K relate to tbese articles? I should be pleased if the Minister could answer these questions, which are of considerable interest to the persons concerned. The case of Mr S. Keenan, who has been trying to obtain a pension for a number of years, is probably well known to the members of this House who represent New South Wales constituencies. A number of friends, and I believe some of the memhers of this House have investigated his case and promised to assist him in his attempts to obtain a pension. Would his case, the particulars of which the Minister may know, come under proposed new sub-section 2 of section 25, which readsA person who became permanently incapacitated for work or permanently blind while outside Australia (otherwise than during a temporary absence from Australia) but has resided in Australia(a) for a continuous period of not less than twenty years; or (6) for periods aggregating not less than twenty years, whether any euch period was before or after he became permanently incapacitated for work or permanently blind, sball, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to have become permanently incapacitated for work or permanently blind while in Australia. I should like to know whether Mr training; or Keenan would be able to obtain his pension under those provisions? Sirs. Blackburn. Dame ENID LYONS (Darwin) [9.41]. I support the remarks made by the honourable member for Elinders( Mr Eyan), and I congratulate the Government on introducing the measure, which is an attempt to rehabilitate incapacitated people. I also support the suggestion made by the honourable member for Flinders about age pensioners. Probably the saddest people in Australia are those who live in cities, have no near relatives and must live in single rooms with noI where to go to meet their fellows, and have also no occupation. A scheme such permitted to supply civilians, as this applied to such people would be of inestimable benefit not only from a social and psychological standpoint hut also economically. It may return to them the capacity to earn up to the amount that is now allowable under the act and restore to them the knowledge that they are useful members of society. I also support the remarks of the honourable member for Flinders about the desirability of reducing the period of qualification at present applied to arrivals from overseas. I remind the Minister, in this connection, that the Nationality and Citizenship Bill now before the House imposes on even British citizens coming to Australia a qualifying period-of five years before they can become Australian citizens. I suggest that, in all the circumstances obtaining at the present time, that period of five years might very well be made the qualifying period for all the rights of citizenship in Australia including those provided in this measure. approve the measure, but there is one portion of it that I sliould like the Minister to explain, as I consider that its application might cause hardship or injustice to some invalid pensioners. The proposed new section 135N statesI f . in the opinion of the Director-General, a person who is a claimant for a benefit or is a beneficiary should(a) submit himself for medical, psychological or other like examination; (6) receive medical or otlier treatment: (c) undertake a course of training foT the improvement of his physical or mental capacity; (d) undertake a course, of vocational (e) do any work suitable to be done by him,",54,Holloway
205,Mr Sheehan (Cook) [9.43],"Jthe Director-General may refuse to grant a benefit to that person, or may cancel or suspend tliat person's benefit, unless that person complies with the requirements of the Director^ eneral iu respect of any such matter. There are many invalid pensioners who may be suffering from some grave affliction and may not desire to undergo treatment. They may be subnormal people or people who, it might be suggested, should go to some asylum or other institution to receive shock treatment, and who may object to such a proposal. Their refusal to undergo the treatment prescribed by the that they would be refused a continuance of pension rights and I ask the Minister to explain whether that is the intention of the section. Minister for Labour and National Service) [9.44] -in replyI am pleased with the manner in which the House has received the nieasure. I shall reply first to the honourable member for Cook( Mr field in the civil community, and are Sheehan) who has expressed a fear that if the measure is administered too harshly it may do harm to some invalid pensioners who cannot stand up to training or other treatment. There is no compulsion about the particular provision he mentioned. There are some people who belong to the class known as "" leadswingers "", who do not want to try to help themselves and the Director General might threaten to discontinue paying pensions to such people while they were unwilling to try to help themselves although perfectly able to do so. The clause, however, does not have any of the intentions that the honourable member for Cook fears. It is the Government's desire, wherever possible, to train tlie invalid pensioners, or any other civilians for that matter, so that they may become aetive members of the community. The honourable member for Plinders( Mr the honourable member for Bourke( Mrs. Ryan) and the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) desire this provision to be extended as far as possible. That is the Government's desire also, but at the moment we ean go no further than an immediate proposal to apply it to invalid pensioners. That limitation does not mean that we do not intend to provide eventually for all the partially invalided people in the community. I repeat that there is no compulsion on an invalid pensioner to take treatment but that where it is obvious that a pensioner does not wish to try to rehabilitate himself he may be threatened with the loss of his pension. It is intended to select people and invite them to come along and offer themselves for some kind of training. The scheme is based upon the wonderful success that was achieved in Australia and in other parts of the world in rehabilitating ex-serviceDirector-General miglit mean men. One would have thought it impossible for some of the ex-servicemen who underwent training ever to become really useful citizens again. Many of them were limbless and others suffered from nervous disorders. Through treatment and the provision of appliances, those individuals can now earn their own living. It is because of the wonderful success of the scheme for training ex-servicemen that we are now extending it to a similar starting with the invalid pensioners. In addition to the humanitarian motive, there is an economic motive in the scheme. It will enable invalid pensioners to earn their own living, which will build them up both physically and mentally, to win back their manhood, and feel that they are useful members of society. But there is no intention to compel people to take training unless they feel equal to it. They may he nervous wrecks who, when the proper training is made available to them, will be able to resume their rightful place in the community. As the honourable member for Flinders has stated, many people who were formerly ID receipt of invalid pensions are now earning full wages as workers. There are about 360 of such people now undergoing training, and the number would be greater if more facilities were available. Provision of artificial limbs, a subject that Blackburn) mentioned, is being carried out commensurate with the availability of such aids. There is nothing thai would be useful to an invalid pensioner or that would enable him to earn his own living that will not be supplied to him free. The only condition attached to that provision is that when invalid pensioners",56,Holloway
206,Mr Holloway (Melbourne P O R T S,"are capable of engaging in employment and are receiving full wages for it, they will be asked to pay back by some easy method tbe cost of the aids lent to them during the training period.

Mrs. BLACKBUBN -Suppos e the person concerned is not an invalid pensioner but a working man. a person will not bc undergoing training. I have been referring only to those persons whom we shall train. Mrs. BLACKBURN -Will not provision be made for the class which I have mentioned ? scarcity exists, the last person to -whom an artificial limb will be supplied is an amputee who is not able to rehabilitate himself in employment, not because he should not have it, but because it will be used more usefully by a person who requires it to enable him to resume work. That situation exists only because of the limited supply of artificial limbs, and will improve when the Commonwealth repatriation factories have overtaken the demands of ex-servicemen. The factories will probably not be able for a few years to cater for people other than ex-service personnel. I shall now describe briefly to honourable members how the work has progressed. As the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan) has stated, the facilities have not yet heen established on the large national scale which we have envisaged. However, the Department of Social Services has developed its organization in each State. Such institutions as technical colleges and technical schools have been giving instruction, and business colleges in each of the six capital cities have been co-operating with the department to train people. Those business colleges are paid for their services. Instruction is given in 59 subjects. With the concurrence of honourable members.

I have no knowledge of the case of Mr Keenan, but if he is a pensioner, I shall ascertain whether he may receive training. Some honourable members have urged that migrants who settle in Australia should not be required to reside here for twenty years before they become eligible to receive the age pension, and have suggested that the period should be reduced. The reason why the period of 20 years was selected was that no country could afford to become regarded as the dumping ground of people ahout to attain the age of 60 or 65 years. Numbers of elderly people are now settling in Australia with younger members of their families.

215,Mr Francis (Moreton) [9.59],"War Service Homes Act is in a very sound condition. The premium income from the inception of the scheme to the 30th June, 1947, totalled £713,548. availahle figures dealing with the fund are contained in the annual report of the War Service Homes Commission for 1946-47. Claims upon the fund, both paid and outstanding, at the date when the report was prepared, numbered only 126,220. Those payments and administrative charges and contributions from the fund towards the maintenance of fire brigades left a profit of £400,000 in the fund, if an insurance scheme can be said to show a profit in that way. At that time, 45,000 homes had been built under the War Service Homes Act, and the costs of 21,000 of them had been repaid by the purchasers. Homes under construction and those on which contributions were still being paid numbered 30,000. Although 45,000 homes had been built, only a very small percentage of payments had fallen into arrears, a high tribute to the ex-servicemen who occupied the houses. The percentage of arrears owing at the end of 1947-48 was a mere bagatelle. The figures for the respective States were as follows:Per cent. New South Wales Victoria Queensland . . South Australia Western Australia Tasnvania .. .. ...'57 Those figures disclose a commendable state of affairs. They show that ex-servicemen who are purchasing homes under the scheme are faithfully meeting their obligations. The facts that 21,000 homes have heen completely paid off and that the amount of arrears' is remarkably small are the reasons for my enthusiastic support, on behalf of the Opposition, of the proposals contained in the bill. Those proposals mainly relate to amendments of section 38 of the principal act to provide for three additional benefits to ex-servicenien. The first benefit is that ex-servicemen, or the widows of ex-servicemen occupying war service homes in respect of which liability has been completely discharged, may continue to enjoy the 50 per cent, rate of premium made available by the War Service Homes Commission. Mr Francis. The existing act does not extend that benefit, and such occupants are required to insure with private companies. The The latest second benefit is that occupants who are about to complete the purchase of war service homes will be permitted to continue to enjoy the benefit of the special rate of premium. The third benefit is that, if an ex-serviceman occupying a war service home dies, his widow or his trustees may continue to pay the low rate of insurance premium to the War Service Homes Commission until the property has been disposed of in accordance with the law relating to the administration of probate. Those three variations of the terms of section 38 of the principal act commend themselves to the Opposition. They have been requested by individual ex-servicemen and by ex-servicemen's organizations. Therefore, I congratulate the Government upon introducing this measure, which I hope will be granted a speedy passage by the House. Question resolved in the afiirmative. Bill read a second time.

Clause8 (Continuance of certain Irish citizens as British subjects). for Information and Minister for Immigration) [10.6] -When the committee reported progress about ten minutes before midnight last Thursday, we were discussing issues raised hy the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Harrison) and the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale) regarding a mutual recognition of citizenship rights by the Government of Great Britain and the Government of Ireland. When the House met on the following day, the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) made a statement which I think elucidated those very complicated and diflicult matters and indicated that the Australian Government adopted the same attitude as that of the United Kingdom Government. I rise now to say-and I think it should be said that, in spite of the passage of an act by the Irish Government to cut the last link binding Ireland to the British Crown, the position of Irish citizens under British law, even under the act not yet proclaimed, and the position of Irish citiciated with moving from one country to zens under the hill which we are now considering, will not be altered in any way. It is a most extraordinary position. It is entirely paradoxical, but it suggests the possibility that, in years to come, Canada and the United States of America may declare that the citizens, of either country shall not be foreigners in the other country. Perhaps some day the United Kingdom and the United States of America may adopt a similar attitude in regard to their citizenship laws, and perhaps we ourselves and the United States may be able to work out some formula which will give reciprocal rights to citizens of either country when living in the other country. In fact, it may bring forward by a few years the realization of Tennyson's dream of the brotherhood of man. In more prosaic terms, it may help to bring forward the time when the English-speaking nations will have a closer . relationship than exists under their nationality ' laws to-day. I hope that something which will be of benefit particularly to members of the Englishspeakingnations will arise out of this extraordinary development. echo to some degree the sentiments of the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell) on this matter of a mutual extension of rights of nationality by various nations. The position created by Eire is, as the Minister said, anomalous and something has been done by the British Parliament to meet it. Following what was done hy the British Parliament in its legislation, which has yet to become law, we have followed suit under clause 8 of this hill. Any step towards achieving some common link of nationality or citizenship between various nations is a step in the right direction. It will be remembered that Mr Winston Churchill offered the French people common nationality in the dark days of 1940. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that in our time we shall be able to extend that courtesy to other countries. As the Minister for Immigration has said, Canada and the United States of America may be moving in that direction. I am not so insular or national as to think that this is a bad move. Anybody who has travelled abroad knows of the difficulties that are assoanother. Any action which will reduce these difficulties is a step in the right direction. This clause is not only, of necessity, highly technical, because of the paradoxical situation created, but also much more restricted than probably the Minister realizes, judging by his last remarks. There will be great difficulty in applying this measure to Irish' citizens after the External Relations Act is repealed. In the meantime Irish citizens can take the benefit of the provision. The operative words of the clause arewho, immediately prior to the date of commencement of this Act, was also a British subject. . . .",60,Second Reading
217,Mr Calwell (Melbourne,Minister,61,Nationality And Citizenship
218,' Mry Beale (Parramatta) [10.9],"IWhen the Irish Parliament repeals the External Relations Act shortly, Irishmen will cease to be British subjects. That is the difficulty. I have read the statement that was made by the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) on Eriday. As I understand it the position is that while the External Relations Act has remained in force, the British Government has always been prepared to accept the position that Irish citizens here have been, technically, British subjects. The whole purport of the repeal of that act is to change that position. They will not hecome aliens, hecause by a series of publio statements we have pronounced that they shall be in a better position than aliens, although not British subjects. that they will be neither British nor aliens, but somewhere in between. red herrings, I do not know, hut somebody has to unravel this tangle. If it is going to be looked at seriously, an Irish citizen may find himself unable to claim the benefit of this clause after the repeal of the External Relations Act. If that act is repealed, it will be necessary to have some supplementary legislation to amend this position, if it is desired to amend it. I am not so sure what is intended. The British Parliament dealt with it in section 2 of the British act and made no bones about it. That act does not purport, to deal with any more than the odd case. That section does not give an automatic and blanket right to Irish citizens to retain their British subjecthood. Section2 of the British act is in almost the identical terms of this clause of our proposed legislation. I am not raising this as a controversial matter, but because it is of importance to Irish citizens. As matters stand, the rights that we intend to extend to them may not be so extensive as some people thought they would be. As I view it, in some special cases where, owing to Irish legislation or non-operation of the British Nationality Act, which does not come into force until the 1st January, this provision may be applied. It is quite clear to me that the operative words of clause 8 of the bill, which are based on the British act, mean that the Irish citizen, seeking to take advantage of that provision, must also be a British subject. Once Eire repeals the act, that position cannot persist. Confirmation of that view is contained in the following words of Mr Attlee, in his statement to the United Kingdom House of Commons:As a result of these discussions, the United Kingdom Government has been able to give the most careful consideration to the relations between the United Kingdom and Eire when the Republic of Ireland Bill comes into force. The United Kingdom recognizes with regret that Eire will then no longer be a member of the Commonwealth. Therefore Irish citizens have no longer the status of British subjects in any shape or form. The statement continuedAccordingly, the United Kingdom Government will not regard the enactment of this legislation by Eire as placing Eire in the category of a foreign country, or Eire's citizens in the category of foreigners . . . So far as Eire citizens are concerned, the position in the United Kingdom will be governed by the British Nationality Act 1948. come into force. on the 1st January. The relevant section is section 2, which says, in almost identical terms with this clauseAny subject of Eire who, immediately before the commencement of this Act was also a British subject, shall not by reason of anything contained in Section1 of this Act, be deemed to have ceased to be a British subject, if at any time he gives in notice in writing to the Secretary of State. . . As I see it, once the External Belations Act is repealed the wider benefits of this clause will not accrue to Irishmen. for Information and Minister for Immigration) [10.19] I do not think the contention of the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale) is correct. After the repeal of the External Belations Act, Irish citizens will still be able to exercise rights under this clause of the bill. They will be British subjects until the passage of this bill. It is a most extraordinary situation. As I explained last week, when the Irish representatives met the Australian Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt), the Canadian Minister for",61,Nationality And Citizenship

223,Mr Calwell (Melbourne,"MinisterExternal Affairs, and three or four members of the British Cabinet, this matter was ironed out. Despite the repeal of the External Belations Act, reciprocal arrangements will be made. No amendment will have to be made to the British law, which is not yet proclaimed, and no amendment will he needed to the Australian legislation. Irish citizens who go to England will enjoy all of the advantages of British citizenship, while British and Australian citizens who go to Ireland should have all of the benefits of the Irish law. I shall read to the honourable gentleman portions of the speech made by the Prime Minister of Ireland, Mr Costello, to the Dail at Dublin on the 24th of this month, on the second reading of the Bepublic of Ireland Bill. This should be recorded hecause in the future many people of Irish birth or descent in this country will want to know what their position is. The fact that the British Parliament has been able to devise a new definition is a tribute to the British capacity for compromise, which has been one of the most outstanding features of British statesmanship in the last half century. Britain stood too rigidly upright before the war with the American colonies and lost them. The relationship was too taut, and it broke. Although in recent times the ties have not been so noticeable, they have been stronger. Mr Costello saidSo far we have been unable to deal w i th British or Commonwealth subjects by means of Nationality Act. The appropriate provisions are, of course, those contained in section 23, which provides that And t h is is the e x t r a o r d in a r y p r o v is i o n of this exchange of rights and privileges. . . . where a country grants to our citizens certain rights, we may grant to their citizens like rights, in our country. Inasmuch as Irish citizenship was not recognized in Britain the provisions of section 23 were inapplicable and various devices had to be adopted to afford British and Commonwealth subjects the rights which they enjoyed and which we intend to continue. Reciprocity is, of course, the basis of all exchanges of citizenship and trade preference rights. Accordingly we propose as and when the Commonwealth countries grant our citizens recognition and rights to make orders provisionally under section 23 (2) giving their citizens comparable rights. Then follows the portion of the speech to which I wish particularly to direct the attention of the honourable member for ParramattaA t a later stage, but in the near future I hope, it is the Government's intention to review our whole nationality law and to bring before the Dail a comprehensive measure to rectify many of the anomalies that now exist in the Act of 1935. and the representatives of the other Dominions and the United Kingdom have agreed with the Irish Government upon this course. What the Irish Government proposes to do, in the words of Mr Costello, i9 thisI n the new bill provisions w ill be made to ensure that Commonwealth citizens shall be afforded comparable rights to tliose afforded to our citizens in the British Commonwealth. There is one thing I should like to make clear to our friends in Britain and in the Commonwealth generally; it is that after the passage of this bill we will continue, provided they so desire, the exchange of citizenship rights and privileges. Ireland does not now and when the External Relations Act is repealed Ireland does not intend to regard their citizens as foreigners or their countries as foreign countries. Throughout, thc position of the Irish Governinent is, that while Ireland in not a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, it recognizes and confirms the existence of a specially close relationship arising not only from ties of friendship and kinship but from traditional and long established economic, social and trade relations based on common interest with the nations that form the British Commonwealth. This exchange of rights and privileges which it is our firm desire and intention to maintain and strengthen, in our view constitutes a the appropriate provisions of our special relationship whicli negatives the view that other countries could raise valid objections on the grounds that Ireland should be treated as a foreign country by Britain and the Commonwealth countries, for the purpose These are the considerations which we put forward to Britain and the Commonwealth countries. We found that they on their part were equally determined not to regard the passage of this bill as placing Ireland in the category of foreign countries or our citizens in the category of foreigners, bnt were prepared to continue the exchange of citizenship and trade preference rights. Accordingly the factual exchange of rights that has existed hitherto will continue unimpaired. By reason of the fact that we have eliminated from this exchange controversial forms, we may reasonably hope that a greater spirit of goodwill and co-operation w ill actuate this factual relationship. I have nothing more to add to that.",62,Nationality And Citizenship
224,Mr Beale,That might be too late.,63,Nationality And Citizenship
225,Mr Calwell,"Our representativessaw no difficulty about this clause because Irish citizens would be British subjects under our existing nationality legislation. Does he agree that if the Dail repeals the External Eolations Act a state of affairs will be created in which an Irish citizen will cease to he a British subject because of that act? position may be, we have agreed with the United Kingdom and the other dominions to continue a relationship, and the Irish Parliament proposes to pass legislation providing that countries which agree to accord to Irish citizens reciprocal rights of citizenship which will make them British subjects, will, in turn, have their citizens accepted by Ireland and given the full citizenship rights of Irish citizens. Lawyers will never be able to understand why this has happened, but statesmen have devised it to preserve a desirable and desired relationship. Clause agreed to. Clause9 agreed to. Clause 10(1.)

This clause, taken with clause 11, is the crux of this very difficult situation. It provides(1.) Subject to this section, a person born in Australia after the commencement of this Act shall be an Australian citizen by birth. Sub-clause 2 provides that certain persons shall not be Australian citizens in certain circumstances. Those circumstances are governed not by statute law but by a gathering together of common law. The first thing to remember is that, under this provision, Australian citizenship is to be basic and that everything else will flow from it. That is a complete reversal of the previous position. British subjecthood will henceforth derive from Australian citizenship, and Australian citizens will henceforth be worse off. Honourable members may remember that, in my second-reading speech, I illustrated the likely results of the new arrangement, which means a basic Australian citizenship with a nebulous British subjecthood flowing from it. The following quotation from The Round Table sums up the A whole series of consequent anomalies springs to the mind. An Australian coming to London must normally wait twelve months before becoming qualified for any employment, public or private, that may bc restricted to a citizen of the United Kingdom and the colonies, although arrivals from, say, Jamaica 'or the Gold Coast would be automatically qualified at once. If a Maltese woman marries an Englishman she is affected by no change of citizenship, being both Maltese and a citizen of the United Kingdom, without change or formality. Buti f a Canadian womanor an Australian womanmarries an Englishman she has to choose betweentwo citizenships, and if she chooses her husband's she has to affirm her choice by registration.

Thus the paradox of the common status and tlie different terms of acquiring or losing it will remain as paradoxical as ever. The only plea in defence can be that, under the new plan, the common status of British subjecthood w ill have little practical importance. And that is the condemnation of the bill which then emerges in its true light as a measure to weaken the Commonwealth by turning the common status into an empty phrase. That sums up the matter.

Children born in Australia of American fathers and Australian mothers during the war were American subjects under American law, but ' their mothers remained of the 10,000 Australian brides who have gone to the United States of America have never surrendered their British nationality to become Americans. Under American law as distinct from British law they do not automatically lose their citizenship by marriage. We are setting the anomaly that Australian women must lose their Australian citizenship and British nationality right in this measure by adopting the American practice. a woman married to a Dutchman but living in Australia with three children while her husband lives in Java? The three children are Dutch. If she elects to remain an Australian, can she naturalize the children? dren were born in Australia they would be Australian citizens. If they were not born in Australia, the mother could the law passed in 1946 she ceases to be even technically an alien. Under the 1937 act brought in hy the Lyons Government Australian women married to aliens were given all the rights of British citizenship, although technically they remained aliens. Because we had to have a uniform law throughout the British Commonwealth, we decided by our 1946 legislation to make such women British subjects while they remained in Australia. As that act was an Australian law only and there was no comparable law in force in any other British dominion they became aliens again the moment they passed out of the 3-mile sea limit wbich defines our national boundaries.

The purpose of the hill is simply to determine an Australian citizenship in relation to the Empire and, as such, to the rest of the world. In short, whether one be black or white, one may acquire Australian citizenship. A person who is born in Australia, in Norfolk Island or in the Territory of Papua is an Australian citizen, but he acquires no rights on that account. It is true that one section of Australian citizens may have different rights from others under our electoral laws. There is a great deal of misapprehension as to what Australian citizenship really means. The Minister agrees, I am sure, that whether citizenship be acquired by birth, by descent or by acquisition, it confers no particular rights but merely indicates that the person concerned is within the protection of the Australian Government, and by virtue of clause 7 of the bill is automatically a British subject owing allegiance to the Crown. These points should be made clear by the Government. for Information and Minister for Immigration) [10.56] -What the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) has said is, broadly, correct. One acquires tralia or Papua, no matter what citizenship either by birth, hy descent, or their pigmentation or ethnic origin, by acquisition through a process of naturalization. Whether one be born a citizen of Australia or whether he acquires to return to Australia, and that citizenship in Australia, he obtains the advantage of being a British national, and, in addition, the more limited advantage of protection by the Australian Government in matters in which he may need that protection. No attempt has been made to define what rights citizenship confers in respect of matters that are of internal importance, such as the right of the natives of New Guinea, or persons born in New Guinea who are ethnologically of Asiatic origin to travel on the mainland and to engage in certain occupations and do certain other things. We shall look at all these matters at a later be Australian citizens. stage. If we did not define citizenship and include our mandated territory under our present nationality law the same situation would arise as is envisaged now by the honourable member. I do not disagree with his view. At a later stage we may have to define what rights are conferred hy citizenship and whether those rights are conferred hy this legislation on persons living in the mandated territories. All persons born in Australia, whatever may be their ethnological origin, or whatever may be the pigmentation of their skins of Norfolk Island.

Such persons will ha.s the same rights as persons born in Great Britain, and descended from someone who came over with William the Conqueror, enjoy. That was always the policy of the United Kingdom, which maintained the open door in regard to citizenship for residents of the Crown forces, in Great Britain, from all parts of the Empire. The only difference between the present situation and what always prevailed is that Great Britain has been reluctantly forced into the position of making a special citizenship for residents of the United Kingdom and residents of the colonies. The Minister said that we might be forced to define in greater detail the position of citizens of Australia, their rights and duties. That, I believe, is exactly what will happen. At present, we have Australian citizenship without its being exactly defined, and without any clear expression of the rights and duties conferred by Australian citizenship. It may be said that there has always heen Australian citizenship, but only in the sense of a person having domicile in Australia, which conferred certain rights and duties, including tbe right to vote. Now, we have gone much further, and defined Australian citizens as native-born Australians, and such other persons as are specifically mentioned in this legislation. law, the subjects of His Majesty the My real anxiety is that, inevitably and irresistibly, we shall be forced to define the rights and duties of Australian citizens, just as Canada and the United Kingdom will be driven to define the rights and duties of their citizens. The passage of this legislation will make us tend, even against our will, to draw away from the other parts of the Empire. It will prove to be a disintegrating force. At present, a British subject, who has resided in Australia for six months, has the right citizens. If we incorporated the Manto vote. kind of British subject. accept the correction. Sooner or later, that Australian citizenship can be the law will be amended to confer the acquired hy residents of New Guinea only right to vote, not upon British subjects by naturalization, but the people of as such, hut only upon Australian citizens. Otherwise, there would be no meaning in the expression Australian citizenship. Our criminal laws will eventually be amended in order to recognize the new situation. In all these things the test will be Australian citizenship, not British subjecthood. Then, in the very nature of things, the United Kingdom Government will bring down legislation providing that a person may not become a member or enter the civil service, or become a member of the learned professions, unless he is a United Kingdom citizen. No such condition exists to-day. Colonials who can scrape up a steamer fare and travel to Great Britain become eligible to vote or to stand for Parliament almost as soon as the ship arrives at Southampton hecause they are British subjects; but, imperceptibly at first, that will tend to change. Already, Australians are in a worse position under the new legislation than they were before. We cannot stop the present trend, but we ought, at least, to realize where we are going. for Information and Minister for Immigration) [11.8] -In fairness to the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender), I wish to state that my conception of the bill is as I explained it. Some of the Government's advisers believe that, as New Guinea is a mandated territory, residents are not, under international King, a fact which may prevent certain of the native population, and any Europeans horn there, from becoming Australian citizens by birth. However, they can acquire Australian citizenship by naturalization.

265,Mr Calwell,"Persons born inPapua and Norfolk Island will undoubtedly be Australian citizens. In answer to the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale), I point out that there is nothing in the law to prevent a citizen of Australia, who goes to the United Kingdom, from finding employment under the Crown, from voting, or from standing for Parliament. In the same way, persons coming to Australia from Great Britain will, after six months' residence, enjoy the right to vote or to stand for Parliament. We could have made the period two years or five years, but it was believed that it was suflicient committee is whether a certificate furto fix the period at six months as being long enough to determine whether or not a person intended to remain in the country. a law existed; I said that the inevitable tendency would be to pass legislation based on Australian citizenship. member's contention may or may not be right, but I admit that he has put it forward in a reasonable manner. However, I refer him to paragraph 6 of page 2 of the explanatory memorandum which I circulated. that a native of Papua is, under this legislation, an Australian citizen, did he mean that if Papuans came to Australia they would have the right to vote in Australia ? them the right to come to Australia. An Englishman who came to this country and complied with our electoral laws could exercise restricted rights as a British subject, whereas a native of Papua would he an Australian citizen but would not be capable of exercising rights of citizenship. Amendment negatived. Mrs. BLACKBURN (Bourke) [11.11]. -Although the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell) was unable to accept the amendment which I have just moved to this clause, I intend to move a further amendment with the same purpose. Of course, I realize from the refusal of the Minister to accept my previous amendment that he will not entertain the amendment which I am now about to move. I move That, in sub-clause (2.), paragraph (6), after the word "" father "", tlie following words be inserted:-""o r mother"". This would actually increase the disability imposed upon the class of people contemplated by the clause, but I had thought on reading the bill that it intended to advocate equal treatment of men and women. I consider that the clause would be more consistent if my amendment is allowed. Another point on which I should like the Minister to enlighten the nished by the Minister will be conclusive evidence that the place of birth was under occupation by the enemy at the material time. The clause should he worded so as to prevent any ambiguity or misapprehension. for Information and Minister for Immigration) [11.12] The Government's purpose in including sub-clause 2 is to exclude children born of enemy fathers in any part of this country which is in enemy occupation in time of war. After enemy troops have been driven out of an area we do not want the children of mixed marriages and irregular unions to be able to claim the rights of Australian citizenship. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 11 (Citizenship by descent). I do not think that the clause should pass without some observations being made upon it. In the first place, it reveals a departure from the early rule for determining nationality under British law. The method of determination which was customarily adopted in days of old was that of the soil; in other words, the place of birth of a child determined its nationality. The provisions of this clause go some distance towards substituting for the law of the soil the law of the blood a9 the determining factor. However, the clause is not even consistent, because the determination of a child's nationality will not depend wholly upon the law of blood.

I agree substantially with the reasons that have been given for the insertion of this provision in the bill, but it assumes that there are Australian consulates in every part of the world in which a child of an Australian citizen is likely to be born.

Does this provision mean that if there is no Australian consulate in the part of the world in which a child referred to in this clause is born, the child w ill not have the benent of Australian citizenship because its birth could not be registered at an Australian consulate?

The provision is not so clear as it should be, and people who are affected by it have been advised by their attorneys that they will have to seek registration. obliged to seek registration, but they may register, if they like. am speaking on clause 12, and that the issues which I have raised may be covered by clause 25; but I should like the Minister to make a specific declaration about the clauses which will automatically confer Australian citizenship upon siibjects of the United Kingdom and other countries constituting the British Empire. If the honourable gentleman will do so, he will remove the cause of a good deal of disquiet in the minds of the people to whom I have referred. This clause is as good an illustration as we have had so far of what has already been referred to as the way in which some of us will be worse off under this legislation than under the old act. In the United Kingdom, under the previous legislation, and, indeed, under the new Nationality Act, before a British subject coming from the Dominions can acquire British citizenship all that is required is that he shall have remained in the country for twelve months, or be in the Crown service. The provisions of clause 12 of the bill, however, are not so restrictive that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a prospective Australian to comply with them. A British subject who comes to Australia from the United Kingdom or another dominion must jump six hurdles before he can acquire Australian citizenship. First, he must be of full age and capacity. Secondly, he must have resided in this country for five out of the previous eight years, or such less time but not less than twelve months, as the Minister may determine. Thirdly, he must he of good character. Fourthly, he must have an adequate knowledge of the English language or have resided here for 20 years. Fifthly, he must have a knowledge of the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizenship, whatever that means. Sixthly, he must intend to reside in Australia or enter the Crown service in this country. In comparison with the position of a British subject of Australia seeking to acquire British citizenship will not be in England, those requirements are startling. Great Britain is preserving an open door whilst Australia, Canada and certain other dominions are imposing restrictions. The fact that the United Kingdom is preserving an open door is beneficial to Australians. In this instance Australians who go to the United Kingdom will be in a better position than that of British subjects who come to Australia from the United Kingdom or from the other dominions.",74,Nationality And Citizenship

The United Kingdom imposes a period of only one year and, if we accept the Minister's Kingdom should impose a period of five years or introduce a provision allowing flexibility. What is good enough for the United Kingdom in this matter should be good enough for Australia. However, we are making it difficult for British subjects to come here by imposing a number of qualifications which a person who desires to acquire Australian citizenship by registration must fulfil.

What was the average price per bushel received from each country in each year mentioned? honorahle memher's questions are as follows:1. Shipments of wheat, including flour in terms of wheat, were as follows, to the United Kingdom, New Zealand and India during the years lst July, 1940, to 30th June, 1947, and lst July, 1947, to 30th June, 1948:Million bushels. United Kingdom New Zealand India 2. The average prices per bushel (bulk wheat basis, f.o.b., in Australian currency) received from each country in each of the two years mentioned were a. United Kingdom New Zealand IndiaI should point out to the honourable member that the figures which I have given relate to shipments during financial years and include wheat and flour from three crops, namely, the crops harvested at the end of 1945, 1940 and 1947. Export sales during the two year period from the l s t July, 1940, to 30th June, 1948, were made at various prices. The figures I have given are average prices for shipments to the three countries concerned. In the case of New Zealand the average price for 1940-47 is a blend of shipments at 9s. Gd., from the 1945-40 crop, and at 5s. 9d. from the 1940-47 crop. Similarly the average price for 1947-48 in the case of New Zealand is a blend of two prices-5s . 9d. on shipments up to the end of January, 1948, and 0s. 4d. on shipments after February. This increase brought the price of New Zealand into Hne wit h the home-consumption price of Gs. 3d. f.o.r., which is equivalent to Gs. 4d. f.o.b. and Agriculture, upon notice1. What was the total dollar deficit for 1947-48 on Australian trading with North America? 2. What was the trading balance with respect to commodity or merchandise trading? 3.

Accurate estimates of Australia's balance 1946-47. 1947-48. of payments wit h individual countries are difficult to obtain, particularly because of the high proportion of Australia's overseas trade which is financed in sterling through London.

A recent estimate by the United States Department of Commerce showed that United States capital investment in Australia increased by about £6.000,000 in the calendar year 1947. It is believed that the inflow of United States and Canadian capital was of the order of £10,000,000 in both 1946-47 and 1947-48 but that figure is only tentative. However, it must be taken into account when estimating Australia's net dollar deficit. Australia's gold production of about £10,000,000 in 1947-48 was sold to the United Kingdom against payment in sterling. This gold may be regarded as equivalent to dollars and is thus an offset to the deficit for 1947-48 shown in the table. However, Australia's contribution of £3,800,000 million in gold to the International Monetary Fund and International Bank of Reconstruction and Development during 1947-48 must be regarded as increasing her dollar deficit. ber, the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) asked the fallowing questions:1.

IRON AND STEEL. ber, the honourable member for Wakefield cerning the shipment of iron and steel to South Australia. Shipping and Fuel has supplied the following information:In the period from the l s t August, 1948, to control. Twenty-six of these are Commonthe 31st October, 1948, over 30,000 tons of steel was shipped from Newcastle and Port Kembla to South Australia and at the present time there are accumulations of steel products awaiting shipment to South -Australia of 15,000 tons at Newcastle and 3,800 tons at Port Kembla. The necessity of providing additional shipping to transport the increased quantity of coal that has been available for shipment in recent weeks has necessitated a reallocation of available vessels from other trades to that of coal shipment. The vessel fjevenpool, which the honourable member has mentioned, was one vessel whose steel loading was cancelled to enable it to l if t urgently needed coal for Adelaide. The BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited's vessel Iron Knob is now loading a cargo of steel for South Australia and the Australian Shipping Board has made available the vessels Oakby and Swainby to load steel products for Adelaide. These three vessels w i ll clear the whole of the existing accumulations of South Australian steel products. ber, the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Edmonds) asked a question concerning the shipment of water pipes to Townsville, Queensland. The Minister for Shipping and Fuel has supplied the following information:A t the present time there is approximately 1,000 tons of steel products at Newcastle awaiting shipment to North Queensland ports including Townsville and the Australian Shipping Board will allot a vessel this week to commence loading the total quantity available. If the goods required by the Townsville Council are included in the quantity available for shipment while this vessel is loading they w ill be included in the cargo lifted. ber, the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) asked a question concerning the functions of the Australian Shipping Board. The Minister of Post-war Reconstruction for Shipping and Fuel has supplied the following information:The Australian Shipping Board, which is still operating under powers contained in the National Security (Shipping Co-ordination) Regulations, no longer exercises the powers of control contained in the regulations and which were designed to meet the situation which applied during the war years. The board at present has virtually only one function, viz., The Minister for to operate on behalf of the Government the Commonwealth-owned vessels and vessels chartered from overseas. The board at present is the largest single operator of ships in the Commonwealth and has 42 vessels under its wealth-owned ships and the remainder are chartered from overseas. The number of chartered vessels fluctuates, but at the present there are sixteen of these ships. The uses to which various vessels are put vary from time to time in accordance with the most urgent needs around the coast and speaking generally the Commonwealth vessels are not engaged in any fixed trades, but are employed as occasion warrants to cover the needs of any particular area or the shipment of any particular commodity. This method of operating ships is uneconomic and could not be undertaken by private companies. The costs involved nre accepted by the Commonwealth as a contribution towards assisting to maintain essential shipping services around the Australian coast. A t the present juncture the vessels under the board's control are disposed as follows:-Coal/ironston e trade, 14; Tasmanian trade, 8; Eastern States-Darwin service, 1; under charter to Western Australia State Shipping Service, 2; vessels under sub? charter, 3; engaged in the general cargo and miscellaneous trades, 12; under refit, 2 ; total, 42. In addition to the above, two G,000-ton vessels, Barrigun and Balaar, have recently been sold to private shipping companies. Although no control is exercised over Australian shipping, a voluntary system has been in operation since the derequisitioning of the privately owned coastal vessels whereby the disposition of ships comprising the Australian coastal fleet, both governinent and privately owned, is directed by a Joint Traffic Committee on which both the private shipowners and the Australian Shipping Board are represented. The Combined Traffic Committee allocates vessels to various trades in accordance with the cargoes offering, the vessels available and thc most urgent needs existing at the time. Vessels of the privately owned companies are insufficient to cater for all trades and the ships of the Australian Shipping Board are used from time to time to supplement the tonnage of the private companies, particularly in such trades as the Queensland sugar trade, shipment of steel, timber, &c. Thus the Australian Shipping Board, while it has no direct control over shipping, is able to influence the direction of Australian shipping by virtue of the tonnage which it operates and through the machinery of the Combined Traffic Committees.",78,Government Publications

I am informed that the question appears to relate to an ordinary parcel enclosing £6,910 in £10 treasury notes, which was posted at the William-street Post Office, Sydney, and delivered during February, 1948, to an address in Brisbane. Because the identity of the addressee was not known at the address indicated, the parcel was returned to the Chief Parcel Office, Mail Branch, Sydney, for return to the sender. No particulars relative to the name and address of the sender appeared on the parcel and, although extensive inquiries have been undertaken by the department, it has not been possible to establish by whom the parcel was posted. In the circumstances, the contents of the parcel (£6,910) have heen paid into miscellaneous revenue, hut should the sender be able to satisfy the Postmaster-General's Department a9 to bis identity and produce the required evidence of the posting of the parcel, the nioney will be made available. the honourable member for Fremantle vice.

328,Mr Mathew (United Kingdom) Supported,"dignified reply; the United Kingdom delegation had preferred to make no reply. Bothhad hoped that their self-restraint would be rewarded; they had been mistaken. He did not wish his silence to be mistaken for weakness or for inability to answer. The allegations of the USSR. were, however, easy to refute. To see that, it would be sufficient to refer to the information which the United Kingdom scrupulously supplied to the Non-Self-Governing Territories Division of the Secretariat, in accordance with the provisions of Article 73s of the Charter. It Bhowed a constant decrease in the death rate in all the territories administered by the United Kingdom. Far from creating conditions which, as claimed by thc US.S.K. delegation, promoted hunger and death among the indigenous population, thc activity of the United Kingdom-expressed itself in the creation of conditions which compared favourably with those in other under-developed areas of the world. A comparison must be drawn between areas, whether autonomous or not, with the Bame degree of' development, and not, as was insidiously done by the USSR. delegation when it contrasted India w i th the British Isles, between an under-developed area and one which, on the contrary, had reached a very high standard of living. Not only did the United Kingdom delegation formally refute the allegations of the USSR. representative, but it wished to state that it did not recognize the moral right of the USSR. to make such accusations against the United Kingdom. The USSR., claiming to be the only country qualified to speak on behalf of democracy, had erected within its borders a system which made slaves of millions of human beings. Such a phenomenon was unprecedented in all history. Since 1930 the world had felt concern about the existence of forced labour in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. But, at the time, . it had been viewed as a normal phenomenon, the inevitable result of a vast social experiment. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics had, for a long time, been accorded the benefit of a doubt, and even a certain amount of sympathy. However, the waT had taught the world a . terrible lesson. The discovery of concentration camps in Nazi Germany had proved that it was possible for a totalitarian state to conceal its activities from its own population and even from its ofncials, and that once a State resorted to police methods it could no longer stop. An ever-increasing amount of evidence had engendered doubts in the minds of those who were most ardently in favour of the Soviet regime. It showed that the statements which claimed the USSR. to be the workers' S aradise were nothing but shameful fraud. Ir. Mayhew recalled that, as f a r back as 1931, Mr Molotov had announced to the Sixth Congress of the Soviets that great publio works would be undertaken w i th the help uf ""masses deprived of l i be r t y "" ; and whereas the USSR. continued, on the one hand, to executive large-scale projects, it did not, on the other, grant any amnesty or liberate its prisoners. The most conservative estimate reached after a perusal of Soviet publications placed the number of prisoners in the USSR. at 1,830,000; non-Soviet estimates placed that number at several millions. Furthermore, tragic reports of the conditions prevailing in the USSR. detention camps came from prisoners who had escaped from those camps; such testimony was perhaps not to bc accepted without a certain amount of scepticism, but it could not be discarded completely. The anxiety of the free world was aroused; the free peoples of the world wished to have their questions answered. If there was nothing to hide, why did the USSR. surround itself with so much secrecy ? It was patent that the anxiety was justified and that was why the United Kingdom could not allow Soviet propaganda to attack, as it was doing, the liberty and the way of life of democratic peoples.",81,Session Third Committe E Of Theunite D Nations Ioth October
