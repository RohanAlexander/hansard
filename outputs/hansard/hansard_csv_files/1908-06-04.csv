The difficulty of the situation, as suggested by these questions, is appreciated by the Government. siderations :1. Membersof Parliament have a f u l l right to criticise any Department they see fit. To endeavour-beyon d such action as may be regarded as necessary in the public interestto curtail this right, involves serious responsibilities and is antagonistic to the principles of representative government. 2. A Defence Department,, or in fact any Department shielded from criticism, would certainly become atrophied. vigorous criticism that any public Department can be kept up to-date. 3. Ungenerous criticism of minor details, or bringing of Defence matters unnecessarily into the political arena, is by common consent regarded as being calculated to interfere with the legitimate control of the Forces. Still, if the Department acts wisely it need not fear criticism. These are the three main points in regard to which all are in agreement. The Government will endeavour to harmonize these difficulties in the proposed new scheme. MrM c DOUGALL asked the Prime Minister, u f o n notice1. Whether.his attention has been directed to the statements made in the Age to the effect(a) That for some time past negotiations have been in progress in the direction of concentrating the operations of the Standard Oil Trust in this city? (b) That although the details liave not been definitely settled, it is understood that enable such Committees to take evidence on oath, the organization known as the Colonial Oil Company is to be merged with that of the VacuumO i l Company? 2. In view'of the fact that in the United States, the Standard Oil Company entered into far-reaching business combinations to destroy fair competition and to exploit its customers, and for years past practically defied the Government of that country, does he not think that prompt and drastic action should be taken by the Commonwealth Government, to prevent the Standard Oil Trust from pursuing in Australia that policy of trade piracy which has become so hateful to the American people and destructive to American national interests? 3. Does the Minister not think that the best time to deal with the Standard Oil Trust is while Parliament is still master of the situation ?

The Joint Select Committee appointed to inquire and report on matters of privilege, have the honour to submit a Second Progress Report. Your Committee, having recommended that the proposed new procedure should not be retrospective, have taken preliminary steps to inquire into some recent allegations published reflecting on Parliament. Their attention has been directed to a statement published by a Sydney newspaper containing charges of political corruption against unnamed members of Parliament. It would be dishonouring to Parliament if such charges were allowed to remain unproved, unwithdrawn, and the maligners unpunished. Your Committee regret to find that in the existing state of the law, they are unable to prosecute their inquiries in an effective and complete manner. There is no statutory law in force authorizing Select Committees to summon and secure the' attendance of witnesses before them, and above all there is no law requiring, and if , necessary, compelling, witnesses before Select Committees to be sworn and to answer questions relevant to the issues involved. It is true that the Standing Orders provide that Select Committees may summon witnesses, but they do not nor do they provide any punitive measures in case of disobedience to the summons, or refusal to be sworn, or to give evidence. Your Committee do not think it would be wise to proceed further with an investigation in which they would be powerless to deal with witnesseswhomay refuse either to prove or withdraw scandalous charges made by them against Parliament, or to give the names of their informants. If the Parliamentary Witnesses B ill at present before the House of Representatives be passed into law with some slight amendments, Select Committees would be armed with effective authority to take evidence on oath, and to recommend the prosecution of recalcitrant witnesses.

That the report be adopted.",19,Statements In Parliament By Military Officers

61,"Sir John Quick, And Read By The Clerk,",,20,Privilege Select Committee
62,Sir John Quick (Bendigo) [3.12],"Two reports have now been presented to the two Houses by the Select Joint Committee appointed to consider questions of' procedure in cases of privilege, of which the first dealt exclusively with questions of procedure, while that presented to-day dealt with certain recent press allegations reflecting on this Parliament. The Committee consisted of members of both Chambers, representative of all parties, and was quite impartial. with an investigation, in obedience to the first mandate of the Parliament, as to the best procedure for the trial and punishment of persons charged with interference with,, or breach of the powers, privileges or immunities of Parliament. We found it undesirable to submit recommendations for procedure which would be retrospective in operation, and therefore did not recommend the application of new modes of trial or measures of punishment for past offences. Our first report dealt only with procedure to meet future cases. In determining what procedure to recommend, we had first to consider section 49 of the Constitution, which enacts that the powers, privileges, and immunities of the Parliament shall be such as are declared by it , and that, until they are so declared, they shall be those of the British House of Commons. Therefore, we now enjoy, and can exercise all the powers, privileges, and immunities possessed by the House of Commons, and can pass laws defining, prescribing, or increasing them. reasonably necessary. and relevant to the constitutional power. On examining the records and questioning witnesses, we found that breaches of the privileges and immunities of Parliament can be summarized as' (1) libellous statements reflecting on Parliament, (2) slanderous statements reflecting on Parliament, (3) interference with or obstruction of Parliament, (4) undue influence and bribery, and (5). insulting and assaulting members in the discharge of their duty. The British House of Commons has hitherto been the sole judge of what constitutes a breach of. its privileges. a certain act or offence amounts to a breach of privilege, it can so declare it , and a general warrant of commitment issued after such a declaration is not examined by the Courts. do^-to summon offenders to the Bar, to interrogate them there, and, if it thinks fit, lo commit them to prison for the term of the current session. But I believe that for some time the consensus of opinion here has been that this ancient method of punishing breaches of privilege and contempt o? Parliament is cumbersome, ineffective, and undesirable, and the Committee unanimously determined that the time had arrived when Parliament might delegate or assign to the ordinary Courts of law the It commenced its work enforcement of its privileges and immunities. In the past it has often happened that offenders who have been brought to the Bar of the State Parliaments-and I believe that the same thing has occurred in England have practically triumphed, the whole procedure being reduced to a farce, such as I should'be sorry to see re-enacted here. Therefore, I had no hesitation in agreeing to the recommendation that the enforcement of our privileges should be relegated to fhe Courts of law, and, preferably, to the Commonwealth Courts. Either House of Parliament, it is thought, might, when it considered that a breach of its privilege or an act of contempt had been committed, pass a resolution authorizing the Attorney-General to institute the prosecution of the offender before a Justice of the High Court or a Judge of a State'Court. That, in my opinion, would be a more dignified and effective course than that which has been followed in the past. Such a step would be taken only with great deliberation Parliament would not authorize a prosecution unless in very extreme cases, when its decision would be reviewed by a Court. It may be said that Parliament should be sufficiently strong and independent to stand above criticism, and should waive the enforcement of penalties against offenders against its honour,' dignity, or independence. But if either Chamber became indifferent to its honour, or lacked the courage to assert its dignity and independence, it would in time sink very low in the estimation of the community. No doubt the assertion of privilege should be made only occasionally. The power to punish breach of privilege and contempt should be kept in reserve; to be used only when necessary to prevent every If it finds tliat idle slanderer or reckless libeller in the community from impugning the honour of.

I believe that the Congress of the United States of America has, either because of want of power, or because of carelessness, not sufficiently resented attacks and insults on its honour, with the result that now the public opinion of it is very low. Any idle scribbler or irresponsible person seems at liberty to attack it without fear of being brought to book. The time has come when, in the estimation of the great public of the United States of America, it is not much honour to be a member of Congress. as ample as we claim to possess. was challenged by a witness whom we examined. member to a case on the subject. Sir JOHN QUICK If Congress has the power, it has not discreetly asserted it , case of improper interference with members and it has, consequently, fallen very low in public estimation. It is quite common for charges of bribery and corruption to 3>e hurled against members, without Congress raising its voice in protest. I hope that this Parliament will show a determination to maintain its honour, and to be very jealous of charges of that kind, so that those outside will know that there is a strong arm, able and ready to intervene, if necessary, for the protection of either House. I have enumerated a list of what are considered contempts, and breaches of the privileges of Parliament. No doubt there are gradations in that list. offences are not as serious as others, and Parliament, in the exercise of its discretion, person to attempt to bribe a member of may not consider it necessary or desirable to hand over the whole of them to the jurisdiction of the High CourtI n submitting this list for the consideration of tlie House, however, we have merely performed our duty. We have submitted to rioth Houses a. list of offences, the power to deal with which, we think, may fairly ' be delegated tp a Justice of the High Court, upon a resolution of the House affected. There can be no doubt that most -of these offences have hitherto been regarded as breaches of privilege, and contempt of Parliament. Professor Harrison Moore, in his evidence, said clearly and distinctly, that these breach of privilege cases are well summarized, and defined on page 501 of the Annotated Constitution, to which honourable members may refer. Among the list the only offences which may possibly suggest new ground, and may, perhaps, slightly exceed previous privileges, are those refer ring to improper interference with, or obstruction of, honourable members in the exercise of their duties. There can be no doubt as to direct interference with, the .proceedings of Parliament-suc h as the action of a person who attended this Chamber, and interfered with, or obstructed, the proceedings-woul d be a breach of privilege. The only point is whether the slight extension that we propose-the extension to interference with members' outside the Chamber, but within the precincts of the House-ma y not be considered a legitimate development of the privilege against interference with, or obstruction within,. the Chamber. any way to lobbying? Sir JOHN QUICK It would cover .a by importunate lobbying, or taking improper action within the precincts of the House. Lobbying, or unduly interfering with members, with a view of persuading them to vote in a certain direction might come under the heading of "" undue interference with members in the performance of their duties."" There might be a certain measure of undue interference with honourable members, not . amounting to bribery, yet decidedly improper. This is a fair and legitimate assertion of immunity on the part of honourable members-a n assertion that they should be protected against undue inSome fluence in the exercise of their duty. Certainly, it is a common law offence for any Parliament. No declaration is necessary to deal with matters of that kind, for they are offences against Parliament. The offences we have enumerated are offences against Parliament, but are not intended in any way to cover offences committed against members in their private capacity. Offences against members in the discharge of their duty as members of Parliament, within the Chamber, or within the precincts of Parliament House, are alone dealt with. So far as offences against members .outside Parliament House are concerned the ordinary law will apply. mittee propose to obtain evidence against persons trying to bribe members of Parliament?",21,Privilege Select Committee

I wish to summarize this branch of the report by saying that we desire, in the first place, to reas others, and it will be for the House tocommend the transfer from parliamentary control of the breaches of privileges enumerated in paragraph 1. The safeguards against abuse of that power, and against frivolous prosecutions, is, first of all, the requirement that the sanction of the House affected shall be obtained to the initiation of a prosecution; and, secondly, that such prosecutions will be under the charge of the Commonwealth Attorney-General. It has been urged that this power might be exercised for the benefit of a majority in Parliament, and that a minority might be defenceless. Such a suggestion is unworthy of a moment's consideration. The recent appointment of a Joint Committee, and the reference to it of certain allegations for inwas to some extent justifiable. But now vestigation, was at the instance of this side of the House, which, as is well known, is in a minority. investigation, and that justice should be done. started because the charge was a general one. cause the allegation referred to a group of members-probabl y a minority-and in such a way as to reflect on the House in its corporate capacity.

Some do not demand such immediate action determine what cases should be handed over to the High Court. The Committee submits this branch of its work to the judgment of the House, having done its best inframing what it considers is a fair summary of the most serious charges. With the exception of the slightly enlarged definition of improper influence and obstruction, they are old offences known to the law, and could previously have' been punished by either House without reference to a Court.

If we do, the timewill undoubtedly come when the House will feel called upon to intervene and to assert its honour and dignity ; whereas if we bring offenders to the bar, we shall be met with the old complaint, "" Here you are acting as your own prosecutor and judge and, in the Where case of conviction, as your own gaoler."" Whichever course we adopt, we shall be subject to criticism and opposition. I , and' my fellow committeemen are unanimous, however, in recommending that Parliament This power is should take these matters into its own hands and do what it thinks right. If it does, it will agree to transfer to Courts of Law the work of dealing with these offences. There are other matters in the recommendations towhicb I need not refer. I come now to the second reference to the Committee, the reference to inquire into recent allegations reflecting upon Parliament.

Before launching upon an inquiry of that kind it is desirable that we should have the power of examining the offenders, and if they refuse to answer questions relevant to the issue we ought to be in a position to report the matter either to Parliament or to the Attorney-General. A law ought to be passed which would enable these witnesses to be summoned before the ordinary tribunals and either fined or imprisoned for refusing to give evidence. only way in whch the authority of a Select Committee or a Royal Commission can be exercised. be applicable to witnesses before Royal Commissions who refuse to answer questions. sions already possess the power to compel witnesses to answer questions.

I promise that during the recess 1 will look into the whole matter, and that next session a Bill will be introduced to give effect to the recommendations of the Committee. If I can see my way ; to submit a fuller and more complete mea-"" sure I will do so. I trust that at this stage we shall not have a long debate upon the motion for the adoption of the report, because we shall be afforded an opportunity to consider the matter fully next session. the recommendation of the Attorney-General, that we should adopt the report without much discussion, is a good one. Certainly it is not open to the objection which might reasonably be urged against measures -suc h as the Bill which was introduced yesterday-involvin g an expenditure of millions of pounds, and which are passed-with extraordinary celerity. The Bill is merely an expression of opinion, or a direction to the Attorney-General as to the lines on which the legislation to protect us are, 1 suppose, to run. I confess I do not share the hyper-sensitiveness of some honourable members as to the effect of lobbying, or of imputations cast on us. If a man is pure and honest, as I suppose the whole of us are, he can stand a good deal of that kind of treatment without his standing in the estimation of the electors, 'who think they know him, being to any extent lowered. The public generally have to stand a' good deal of knocking about in these days of a free press. Some public men, I dare say, have the estimate of themselves changed by, perhaps, the not particularly delicate pens of some anonymous writers for the press. man's dignity to ignore such references, than to be always squealing, just because a few critical bolts seem to hit him pretty hard. Then, there are the reciprocal rights of the public to speak their minds, even though they may not always express their opinions in the words of politeness. Sir JOHN QUICK man's political reputation cart be killed ing to the ordinary methods of legal inpolitely. but I am merely warning honourable members against the danger of going too far in legislation of the kind. I personally recognise the rights of the public to lobby. How can the public bring even their delusions here and have them cleared up, except they may come within the precincts of the House. How could the Opposition, for instance, gather information, unless from what is reported to them within the precincts of the House, if occasion require? We ought not to be too sensitive. The web of our l i fe is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together; our virtues would be proud if our faults whipped them not, and our crimes would despair if they were not cherished by our virtues. I am merely throwing out a hint to the Attorney-General that he must not, under powers given to Parliament by the Constitution-and , perhaps, not altogether intended-excee d even the privileges of the House of Commons, and introduce a Bill, full of penalties against those who may attempt, by rather too strong moral suasion, to affect the independent judgment of members of Parliament. Assuming that we do not go beyond what is reasonable and necessary for our protection, there can be no harm, as far as I can see, in the legislation suggested. But what I have just indicated is the measure of our rights, and, while the House of Commons may be as omnipotent as the Imperial Parliament chooses to make it, .we here are to some extent limited as to Acts oi Parliament we can pass. We have no authority to create privileges, or to define privileges, in a way that is not reasonably necessary for the effective discharge of our duties as representatives-that is the limit to our.powers. I hope that limit will be respected; and that we shall keep within the bounds of reason, and certainly not exceed the privileges' of the House of Commons. What we are endeavouring to do is to hand over the power of inquiry and punishment to a Court of But it is more consistent with the justice, rather than to determine such matters for ourselves.

It is now suggested, however, that that tribunal should be brought down to the level of a Court of summaryjurisdiction; and simply because we desire to "" get over "" the provision of the Constitution which makes an indictable offence tryable only by a Judge and jury. If these offences were described as indictable, they would have to be tried by a Judge and jury, and to avoid that, we declare these offences to be matters of summary jurisdiction, and propose .to invest the High Court with the power of trying them. I do not know that the High Court will altogether relish being invested with this jurisdiction, in view of the loose description of offences, and if the somewhat elastic provisions of the B i ll be in line with'the recommendations of the report. It will be seen that libel, according to the report, involves a very great extension when compared with ordinary libel, as between subject and subject-that it relates not to mere matters of insult, but to defamatory statements which bring honourable members into ridicule, to obstruction, and so forth. of contempt of Parliament. remember, however, that the law of privilege arose 200 or 300 years ago, when Parliament required a good deal of protection against the Monarch, and, sometimes, against the Monarch's soldiers; and when liberty of speech was not recognised then as now, the press being under a ban. It was then that some of the greatest ornaments of eloquence were delivered in favour of the liberty of the press. But the protection which was necessary in those times for members of Parliament may not be necessary under the enlightened conditions of the twentieth century. terested in the independence of members of Parliament and their necessary protection ? f a c t ; but that is not involved in the point I am now advancing. I am now pleading against excess. case of an attempt to bribe an honourable member, or to libel him, I should not object to our privileges being used as a check, but do not let us go too far-d o not let us define the privileges of members of Parliament by the terms of the necessities of 250 or 300 years ago. in favour of the liberty of the press 1 should take very much the same view; 1 merely throw out the hint that we should not be too extreme. I do not happen to be so sensitive as to object to the occasional moral suasion which some honourable members seem to reprehend. able member has not smarted so much as others. perience. Within the last week I have had two presents sent to my house by a foreigner who, I suppose, thought that they would to some extent affect the importunities I was supposed to bring to bear on the Prime Minister in order to have consideration of a reasonable request made by letter sent through me as a representative. But I did not come to Parliament howling about the matter; I merely ceased all interference with the case, sending the information that if the presents were not removed from my premises within a certain time, something else might occur. When the honourable member for Bendigo was speaking, he said something to the effect that the power of Congress is more limited, or at all events had been frustrated in some way by the We must Courts of America. I have kindly been supplied by the Attorney-General with vol. 19 United States Law Reports, in which there is a report of the case of Anderson v.

For this Sir Francis Burdett was arrested, and thereupon he sued for assault in the Courts of Justice. Arguments having been heard for Sir Francis Burdett, Lord Erskine did not call on the representatives of Parliament to reply, considering the matter so clear. He saidTlie House of Commons, whether a Court or not, must, like every other tribunal, have the power to protect itself from obstruction ancl insult, and to maintain its dignity and character. If the dignity of the law is not sustained, its sun is set, never to be lighted up again. So much I thought it necessary to say, feeling strongly for the dignity of the law; and have only to add, that If u l ly concur in the opinion delivered by the Judges. That opinion was that"" the House of Commons had power to punish for insult or libel, and that the House. could also delegate that power. States case the Court also decided that the power fo punish for libel was necessary in the case of each House, and Judge Johnson, who delivered the opinion, saidThis result is fraught with too much absurdity, not to bring into doubt' the soundness of any argument from which it is derived. deliberate assembly, clothed with the majesty of the people, and charged with the care of all that is dear to them; composed of the most distinguished citizens, selected and drawn together from every quarter of a'great nation; whose deliberations are required, by public opinion, to be conducted under the eye of the public, and whose decisions must be clothecf with all that sanctitv which unlimited confidence in their wisdom and puritv can inspire; that such an as -, sembly should not possess the power to suppress rudeness, or repel insult, is a supposition too wild to. be suggested. Ancl accordingly, to avoid the pressure of these considerations, it has been argued, that the right of the respective houses to exclude from their presence, and their absolute control within their own walls, carry with them the right to punish contempts committed in their presence; while the absolute legislative power given to Congress within thi.s district, enables them to provide by law against all other insults against which there is any necessity for providing. Well, I think it is also .""too wild"" to suggest that the decision as to the extent of the privilege, by whatever tribunal enforced, has been, subsequently upset by another of the United States Courts. But the honourable member may be right as to the enf 01 cement of a later case. My desire is, not to 'discount the recommendations of the Committee, but to ask that, whatever declaration Mr Glynn. of privilege we may make, shall be determined by the necessities of the present time, and not in accordance with views held 200 or 300 years ago. The Committee has done good work, and I think that its recommendations might be adopted without much discussion. orable member for Angas has rightly complimented the Committee upon the expedition which it has shown, and the work' .which it has done. I wish to revive the recollection of the events which brought about its appointment. In the first instance, a question was asked by the honourable member for .Hunter, as to certain general charges of corruption in regard to the Tariff, published in the Sydney Bulletin. A few weeks later, I drew the attention of the Prime Minister to the fact tliat no action had been taken in the matter. After he had been questioned on the subject on several further occasions, he promised to go intoIn the United' the matter, and, at last, moved for the appointment of this Select Committee. I opposed the appointment of the Committee, which was directed, not only to recommend 'procedure for the future, but to say how the charges which had been made should be dealt with. In the meantime, the That a charges published in the Bulletin had beenemphasized by the Age, and levelled particularly at the-free-trade members of the Opposition. I asked the Prime Minister why he should not investigate matters for himself, and, if necessary, introduce a Procedure Bill. The witnesses who gave evidence before the Select Committee could have communicated their information to tbe officials in the Prime Minister's Department, and the Attorney-General could have been instructed to draft any Bill that might .be necessary. I contended that the Committee's investigations would be ineffective, because witnesses, if summoned, would refuse to attend. To my mind, members of Parliament must not be too squeamish. They cannot affect the graces of a drawingroom miss of seventeen, .who pretends to be offended at the slightest provocation. The more hostile criticism a public man; gets, the better it is for him, so long as he gets enough. There is. no better suit of clothes in which to go to an election, thai* the abuse of the press.

Under the new Tariff, certain duties were imposed upon harvesters, and the passing of that Act meant the repeal ot the Act under which restrictions were imposed on the prices that might be charged for harvesters during certain years.

Minister) [4.45] I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This measure, as its title indicates, has been introduced for the purpose of dealing principally with Public Service Inspectors. In the administration of the Public Service Acti t has been found rather irksome to have the Commissioner and his Inspectors restricted in the way that they are at present, and with a view to providing them with opportunities for promotion, it has been thought advisable to place this B ill before the House. Honourable members will recollect that the Public Service Commissioner was appointed for a term of seven years at a fixed salary, and that consequently he is precluded from being appointed to any other position. Of course, I do not suggest that it is proposed to appoint him to any other office. But let us assume that the Royal Commission which is to be appointed to inquire into the condition of the Post Office recommends that that Department shall be placed under the control of Commissioners, and that a strong man is required as its head, at an even higher salary than that which the Public Service Commissioner receives, surelv it would be an injustice to debar him from obtaining that office. barred ? appointed for a fixed term, and at a fixed salary, and in a fixed position. prevent him resigning his office andapplying for another position. true. But as-this Bill had to be introduced to provide for the Public Service Inspectors, the Government thought that provision might well be made iirn it which I think that is would permit of the promotion, if necessary, of the Public Service Commissioner. Such a provision might obviate the disorganization of the whole Public Service. Let us assume for a moment' that a better position than that of Public Service Commissioner was offering, and that the Commisagreed sioner thought he was entitled' to it . In order to obtain it he would have to resign his office, and the result of this might be to throw the whole service, into disorder. appointment might be simultaneous. position in the Public Service of equal value ? that a better position is created in the Seivice which the Commissioner desired to fill. It might be desirable to appoint him. him ? the Government would do so. In order to obtain that position he would Have t'o resign his present office. There would then be no Public Service Commissioner, and no officer to take his place. Under such circumstances it will be recognised that an Act of Parliament is necessary. With a view to providing in advance for difficulties of that, kind, the Government seized the present opportunity of dealing, not only with the Public Service Inspectors, but with the Public Service Commissioner. In regard to the Inspectors, I think it will be recognised that it is desirable that they should be permitted to occupy, at any rate, temporarilv, some other office. Both under the Public Service Act and regulations they can occupy only tbe office of inspector They are special officers who are appointed for a special term at a special salary.",31,Excise Tarif F Starch Bill Second Reading

160,Mr Josep H Cook,"I admit that,12058 hesitation in saying that I regard that as. a cruel and unnecessary restriction. Moreover, I think there is an underlying implication which is quite unworthy of the framers of the B ill . an Inspector to do his duty in His own State, we cannot trust him to do his duty in any other State; and I do not think that the fact that he has to report on superior officers in his own State should debar him from ' any promotion which otherwise would be legitimately open. But this Bill provides that, if an Inspector Postmaster-General, higher office, hecan only do so by breaking up all his old associations, and transferring himself to some, perhaps, distant part of the Commonwealth. That, in itself, is an effectual bar to promotion, because no man, for the sake of, say, an increase of Â£ 1 0 0 a vear, would break up his home and associations. Surely we may trust our Inspectors who have lived all their official life under the eye of the Commissioner, and have done their work so faithf u l ly and well as to earn the approval of the Minister. I am entirely in accord with that' provision. which opens the whole service to the Public Service Inspectors; but I sincerely hope that the clause, which calls upon an Inspector to move from his own State before receiving promotion, will be expunged. aJmendment which will"" perhaps meet the case. spector is immediately under the man who has to promote him. are there to be of assistanceto the Public -Service Commissioner nence given to an Inspector's work which is not given to the work of other officials. prominence is"" inseparable from the nature of the work an Inspector has to perform, and it should not prove a disability in the way of promotion.

There is no reason to entertain the implied reflection, first, of want of capacity on the part of the Public Service Commissioner, and,next, of want of inPublic .Service [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bill. tegrity and faithfulness on the part of the Public Service Inspectors. In my opinion, it would be a slur to. tie the Inspectors down in the way proposed; the whole service If , we cannot trust ought to be left open, and the Public Service Commissioner trusted to do justice to,his assistants. With the reservation I have indicated, I support the Bill most cordially as one which ought to have been' passed long ago. If there had been such a measure in operation sooner, it would have been a modicum of encouragement to a man who has left us altogether, after desires to be, say, a Deputy good and f a it h f u l service, but who was deor fill any other barred just promotion by. reason of the provision in the original Act. If this B ill had been introduced for the purpose of allowing the Public Service Commissioner to have a well-earned holi: day, I should have been entirely in favour' of it. In my opinion, however, the Public Service -Inspectors are in much the same 'position as Judges, and, therefore, ought not to have the control of their own promotion. judges when they finally determine nothing without reference to the Public Service Commissioner ? is absolutely impossible for the Public Service Commissioner to make himself acquainted with the whole ramifications of the service; and, therefore, he has to act on the recommendations of his Inspectors No doubt, in many cases of importance, or where he has any doubt, the Public Service Commissioner makes inquiries; but it would take years for him to make himself acquainted, with all the details of the Public Service in the six States. As I said before, these Inspectors are the judges; and, therefore, there is a doubt as to whether the Bill is desirable. I quite agree with the honourable member for Parramatta that,if Public ServiceInspectors are to be eligible for other positions in other States, they ought to be eligible in their owri State; but, as the B ill itself indicates, I think there is a danger in this connection, because there might be an inducement for the Inspectors to provide billets for each other. As a matter of fact, I think that I do not quite the whole system of Public Service inspection is wasteful and costly.

In my opinion, it is absurd that the Public Service Inspectors should receive less salary than -do heads of Departments whom they are supposed in a way to supervise. If the -salary be made commensurate with the responsibility, an Inspector will not be anxious to change his status; and I think it is most dangerous to allow men who are placed in a positon; as it were, of Judges to be at liberty to chop and change. This Bill is to make it worth their while to remain Inspectors. If those who are in that office are doing their work well, the country cannot afford to lose their services at the end of a. few years. But what could member suggest that an Inspector should receive more than a Deputy Postmaster General?

The Inspectors are answerable for the proper administration of all the Departments, and they should be given salaries worthy of their offices, so 'that they will have no temptation to engineer themselves into other positions. As the honourable member for Hindmarsh has said, either it is a good thing that Inspectors should 'be eligible for promotion or it is not j the paddocking-off provided for in the B ill , the arrangement whereby the New South Wales Inspector cannot be promoted in New South Wales, but may be promoted in some other State, is unreasonable. .

That might occur under this Bill. When the opportunity offers I shall endeavour to bring about a different system. Many years ago in Victoria an Attorney-General retired from office to take the position of a Justice of the Supreme Court. He was a politician, and appointed himself to the Bench: Manv cases of favouritism might be cited. When we are closely associated with a man, and recbgnise that he is capable of filling a certain position, we are prone to give him a preference over others of whom we know nothing, but who may really possess better qualifications. able member debar a Postal Inspector from obtaining preferment in his own State? taining preferment in any other State. . The office of Commissioner should be the only promotion open to a Public Service Inspector, and the Inspectors should be fitting 'themselves by experience to fill that position. 1 able member apply the same reasoning to services within a State? Would he say, for instance, that Postal Inspectors in one State should be called upon to go to another State to secure preference ? tween Postal Inspectors and Public Service Inspectors is that the former have some one 'in authority over them, whilst Service Inspectors. dent statutory positions. drawn between the position of a Public Service Commissioner's Inspector, and that .of any other officer in the Service, I have no desire that officers in the Public Service Commissioner's office should be placed at a disadvantage, but at the same time. I fail to see why they should enjoy an-advantage over men in other branches of the Service. Some time ago a messenger was required for one of the Ministerial Departments at a salary of Â£ 2 5s. or Â£ 2 ios. per week, and hundreds of officers in the Service applied for the position. Some of the applicants had served twenty-two years in the i Post, and Telegraph Department, but at young man whose position had brought him immediately under the eye of the Commissioner was appointed. I do not wish to suggest that he was not a thoroughly capable officer, but at the same time he was junior to many other applicants. member expect that it would be possible in any service to stop that kind of thing? The illustration given by him shows that,, despite all we may do, there is an element of human nature everywhere. what we can to minimize it. young man in question was junior to some of the other applicants is no evidence that he was not the ablest. prove that he was the most eligible person for the position Does not the honourable' member see the point which I am endeavouring to make ? I do not doubt the honesty of 'purpose of the Public Service Commissioner, who has certainly worked so hard that he richly deserves a holiday. But I contend that many things are done by his Department which do not reflect that degree of intelligence that we have a right to expect. Only to-day the fact was brought under my notice that a number of telegraph line repairers-me n who have been accustomed to -hard mechanical work ever since they were nine years of agehave been asked to pass an educational examination. That.fact does not redound to the credit of the Department. It is not customary to compel manual labourers to undergo an educational examination. Whilst : it is .true that in the old days, when political patronage was rampant, there was unrest in the Public Service of the States, I maintain that there is more unrest in the Commonwealth Public Service to-day. I know that officers who have consistently applied themselves to the faithful discbarge of their duties in the hope of securing advancement, find .all their efforts unrewarded because they.do not happen to come.under the eye of the Commissioner. A radical change in the whole system of administration is needed. I contend that if this Billbe passed the. existing condition of affairs will be made worse. Personally, I would prefer to see a measure introduced which would rank the Public Service Inspectors next to the'Commissioner, and which would give them salaries commensurate with the work which they perform.

Under such circumstances, can we wonder only way in which we can overcome that discontent, is by making the Department An intelligible plan which controls promotions as able as we possibly can.

338,Mr Glynn (Angas) [8.14],"I do nota Bill introduced in another place' by Senator Neild three or four years ago, that Bill in turn being suggested, i believe, by an Act passed iri England in consequence of there being a doubt, whether the House of Commons had.the power of the House of Lords, as a Court of Judicature, to administer oaths. however, does not go the length of the-.bill before us. Iri May it is laid downAt length, in 1871, in pursuance of the recomrepresent; and personally, I should like mendations of a Select Committee of 1S69, Act 34 ancl 35 Vict. c. 83 was passed, empowering the House of Commons and its committees to administer oaths to witnesses, and attaching to false evidence the penalties of perjury. . . . It is not usual, however, for Select Committees to examine witnesses upon oath, except upon inquiries of a judicial or other special character. If we do not abuse these great powers all will be right; but I think the custom at Home is not to administer the oath to witnesses before Select Committees. to administer the oath here. point; but, if I am not mistaken, the powers we have are those of the House of Commons, and there, under the Imperial Act, a Select Committee has power to administer oaths. Clause 49 of .the Constitution is as follows :The powers, privileges, and immunities of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, and of the members of the committees of each House shall be such as are declared by the Parliament, and until declared shallbe those of the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom, and of its members .and committees, at the establishment of the Commonwealth. I think that that clinches the matter, and the extract from May shows that the House of Commons has the power, and that, therefore, we also have the power. Whypass a Bill, .which, from beginning to end,, is riddled with ridiculous penalties? I do not believe that there is aParliamentary Committee or a Court of Judicature in the British Empire which has the powers proposed to be given by this Bill. It is all very well for the Attorney-General to say that this is a copy of the. Queensland Act; but the. moment his attention was drawn to the matter, he had to confess that two most material words had been dropped out of the clause, not by the Government, but apparently by some private member, whose view has been accepted, is there a court anywhere which has statutory power to impose two years'. imprisonment with hard labour-becaus e imprisonment, according tb the Acts Interpretation Act, involves hard labour-o n a witness for not answering a question in relation to which he would in any ordinary proceedings be entitled to claim privilege. It is all very well to say that this is a private Bill, but, in my opinion, it involves serious limitations of the liberty of the subject. We That Act in England, are too much inclined, with our super-sensitiveness in regard to our dignity, to encroach on the liberties of the people we to see the Bill suspended until it is really necessary. It is to be deplored that, witn such little consideration as we have given to this matter-althoug h a Bill was before us last year and shelved as too extreme -w e should be called upon at this hour of the session to pass this measure into law. In the clause as it stands a witness may be asked a question which would-criminate him, and, although he may claim privilege, he is compelled to answer it, and. unless he shows good cause-to be determined by what tribunal I know not--h e may be arraigned I know that there is a passage in May which declares that it is doubtful whether, on the examination of a witness, privilege may be claimed. A man was before an Imperial Select Committee as the writer of an article, and when he was asked a question he claimedprivilege, because, if he answered it, he might be prosecuted. In all matters affecting criminal offences, "" attended with such a severe penalty as this, the position ought to be set out clearly. urgency for the Bill?

In the first place the Judge will say to the jury : "" Gentlemen of the jury, before you can convict this man you must first of all ascertain whether the Postmaster-General has any reason for adopting the course that he did.

Are we to take part in a farce? Is it not little more than a farce that we should put such a provision as this on the statute-book? In stances of the kind I have cited might readily be multiplied, although the particular Select Committee to which I have referred will have perhaps a more direct issue to deal with than the issues which many Parliamentary Committees are appointed to consider. ber think that a Select Committee should not be armed with any power to compel -x witness to answer relevant questions? Mr W. H . .

Having regard question touching the subject-matter of the the phraseology used, the difficulty is inquiry under penalty of a fine of Â£ 5 0 . much greater than some laymen imagine.

IRVINE If the Attorney General is prepared to modify this provision, so tliat it will not provide for a greater penalty than may be imposed ^n a witness who refuses to give evidence before a Royal Commission, I shall be satisfied. I have listened with considerable interest to the. variety of opinions that have been expressed upon this subject, and could not help reflecting when I heard the legal fraternity expressing such widely divergent views that we might be emphasizing the scarcity of litigation in this State even more than it has been by demonstrating to the public the impossibility of obtaining uniformity in legal opinion. The honourable member for Flinders has pointed to the weak spot in this B ill . It is proposed to give to these Could honourable members Committees a power which no Court in this country has possessed. In the case of a witness who refuses to give evidence before a Royal Commission-and Royal Commissions are supposed to be of a much more grave and important character than Select: Committeesa penalty of-as a rule-no t more than Â£ 5 0 is imposed;. In connection 1 with an important inquiry by a Royal Commission in New South Wales as to some land scandalsI do not refer to the inquiry conducted by Mr Justice Owen-it was found difficult to get certain witnesses to answer questions. The Commission possessed the powers usually vested in a Roval Commission, but all.that it was able to do was to prosecute a witness, who had refused H a v in g regard to answer questions, for the penalty of Â£ 2 0 . Turning from Royal Commissions to other important bodies like the High Court or the Supreme Courts of the different States, we find that the only power they have in this regard is to commit a witness for contempt, in refusing to answer a question But one never heard of a Justice of the Supreme Court committing a witness for refusing to answer questions to a term of imprisonment I say that I ceranything like as long as one year, Mr .W.

378,Mr Bruce Smith (Parkes) [8.44].,"The honourable member for Hindmarsh, like a good many more laymen, rushes in where even lawyers fear to tread. He say's that if the word "" lawful."" is doubtful, we ought to strike it out. I differ from the honourable member for Flinders with regard to the use oi that word. He will admit that a question may be relevant, but not lawful. A question may be relevant, but by replying to it the witness might incriminate himself. Therefore, although perfectly relevant, it would not be lawful. I agree, therefore, with the Attorney-General that the word "" lawful "" is necessary. The punishment proposed, however, is absurd. Let me deal for a moment with the question of relevancy. It is a well-known rule of the law of evidence that', under cross-examination, a witness may' be asked a question about his early life-abou t something that has no connection with the problem that is before the tribunal-becaus e it goes to Iris character and credibility. The point is whether such a question would' be relevant, although it might be allowed by the Judge or"" the chairman of the tribunal as haying abearing upon the credibility of the witness. ing .of. the word "" l a w f u l "" heie-it maybedesigned to give authority for asking no power to impose imprisonment. The such a question. the' word "" lawful "" is sufficiently covered by the principle of incrimination. As to pression for the moment that the power the question of urgency in passing the was toi be given to a Committee to order .measure, I think that the honourable ' and imprisonment.

A legal tribunal, then, with all deference to number of honourable members have been the honourable member for Parkes and the appointed, in all seriousness', to enter upon honourable and learned member for Flinan inquiry; and they are about to begin ders, I say that the Court would construe that inquiry while ""the House is in recess. the words, ""any question,"" as meaning The honourable member, as chairman of any question within the meaning of the that Committee, says, im effect: "" I am Statute. That sort of thing is constantly not prepared to embark upon this inquiry occurring.

''-. ""quiry because certain witnesses refuse to give the information, and he cannot enforce his requirements of them. I , therefore, think that the measure is urgent; also that the word "" lawful "" is not surplusage, and should remain in the clause. Eveni f I were paid a fee for anopinion, I should say that its use is warranted. I often notice that the views of lawyers, given without fee, are not nearly so reliable as are those given by them when a fee is paid.. I repeat that, in my opinion, the measure is urgent, and that it is right that the word "" lawful "" should be retained, but I think that the Attorney-General will make a grave error if he persists with his proposal with regard to imprisonment. He will be perfectly safe in going upon the lines adopted in regard to Royal Commissions, and providing for the imposition of a severe monetary penalty for refusing to answer a question. I see no reason to support the clause as it now stands. If the person refusing to answer a question were to be tried before a properly-qualified legal tribunal, the phraseology of this clause would be inter-, offender must be placed on trial before a The chairman he would-incur any risk?

I would' point out, however, that it does not mean We have not absolute safety so far as the position of this House is concerned. I have watched with considerable interest the conduct of negotiations between the Prime Minister and the Imperial naval authorities, and have found that the honourable gentleman does not hesitate to make representations to them which have no foundation in fact in this country.

As a matter of fact, they did not. I have mentioned the matter in this House in the presence of the Prime Minister, and he has had an opportunity to contradict me. The honourable gentleman, as the honourable member for Dalley has stated, certainly did represent when ih the Conference that the people of Australia were unfavorable to the continuance of a money contribution' to the British Navy. . And he emphasized that statement so frequently that at last Lord Tweedmouth, as representing the naval authorities at the Conference, said, in effect, "" If the people of Australia have made up their minds to contribute to the ' defence . of the Empire in ' kind ' instead of in cash, we should like you to build a certain class of vessels which if would be very inconvenient for us to send from England to Australia."" He went on to say, however, "" If you bave an Australian flotilla we shall expect you to place it under the control of the Commander in-Chief in time of war."" The : Prime Minister said in this House that that could not be, and the leader of the Labour Party said it was impossible. Those words' stand in Hansard to-day. That means to the honourable member that to allow him to continue the line of argument he is now pursuing would be to open up a genera! discussion as to what took place at the. Imperial Conference.

Mr W. H . IRVINE nucleus. we are able to appropriate for old-age pensions is also very small, but the honourable member will see that the same policy is at work in both cases. We are to have a sort, of money-box, and the Government wish to put their pennies into it in order that when the time comes to carry' out 'this policv, they may find it fairly f u l l . I object to this sum of Â£ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 being voted as an earnest to the British Government that we are in favour of the policy enunciated by the Prime Minister. This Parliament in 1903, passed a B ill establishing -a solemn compact between the British Government ancl Australia that a ten years' contribution of Â£ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum should be made by us for certain naval services. Although many honourable members are' under the impression that we do not get value for that expenditure, unless the ships of the Squadron are lying either in Sydney Harbor Or in Port Phillip, we know that the greatest naval authority in the world has declared that the naval base for the defence of Australia is the Indian Ocean, and not the Australian ports. We cannot cancel that agreement without the consent of the Imperial Government and of New Zealand. It may be that the British Government, in their desire to placate Australia, as one of its colonial possessions, may be perfectly willing to forego that agreement that agreement conditions which Great Britain has to f u l f i l , and if it be cancelled Great Britain will be released from observAustralian manufactures .of that ing those conditions. But dence clearly shows that if we cease to rer cognise the undertaking into which we entered with the British naval authorities,' the . ships of war which are now constantly in, or in the neighbourhood of, Australia will be immediately removed to the Indian and China seas. British naval authorities have already announced-if the Minister had read Lord upon an Australian Navy. We Tweedmouth's speech he would be aware of the fact-that in the event of the agreement being cancelled, the ships will be removed to the China and Indian seas to become part of the British Fleet in those quarters. moved ? would be better for the defence of the Empire to remove them to the localities I have indicated, in order that they may be in a position to carry out the doctrine enunciated by Nelson,. and acknowledged ever, since, that a navy should go outto meet the enemy rather than that they should be kept anchored in Australian ports. I object to this money .being regarded as an earnest of anvthing, until the defence scheme of the Government has been enunciated and approved by this House. . Although in the abstract honourable members may be in favour of an expenditure of Â£-250,000 for' naval purposes, the Government might bring down a scheme relating to naval construction which the House would wholly, condemn. For instance, instead of proposing to construct torpedo destroyers, or submarines, they might propose to build one huge battleship a project which the House would regard ' as an utter absurdity unless it is to be a contribution to the British Navy. Therefore I contend that this Bill does not and must not be taken to commit us to any naval expenditure whatever. All that we are consenting to is the appropriation of Â£ 2 5 6 , 0 0 0 , which I contend ought to have been returned to the States. der it. the honourable member's opinion.

I came prepared to-night to speak fully on the question of naval defence, but was dissuaded from doing so by the Ministerial statement that the passing of the Bill would not commit us to any definite expenditure, and that before any money was spent we should have a full opportunity to discuss the subject gaierally. Therefore, what I am prepared to say can. be kept until a few months hence, when the matter comes up again, seeing that there is to be no expenditure in the interval. I was rather amused at the statement of the honourable member for Wide. Bay, that we are prepared to defend ourselves. This is the second time, that he has made it within a few days. What the Prime Minister proposes is merely the making of preparations for the defence of our harbors and coasts; our water-borne trade must still be protected by the Mother Country, and that defence will cost a great deal of money. The difference between the position of the honourable member for Wide Bay and my position is that, while I am, and always' have been, in favour of assisting the Mother Country to bear the burden of defending the Empire of which Australia is part, he wishes her to If1 do so without our assistance, and, indeed, without even acknowledgement. His policy is a selfish one. He thinks only of our harbors and coasts, forgetting that our existence as a country depends on the power and strength of the British Navy. We should surely assist in providing the. defence extended to us by Great Britain. We should not desire to get it for nothing. The object of the proposed measure is to enable money to be taken from this year's revenue, and placed to a reserve fund, so that it shall not be returned to the States. I do Nothing worse can not object to tbe appropriation, because that is legal; but I maintain now, as I did the other night, that to place this money to a trust fund is unconstitutional, and a grave breach of faith with the States. Parliament, however, has decided against the view I revenue which they would otherwise receive, and to which I believe they are legally entitled. To-night we are giving effect to that decision. The money to be appropriated is to be paid into a trust fund until its expenditure is authorized; but the mode of expenditure is not to be discussed until next session, or even later. Indeed,the money may eventually be reappropriated by law to some quite different purpose. I think, however, that at the end of the financial yeafNwhen the States have an opportunifeyi^to test the validity of our legislation, the High Court will decide that what we have done is unconstitutional. It may be argued that if I vote for this measure, .knowing that the object of the appropriation-whic h in itself is perfectly legal-is to prevent the return of money fo the States, I shall be inconsistent. To guard myself against that charge, I again protest against the illegality of ""these unexpended moneys which it is proposed to place in a trust fund, being so placed.

542,Mr Knox (Kooyong) [Io.39],"I wishthe Minister of Defence adhered to the declaration made some time ago by the Prime Minister, and confirmed to-night by the Treasurer, I think that he would have found the Committee unanimously in favour of the proposed vote. But instead ofdoing so, he made a statement which has opened up a general discussion. I consider that our annual subsidy of Â£200,000 to the British Navy is a very paltry contribution, having regard to the benefits which we derive from it. Notwithstandingthe suggestion that our contribution to the naval defence of the Empire may be a contribution in kind, I distinctly hope that the Naval Agreement will be maintained as an earnest of our loyalty and a recognition of the power that is protecting us. Would it be possible for us to defend ourselves from a foreign invasion ? member, must not discuss the general question of defence. not prepared to vote against the Government in respect to this vote, believing that, in view of the passing of the Surplus Revenue Bill, the Committee will be entirely in favour of it, I want it to be clearly understood that I do not commit myself to ""the Government scheme, the details of which will have to be considered later on. The Minister, by.his remarks, gave rise to an interjection by the honourable member for. South Sydney, which introduced into the debate an element that I deeply regret. We are practically proposing to-night to ear-mark a sum of Â£250,000 for use in connection with a scheme which is to be brought before us later on, and if that' scheme be not adopted this proposed appropriation will lapse. My desire is that the vote shall not be applied with a view-to diminishing the contribution that we make to the British Navy. I shall always consider that that contribution is a very moderate one, having regard to the great services rendered to us by the British Fleet. ject to our embarking upon an undertaking without any knowledge of what it is going to cost, or where it will lead us. We are setting out to-night on a dangerous course, which I feel confident will land the Commonwealth, in the near future, in an enormous expenditure. One might imagine, from the tenor of some of the speeches delivered during this debate, that the Japanese were at our doors, and that. we were doing nothing for the defence of our country. As a matter of fact, however, our defence bill is far greater than is that of Canada. Whereas our defence expenditure to-dav is equal to 5s. per head of our population, that of Canada is equivalent to only 2s. 6d. per head of her population. I am no more unpatriotic than is the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, yet I have strong objections to the Naval Agreement. The commerce of Canada enjoys the protection of the British Fleet just as does that of Australia, yet she contributes nothing to the Imperial Navy. But no one suggests that Canada is disloyal.to the Empire as much as we do on defence. of Federation, we were spending upon defence, a sum equal to 4s. per head of our population, as against a defence expenditure by Canada equal to 2s. per head of her population. papers, we are still expending on defence a sum equal to 4s -or , to be exact, 3s. n j d . -pe r head of our population. penditure on defence is equal to about 5s. per head of our population. As soon as a newspaper article suggesting that we are threatened with a Japanese invasionis published, something in the nature of a panic takes place, and there is a wild cry for increased expenditure on defence.

I may be wrong, but I do not think Australia has anything to fear from the Japanese. For many years to come Japan will have her hands full. I cannot forget the lessons of the South African war. It cost Great Britain over Â£220,000,000 to conquer a handful of people in South Africa, and it has been said by undoubted authorities that no other power could have done what Great Britain did, in transporting so large a force there. tempted to invade Australia, I am sure that we should put up a record equal to that of Britishers in any other part of the world. We are asked to-night to embark upon a costly undertaking, and I regret that the Committee should be prepared to agree to this vote with no knowledge of what the Government scheme will be. We are called upon to vote blindly upon this question, and to agree to the initiatioif of The honourable member for South Sydney a scheme which may cause the people of the future to curse us. I wish to place on record my objection to this vote. Â£10.52] I approve of this appropriation of Â£250,000 being made for the defence of the Australian coast. The scheme to be propounded by the Government will have to be considered by this House, and we shall have later on an opportunity to discuss it. I certainly am in favour of our obtaining submarines and submersibles for coastal defence purposes. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat has said that we need not fear invasion, and has suggested that if an enemy's fleet set out for Australia it would be intercepted and destroyed. Russian fleet reached Australian waters unheralded and anchored off Glenelg, ih St. Vincent's Gulf, before any one was aware of its presence on the coast. Sir Henry Parkes, referring later on to the Russian 'war scare, said that he had information that the Russians at that time had designs upon Australia. WhilstI am in favour of this proposed appropriation as an earnest of oiir intention to provide for the defence of our coast, I certainly am not in favour of our withdrawing from the Naval Agreement under which we contribute Â£200,000 per annum to the upkeep of the British Navy. When the Naval Agreement Bill was introduced by. Sir Edmund Barton, he said that he had been asked by the Imperial authorities to invite Parliament to grant an annual subsidy of mark that I was satisfied that my constituents would support me in voting for such a subsidy. The British Navy is the chief arm of our defence. No Power can swoop down,upon us. But even if the vessels of a hostile force succeeded in raiding us, it is questionable whether they would be able to get away with the spoil, because the British Fleet, having command of the sea, would probably intercept them before they had gone very If a foreign power atfar. Having read the discussions upon this proposal which took place in England, I see no objection to the appropriation of the Â£250,000 provided for in this Bill, seeing that it is to be devoted to coastal defence. But I hold myself entirely free to oppose the Government's scheme of defence if it does not embody what I conceive to be the best policy for Australia. stated, by way of interjection, that in voting for this appropriation, honourable members would be tacitly admitting that there should be a dual control in the matter of the naval defence of Australia. I say that I . am opposed to any such control. The Admiral of the British Fleet should have full control over the vessels provided by Australia. -The honourable member for Grey referred in terms of surprise to the fact that I intend supporting this Bill, and that I am in favour of an Australian-owned Navywhich, by the way, is a plank of the Labour Party's policy that I am astonished When I was a boy a to see the honourable member opposing-not withstanding that I assisted to cut down, the military Estimates some years ago. The honourable member, as well as the honourable member for Parkes and others who interjected, might have done me the justice of stating that when I moved for a reduction of those Estimates in 1902, I offered, on behalf of the party which I'represented, to vote an additional expenditure of Â£500,000 for the purpose of providing necessary arms and equipment. The point to which I took exception was that we were spending an enormous sum of money on training, without making adequate provision in the matter of. arms, munitions of war, and",64,Audit Bill

He saidI understand that Australia puts forward a proposal that the scheme of 1902 should be ended, and that Australia should start something in the way of a local defence force. The Prime Minister cf Australia said, in his reply to Lord Tweedmouth, that the views of the Federal Government had already been despatch which he had sent to the Admiralty, and that the existing system of contribution was not generally popular. I , however, say distinctly that the present system has been popular, and that the people of Australia do not desire a change. saidFurther consideration has convinced the public that the present agreement is not satisfactory either to the Admiralty, the political Lords of the Admiralty, or to the Parliament of the Commonwealth. That is definite enough, but I still say that' the people of Australia do not approve of the Prime Minister's views on this question. The honourable member for South Sydney argues that what it is proposed to do will form the nucleus of an Australian Navy. I quite admit that we must form the nucleus of a Navy at some time. But we must not try to run before we can walk. To talk of a handful of people not more than 4,500,000 in number establishing a Navy is nonsense. We have developed under fhe protection of the British Navy. Without the protection of the British flag to-day, what would be our position as a nation? What should we do with our commerce? primary producers do? be successful, and Australia could never develop. It is the security that we get from the protection of Great Britain which makes us a prosperous and progressive people. It would in my opinion be far better for us to double the present subsidy than t'o think of establishing a Navy of our own at preB u t the honorsent. I am satisfied that the views which I am expressing are those which are entertained by the majority of the people of this country. It is all very well for honourable .members opposite who represent city constituencies to speak . so confidently upon But the honorthis subject. But the country districts also have an interest in the matter, and their -views must be respected. It will be time.

He never says, "" This is not the time to do such a thing."" put on record in a pose that the honourable member knows very much about establishing businesses, or he would be aware that that is exactly how a business man does talk. There must, of course, be a beginning for everything, but we are not in a position to make a beginning with an Australian Navy at The Prime Minister further present. I am sure that the bargain made with the Admiralty some years ago would be endorsed by at least 70 per cent, of-the people of Australia, and they would rather see the subsidy doubled than the agreement' broken.' hope that the people of Australia do not hold the views expressed by the last speaker. I should be very much ashamed of them if they did. They would place themselves before the world as a helpless crowd of people who felt unable to do anything to protect themselves. The people of this country do not adopt the view that we must for all time "" depend upon mother."" It is a hopeless policy t'o say that we must do nothing to protect ourselves upon the sea until we have a population of 10,000,000 or 20,000,000.
