Bill Read A First Time. Second Reading Regional Development) (09:01","I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Railway Agreement (Western Australia) Act 1961 established an agreement to allow the Commonwealth to provide a long-term loan to Western Australia to undertake construction of a standard-gauge railway, primarily from Kalgoorlie to Perth. The purpose of the Railway Agreement (Western Australia) Amendment Bill 2014 is to amend the Railway Agreement (Western Australia) Act 1961 to allow Western Australia to pay the outstanding balance of the loan from the Commonwealth, some $1.6 million, should they choose to do so. The bill also provides for the repeal of the act 28 days after the repayment is made. This government is committed to reducing red tape through its deregulation agenda. The government is working with state and territory governments to deliver on reducing the regulatory burden to grow Australia's productivity. The bill enables the early repayment of the loan to the Western Australian government for standardisation of the railway from Kalgoorlie to Perth. This change is necessary as the act currently does not allow for early repayment of the loan, with the final payment scheduled for 2041. Once the loan is repaid there will be some minor administrative efficiencies from the cessation of the administration of the act. There are no outstanding claims under the act and consequently it should be repealed. The amendments to the act do not have any regulatory or financial impacts on businesses and the not-for-profit sector. The amendments in this bill will help to streamline early repayment from Western Australia to the Commonwealth for loans that date back to the 1960s. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned.

2,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure andand the Export Inspection (Establishment Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2014 presented by Mr Joyce. Bill read a first time. Second Reading Nationals) (09:04): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. We all want a strong and prosperous agriculture sector in Australia. We want an agriculture sector that lasts, a sector that grows and delivers great returns for our nation. Australian farmers are world leaders in producing efficient, sustainable and high-quality produce to meet demand both here and abroad. The export of these products plays a major role in the future of Australian agriculture, and indeed the future of Australian farmers. We export around 65 per cent of our farm products, 75 per cent of our fish products and 60 per cent of our forest products, worth more than $41 billion in 2012-13. (Confirmed by The export of these products helps support the estimated 134,000 farm businesses across the country-most of which are family owned and run-and a great many more jobs for hard working Australians in our primary industries. This government is working to boost the competitiveness and productivity of the Australian agriculture sector. Creating new market opportunities and maintaining existing export arrangements supports the government's trade objectives while assisting those at the farm gate, which is vitally important for agriculture in this country. Underpinning it all is the export legislation which safeguards Australia's international reputation and position as an agricultural exporter, providing confidence that Australian agricultural exports meet the requirements of importing countries. One of our greatest advantages is our 'clean' label, as a country whose product is phytosanitarily looked after and correct, which gives people a great sense of security when they consume it. People who have had experience around the irrigation areas of St George would acknowledge what a clean, green place our irrigation country is. Export legislation provides the Department of Agriculture with the authority to grant certification services to exporters and-consistent with the Australian cost recovery guidelines-to recover the costs of providing these services. The Export Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 amends four acts administered by the department. Amendments to the Export Control Act 1982 and the Export Inspection and Meat Charges Collection Act 1985 will remedy technical defects in these acts and allow for consistent and equitable cost recovery from export activities.",17,Bills
3,Mr Joyce (New England,"Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Leader of TheCurrently, inconsistent definitions mean that the department has been unable to recover establishment registration and quantity charges for the exportation of certain products. Put simply, exporters of some plant products like nuts and seeds, for example, are not paying establishment registration and quantity charges which are being paid by exporters of other plant products like grain. This is not fair, when all exporters have access to the services that they need to export their products. We must get a fair and equitable coverage of costs across industries. These amendments will address this inequity and provide a more level playing field by aligning the definitions in the Export Inspection and Meat Charges Collection Act 1985 and the Export Control Act 1982. Removing the definitional inconsistencies between the two acts will allow for consistent and equitable cost recovery for services provided by the department to exporters. The bill will also amend the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997 (AMLI Act) to enable the department to recover costs relating to services, such as issuing quota certificates for quotas that are administered by other countries. The costs of granting quota certificates for quota administered by Australia are already recovered from the users of the services. Amendments to the AMLI Act will enable the department to recover costs when it is not responsible for allocating the quota but, nonetheless, is required to issue quota certificates. No fees are being proposed by this act-and any cost recovery for quotas will be determined through a cost recovery impact statement in consultation with the industry. The proposed amendments will enable the department to recover the estimated $1.9 million per annum for providing export services for commodities which are currently excluded from cost recovery. These amendments are largely supported by industry-who like me-believes that costs for export services carried out by the department should be appropriately and consistently recovered. The Export Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 will also correct a referencing anomaly in the Export Control Act 1982, which will enable departmental officers to request search warrants by telephone or other electronic means. This will enable enforcement operations to be conducted in an appropriate time frame. From time to time, authorised officers are required to access registered premises-being ships, planes, vehicles or premises-where officers believe that there may be evidential material relating to breaches of this act. Correction of this incorrect referencing will expedite the execution of warrants. The Export Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 and the associated bills which I will also introduce to make the relevant consequential amendments, are important pieces of legislation that will not only provide a fairer and more consistent approach to cost recovery for services provided to exporters, but will also provide departmental officers greater access to important documents and information in a timely manner, making it easier for them to perform the important role of protecting the integrity of Australia's export commodities. Madam Speaker, I apologise for my over-reference to phytosanitary correctness, but it is the Gut Foundation day and we want everyone to have their proper bowel screening. Debate adjourned. Export Inspection (Quantity Charge) Amendment Bill 2014 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Joyce. Bill read a first time. Second Reading Nationals) (09:11): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Export Inspection (Quantity Charge) Amendment Bill 2014 is the second of four bills being introduced to form this legislative package that will remedy technical defects and allow for more consistent and equitable cost recovery for services provided to exporters by the Department of Agriculture. The Export Inspection (Quantity Charge) Act 1985 enables the collection of charges for export related services carried out under the Export Control Act 1982. As the Quantity Charge Act is incorporated and reads as one with the Export Inspection and Meat Charges Collection Act 1985 (collection act), consequential amendments are required for consistency with amendments being proposed to the collection act (which are being made by the Export Legislation Amendment Bill 2014). The bill itself does not impose any extra charges. Debate adjourned. Export Inspection (Service Charge) Amendment Bill 2014 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Joyce. Bill read a first time.

The Export Inspection (Service Charge) Amendment Bill 2014 is the third of four bills being introduced to form this legislative package that will remedy technical defects and allow for more consistent and equitable cost recovery for services provided to exporters by the Department of Agriculture. The Export Inspection (Service Charge) Act 1985 enables the collection of charges for export related services carried out under the Export Control Act 1982.

Bill read a first time. Second Reading Nationals) (09:14): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Export Inspection (Establishment Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2014 is the final bill being introduced to form this legislative package that will remedy technical defects and allow for more consistent and equitable cost recovery for services provided to exporters by the Department of Agriculture. The Export Inspection (Establishment Registration Charges) Act 1985 enables the collection of charges for export related services carried out under the Export Control Act 1982. As the establishment registration charges act is incorporated and reads as one with the Export Inspection and Meat Charges Collection Act 1985 (the collection act), consequential amendments are required for consistency with amendments being proposed to the collection act (which are being made by the Export Legislation Amendment Bill 2014). The bill itself does not impose any extra charges; however, the department would have the ability to recover establishment registration charges for exporting certain plant products like cut flowers, dried fruits, nursery stock, nuts, seed, timber products and tissue culture, allowing for more consistent and equitable cost recovery for services provided to exporters by the department. Debate adjourned. Student Identifiers Bill 2014 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Ley. Bill read a first time. Second Reading Ms LEY (Farrer-Assistant Minister for Education) (09:16): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Introduction Australia's continued prosperity depends in large part on the skills and knowledge of our people.",20,Abares 3 March 2013
6,Mr Joyce (New England,"Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Leader of TheThis will especially be the case as we move to reposition Australian industry to take advantage of the many opportunities and face the competitive challenges of the 21st century. The government is committed to ensuring that the vocational education and training sector is ready to meet the skills and training needs of the nation and it is in this context that the Student Identifiers Bill is presented to the House. Currently, information about vocational education enrolments, participation and completion is fragmented and inaccurate. Many vocational education students use more than one training provider. This leads to wasteful and confusing duplication in the creation of student identities, which in turn makes it difficult to understand pathways and patterns of enrolment and completion and to develop evidence-based and cost-efficient programs that effectively target skill shortages and the skills needs of industry. Through the introduction of a national lifelong unique student identifier for students who undertake nationally recognised training, the bill will generate savings for individuals and businesses by enabling the streamlining of data collection and other processes in the vocational education and training sector. The unique identifier will assist industry in making better informed decisions about the skill levels and training needs of their workforces and effectiveness of training undertaken. In addition, individuals will have easy, reliable, lifelong online access to a record of their training history from a single authoritative source. Governments will have access to more accurate and complete data on training completions and pathways that will greatly improve the monitoring of the efficiency, responsiveness and effectiveness of the training system. This will inform the development of a contestable training market and enable governments to target assistance to training providers, students and employers more efficiently and effectively than ever before. Specifics of the bill The Student Identifiers Bill 2014 provides for the introduction of the scheme for students undertaking nationally recognised training in the VET sector. It provides for the assignment of student identifiers and for their collection, use and disclosure. While student identifiers will be mandatory for students undertaking VET courses once the scheme commences, there will be provision for the Commonwealth minister to make exemptions under the scheme by legislative instrument with the agreement of the states and territories. A key principle underpinning the scheme is that individuals will have control over their student identifier and can determine who can have access to their personal and educational records associated with it. The privacy framework for the scheme is intended to complement and work in conjunction with existing Commonwealth, state and territory privacy provisions which will continue to operate in relation to personal information as they do now. The bill establishes a new Commonwealth statutory office holder, the Student Identifiers Registrar, to ensure the protection and appropriate use of information. The registrar will be responsible for assigning student identifiers to individuals who apply for one and for providing authenticated VET transcripts upon request. The bill also requires the registrar to submit an annual report to the Commonwealth minister for presentation to the parliament and to provide a copy to the ministerial council. The functions of the registrar will be funded from existing funding for the support of the national training system with the amount of the allocation to be agreed by the state, territory and Commonwealth training ministers in accordance with the National Agreement for Skills and Workforce Development between the Commonwealth, states and territories as is in force from time to time. The introduction of the student identifier will be supported by the inclusion of additional requirements to the standards for registered training organisations under the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Act 2011 and mirrored in the Australian Quality Training Framework. The introduction of the student identifier will enhance the efficiency, transparency and responsiveness of the VET sector. The Australian government is committed to strengthening the training sector by providing a clearer picture of our skills base, confirming that future training can be targeted to meet the needs of industry and the economy. Debate adjourned. Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Seniors Health Card and Other Measures) Bill 2014 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Andrews. Bill read a first time. Second Reading That this bill be now read a second time. This bill will implement the government's election commitment to index income thresholds for the Commonwealth seniors health card. The seniors health card is available to people who are of age pension age but who do not qualify for the age pension-typically, self-funded retirees. Qualification for the seniors health card depends partly on a person satisfying the seniors health card taxable income test. Under that test, the person's adjusted taxable income must not exceed the taxable income limit that applies to the person's family situation. These income limits are currently set at $50,000 for singles and $80,000 for couples. The taxable income limits are not currently indexed and have not increased since 2001. Introducing indexation means more people will satisfy the seniors health card taxable income test and therefore qualify for the seniors health card.",21,Abares 3 March 2013
7,Mr Andrews (Menzies,"Minister for Social Services) (09:21): I move:The government recognises that self-funded retirees, after a lifetime of hard work, have made a significant contribution to our nation's success. They are entitled to a safe and secure retirement. We also recognise that, by looking after their own retirement needs, self-funded retirees save the Commonwealth budget considerable pension costs. However, we know that many self-funded retirees are not wealthy and face financial pressures. Those who meet the current income test and therefore hold a seniors health card are rightly concerned about modest changes in retirement income potentially causing them to lose their entitlement to the card. Unexpected medical bills can be a significant worry for many seniors in that position. Indexing the current income thresholds so they do not erode in real terms will allow more self-funded retirees to qualify for a seniors health card-or to keep their card despite small increases in their income beyond the current limits. This means more seniors will be able to access the concessions that come with the cardincluding medicines listed in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme at the concessional rate. Indexation of the income thresholds will occur annually, starting on 20 September 2014, and will be based on movements in the consumer price index. This measure applies to the seniors health card under either the Social Security Act 1991 or the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. The bill will also make minor and technical amendments to portfolio acts, including reflecting changed Public Service administrative arrangements. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Morrison. Bill read a first time. Second Reading move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014 amends the Migration Act 1958 (the act) and the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 (the citizenship act) to:  ensure that sections 48, 48A and 501E of the act can be correctly applied according to policy intention;  ensure that a bridging visa application is not an impediment to the exercise of the removal of the person under subsection 198(5) of the act;  apply the debt liability provisions of the act to all convicted people smugglers and illegal foreign fishers;",23,Abares 3 March 2013
8,Mr Morrison (Cook,"Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (09:24): I clarify the obligations of the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal to give documents to an authorised recipient;  clarify the role of the authorised recipient, and the extent of the obligation to notify an authorised recipient of direct communications made with the person who appointed them;  provide access to, and use of, material and information obtained under a search warrant issued under the Crimes Act 1914 for certain purposes of the act and the citizenship act;  ensure that the procedural fairness requirements prescribed in the act will apply universally to all visa applications and provide for greater consistency in decision making; and  repeal provisions in the act which contain references to section 14 of the Electronic Transactions Act 1999. The first schedule to the bill will ensure that sections 48, 48A and 501E of the act can be correctly applied according to policy intention. Sections 48, 48A and 501E of the act limit or prohibit the making of valid visa applications by persons who have been refused a visa or who have held a visa that was cancelled. Currently, section 48 limits further visa applications by a person in the migration zone who held a visa that was cancelled. This means a person whose visa has been cancelled at any time in the past will not be able to make a further visa application while they are in Australia. This is not consistent with the policy intention, which is to limit further visa applications if the person has held a visa that was cancelled only since last entering Australia. In addition, the amendment will clarify that sections 48, 48A and 501E also apply to limit or prohibit the making of a further visa application by persons who were refused a visa for which a valid application was made on the person's behalf. This is irrespective of whether the person knew about, or understood the nature of, the application because the person lacked capacity due to a mental impairment, or because the person was a minor at the time of that application. The amendment will ensure that, consistently with the policy intention, the application of sections 48, 48A and 501E will not be determined by reference to a retrospective and subjective assessment of the person's knowledge or understanding of the visa application made on their behalf. Instead, the application of these provisions can be determined by reference to the objective criterion of whether or not the person has been refused a visa since they last entered Australia as a matter of fact. The amendment will protect the integrity of Australia's visa systems by ensuring that minors or mentally impaired persons who have been refused a visa and who do not otherwise have a lawful basis for remaining in Australia, cannot make or have made on their behalf, unmeritorious visa applications in order to prolong their stay in Australia. It also ensures that different members of the same family unit, some of whom may be minors or mentally impaired, who applied for visas together will receive consistent immigration outcomes and be bound by the same consequences. Schedule 2-removal of unlawful noncitizens The second schedule to the bill will clarify the interaction between section 195 and subsection 198(5) of the act. This is to ensure that a bridging visa application is not an impediment to the removal of a person under subsection 198(5) of the act. Currently, subsection 198(5) of the act does not explicitly cover situations where a detainee has applied only for a bridging visa, which has resulted in a small cohort of detainees being unable to be removed from Australia. This amendment now clarifies the wording of subsection 198(5), to ensure the correct operation of removals policy intent. In addition, these amendments put beyond doubt that a person cannot be removed if they have applied for a protection visa and the grant of the visa has not yet been refused or the application has not yet been finally determined. This puts beyond doubt that subsection 198(5) of the act does not apply to an unlawful noncitizen who has made a valid application for a protection visa. These measures will apply to the removal of a detainee on or after the commencement of this schedule, including if the detainee was detained before that day. Schedule 3-recovery of costs from certain persons The third schedule to the bill will apply the debt liability provisions of the act to all convicted people smugglers and illegal foreign fishers. On9 November 2009, the relevant operative provisions of the Migration Amendment (Abolishing Detention Debt) Act 2009 commenced. These amendments removed liability for certain persons and liable third parties to the Commonwealth for the cost of keeping, maintaining, and transporting them while they were in immigration detention. Under existing legislative arrangements, convicted people smugglers and illegal foreign fishers who are detained because of section 250 of the act, remain liable to the Commonwealth for their detention and removal costs. The act also contains a number of provisions that facilitate the recovery of these debts. However, under current provisions of the act, a person is not liable for costs arising from their immigration detention and removal if they were not initially detained because of section 250, or because they were not in immigration detention at the time of their conviction, or because they have since been granted a visa (for example, a criminal justice stay visa while in prison). Accordingly, the debt liability provisions cannot be applied to all people smugglers and illegal foreign fishers, regardless of how or if they were detained and whether they have been granted a visa. This inability to apply the debt liability provisions of the act consistently to all convicted people smugglers and illegal foreign fishers, negates any financial disincentive to these persons to participate in people smuggling or illegal foreign fishing. Changes to the act will make it clear that these provisions will apply either at the time of conviction or after the convicted people smuggler or illegal foreign fisher has completed serving the whole or part of their criminal sentence. These amendments will also clarify that detention transportation and removal costs are recoverable from a convicted people smuggler or illegal foreign fisher regardless of their current status or whether or not they were believed to be a people smuggler or illegal foreign fisher at the time of their immigration detention. Schedule 4-authorised recipients The fourth schedule to the bill will clarify the obligation of the Migration Review Tribunal (MRT) and the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) to give documents to an authorised recipient. The amendments also clarify the role of an authorised recipient and remove the requirement to notify an authorised recipient of direct oral communications made with the person who authorised them. The first amendment addresses the full Federal Court's decision in SZJDS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2012] FCAFC 27, in which the full Federal Court found that the MRT or the RRT's obligation to give documents to an authorised recipient does not extend to review applications which have not been properly made. The amendment will put it beyond doubt that where an authorised recipient has been authorised by a review applicant to receive documents on their behalf, the MRT or the RRT must, consistent with the review applicant's wish, give documents relating to the review to the authorised recipient, even if the review application itself was not properly made. The second amendment is to clarify the intended operation of the provisions relating to authorised recipients. Currently, the act provides that an authorised recipient can do things on behalf of an applicant or a person that consist of, or include, receiving documents in connection with the application or matters arising under the act or the Migration Regulations 1994. This is broader than the policy intention for the role of an authorised recipient, which is only to receive documents and not do anything else on behalf of the applicant or person, and has led to comments by the full Federal Court in MZZDJ v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2013] FCAFC 156 that the relevant provision means that an authorised recipient is 'constituted effectively as the agent of the visa applicant'. The amendment therefore clarifies that an authorised recipient is authorised to only receive documents and to update their own address for the purpose of receiving documents. If an applicant or person has an intention to allow another person to do additional things on their behalf, evidence must be provided to the department or the tribunal separately to the authorisation of that person as an authorised recipient. Finally, the amendments remove the current requirement to notify an authorised recipient of direct oral communications made with the applicant or person. This is a consequential amendment to the clarification of the role of an authorised recipient. If an authorised recipient is only authorised to receive documents, then there is no longer a reason or a need to inform the authorised recipient of communications made directly with the applicant or person. However, this would not prevent the department or the tribunal, under policy, from informing the authorised recipient of relevant and important direct communications made with the applicant or person, in circumstances where the authorised recipient has also been given separate authority to act for the applicant or person, other than to receive documents. Schedule 5-Crimes Act warrants The fifth schedule to the bill will provide access to, and use of, material and information obtained under a search warrant issued under the Crimes Act 1914 for certain purposes of the act and Citizenship Act. These amendments overcome the limitation on receiving and using information obtained under a search warrant issued under division 2 of part 1AA of the Crimes Act 1914 for the purposes of making certain administrative decision under the act or Citizenship Act. The purposes for which the material and information can be received and used in the context of the act are:  making a decision, or assisting in making a decision, to grant or refuse to grant a visa;  making a decision, or assisting in making a decision, to cancel a visa;  making a decision, or assisting in making a decision, to revoke a cancellation of a visa; and  making a decision in relation to the detention, removal, or deportation of a noncitizen from Australia. The purposes for which the material and information can be received and used in the context of the citizenship act are:  making a decision, or assisting in making a decision, to approve or refuse to approve a person becoming an Australian citizen;  making a decision, or assisting in making a decision, to revoke a person's Australian citizenship;  making a decision, or assisting in making a decision, to cancel an approval given to a person under section 24 of the Citizenship Act. The Department of Immigration and Border Protection has a critical role to play in ensuring fair and reasonable decisions are made regarding people entering or the detention, removal or deportation of a person from Australia to ensure compliance with immigration laws. It is in the public interest that, where available, immigration decision makers are able to use and share information that help inform lawful decisions. Immigration criminal investigators have at their disposal legitimately obtained material that could be made available to administrative decision makers if supported through appropriate legislation. The bill seeks to facilitate the use and sharing of material or information obtained under a section 3E Crimes Act 1914 search warrant. The amendment proposes to use material already in the possession of the department, as well as enabling other agencies to provide material obtained under a warrant, for certain visa and citizenship decisions. The amendment would not further extend coercive powers or administrative responsibilities, simply provide further information to administrative officers for more effective decision making. Schedule 6-procedural fairness requirements and removing redundant references Part1 of the sixth schedule to the bill will remove the current distinction between applications for visas that can be granted when the applicant is in the migration zone and which are subject to merits review by the MRT or the RRT, for which the act requires an opportunity to be given to the visa applicant to comment on certain adverse information before a decision to refuse can be made, and applications for other types of visas. The amendment addresses the finding of the High Court in the case of Saeedv Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2010] HCA 23 (Saeed) that although the act does not require an opportunity to comment to be given to applicants for visas not subject to MRT or RRT review, nevertheless there is a requirement under the common law to provide the visa applicant with an opportunity to comment before a decision can be made on the visa application. The Saeed decision means that procedural fairness must be given to all visa applicants. The only difference is whether the statutory or the common law procedural fairness requirements apply, depending on the visa applied for. The amendment therefore removes the current distinction between applications for visas. In other words, the amendment will ensure that the procedural fairness requirements prescribed in the act will apply universally to all visa applications and provide for greater consistency in decision making. Part2 of the sixth schedule to the bill will repeal provisions in the act which contain references to section 14 of the Electronic Transactions Act 1999 (the ET Act). These provisions have become redundant following the amendment to the ET Act in 2011 which restructured and renumbered provisions in the ET Act, and the subsequent amendment made in 2013 to the Electronic Transactions Regulations 2000. I commend the bill to the chamber. Debate adjourned. Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Repeal Bill 2014 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Morrison. Bill read a first time. Second Reading move: That this bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to repeal the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Act 2013 (ORA Act). The ORA Act seeks to regulate the employment of noncitizens working in the offshore resources industry by way of a visa arrangement, regardless of whether they are actually working on a resource installation or not. The amendments were introduced by the previous government in response to a Federal Court decision in May 2012 in a case that became known as the Allseas case. The Allseas case involved two vessels attaching gas pipelines to the seabed within Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone and the waters of the continental shelf. In its judgement the Federal Court ruled that noncitizens aboard the two vessels were not within the migration zone, and therefore not required to hold work visas. This was due to the fact that, as the offshore resources industry had maintained, both vessels fell within an exemption in the migration act that specifically provides that a vessel that is used or is to be used wholly or principally in manoeuvring a resources installation, or in operations relating to the attachment of a resources installation to the Australian seabed, is not a resources installation, and therefore not part of the migration zone. The offshore resources industry is vital to the Australian economy. Australia is the world's ninth largest energy producer, and the oil and gas industry accounts for 21/2 per cent of our GDP, generating $28 billion in revenue, and contributing $9 billion in direct tax payments. The development of Australia's offshore resources contributes significantly to the Australian economy and employs thousands of Australians. It is also critical for our future energy security, accounting for 58 per cent of Australia's primary energy needs. The offshore resources industry is a global industry, and competes for a limited pool of skilled labour. It employs a highly mobile workforce, and relies on the capacity to be able to transfer workers with specialist skills from project to project, and from one country to another country.",24,Abares 3 March 2013
9,Mr Morrison (Cook,"Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (09:39): IIf we are to continue to derive the substantial economic benefits that this industry provides, it must be allowed to remain internationally competitive and able to operate in line with international best practice. The industry should not be expected to operate under an increased regulatory burden, or additional cost pressures that would put the viability of current and future projects at risk. However, the ORA Act will do exactly that. This means that our migration arrangements must be relatively flexible, and not impose an undue administrative burden on industry, or create unnecessary barriers for overseas workers when they are genuinely needed, especially when their skills are unavailable in Australia. The issue of Australia's offshore maritime zones is highly complex. In addition to international conventions, the offshore resources industry is subject to complex and overlapping regulatory frameworks imposed by Commonwealth, state and territory legislation. We therefore need to consider any regulatory changes in this context very carefully, and to pursue considered and measured policies. A leading offshore resource industry group has said that: Australian jobs and our overall economic success relies on a confident, growing offshore oil and gas industry able to do business consistent with international laws and practices … With this much at stake, it is vital that sectional interests do not come before the national interest and that parliament delivers sustainable, proportionate and balanced regulation affecting offshore operations. The government could not agree more. Repealing this legislation does not mean that the industry is, or will be, in any way 'unregulated'. For example, noncitizens working on resource installations will still be required to hold valid visas. They will also still be required to hold the appropriate visa if they wish to come to the Australian mainland. Hence, if a particular employer wants to transfer their overseas workers to a project on the mainland, they must hold a visa with an appropriate work condition, such as the 457 visa. The ORA Act also fails to take into account the fact that many persons engaged on resource installations and vessels use fly-in fly-out arrangements, and frequently transit through an Australian airport, which requires them to hold a valid visa to be immigration cleared. Hence many of those persons who are not currently required to hold visas for the work they are doing on a vessel are still subject to immigration controls when they enter or leave Australia. To the extent that persons working in Australia's offshore maritime zones are subject to Australian domestic laws, these laws will still be policed and enforced by the appropriate authorities. Terms and conditions of employment, for example, will continue to be protected under domestic law, and where appropriate under international law through the Maritime Labour Convention. The National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority will continue to ensure the safety of those persons working on board resource installations and vessels operating in Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone and the waters of the continental shelf. It is also worth drawing attention to the actual number of workers who are the focus of the ORA Act. The previous government stated at the time the legislation was introduced that it had an 'incomplete picture' of the number of noncitizens working on board vessels who did not hold visas. While it is true that determining a precise number is difficult, consultation with the industry, the migration advice profession, and across government indicates that the number is actually relatively small. One estimate has put the total at no more than 2,000 persons per year, while others have put the number at considerably fewer than this. Fly-in fly-out arrangements mean that workers generally remain in Australia for relatively short periods of time, meaning that only a proportion of this 2,000 or so will actually be in Australia at any given time. When we compare this with the 68,000 overseas workers who were granted 457 visas during the last financial year, let alone with the number who are granted permanent visas each year under the Migration Programme, it becomes even clearer just how small the number really is. The government is committed to promoting the development of Australia's offshore resources, to adhering to Australia's international obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and to maintaining the integrity of Australia's borders. Repealing the ORA Act would remove an unnecessary and disproportionate legislative burden on an industry that is critical to Australia's future economic growth and the well-being of all Australians. I commend the bill to the chamber. Debate adjourned. Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Mental Health and Other Measures) Bill 2014 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Robert. Bill read a first time. Second Reading That this bill be now read a second time. TodayI present legislation to the House that will improve access to mental health services for current and former members of the ADF and their families. This bill will enhance the operation of the Veterans' Review Board and make other improvements to veterans' affairs services and administration. The bill reflects this government's commitment to recognising the unique nature of military service. Tackling mental health challenges for veterans and their families is one of the four pillars of our plan for veterans and their families. Two of the measures in the bill will strengthen mental health services through increased access to nonliability health care and the expansion of access to the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service, the VVCS. The government currently spends around $166 million a year on mental health services for veterans, members and their dependants. This expenditure is not capped; it is demand driven. It includes funding for online mental health information and support, GP services, psychologist and social work services, specialist psychiatric services, pharmaceuticals, PTSD programs and in-patient and outpatient hospital treatment.",29,Abares 3 March 2013
10,Mr Robert (Fadden,"Assistant Minister for Defence) (09:47): I move:The mental health measures in this bill will help build on existing support already available for veterans, members and their dependants. From1 July 2014, access to treatment under nonliability healthcare arrangements will be expanded to include diagnosed conditions of alcohol use disorder and substance use disorder, regardless of whether the condition is service related. From1 July 2014, eligibility for treatment under nonliability healthcare arrangements for members of the Defence Force with peacetime service only will be expanded by removing the current cut-off date of 7 April 1994. This means that all those with at least three years continuous full-time peacetime service will now also be eligible for non-liability health care for PTSD, anxiety and depressive disorders and alcohol and substance use disorders. Members who discharge before completing their three years continuous full-time service may also be eligible, where discharge is on the grounds of invalidity or physical or mental incapacity to perform duties. Veterans and members who have been unsuccessful in previous liability claims may be able to access mental health treatment under the expanded nonliability healthcare initiative. This means that treatment for the mental health conditions of PTSD, anxiety and depressive disorders and alcohol and substance use disorders will be available without the need for the condition to be accepted as related to the member's service. Mental health services for veterans, members and their families will be further improved through the expansion of the client groups eligible for counselling through the VVCS. From1 July 2014, current and serving members with certain peacetime service will be eligible for counselling through the specialised services of the VVCS. This includes border protection service, service in a disaster zone, either in Australia or overseas, service as a submariner and personnel involved in training accidents and members medically discharged. Access to counselling services from VVCS will also be extended to partners and their dependent children, up to the age of 26, of these newly eligible groups and to the partners, dependent children aged up to 26, and parents of members killed in service related incidents. It is recognised that military peacetime service has its own risks for exposure to traumatic events and impact on mental health. It is understood that early access to treatment can result in better outcomes for clients. Another significant measure in the bill will enhance the operation of the Veterans' Review Board, the VRB. The VRB provides merit reviews of decisions relating to disability and war widower pension, compensation and other entitlements under the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. The bill will introduce a legislative framework for alternative dispute resolution processes including conferencing and mediation. Additional improvements relating to case management, and the administrative and procedural practices of the board are expected to enable more effective management of the functions of the board. The 2011 Review of Military Compensation Arrangements recommended refining the appeal process under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act to the board and then to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as a means to a more timely, less complex, less costly review process. There is widespread support amongst the ex-service organisations for this change. The Department of Veterans' Affairs is working through the implementation implications for a single pathway in order to provide advice to the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission and the government. The changes proposed in this bill to prepare the way for a possible future single appeal process through the board. Some might view the changes in this bill as 'legalising' the board or turning the board into a replica of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I want to reassure the veteran community that that is not the case. These changes are designed to give the board more modern and efficient processes. They will enable the board to apply alternative dispute resolution mechanisms to resolve matters more quickly and satisfactorily so as to prevent the need for hearings in many cases. Alternative dispute resolution processes encourage early identification and clarification of the issues and for the gathering and consideration of the necessary evidence aimed at resolving the appeal at the earliest possible stage. It is important to stress that the commission delegate who made the primary decision will not be involved in alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. Where a matter goes to a hearing, the same informal and non-legalistic approach to hearings will continue, which I know is appreciated by many in the veteran community. There was extensive consultation with ex-service organisations in 2013 on these matters, and I am pleased that there is broad support for these reforms. There will be further ongoing discussions with the ex-service organisations on the implementation of these changes. Amendments to the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act will expand the circumstances under which an eligible young person is taken to be wholly dependent on a member. The expansion will include an eligible young person for whom the member is liable to pay child support. These eligible young persons will have the same wholly dependent status as an eligible young person who lives with a member. It should be noted that these situations are not exhaustive and other circumstances that meet wholly dependent status for an eligible young person will continue to be determined on a case-by-case basis. The bill will also act on the advice of the Department of Defence and make a technical amendment to an end date for a period of service in an operational area in schedule 2 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The amendment will not disadvantage any veteran as the change to the date will align the period of service for that operational area with the dates of the instruments of allotment for that operational area which are dictated by the Department of Defence. Further amendments to the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act will enable the chief executive of Comcare to be nominated for appointment to the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission. This measure rectifies the inadvertent disqualification in 2012 of the chief executive of Comcare from nomination for appointment to the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission. The amendments reinstate the original intention of the MRCA, that the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission be able to benefit from the expertise of a member with whole-of-government knowledge on workers compensation issues. Amendments relating to the Commonwealth seniors health card and seniors supplement will reduce the administrative burden on clients who travel overseas for more than six weeks. Currently, one of the eligibility requirements for seniors supplement requires the person to be the holder of a Commonwealth seniors health card. If that person travels overseas for more than six weeks, to regain eligibility for seniors supplement the person must reclaim the Commonwealth seniors health card, which requires a written claim and proof of the person's income details. The amendments will mean that card holders will be eligible for the seniors supplement on their return from overseas without needing to reclaim the Commonwealth seniors health card. This government is committed to reducing red tape and this measure will assist older Australians to access benefits from the Australian government. The measures in the bill will benefit veterans, members of our defence forces and the families of our military personnel. This is achieved by providing additional treatment and services for mental health conditions and support for mental well-being. Improvements to the operations of the Veterans' Review Board, including introducing a legislative framework for proven alternative dispute resolution processes and providing easier access to seniors supplement for Commonwealth seniors health card holders who travel overseas for more than six weeks will also be beneficial to the veteran community. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Tax Laws Amendment (2014 Measures No. 1) Bill 2014 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Ciobo. Bill read a first time. Second Reading That this bill be now read a second time.",31,Abares 3 March 2013
11,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (09:57): I move:This bill amends various taxation laws to implement a range of improvements to Australia's tax laws. Schedule1 will improve the Farm Management Deposit scheme by amending the Banking Act 1959 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Farm management deposits allow farmers to save some of their income in good years without it being taxed, and then withdraw it in leaner years and pay tax on it when their marginal tax rate is lower. They are a financial risk management tool to help farmers protect themselves against the large income fluctuations that are often typical of primary production. This legislation will make several improvements to the scheme to make it easier for farmers to use farm management deposits. First, farmers will be able to earn more income from non-primary production sources before they are prevented from creating new farm management deposits. The non-primary production income ceiling will be raised from $65,000 to $100,000. Second, individuals will be able to consolidate farm management deposits across financial institutions without adverse tax consequences. If a farmer chooses to combine multiple farm management deposits that they have held for at least 12 months into a single account, the amounts will not be included in their assessable income for that year, or affect their entitlement to make new farm management deposits in that year. Finally, farm management deposits will be excluded from the unclaimed money provisions in the Banking Act 1959, to ensure that these accounts, which are intended to facilitate long term savings, are not inadvertently paid to the Commonwealth as a result of a period of inactivity. Schedule2 to this bill amends the GST law to allow taxpayers to determine whether they are entitled to a refund by reference to objective conditions, rather than having to rely on the commissioner to exercise the discretion to refund an excess amount of GST. The measure provides additional clarity for entities which may have overpaid GST and are seeking to claim refunds. The measure also aims to prevent taxpayers from receiving a windfall gain of overpaid GST and encourages suppliers to refund their customers any overpaid GST. Schedule2 also addresses a gap in the existing law relating to refunds associated with miscalculations of GST payable on a supply. Recently the Federal Court found that the restriction on paying a refund does not apply where GST is overpaid because of a miscalculation. The amendments provide that the refund provisions apply to overpayments of GST, irrespective of whether the overpayment arises as a result of a mischaracterisation or miscalculation of the GST payable. The amendments apply only on a prospective basis from the date of commencement in order to minimise the uncertainty and compliance costs involved in the application of the amendments on a retrospective basis. Schedule2 also amends the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to give taxpayers review rights, both in relation to the commissioner's discretion to refund in exceptional circumstances, as well as to restore these rights under the existing refund provisions as a consequence of a recent decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Full details of these measures are contained in the explanatory memorandum. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Public Works Committee Approval of Work (10:00): I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of a new Australian High Commission in Nairobi, Kenya. As an important overseas mission in Africa, the Nairobi High Commission is significant in representation terms, as well as acting as a hub for Australia's interest in East, West and North Africa. In 2004-05 a global review of physical security at Australia's overseas missions was undertaken, which identified a number of high-risk chanceries, including the current mission in Nairobi. As well as providing appropriate physical security, this project will deliver a modern, functional chancery building to accommodate tenant agencies, as well as providing guardhouse, service building and recreational facilities all within a secure compound. The proposed new construction will ensure updated security measures and compliance with Australian standards, and work, health and safety requirements. The estimated cost of the proposal is $57.6 million and includes all construction costs, site preparation, infrastructure, management design fees, contingencies and escalation. The Public Works Committee has reported back to the House and the Senate on this project and recommends that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction of the major works package is forecast to commence in early 2016, with practical completion and occupancy in late 2018. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. Approval of Work (10:03): I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: CSIRO Australian Capital Territory Consolidation Project, Australian Capital Territory. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation proposes to consolidate its property holdings in the Australian Capital Territory by relocating staff from leased premises in Campbell, Yarralumla and Acton to the CSIRO site at Black Mountain. The Black Mountain site has an area of 37.3 hectares. The current dispersed layout reflects a legacy of earlier autonomous divisional structures, which are spread across a number of different buildings with replicated activity clusters.",34,Abares 3 March 2013
12,Mr Mccormack (Riverina,Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance),36,Committees
13,Mr Mccormack (Riverina,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance)The intent of the proposed consolidation project is to consolidate science, research and support facilities on the Black Mountain site. These new buildings will accommodate staff and functions which currently occupy buildings which have passed their effective design life and which do not meet current standards for health and safety. The buildings which are unsuitable for continued use will be demolished. The estimated cost of the project is $195.6 million plus GST, with the works to occur in two phases. In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed, subject to the recommendation that CSIRO continue to consult with its staff with a view to implementing measures to address staff concerns where this is warranted and feasible. I am advised that CSIRO accepts and will implement that recommendation. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in July 2014, with completion scheduled for March 2019. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. Approval of Work (10:05): I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: CSIRO Clayton property strategy, Clayton, Victoria. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation proposes to relocate its staff and research from Highett, Melbourne to its Clayton site adjacent to Monash University. CSIRO requires property to enable its specialised science capabilities. As such, CSIRO needs to ensure that all of its facilities are fit for purpose, support science, and provide facilities which attract leading researchers and scientists to CSIRO. This proposal includes the provision of a new building at North Clayton for science education and the Factories of the Future Innovation Centre. In addition, the new buildings will house the CSIRO science education centres currently located at Highett. The estimated cost of the proposal is $32 million plus GST and includes escalation costs, contingencies, all professional fees and authority charges. The Public Works Committee has reviewed the project and reported back to the House and Senate recommending that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is scheduled to commence in June 2014 and to be completed by December 2015. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee, under the leadership of Mrs Karen Andrews, the member for McPherson, for considering this project in such a timely manner and for its support for this project. With that, I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to.

15,Mr Mccormack (Riverina,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance)Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Reserve Bank of Australia, National Banknote Site, Craigieburn, Victoria. The Reserve Bank of Australia is the sole issuing authority for Australian banknotes. The key objective of the Reserve Bank in meeting this responsibility is to maintain public confidence in Australia's banknotes. The Reserve Bank has embarked on a program to upgrade the security of Australia's banknotes. The Next Generation Banknote project will progressively replace currently circulating banknotes over the next decade. The current storage, distribution and processing capacity of the Reserve Bank Sydney, Melbourne and Craigieburn sites is insufficient to enable the bank to store and issue the new series of banknotes and to accommodate banknote growth in the medium term. The Reserve Bank proposes to build a national banknote site on vacant land owned by the bank at Craigieburn in Victoria. The estimated cost of the proposal is $72 million, plus GST, and includes all construction costs, site preparation, infrastructure, management design fees, contingencies and escalation. The Public Works Committee has reviewed the project and reported back to the House and the Senate. In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that these projects proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, work is proposed to commence in early 2015 and to be fully operational in early 2017 to enable a transition to the Next Generation Banknote series and meet the banknote storage, distribution and processing operations for at least the next 25 years.

Standing Committee on Tax and Revenue Report and Revenue, I present the committee's report entitled: 2013 annual report of the Australian Taxation Office: first report, together with the minutes of proceedings. Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e). Committee on Tax and Revenue. The committee has hit the ground running with this report into tax administration. Firstly, I wish to note the achievements of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit in its previous inquiries into tax administration between 2007 and 2013. Simply put, we are building on the work of the Public Accounts Committee. We will have regular hearings with the Tax Office and other bodies such as its scrutineers. We will also work through issues with the Tax Office over a series of meetings to follow them through and ensure action is taken. This inquiry has come at an opportune time for the committee and for the tax office. The tax office has undergone significant change in senior management over the last two years.",37,Committees

18,Mr Alexander,"by leave-I am delighted to table the first report of the StandingNew leadership has brought new goals to the organisation. Commissioner Chris Jordan's aim of transforming the tax office into a contemporary service organisation is admirable and should be supported. I am optimistic about what can be achieved in simplifying the tax system through innovations such as pre-filing and streamlining the online process for those with uncomplicated affairs. It is pleasing to see the tax office looking overseas to countries like Norway and Denmark for examples of best practice and ways to improve the Australian system. Streamlining tax administration and how taxpayers engage with the system should be seen as a priority. It will be a focus of mine as chair of this committee. One of the areas we scrutinised was how the tax office estimates the tax gap-that is, the difference between what is actually collected and what should be collected. The tax office is consulting and conducting research to develop a position later in the year. I look forward to the tax office providing further information to the committee on this issue in the near future. One of the benefits of estimating the tax gap is that the tax office has a starting point for reducing it. Collecting more revenue more efficiently would be of benefit to all Australians. Separately, budget pressures appear to be the challenge to the commissioner's attempt to modernise the tax office. Budget reductions can deliver savings in the short term; however, this needs to be balanced against retaining the capacity necessary to achieve larger long-term benefits. Realising benefits in the future may require continued investment in the short term. The tax office's determination to prioritise revenue collection in the face of staff reductions should be commended. It should remain the priority of the tax office to collect revenues due within the absolute principle of fair treatment and respect to taxpayers. We covered many other topics in the hearing and the report. These include the recent capability review by the Public Service Commission, the internal review of disputes with the tax office and services for small businesses. I look forward to returning to these issues at our next hearing in August. Finally, I thank all witnesses, committee members and the secretariat for their help in the public hearing and preparing the report. I commend the report to the House. Electoral Matters Committee Reporting Date as Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on the committee's inquiry into the 2013 federal election and to present a copy of that statement. Leave granted. Committee on Electoral Matters that it was the committee's intention to report early-ahead of its full report-on the specific issues relating to the voting system used to elect senators. It is my intention to table out of session a report prior to the resumption of the 2014 budget sittings. The committee has conducted a number of public hearings and still has some more evidence to hear in coming weeks. Suggestions for reform have included changes to the Senate voting system as well as broader changes to party registration. Many of these issues have received widespread coverage since the September 2013 federal election.",38,Committees
19,Mr Tony Smith (Casey) (10:14,I seek leave of the House to make a short statement,39,Committees
20,Mr Tony Smith,"In FebruaryI informed the House on behalf of the Joint StandingOne issue that has come to greater public prominence since the election, particularly in recent days, is the fact that there are currently no requirements under the electoral act for candidates to be a resident of the state for which they are seeking election. For example, at the last federal election, Sex Party candidate Robbie Swan, a resident of the ACT, narrowly missed election for the Senate in Tasmania. Some reports state that in the Western Australian Senate election now being conducted 10 of the 77 candidates live in other states. Given that the Senate is a state's House, it is not surprising that most people would find this situation bizarre. The absence of a requirement to live in the state for which you are seeking to become a senator has not been an issue of note in the past, because political parties have had no difficulty finding members within each state to nominate and genuine independents have wanted to seek election in the state in which they live. While the committee has more work to do on a range of related matters before it is in a position to report back to the House, I do confirm that this matter will be dealt with in our early report on Senate voting. On this matter, as with some other features of our electoral system, status quo is not an option. I present a copy of my statement to the House. Consideration of Legislation motion standing in my name on the Notice Paper: That, in respect of the proceedings on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (Abolition) Bill 2013 [No. 2], so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the following from occurring: (1) at the conclusion of the second reading debate, not including a Minister speaking in reply, or at 12 noon on Thursday 27 March 2014, whichever is the earlier, a Minister being called to sum up the second reading debate and then without delay the immediate question before the House being put, then any question or questions necessary to complete the second reading stage of the bill to be put; (2) if the second reading of the bill has been agreed to and any message from the Governor General recommending an appropriation for the bill announced, the bill then being taken as a whole during consideration in detail stage, if required, for a period not exceeding 60 minutes, at which time any Government amendments that have been circulated in respect of the bill shall be treated as if they have been moved together with: (a) one question being put on all the Government amendments; (b) one question being put on any amendments which have been moved by non-Government Members; and (c) any further questions necessary to complete the remaining stages of the bill being put; and (3) any variation to this arrangement to be made only by a motion moved by a Minister. This is a debate management motion designed to ensure that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation bill can be dealt with today. This bill has already been through the House of Representatives once and rejected by the Senate. The government is keen to pass it through the House of Representatives today so it can get back into the Senate at the beginning of the next sitting period, in seven weeks. While I assume the opposition will not be pleased with this motion, I think that the number of speakers who have listed themselves for the debate is indicative of the fact that the House just wants to get on with it. And in the interests of",39,Committees

Now, the moment any legislation appears they are anxious to make sure that debate is shut down, and shut down immediately. The irony of all the comments about freedom of speech when one sees the way the Leader of the House actually manages the parliament is extraordinary. Given the outcome and what that will mean for later debate, I will also add that the reference the Leader of the House made to there not being a very large number of people who had listed themselves to speak is actually evidence as to why the gag was not appropriate and was not required in any way, shape or form. It is not necessary, should not occur but has become part of how the House is managed under this government. example of why, when a bill has been rejected by the Senate, the appropriate course for this House is to look at the reasons the Senate has rejected it. What would be seen if you looked at it in any depth is that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is actually working. On any rational assessment you would see-even if you believe that so-called direct action was the only way to go-that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is an organisation that is worth keeping. What came out during the course of the debates in the Senate was that by investing $536 million the CEFC has leveraged more than $1½ billion worth of additional investment. In other words, $500 million of public money has generated $2 billion of investment in clean and renewable energy. These are jobs and projects that are happening now. We have the Macarthur Wind Farm, we have Taralga Wind Farm, and we have various other solar projects happening, many of which are in Western Australia. And we have wind farms being developed in Portland. There are jobs that hang on this investment continuing. What is also clear from the Senate vote, and it is another reason we should not rush this through, is that regardless of how one thinks about the so-called carbon tax there is actually broad support across the political spectrum for keeping the CEFC. Conservative, Independent or other-party's senators actually voted at the end of last year to keep the CEFC. So the approach that should be taken is to go back to the drawing board and say, 'Perhaps we got it wrong on this. Perhaps this is actually an instance where co-investment of public money is driving the changes in the renewable energy sector that people have been calling on for a while now.' The gag is completely inappropriate. It is part of a worrying pattern that is developing with this government. It seems in Tony Abbott's parliament you have the right to be a bigot but not the right to scrutinise legislation. Yesterday there were 10,000 regulations being debated, with a gag motion that meant we had 1.7 seconds per regulation to debate it. The gag motion yesterday meant that no members of the crossbench were able to contribute to the debate. I suspect it is going to be exactly the same today. If this gag motion is passed, and we finish the debate at 12 o'clock, we are talking about getting rid of billions of dollars worth of investment with less than a couple of hours to debate it. If this government is committed to freedom of speech, and it is committed to transparency, and believes its policies will actually withstand some scrutiny, then they should not gag",40,Business

They made it clear. It was their, sort of, Liberal red-spot special: you can vote Liberal or you can vote Labor and you get the same deal; there is no difference. The Prime Minister, then the Leader of the Opposition, took it further-as he tends to do, as we saw yesterday. He said that no school would be worse off anywhere in Australia. This Prime Minister loves to use the word 'honour'. He said, 'We will honour the agreement.' Whenever this Prime Minister uses the word 'honour', we know it means that someone is about to get it in the neck. They said there was an 'absolute unity ticket' on education. The only unity ticket in this country that the Prime Minister is on is the unity ticket with Premier Colin Barnett to cut education funding. This Prime Minister goes to Western Australia; he is all things Western Australia; he is a 'Perth-onality'; he is your man in Western Australia; he is going to deliver education for Western Australia. But then he also says, showing his usual deft touch for the issues, 'I want to be like Colin Barnett. When I grow up and become a Prime Minister, I want to be like Premier Colin Barnett.' The only problem with that is that Colin Barnett is the education Premier from the Dark Ages. Only Liberals, who do not believe in education, would cut $183 million from the school system-350 teachers and 350 school assistants. You know that, when the Liberals come to town on education, it is time to start getting nervousvery nervous, indeed. When we look at how they say they will honour their promises, they have broken their promises on education like this: they said there would be a no-strings deal for all states. This is why we must suspend standing orders. What they are proposing to do is take hard-earned Commonwealth taxpayer money in the front door of the education system, or, for instance, Western Australia, and allow their cronies in the state government to take state money out of the system. The beauty of what Labor believe in education is that, if the Commonwealth is going to encourage greater funding in schools, we are not going to reward anti-education state jurisdictions to take money out of the system. That is not an increase; that is a cut. They also say that they are going to do exactly the same as us. Everyone in Australia who follows the education debate, which immediately eliminates half the gene pool on the other side of the parliamentary chamberAn opposition member: Only half? funding system that there would be five and six years of funding-not four. There would be a fifth year and a sixth year and, indeed, this budget needs to determine the funding for the fifth year.",43,Business
27,Mr Shorten,"All of them, yes. I meant that half of the chamber. We promised in ourIf you are going to be doing the same thing on education as what Labor was doing, you would have not four years or five years but six years of funding. Of course, those tricky shysters of education opposite us-those bargain basement short-changers of our children's future-recognise that they have promised a total of $2.8 billion in extra funding for schools across four years. We promised, in conjunction with requiring states to fund education, $14 billion. Now, of course, the Minister for Education glibly-as is his style-says, 'More money won't make schools better.' Come and visit poor schools around Australia. Only someone who was out of touch could say that to children who are not getting access to the language classes, the language labs or the music lessons. What is amazing about the government and their wrong priorities is they will not keep to the six years of funding and they will not require states to keep their funding. They are not committed to the student resource model. They have already made cuts in the Northern Territory, with $47 million worth of cuts and 130 teachers gone. In Western Australia, they have already made $183 million worth of cuts, with 700 educational professionals gone. What is amazing about the government is their wrong priorities. We have that clumsy Attorney-General Brandis, who must have some of the more intelligent members of the government slapping their heads. He will fight for the right for bigots to have speech; he just will not fight for schoolchildren to have speech lessons. In further considering why standing order should be suspended, we look at their other proposed wrong priorities. We have a government who are taking Australia backwards, not forwards. They have given new life to the term 'anachronistic'. I think it was the member for Chifley who said, as surely as knight follows dame, what we see here is education funding going backwards in this country. The Labor opposition is not greatly interested in the day-to-day travails of the government-their watering down of racism laws and hate laws. We are not greatly interested, frankly, in all their amazing kerfuffle about knights and dames. We are interested in what happens to the children of Australia. We are interested in what happens to the teachers in Australia. We are interested in what happens to the future of this country and where the good jobs come from. Australia can take either a high road or a low road in the future. That is why we have to suspend standing orders. We can decide to compete with the rest of the world by cutting wages, by cutting services and by lengthening the unemployment queues-and we can also compete by having the best honours list in the world. Or, alternatively, we can take the high road. We can be in competition with the rest of the world to have an educated workforce-a smart workforce. Who on earth in the government thought it was a good idea to cut trades training centres? I bet we will not find anyone. All they try and do is attack learning in this country. We also believe it is important, when it comes to our schools, that we give our kids the best start in life. There have been a lot of attacks by the government on the Gonski plan and on the efforts of Labor in terms of education. But when it came to them starting to rip up the unity ticket, boy oh boy, did they stick their hand in a pencil sharpener, watching the reaction of state governments who had deals! Yet again this government have the wrong priorities. They want to walk away from six years of education funding. Hello, over there: children do not stop existing after four years; they keep going and they have a right to have certainty in their schools. Quite often this government attack the teachers. They do not like the teachers' representation-'Teachers might be in a union; therefore, that is a reason to attack the education system.' Let me put on record why we think this government have the wrong priorities in education, why we think they should back our bill and why we should suspend standing orders. It is because our teachers put in a great deal of effort every day. There is a great deal of discussion about teachers from those opposite, who somehow think teachers have special conditions. Our teachers in this country are underpaid; they are not overpaid. Our teachers work harder than they get credit for from the government. They are not taking time off-as some in the government would have you believe. So there we have it, for members of this House of parliament: we should suspend standing orders, because we have a bill which will make sure that the Commonwealth does not just give money to the state with no strings attached. This bill does not cost a cent. All we are saying is that, if you are going to use scarce taxpayer dollars, make sure when you hand it to the states they do not take money out the back door and make sure that we have a commitment to a national approach in education and a properly funded student resource standard. We want to make sure this government keep their promises. There is no doubt, from what we have seen this week, that this is a government who struggles to keep its promises-certainly in education. The government will not tell us what is in its 'commission of cuts', because we know that that might damage its performance in the Senate election. There is nothing this government does which is not about politics first, politics second and politics third. That is why we should suspend standing orders. We on this side believe that education is too important to leave to the government alone, to mishandle. We cannot afford to waste three years of this government. The education of our children is too important. (Time expired) Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (10:46): I rise to second this motion. This is an important motion to suspend standing orders today to debate the Parliamentary Australian Education Amendment (School Funding Guarantee) Bill 2014. The Abbott government have been robbing the schoolchildren of Australia and they want to make it possible for the states and territories also to rob the schoolchildren of Australia. The whole purpose of the Gonski education reforms is to make sure that every school in Australia is a great school and that every child in Australia can get a great education. John Dewey said, 'What the best and wisest parent wants for his child is what everyone in society should want for all of our children.' That is what the Gonski education reforms are all aboutmaking sure that every child in every school has the education they deserve. We have to suspend standing orders today to debate this legislation because we need to make sure that the states are not ripping extra funding out of their state education budgetsthat, as the Commonwealth government tips a little bit extra into the top, the states are not ripping the funding out of the bottom of the system. Take Western Australia as just one example. Before the election, Western Australia was offered $920 million in extra school funding by the previous government, by our government-$920 million of extra funding for the schoolchildren of Western Australia. What did they get after the election? They got $120 million over four years. So $920 million over six years and $120 million over four years-a difference of $800 million. What does that mean this year in Western Australian schools? It means that, instead of being $400,000 better off on average in Western Australian schools this year, they are $135,000 worse off. Instead of getting more money in schools this year, they are getting less money in schools this year in Western Australia. There have been hundreds of job losses-teachers, teachers' aides, anaphylaxis education assistants, Aboriginal and Islander education officers. Teacher numbers have been frozen, even though there are 11,000 more students in the system this year. What does that mean? It means bigger class sizes and less individual attention for students. School support funding has been cut by 30 per cent. That means less funding for literacy and numeracy programs for kids, for behaviour management programs, for Indigenous students' needs, for kids with learning difficulties and for kids who have English as a second language. Before the election this government promised that they were on a unity ticket with Labor when it came to school education funding. Every day since then we have seen that promise broken-and broken in the worse possible way, in a way that robs the schoolchildren of Australia. The education deal that this minister opposite has proposed is a second-rate deal. It is a deal that provides less than a third of the funding that schools would have received under Labor's offer. It is a deal that gives only four years funding, not six. It is a deal that ignores the student resource standard. It is a deal that ignores the extra loadings for kids from a disadvantaged background, for kids with a disability, for kids who are Indigenous, for kids who have English as a second language and for kids who attend a remote or small school or are from a poor background. What is worse-and what we are trying to fix today with this piece of legislation-is that it allows the states to rob their own schoolchildren as well. Before the election we saw states that did not sign up to the Gonski education model, because they refused to put $1 in for every $2 they were being offered by the Commonwealth government. We have seen them refuse the extra funding-as Western Australia refused to accept $920 million of extra money for their schools. But, what is worse is that even the states that signed up to the deal have been given a nod and a wink as well-even those states that have now agreed that they would put in extra funding. Those teachers, those kids and those parents had a deal. They knew they were going to get extra funding for their schools. But, no, this education minister opposite has said with a nod and a wink to those state systems: 'You don't need to keep your word; we haven't kept our word as a federal government.' They have said, 'We're not going to keep our promise to fund schools extra, but you don't need to keep your promise either'-shameful! to speak on behalf of the government on this motion to suspend standing orders today. But I note that the Labor Party do not really have their heart in this motion; they are really just going through the motions on it. The shadow minister could not even be bothered being here. The shadow minister, the member for Adelaide, could not even be bothered being here for the debate. Ms Plibersek: Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. seat.

31,Mr Pyne,"I certainly will not be withdrawing the fact that the member for AdelaideMr Dreyfus: Bully the Deputy Speaker again! of the Opposition's speeches I made no interjections nor took any points of order. I would like to be treated with the same courtesy and I make the point again: if Labor really had their heart in this motion, the shadow minister would not be campaigning in Perth during a sitting week of the parliament-she would be here moving this motion. But of course the shadow minister knows that Labor does not really have their heart in this motion or in the bill because the shadow minister said only last week that Labor was not committed to years five and six of the Gonski funding model. She was asked about it by David Lipson on Sky News on three occasions on 18 March. David Lipson asked her, 'Will you take to the next election a promise to restore funding in years five and six for the Gonski education funding model?' The member for Adelaide said, 'Look, what we are focused on is the budget that is an eight weeks time.' Again David Lipson asker her, 'Will Labor commit to take that funding for years five and six to the next election?' This is what the member for Adelaide said, 'But David, it might not shock you to know this is not our election policy launch.' So Lipson tried asking a third time, 'Isn't it a bit hollow though to call on the government to do that if you are not committed to doing it yourself? The member for Adelaide responded, 'Well, obviously, we'll make a budget reply in a few weeks time.' So the reason the shadow minister is not hear to move this motion and to speak on it is that she knows Labor is not committed to years five and six of the Gonski funding model. She let the cat out of the bag last week. She has avoided this debate because she did not want to be embarrassed into saying things in the chamber that she knew would not be true when finally Labor releases a policy on the budget in the coming election campaign in 2½ years time. I can understand her embarrassment because it was the Leader of the Opposition who ripped $1.2 billion out of the school funding model in the economic statement of the former government before the election, which was confirmed in the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, and was published by the Treasury. So it was perfectly obvious that Labor was taking $1.2 billion out of the $2.8 billion that had been set aside for school funding over the next four years. When I became the Minister for Education, I was immediately presented with the situation in which the money put aside for the school funding model was $1.6 billion, not the promised $2.8 billion. This meant that Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland were all going to be short-changed that $1.2 billion of extra funding. The Labor members shake their heads but they know it is true. The shadow minister knows it is true and that is why she is not here. SoI set about finding that money, the $1.2 billion, to put back in to the school funding model. The irony is that it was the government and I who delivered the national school funding model across every state and territory, fully funded for the next four years, as promised to the Australian people before the election. Labor has turned up in the House today to move this motion, to pretend that somehow they would put the money into school funding, when they were the party who ripped $1.2 billion out. They ripped $1.2 billion out; we have put $1.2 billion in. We are the party that delivered the national school funding model. The sector knows it and they are very grateful. The only state government that is ripping money out of school funding is the South Australian Labor government which has cut $230 million from school funding over the next",47,Business
32,Mr Pyne,"You are the bully. During the Leader of the Opposition's and Deputy Leaderfour years. In the great state of Western Australia, they have increased their school funding by 7.1 per cent this financial year. In my great state of South Australia, they have actually taken $230 million out of school funding for the next four years, yet they have the gall to come in here and lecture us. I can understand why the Leader of the Opposition filled his speech with one-liners, as the Milton Berle of Australian politics, thinking he was hilarious. I must say that those one-liners got worse as his speech went on. The only one that was in the slightest bit amusing was 'Perth-onality'. Unfortunately he filled his speech with one-liners because he had nothing of any substance to say. This is the problem with Labor across the whole policy spectrum. Over the course of the sitting weeks this year we have seen Labor run a tactical campaign every day. Every day is about trying to be on the television news that night. I know that the member for Chisholm knows what I am saying is true because she has been around in this place and she should be on the front bench of the Labor Party. IfI had been on the caucus, I would have voted for the member for Chisholm-I can tell you that right now. She knows about tactics in this place. She knows that you have to have substance to present to the Australian public, at election time, a suite of policies that you genuinely believe will be better for the country-which is what we did for the four years when the current Prime Minister was Leader of the Opposition, leading to two elections. We showed the substance required to take the Treasury benches. Labor has every day run a tactical campaign just like the motion they have moved today. I was happy for them to debate it because the coalition is on very strong ground when it comes to school funding. Not only did we put the $1.2 billion into the school funding model, not only did I deliver the national school funding model, but also we are moving to do the other things that are very important to the outcomes for students-getting the curriculum right, so we can have a national review of the Australian Curriculum, to make sure that what we are teaching young people in our schools is useful for them and is going to expand their knowledge so that when they leave school they will be able to take on a career of their choice. We are expanding independent public schools across Australia. The Western Australian model is a very good model. I know that yesterday the Minister for Education in New South Wales, Adrian Piccoli, was praising the role he has played in introducing school autonomy across New South Wales. The Northern Territory is following suit. Queensland is following suit. Victoria already has a high level of school autonomy. Everyone knows in education and all the research indicates that, the more autonomy in a school, the higher the expectations put on students by parents, by teachers and by the principals. The more autonomy there is in a school, the better are the outcomes for students. We have a deep and abiding passion for independent public schools. We have put $70 million into a fund to ensure that independent public schools can be rolled out around Australia. We are also focusing like a laser beam on teacher quality. If the shadow minister and the Labor Party actually researched education in Australia, they would know that the PISA results published by the OECD in December last year said-and they have routinely said this-that the overwhelming factor in Australia that indicated the success or otherwise of our school students was the classroom they were allocated to in a school. Nothing could give you more indication of the fact that teacher quality is the most important factor in schooling than knowing that, in eight out of the 10 reasons that affect a student's outcome at school, the OECD said it was the classroom to which a student was allocated-in other words, the teacher to whom they were allocated in a school. They did not say it was socioeconomic status or school autonomy; they said that one out of 10 reasons was their SES background, one out of 10 reasons was other factors and eight out of 10 reasons for the success of a student was the teacher to whom they were allocated. That is why we on this side of the House want to give the professional development that is necessary for the existing teacher cohort across Australia to reach their best selves. We are also reviewing teacher education across the universities in Australia so we can produce the best new teachers possible in our schools, because this is the area where we have the most influence as a Commonwealth government. Of course we will not be supporting this motion, but we are pleased to have the opportunity to talk about our program. standing orders as moved by the Leader of the Opposition. The House divided.

Australian National Audit Office: Norfolk Island Financial Statements (11:13): by leave-TodayI table the Australian National Audit Office's (ANAO's) audit of the financial statements of the Norfolk Island Administration. The results of the audit are troubling and clearly show the scale of the challenges facing the Norfolk Island government. Like any remote community, maintaining infrastructure and generating job opportunities has its challenges. However, these challenges on Norfolk Island",50,Business
34,Mr Briggs (Mayo,"Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development)are exemplified by a unique set of governance arrangements laid out in the Norfolk Island Act 1979. Norfolk Island is Australia's only self-governing external territory and the only place in Australia where residents do not participate in the Australian taxation system and do not receive social security benefits. In fact, there is almost a complete absence of social services and a basic safety net which could protect the most vulnerable. Over the last four decades there has been a plethora of reviews and reports looking at these arrangements, including a royal commission conducted in 1976, 12 separate parliamentary inquiries, and the commissioning of more than 20 reports from experts in various fields including outgoing reports from former administrators. All of these reviews, reports and audits have been unanimous in recommending significant changes and reforms. In spite of this, as the ANAO findings I table today show, there has been very little progress in addressing the fundamental issues facing Norfolk Island. In fact the situation has deteriorated and the challenges are increasingly more difficult. The ANAO has now forecast unfunded budget deficits for the Norfolk Island government in future years of between $7.4 million and $7.8 million. The ANAO has also found there is a lack of proper financial controls and poor financial management practices in the Norfolk Island administration, and has concluded that without further Commonwealth support, the administration is not a 'going concern'. These issues identified by the ANAO are long standing, and I am not the first minister to stand in this chamber and talk about the problems facing Norfolk Island, but these problems are becoming more critical as deficits increase and essential infrastructure on the island further deteriorates. I recently visited Norfolk Island, where I was able to spend some time with the Norfolk Island government, the legislative assembly and community leaders. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Administrator of Norfolk Island, Neil Pope, for his generous hospitality during my visit. I would like to thank him for his work over the last two years as the Administrator. Unfortunately-I say that very genuinely-he has decided not to stay on as the Administrator and will return home to Victoria at the end of June. He will be a huge loss to the island, and I wish him and his wife, Jen, all the best for the future. The visit was an opportunity to hear first hand about the significant and ongoing challenges the island faces. I was also able to see the island's infrastructure. Simply, it is dated, run down and fragile. There has been no significant infrastructure investment since the 1970s and the Norfolk Island government has not had the capacity to maintain much of what was built then either. The island's hospital is outdated. The roads are deteriorating. Broadband services are poor. And the island's electricity network is extremely fragile and at risk of collapse. Electricity costs on the island are very high, but the money raised through utility charges is not invested in the network but rather used to cross-subsidise other activities of the Norfolk Island government. Previous attempts by the Norfolk Island government to reduce reliance on imported diesel by promoting solar have achieved a high take-up of solar panels. But the surplus electricity now produced places the ageing network at risk of overload, exacerbating existing technical problems, and increasing the risk of system failure. While many communities across Australia have infrastructure needs, the inability of Norfolk Island to access funding programs such as Roads to Recovery, equalisation payments, and local government financial assistance grants have made the infrastructure backlog much more severe than for comparable remote communities across Australia. If something is not done, the Norfolk Island community will be increasingly at the mercy of events, with the chance that a future crisis or even simple neglect could push essential infrastructure past breaking point. This could have very severe consequences for the Norfolk Island community, leading to the point where the welfare of residents and even the ongoing viability of the Norfolk Island economy are placed at risk. It is clear that the problems facing Norfolk Island are getting worse, the financial position of the island is deteriorating, and the population continues to decline. The lack of progress is disappointing, but it also shows the difficulty of achieving real improvements in this area and the challenges of maintaining a sustainable model of self government for a remote population of less than 2,000 people. As disappointing as it is that long-term reforms have not taken place, I acknowledge that previous Australian governments have taken a number of steps to help the Norfolk Island government and community, including:  The provision of emergency financial assistance to the Norfolk Island government on an annual basis; and  ensuring certainty for the tourism industry by underwriting the airline services to the island. The Australian government has also been working with the Norfolk Island government to introduce public sector and immigration reforms as well as land valuations ahead of the introduction of municipal rates on the island. However, progress on even these modest reforms has been slow and the Norfolk Island government seems to lack the capability to address many of the key sustainability issues facing the island. The Australian government has also made funds available to construct a waste management facility as well as to extend the Cascade Jetty on the island. Extending the Cascade Jetty will be a significant investment that will reduce the freight costs and increase revenue opportunities for Norfolk Island, as additional tourists will be able to visit. As important as these initiatives are, they will take time to pay dividends, and there is still important work that the Norfolk Island government can and must do to help tackle some of the issues facing the island. Members will be aware that the Australian government has an election commitment, made by the member for Stirling, prior to the election, to integrate Norfolk Island with the mainland taxation and social security systems. As a point of principle, the Australian government believes that Australians should be treated the same, no matter where they live. That is why the Australian government remains determined to implement our election commitment, as made by the member for Stirling. But let me make this clear: we will not be introducing Australian welfare benefits without the obligations of the Australian taxation system. The Prime Minister has asked me to develop a discussion paper on possible reform options, including governance reform and plans to extend mainland taxation and social security systems. In the coming weeks, I will be talking to my ministerial colleagues and the wider community about the best way to take this forward. To help frame our policy direction, I have written to all residents on the island seeking their views on how best to deliver essential services and the best governance model for the future of the island. I must say that I have been impressed with the level of responses I have received to date. I can say that the correspondence reflects a strong mood for reform. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of those who have already written to me. The feedback is very important and will assist in forming government policy going forward. I am pleased that, while I was on Norfolk Island, the Norfolk Island government indicated its commitment to reform as well. This shared commitment will be important, as there is no doubt that this reform process will be complex and challenging for the Norfolk Island community, particularly in the adjustment to mainland taxation and social security systems. Businesses and individuals on Norfolk Island will need to adopt new record-keeping practices, comply with various legislative and regulatory requirements and disclose personal information such as income and assets to a government, for the very first time. As challenging as these reforms will be, they are important for the future of the Norfolk Island community. While the costs of addressing the problems facing Norfolk Island may seem significant; the costs of not acting are even greater. If a single parent on Norfolk Island needs family tax benefit payments to make ends meet, or if a person with a disability needs to receive the disability support pension, or if an elderly person needs to buy medicines that are unaffordable without the PBS, they must currently leave their support networks and community and move to the mainland, often at great personal expense. Australian citizens living on Norfolk Island are not eligible for Medicare, and Australians visiting Norfolk Island cannot use their Medicare card if they need to access medical services. In fact, Australians on Norfolk Island have to pay much more for public health services than on the mainland and the health fund operated by the Norfolk Island government is based on a flat levy, which hits low-income earners especially hard. For instance, a recent report on child and family services on Norfolk Island found that a family of four needs to spend almost $4,000 each year before the island's health insurance scheme starts to assist them and even then the scheme does not cover the full costs of some treatment. The Norfolk Island government recently announced an increase of more than 50 per cent to its health levy, which will drive up these expenses even further. While the Commonwealth is assisting the hospital to gain accreditation against the Australian Council of Healthcare Standards, several recent reviews have highlighted a fundamental disconnect between the services currently being delivered and the needs of the community. Issues with broadband access have also limited the opportunities to consult with mainland specialists in the event of an emergency. Extending the social security system will support Australians on Norfolk Island and allow them to continue to live and reside in their community throughout major life events. While integration with the mainland taxation and social security systems will assist and support the most vulnerable in the Norfolk Island community, it will not, of itself, guarantee the sustainability of Norfolk Island and its government, or fix all the service delivery issues on the island. The fact is that no other remote community of less than 2,000 people has to deliver complex national-level services including customs, immigration and quarantine. Therefore, as part of the reform work, the government will also be considering looking at changes to the governance arrangements for Norfolk Island. I appreciate the fact that many Norfolk Islanders have a strong connection to their history and their culture, as do many Australians, but the reality is that they are Australians and they will be treated as such. While I am fully aware that the problems outlined here are not new, and many promises to introduce reforms have been made in the past, I would like to assure Norfolk Island residents that this government intends to put Norfolk Island on a more sustainable footing. Despite the challenges, I am optimistic about the future of this special part of Australia. I have seen first hand its natural beauty and experienced the warmth and hospitality of its people. It is etched in Australian settlement history and remains integral to our country. If we can take the time to get the policy settings right, then I think the island will have a bright and prosperous future. I present the following document: The Australian National Audit Office independent report of Norfolk Island's financial statements 2012-13-ministerial statement, 27 March 2014. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Lingiari to speak for 13 minutes. Leave granted. That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Snowdon speaking for a period not exceeding 13 minutes. Question agreed to. and Regional Development for his statement on the governance and finances of Norfolk Island and say that we agree with the direction in which the government is heading. My friend the member for Canberra is sitting alongside me because she is evidence of the support that exists across the chamber for the changes the minister has indicated. Norfolk Island is a very important place in our national story and will always be emblematic of our nation's history. But this is an opportunity, as the minister has rightly pointed out, for us to determine a new future, a new pathway, for that community. The report from the Australian National Audit Office is salutary reading. We need to be very concerned about what it has indicated to us. Paragraph 1.3 of this report says that the administration of Norfolk Island has forecast significant negative cash flows from operations to total $7.4 million in 2014-15, $7.4 million in 2015-16 and $7.8 million in 2016-17. It says: The Commonwealth of Australia's funding commitments to the Administrationof Norfolk Islandends at 30 June 2014 and as at the date of signing these financial statements, no further financial assistance to the Administration has been negotiated. The report indicates that 'these conditions give rise to a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt' upon the administration's ability to continue as a going concern, and 'in the event that the administration of Norfolk Island does not obtain additional funding from the Commonwealth of Australia and/or reduce expenditure in line with available revenue' the administration may not be able to continue its operations as a going concern. That is the nub of the problem. The issues of governance and finances have been vexed issues for over four decades, as the minister rightly pointed out. I have had the great fortune of visiting Norfolk",51,Ministerial Statements

36,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari) (11:26,"I commend the Assistant Minister for InfrastructureIsland on a number of occasions, in the early 1990s in particular, in an endeavour to advance some of the changes which we are talking about this morning. The minister mentioned that in many remote communities-and Norfolk Island is remote-maintaining infrastructure and general job opportunities has its challenges. The population, although now 2,000, is declining, which is an issue of significant concern. As an example, in the year August 2011 to September 2012, about 25 per cent of the male population aged between 25 and 50 had left the island and the overall population dropped by 9.4 per cent. The minister referred to the issues dealing with social services and the requirement for a basic safety net which could protect the vulnerable. Last year, there were reports of people getting by on charity parcels and shooting wild chickens-that is not what Australia should be about As he rightly pointed out, there have been 12 parliamentary inquires on this issue and more than 20 reports have been commissioned from experts in various fields. On2 March 2011 the Norfolk Island Road Map was agreed upon between Simon Crean, the then Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, and the Hon. David Buffett, Chief Minister of the Norfolk Island government. The Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories tabled its Report of the visit to Norfolk Island 29-30 April 2013, and on 5 June 2013 noted: Since the passage of the Territories Law Reform Act 2010, four funding agreements have been made between the Australian and Norfolk Island Governments. These agreements have seen the Commonwealth grant specified funds for specified purposes to the Norfolk Island Government in order to allow the Norfolk Island Government to continue to provide essential services to the community. $3.829m was granted in December 2010, $5.629m in April 2011, $2.9m in September 2011 and $4.5 million in December 2012. In each case, the funding was tied to stipulated conditions for the reform of governance or finances under the Territories Law Reform Act 2010 or the Norfolk Island Road Map. Those of us in this place who have had any experience of Norfolk Island know of the need for change. You very rightly pointed out, Minister: It is clear that the problems facing Norfolk Island are getting worse, the financial position of the island is deteriorating, and the population continues to decline. You further said in your speech, Members will be aware that the Australian government has an election commitment … to integrate Norfolk Island with the mainland taxation and social security systems. We absolutely concur, and we are determined to assist you in that process. You have rightly pointed out that the Australian government will not be introducing welfare benefits without the obligation of the Australian taxation system, and we concur with your position. We also concur with your observation that Australians should be treated the same, no matter where they live. We support the development of a discussion paper, but I think those of us on this side of the chamber with experience of Norfolk Island, which we have had over many years, would say to you: let us expedite this process. We are very supportive of your communications with the Norfolk Island community and interaction with the community residents, because clearly they have got to be partners in this process. I am sure the member for Canberra and I can attest to the strong feeling of support for change. No longer can we be stuck in the ideas of Queen Victoria. They are no longer relevant, despite what the Prime Minister might think from time to time. It is very important that we actually address the needs of the community on Norfolk Island. Your observations and the examples that you provided about those people who are missing out are salutary reminders of what we need to do in this place as parliamentarians to make sure all Australians are treated fairly and equally. CanI again say to the minister that we on this side of the House want to work with you in a bipartisan way to get the best possible outcome for the people of Norfolk Island. Clean Energy Finance Corporation (Abolition) Bill 2013 [No. 2] Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Clean Energy Finance Corporation (Abolition) Bill 2013 [No. 2]-a very important bill which was not able to be debated last time the package of changes to the clean energy system were before this House, because it was part of a cognate debate concerning 11 bills. This really does fly in the face all of this government's protestations of being an open and transparent government. After meandering through the address-in-reply debate for who knows how long, we now have 27 minutes for a full parliamentary debate on a very important piece of legislation. This is a critically important part of the former government's clean energy package to deal with the challenge of climate change. Had we had more time to debate this important piece of legislation there would have been an opportunity, I suspect, for a number of members of this place to make some contributions about developments in climate change policy since that policy area was last debated by the House of Representatives, before Christmas. The developments have been significant: more and more scientific reports confirm the need for strong and sensible action, and there have been important developments in the relationship between the United States and China, seeking to drive global momentum for an ambitious global compact in Paris next year. All of this goes very squarely to the question of whether the Clean Energy Finance Corporation should be maintained in place. Yesterday the Senate Standing Committee on Environment and Communications delivered a report on their inquiry into the government's alternative policy proposition, known as Direct Action, which confirmed the consensus that had emerged from the four years of the life of Direct Action-that it is a policy hopelessly inadequate to achieve even the commitment to carbon pollution reduction that Australia has signed up to and that it is based on contested methodologies, particularly soil carbon, which does have significant potential in the future but which the CSIRO again confirmed, in the context of this Senate inquiry, is still unable to deliver anywhere near the abatement that the minister and its supporters have argued for so long. The Senate inquiry heard much evidence that confirms very serious doubts about whether Direct Action can avoid taxpayer dollars being handed over to support things that were going to happen anyway. The question of additionality has still not been addressed at all adequately",55,Ministerial Statements
37,Mr Butler (Port Adelaide) (11:33,"We now have 27 minutes available to debate theby the new government, and we heard only last week from two very esteemed economists, Ross Garnaut and former Treasury secretary, Dr Ken Henry, that there is no way that this policy will come anywhere near the minimum commitment Australia has made to reduce carbon pollution at anywhere near the budget that has been allocated. Instead, it would likely involve the transfer of $4 billion to $5 billion of taxpayers' money to the large polluters every single year of the life of Direct Action policy. There was consensus before the release of Direct Action, but there is an even stronger consensus now emerging that the best response to climate change rests on two pillars. Firstly, the pillar of an emissions trading scheme-which the government and the Greens party combined to defeat in the Senate last week-which puts in place a legal limit on carbon pollution, which reduces over time but lets business work out the cheapest and most effective way to operate within that limit. Secondly, a renewable energy target to drive the transition of our electricity sector particularly, from one that relied very heavily on methods that produced significant quantities of carbon pollution to cleaner methods and cleaner technologies. This is accepted around the world as the best approach to dealing with climate change-an emissions trading scheme and a renewable energy target. Ken Henry, in that same interview on 7.30 last week where he backed in Ross Garnaut's estimate that Direct Action will cost taxpayers $4 billion to $5 billion each and every year of its life, also said, 'Reducing Australia's carbon emissions through any mechanism other than an emissions trading scheme will necessarily be more damaging to the Australian economy.' As I said, the renewable energy target's job is to transform Australia's electricity sector. That is the job the renewable energy target in dozens and dozens of other countriesdeveloped and developing-has around the world. The electricity sector, power generation in particular, is the largest contributor to carbon pollution in Australia by a fair distance. About 33 per cent-so about a third-of all Australia's carbon pollution is produced by electricity generation. Another 17 per cent of Australia's carbon pollution is produced by stationary energy produced generally at manufacturing plants, so about half of Australia's carbon pollution comes from the production of energy. As everyone in this place and beyond knows, Australia has traditionally relied very heavily on fossil fuels-particularly on coal-for the generation of its power, which is why Australia has traditionally had a much higher level of carbon pollution from the electricity sector than many other nations. The renewable energy target has been a bipartisan policy area for well over a decade. After all, it was the Howard government, to their credit, who introduced the first mandatory renewable energy target in 2001, and the architecture of that scheme-modest as it was in terms of its quantum-is still in place and was built on by the former government. The architecture involves a target that builds on existing renewable energy that existed before the introduction of the target in 2001. Renewable energy that existed as at 1997, which was largely hydro-electricity from the Snowy Mountains Scheme and also down in Tasmania, was about 15,000 gigawatt hours, or 15 terawatt hours. The target introduced by the Howard government in 2001 involved an additional 9,500 gigawatt hours being added to Australia's renewable electricity capacity by 2010. Importantly, that target was not expressed as a percentage of the overall electricity generation from year to year; it was expressed as an actual generation figure-9,500 gigawatt hours. In 2003, the former conservative senator from the Northern Territory Grant Tambling conducted a review of the renewable energy target called the Tambling Review, which dealt with this question among many others. On the question of whether the target should be expressed as a percentage of electricity generation or as an actual generation figure, the review said: The Review Panel considers that a fixed target is more compatible with market certainty, rather than a percentage of a fluctuating electricity market over which the industry has no control. As people who follow this debate would know, it is obviously something that is very much in the mix as the government considers whether or not to jettison its very clear election commitments around the renewable energy target and take a position that is more in keeping with the target's opponents. Needless to say, the MRET-the mandatory renewable energy target-of the Howard government was successful. By 2007, three years before its target date, the 9,500 additional gigawatt hours from renewable sources had been achieved. After the Labor Party came to government in 2007, we set about putting in place a system that would allow us to deliver our election commitment that at least 20 per cent of Australia's electricity generation would come from renewable sources by 2020. In 2009, the renewable energy target was expanded from 9,500 gigawatt hours, on top of the capacity that existed in 1997, to 45,000 gigawatt hours, almost quintupling the target that had been put in place by the Howard government. So 45 terawatt hours became the renewable energy target by 2020. In 2011, for a range of reasons I will not go into here for the sake of time, that target was split into two different targets: the large-scale target-big wind farms, big solar farms and the like-which had a target of 41 terawatt hours, or 41,000 gigawatt hours; and the small-scale target of 4 terawatt hours, which is essentially driven by solar water heaters and PV solar panels being put on people's household roofs. In addition to that very significant quantum change by our government, a number of other changes were also made. Firstly, some exemptions were put in place that did not exist under the Howard scheme for emissionsintensive trade-exposed industries. About two-thirds of those exemptions go to the aluminium industry-which, as people would know, is a very significant consumer of electricityensuring that the renewable energy target that was put in place would transform our electricity sector in a way that would not place sectors like the aluminium sector at a competitive disadvantage. The second change we made to the system was to introduce some support agencies, in particular the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, or ARENA, which is tasked with supporting emerging technologies like geothermal energy, hot rock technology or utility-scale solar thermal technology-which, I think all would agree, has still not got off the ground. The second agency we introduced was the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and I will come to that in due course. On any measure from 2001, but particularly following the acceleration put in place in 2009, Australia's renewable energy policy has been a resounding success. During our term in government, wind power generation in Australia tripled in six short years. When we came to government about 7,400 households in Australia had PV solar panels on their roofs; when we left government that figure was closer to 1.1 million-delivering cleaner energy to Australian communities and also, importantly, delivering vastly lower power bills to those households. And households in their thousands every fortnight continue to put PV solar panels on their roofs. Australia started to move into the position of a world leader in renewable technology. A country that had relied so heavily in its past on fossil fuel electricity generation started to move into that refined group of world leaders in renewable technology. Last year I had the pleasure of participating in the launch of the largest wind farm project in the Southern Hemisphere-the Macarthur wind farm, supported by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Also last year Australia launched the largest PV solar farm in the Southern Hemisphere-as a clear world leader in this area. This drove very significant investment. It is estimated that about $18½ billion in investment has taken place since the Howard government introduced the MRET in 2001. About $10 billion of that has gone into the large-scale sector, and about $8 billion of investment has gone into PV solar panels and solar water heaters on the roofs of Australian households-hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Australian households. And it is forecast that if the existing policy parameters are kept in place, including agencies like the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and ARENA, then another $18.7 billion of investment will take place between now and 2020. All this is, of course, now on hold-partly because of the decision by this government to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the decision of this government to strip about $434 million in funding from ARENA, despite having indicated, before the election, a bipartisan support for the work of that agency and, perhaps most importantly, because of all the speculation encouraged by unnamed conservative or Liberal and National Party MPs. They have been going to the newspaper saying that the review that was put in place in place, in contravention of the provisions of the Climate Change Authority legislation, is all a precursor to killing the Renewable Energy Target-to use the phraseology of some Liberal Party MPs, who of course do not put their name to these articles in the newspapers but speak on background. All of this investment is now on hold. Every three months Ernst& Young publishes a renewable energy country attractiveness index-a worldwide index that tracks investment in renewable or clean energy all around the world. It is a very highly regarded document that comes out every quarter and was released only a few weeks ago, in February 2014. This document demonstrates how seriously this is viewed by investors around the world. By mid-2013, because of the suite of policies I have talked about, Australia moved into fourth place on that index-fourth place around the world as an attractive place to make renewable energy investment, after the United States, China and Germany, which are universally regarded as the world leaders in clean energy or renewable energy. By November, after the election of this government, we had slipped to sixth, and by February we slipped to eighth place. In the February document-a substantial document in terms of its length-we appeared under the heading, 'What's bad about investment in renewable energy around the world'. That document, on page 5, says: Australia also continues its fall from grace, dropping two places to eighth position. Government measures to scrap carbon pricing and clean energy funding are derailing progress towards an economically viable renewables market. The investment I have talked about has brought thousands and thousands of jobs. We talk a lot in this place about jobs, for very good reason: they are central to our prosperity and to our opportunity in the future. It is estimated that over our term of government-six years-the number of jobs in the renewable energy sector tripled to more than 24,000 by the end of 2012. Most of those were involved in the rooftop PV solar part of the industry, but we also have seen jobs in manufacturing-for example, in manufacturing wind towers from BlueScope Steel that have been put in place in many different regional communities across Australia. And it would be no surprise to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Broadbent, that as a result of the investment uncertainty created by this government there are very significant forecasts of job losses in this sector if the speculation around this government's renewable energy policies ends up being true. Importantly, though, the other success from the suite of renewable energy policies, of which the Clean Energy Finance Corporation policy is just one, has been that they have driven down carbon pollution from the largest source of carbon pollution in Australia, namely electricity generation. Over the last five or six years we have seen, for the first time in any of our lifetimes-for the first time since World War II-that electricity output, or electricity demand, has started to reduce. It does require some attention to work out what part of the reduction in carbon pollution is due to the fact that Australia is just generally using less electricity and what part is due to the fact that our electricity mix is becoming cleaner. Electricity generation in Australia peaked in around 2008, and in the national electricity market-which covers the eastern states and South Australia and Tasmania-the electricity market's peaking in 2008 has reduced its output by about seven per cent in the five years since. But the carbon pollution-the emissions produced from the electricity market-have reduced by 16 per cent, and demand is down by seven per cent. That difference was even starker in the first year of the carbon price mechanism-2012-13. In that 12-month period the carbon pollution produced by the national electricity market reduced by about seven per cent. A third of that was due to a drop in demand, but fully two-thirds was due to a shift from polluting sources of electricity generation, particularly black and brown coal, to cleaner energy sources. In that 12 month period the renewable energy sector increased its share of the National Electricity Market by a full 25 per cent. In states like South Australia that shift has been even faster. In those five years carbon pollution in South Australia that is produced by electricity has reduced by 25 per cent as wind power in particular has substituted for coal powered electricity generation. All of this makes the attacks-many of them from unnamed sources in newspapers-on the renewable energy policies of Australia, which have had been bipartisan for four previous elections, so mind-boggling. A very clear bipartisan commitment was given by the relevant parliamentary secretary, Senator Birmingham, only a week or two before the election in September 2013. They said they would not only respect the broad policy-the 20 per cent by 2020 aspiration-but that an Abbott government would also abide by the 41,000 gigawatthour target that is set out in the renewable energy legislation. It was a clear commitment, not just to the broad idea of a 20 per cent target, but it was a clear commitment to that quantum figure that Grant Tambling said was so important for market certainty. We have since seen the unnamed backgrounding from Liberal Party MPs that they are going to kill the Renewable Energy Target. We have also seen, in a number of interviews with Alan Jones, the Prime Minister start to crab walk away from the commitment that was so clearly and definitively given by Senator Birmingham only a couple of weeks before the election. The Prime Minister, in a tried and true method, has started to try to create a scare campaign around power prices. The Prime Minister said to Alan Jones that the Renewable Energy Target is: … significantly driving up power prices right now. That just flies in the face of any of the evidence from all of the state regulatory agencies that set the allowable power prices by generators and retailers. It also flies in the face of all of the reports from the Australian Electricity Market Commission, an independent agency. For example, in South Australia it is quite clear from the regulatory reports that the Renewable Energy Target, the large scale one, counts for about 1.4 per cent of the average power bill, and it is dropping. So it is about 40 cents per week, and it is dropping. In New South Wales it accounts for about 1.9 per cent of the average household bill, or 80 cents a week, and that is dropping as well. The point has been made that this determination by IPART in New South Wales was based on a certificate price, an LGC price, of $51 per megawatt hour. It is quite clear that those certificates are being trades for far less than $51 per megawatt hour. Generally it is around $40, and most recently-particularly because of the policy uncertainty in this area-less than $30. So even that small impost is a result of the regulatory agency overstating the price that retailers would have to pay for these Renewable Energy Certificates. In Queensland the QCA, the Queensland Competition Authority, which sets prices in that jurisdiction, has found that the large scale Renewable Energy Target accounts for about 40 cents per week, and is also dropping. This flies in the face of the Prime Minister's attempt to launch yet another scare campaign against households and their power prices. The CEFC plays a very important role her. In the words of its mandate they help with: … mobilising investment in renewable energy, low-emissions and energy efficiency projects and technologies. The question is often asked of me, and I am sure of other members in this place, why it is that we need a government backed investment or financing vehicle? Why can the private banks not finance these projects, if they are worthy? I encourage members of the House-and members of the community who have a deep interest in this area-to have a look at some of the evidence on this point. Have a look at some of the evidence to the Senate inquiry, whose report was released last night. For example, Mr Buckley, from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, told the committee, as stated on page 60 of the report: … the CEFC is meant to lead the way, to pave the way for new technologies for deployment in the Australian market to show that they are financially viable. In a regulatory framework that works, that makes entire sense. The domestic institutions will learn by that process and then follow. They will probably invest in deal 3, 4, 5 or 6 and then fund 100 per cent of those thereafter. You need the CEFC to pave the way to show that this can be done economically and viably with the right policy. Gillian Broadbent, the Chair of the CEFC, an esteemed businesswoman in the community, a former board member of the Reserve Bank of Australia, has made very similar comments to that Senate inquiry. To date, after only starting co-investing from 1 July 2013, the portfolio of the CEFC has invested sums amounting to about $590 million-leveraging $1.8 billion in investment. So they are supporting projects financed to the tune of almost $2.5 billion. The average yield, and this is an important point, from those investments is seven per cent. So it is about 3.5 per cent more than the cost of funds to government. Mr Craig Kelly: Madam Speaker, I seek to intervene on a point of order. I would ask the member a question. If he thinks it is such a great return, will he be investing his own money in it? If not, why would he invest taxpayers money? take the intervention? maybe I would. Given that this bill has been gagged for 26question, and maybe the member and I can have a talk about it after. From 2015 the CEFC starts returning money to the budget. The cost of abatement is actually a negative cost. It is a negative cost of about $2.40 per tonne of carbon pollution. I am sure the point will be made by members opposite that this is somehow a bizarre and unique experiment on the part of the former Australian government. Nothing could be further from the truth. For example, the United Kingdom has the Green Investment Bank that is ramping up to invest for a commercial return-in the same way that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is doing-the equivalent of more than $A6 billion to start to drive technologies in that country. The United Kingdom has just overtaken Australia in the Ernst& Young renewable energy country attractiveness index. Germany is doing the same with over 100 billion euro being deployed from government through the commercial finance sector. We will oppose this bill. It was a bad bill when it was first introduced and it remains a bad bill. resolution agreed to earlier today. would like to thank all members who have contributed to the debate. This bill abolishes the Clean Energy Finance Corporation by repealing the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Act 2012. This bill also transfers the CEFC's existing assets and liabilities, including the CEFC's investments, to the Commonwealth. These assets and liabilities will be managed by the Treasury. Funding to manage the CEFC's existing assets and liabilities and to meet contractually committed payments on investments will be met from the CEFC's existing funding, which will be transferred to a new CEFC transitional special account. Future moneys that were due to be appropriated to the CEFC annually until 2017 will be returned to consolidated revenue. The bill also provides for excess funding to be returned to consolidated revenue at any stage if it is no longer needed for managing the CEFC's assets and liabilities.

43,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (12:01): Firstly, IConsideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as whole. comments I did not have time to make because this bill has been so outrageously gagged by a government that seems far more interested in extending and meandering through the addressin-reply process than allowing a focused debate on such an important area of policy. It is clearly the case that this bill was cognately debated as one of 11 bills proposed by the government to dismantle the clean energy package introduced by the former government. As a result of that, there was no opportunity at all to allow members of this place to talk about the merits of the suite of renewable energy policies that had been put in place by the former government. These policies expanded on a bipartisan commitment initiated-to their credit-by the Howard government in 2001 with the introduction of the mandatory renewable energy target. So with all of the froth and the bubble around the so-called carbon tax over the last three years, there was never a peep from the then opposition-now the government-that the bipartisan commitment between the major parties, which had endured over four elections, to start to drive a transformation in our electricity sector would no longer be abided by by the new government. As I said earlier, the then shadow parliamentary secretary for the environment, Senator Birmingham, made a very clear statement to the clean energy conference only a week or two before the election that the Abbott opposition, now the Abbott government, remained committed not only to the aspiration of a 20 per cent renewable energy contribution to electricity by 2020 but to the precise generation figure of 41,850 gigawatt hours by 2020. It is clear from all of the advice that we received when in in government, and all the advice that anyone can receive if they talk to this sector or to an authority like the Climate Change Authority, that with the existing suite of policies remaining in place-with the work that and geothermal, which previously had bipartisan support from the two major parties; and with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation in place-Australia would comfortably reach the target of 41,000 gigawatt hours by 2020 and reach the broader aspiration known as 20 per cent by 2020. There was never any indication from the Abbott opposition that they were going to move away from a policy area initiated by John Howard-not initiated by us, but by John Howard-but I must say that it was very much built on by us. Again, this is something which starts to move Australia away from the global mainstream. We are seeing it broadly in climate change policy. The Abbott government is trying to take Australia backwards while the rest of the world is moving forwards. They are stuck in the atmospherics of the Copenhagen conference in 2009, when it was quite clear that there was not any global consensus to start to move forward. The world has moved on since 2009; the world has significantly moved on. The United States and China concluded a memorandum of understanding only in the last couple of weeks committing them to drive momentum towards a global agreement in Paris next year. We have had the, frankly, quite embarrassing situation of the US quite publicly trying to prod this government into taking seriously the statements that the Prime Minister and the minister made that the G20 would be a forum in which they could encourage constructive",63,Bills
44,Mr Butler (Port Adelaide) (12:02,"This is a wonderful opportunity to expand on thedebate around climate change, yet there is no commitment by this government as chair of the G20 this year to include climate change as a topic of discussion in the pre-eminent economic forum of the world's leading economies. This bill is but one detail of a broader problem that this government presents to the country. The country has an opportunity to move to a clean energy future and to finally be a part of some global momentum for an agreement next year that will start to deal with the very serious threat of climate change to Australia and every other nation. Instead, the government is playing politics; it is stuck in the atmospherics of 2009. For that reason, we will be opposing this bill. the second reading title. I think that there was general shock that there was no vote on the second reading but there was only one voice in the chamber, so we will now move on to the member for Ryan. Corporation (Abolition) Bill 2013 [No. 2] yet again because of the inability of those opposite to listen to the Australian people and respect the decision they made at the last election. This bill repeals the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Act 2012, thereby abolishing the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, as the coalition promised to do prior to the 2013 federal election as part of the carbon tax repeal. It is unfortunate that while in government those opposite refused to follow through on their 2010 election promise, and that now even from opposition they are standing in the way of the coalition government fulfilling ours. One must ask if those opposite purposefully enjoy misleading the Australian people. This bill will see the Clean Energy Finance Corporation's assets and liabilities transferred to the Commonwealth by statutory novation and managed by the Treasury. Abolishing the CEFC will save more than $6 billion in borrowed money to the end of the forward estimates, to 30 June 2017, and $350 million in interest costs alone. I have spoken in this place many times before on the fact that a whole-of-economy tax and risky financial expenditure will not reduce our carbon emissions, nor will they have a positive impact on our environment. The effect of the carbon tax on everyday Australians can be felt everywhere in our community. It is everyday Australians who are footing the bill for the carbon tax, not the so-called 'big polluters'. The Labor Party told Australians at the 2010 election, once again, that there would be no carbon tax under a government led by whomever the Labor Party and the caucus happen to like on that day. But just last week, after telling Western Australians yet again that they oppose the carbon tax and on the very day they told the public that they oppose the carbon tax, they voted our bill down in the Senate. The hypocrisy of those opposite to mislead the Australian people's on their stance on the carbon tax time and time again, election after election, is a blight on our nation's history. They are a disgrace. Those opposite are in this place supposedly to represent the Australian public, yet when Australians speak clearly and loudly against the carbon tax those opposite refuse to listen and refuse to represent their constituents. Every day that the Labor and the Greens toxic alliance in the Senate continues to oppose the repeal of the carbon tax is another day Australian people pay more for their electricity prices, more for their gas prices, more to run their businesses and more at the supermarket for food for their families.

When it comes to walking the talk, though, Labor votes to keep this toxic tax. Today marks yet another day that the coalition government is delivering on our election promises. Within the first 100 days of government we introduced the carbon tax repeal bills, and today, after they were voted down by the Senate, we are trying yet again. The coalition promised we would repeal the carbon tax and we are following through on that election commitment. It is clear that the only side of the chamber Australians can trust to tell the truth and to follow through on the promises taken to the election is the coalition. I am proud to stand on this side of the chamber and I commend this bill to the House. Corporation (Abolition) Bill 2013 [No. 2] abolishing the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is bad public policy at its best. This is public policy well and truly stuck in the 1970s and, after the announcement of the return of dames and knights, it is evident that this is a government that is well and truly stuck in the 1970s. The abolition of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation will stifle research and development into clean energy in our country. It will put a hold on commercial investment in clean energy projects in Australia. Most importantly, it will guarantee that we leave our kids an economy and an environment that is worse off because of the decision that the parliament will make if we abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. The CEFC was established to provide sustainable clean energy finance into the future, investment in clean energy in Australia on a commercial basis. The process of the CEFC was to also leverage private sector investment to overcome barriers to investment in renewable energy in our economy and it was to do that on a commercial basis. The research and the evidence from the CEFC's activities so far demonstrate that that is exactly what is occurring. It is leveraging finance on a commercial basis and returning, and will return, dividends to Australians in the short term. So far the Clean Energy Finance Corporation has been able to catalyse over $1.55 billion in non-CEFC private capital investment in projects and programs while it has only committed $536 million. These projects that the CEFC has commercialised will account for a reduction of 3.9 million tonnes of carbon in Australia. So a very small investment by the CEFC is leveraging a greater commercial investment from the private sector in clean energy and will return a dividend to the Australian people, in particular the next generation of Australians. And yet it is a project that the government is comfortable knocking off today. It is knocking over a vehicle for investment in clean energy throughout Australia. If this goes through, that is something our nation will pay for for many, many years. And what are they going to replace it with? They intend to replace it with a scheme of government grants-government handouts-to all and sundry on a whim and with the hope that they will invest in projects that are commercially viable and will result in carbon reductions in our economy. One would think that we are living in a parallel universe. I was always under the impression that the Liberal Party of Australia were all about the market and market-based mechanisms providing the best outcomes in our country. And here we have the Liberal Party knocking off a market-based mechanism for investment in clean energy in Australia and replacing it with what? A scheme of government grants-going completely",65,Arena Does With Its $3 Billion Budget To Support Emerging Technologies Like Solar Thermal
47,Mr Thistlethwaite (Kingsford Smith) (12:11,"This Clean Energy Financeagainst their own ideology and philosophy, simply because they are opposed to a Labor initiative that is good public policy. What are some of the projects that a program like the CEFC will commercialise? I am fortunate that in my community we have the University of New South Wales, which has done outstanding work in research and development of photovoltaic cells. Just two months ago the university's ARC Photovoltaic Centre of Excellence took out the AF Harvey engineering research prize for the Institution of Engineering and Technology for the team's discovery of a mechanism to control the charged state of hydrogen atoms to correct the deficiencies in silicon-the most costly part of solar cell technology. That will revolutionise photovoltaic solar cell development, and that is the sort of project that will get commercial backing under the CEFC. But it is being knocked off by those opposite for short-term political gain, and our kids will pay. Communications) (12:16): I am very pleased to rise to speak in the consideration in detail stage of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (Abolition) Bill 2013. There is a very clear question before the chamber contained in the terms of the bill we are debating this afternoon: whether the Clean Energy Finance Corporation should be maintained or whether it should be abolished, as schedule 1 to the bill would have the legal effect of doing. It is the policy of the Abbott government that it should be abolished. The first reason why the parliament should support this bill is that we were very plain, we were very clear, we were very explicit when in opposition that we did not think the Clean Energy Finance Corporation was a good idea. We said very clearly that we intended to abolish it. We took that to an election, and we were resoundingly supported. Let there be no doubt in this House: we have a very clear mandate to give effect to the policy that we took to the 2013 election, which was that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation should be abolished. Why did we take that policy to the election? If you listen to the previous speakers opposite, you would think that what we were proposing to do was to strangle a marvellous vehicle that was going to produce an endless stream of commercially viable, profitable and wonderfully environmentally supportive ventures, and that we are turning our back on this economic and environmental nirvana that the previous Greens-Labor coalition had invented. We are very sceptical that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation would work as it was intended to, and we have expressed clearly our scepticism from the outset. Let us consider what the fundamental business model of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is. IfI quote from a press release issued by the then Treasurer on 12 October 2011, the mission is to: … act as a catalyst to private investment which is currently not availableand apparently was going to: … overcome capital market barriers that hinder the financing, commercialisation and deployment of renewable energy, energy efficiency and low emissions technologies. The business model of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is for the taxpayer to be the mug who comes along and invests in projects that the private sector has passed on investing in. The business model here is that when the private sector has examined the opportunity for investment and has determined, on the basis of that examination, 'We do not intend to put",66,Arena Does With Its $3 Billion Budget To Support Emerging Technologies Like Solar Thermal
48,Mr Fletcher (Bradfield,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister formoney in here because it is too risky and we are not going to get a return,' then apparently the taxpayer should come along and invest money to do that. And by the way, where was the taxpayer going to get that money from? Where was the government of Australia going to get that money from? Of course, it was going to borrow that money because of the chaotic state in which the public finances of this nation have been left by the Rudd Gillard Rudd governments. This was a proposal from the previous government, this was a measure from the previous government that was predicated on a deeply unwise assumption that a government-owned corporation would do a better job of investing in risky ventures than the private sector would. It was predicated on the deeply unrealistic assumption that you could establish this venture and that it could invest in a way that was not subject to any kind of political pressures, that did not expose it to any kind of expectation on the part of Labor and the Greens who set it up that money would flow to all kinds of projects that they thought were virtuous. It is a venture that has been set up in ignorance-in clear and studied ignorance-of the tragic track record of these kinds of investments and ventures around the world. In the brief time. I have available, let me mention Solyndra, which was the US example of a new photovoltaic solar panel manufacturing facility, a $US535 million loan guarantee given by the Obama government. And guess what? Within just a few months the expansion was postponed; three-quarters of that guarantee was called on. The taxpayer there was left as the mug, and under this venture the taxpayer would always have been the mug. That is why we have opposed this ill-judged venture from the outset. century, they are living on another planet. They are living on a planet where, apparently, global warming does not exist. They are living on a planet where you can ignore what every scientist in the Climate Commission and elsewhere around this country is telling us, which is that if we are to protect the Australian way of life from the impacts of global warming, which will include more severe and more frequent droughts and bushfires, then we have got one or two decades at most to get this country to be a zero-pollution country-and that means running on renewable energy. That is a big task. It is a huge task to do in a short period of time, but it is a task that we have to do if we are to protect Australia and its way of life. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation is one of the best initiatives of the last parliament. It was never on the table in any of the schemes that had been put forward to deal with global warming under previous parliaments, but it happened in the last parliament because we had a parliament where Greens, Labor, city Independents and country Independents were able to come together and ask: 'What can we do to advance Australian industry in the clean and renewable energy sector?' And the answer, in large part, was the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. The idea that this is some unstudied, back-of-envelope development bears no examination because what I can tell the House is that when we developed the Clean Energy Finance Corporation we looked around the world at what else was going on and we took our lead from the Conservative government in the United Kingdom. The Conservative government in the United Kingdom has a Prime Minister who is not like our Prime Minister; he is a Prime Minister who says: 'When I see science I believe it, I don't say it's crap. I believe it when I see the science.' In the United Kingdom they had said, 'What can we do to support our local",67,Arena Does With Its $3 Billion Budget To Support Emerging Technologies Like Solar Thermal
49,Mr Bandt (Melbourne) (12:21,"The Abbott government are not just living in anothermanufacturers and to ensure that we have world-leading renewable and clean technology?' and they set up the United Kingdom Green Investment Bank. It is successful. And that model, together with the rest of the world's best practice, is now operating here in Australia. What we have in Australia is the Clean Energy Finance Corporation that has spent only $500 million-odd of its own money and, from that, has leveraged over $2 billion worth of investment in clean and renewable energy around this country-and that is happening now. That means that this bill from the Abbott government is an anti-Western Australian bill and an anti-jobs bill, because right now in Western Australia the CEFC has proposals for projects with a total project investment value of more than $1 billion, with only $400 million of investment from the CEFC. There are projects in solar photovoltaics and in wind. Twenty-one per cent of that investment is happening in the agricultural, forestry and fishing sector, with the rest of it in solar, wind and across the board in areas such as biofuels. This is happening right around the country. There are success stories of wind farms in Victoria and solar plants in New South Wales that are actually happening now, that are being built or in the pipeline to be built, because this corporation is using money wisely to leverage private sector investment. It was because this piece of ideology from a government trapped in another century and on another planet is so wrong-headed that it was rejected by the Senate. It was not just Labor and the Greens saying that this was an important thing we achieved in the last parliament. There are actually conservative independents and people from across the political spectrum saying, 'Hang on, this Clean Energy Finance Corporation is actually working.' Every speaker from the other side who has got up so far-and I bet there are going to be more-to talk about the carbon tax should be struck out of this debate because this bill is not about the carbon tax. This bill is about the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Whatever you think about putting a price on pollution, you have to look at the evidence and you have to say that putting money to supporting private sector investment in clean and renewable energy is a very good thing for this parliament to be doing. (Time expired) in detail stage of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (Abolition) Bill 2013, take 2. It is take 2 because this bill has already been to this House. It was debated in this House and it was passed on 21 November last year, and we did so to meet one of our election commitments. The coalition went to the last election with a very clear policy that we would abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. We did so on the clear basis that we do not support taking $10 billion of taxpayers' money, actually borrowing $10 billion of taxpayers' money, putting the government further and further in debt, to spend on projects that the private sector has deemed too risky. We heard the opposition leader in this chamber this morning whingeing about the government keeping our promises. But he, with his senators hand in hand with the Greens, has prevented the coalition government from keeping our promises. We know that the previous Labor government broke promise after promise. We know what they did on the carbon tax. In 2010 they went to the election with the then Prime Minister promising there would be no carbon tax under the government she led. Of course, they broke that promise. Then in 2013, only last year, they went to that election making out to the Australian public that they had abolished, terminated, the carbon tax. And now they come in here and whinge",68,Arena Does With Its $3 Billion Budget To Support Emerging Technologies Like Solar Thermal
50,Mr Craig Kelly (Hughes) (12:26,"I take great pleasure to rise in this considerationabout the government not keeping our promises when we are keeping our promises in this House, the bill goes over to the Senate and they reject it. That is why we are here today. I have heard many of the speakers on the other side and I see the good member for Rankin and the good member for Scullin over there ready to speak on this consideration in detail. I am sure one of the points they might raise is how wonderful this Clean Energy Finance Corporation has been and how it is actually making money for the government. Dr Chalmers: Good point! investing your own money in it? If you think this is so good, how much of your own money are you putting in it? Why are you prepared to put taxpayers' money at risk when you won't put your own money in it? That is the ultimate question. That is the ultimate question, because they know as well that this scheme will waste and lose taxpayers' money. That is the reason they wouldn't put one cent of their own in it. They want the Australian taxpayer to wear a risk that they are not prepared to take. We have seen an example of why the taxpayer is not needed with Mr Flannery's Climate Commission, which this government also abolished to the great howls and cries of members of the opposition. But what then happened? They then went and said: 'Look, this is terrible. This evil government has closed us down.' They were then able to receive donations from the public. So we in government today are able to receive the benefit of the wise, insightful opinions of Mr Flannery and listen to his predictions without it costing the taxpayer one cent, because it is funded privately! Mr Fletcher: It's a win-win. speaker that stands up and says how wonderful this scheme is and how it is returning a great return to the taxpayer should also state why they are not prepared to invest their own money in it. We have seen examples overseas of the dangers and the risks to taxpayers. We have seen in the USA the massive $700 million failure of the Solyndra project-US taxpayers' money flushed down the toilet and wasted. That is what we should be learning from. We have also seen it here. Many people may remember the Bligh Labor government in Queensland's ZeroGen project in which they invested $100 million of taxpayers' money. They said how wonderful this was, how it was going to create all this renewable energy and why the taxpayer should put their money in-and anyone who objected to it was said to be on drugs. We know what happened. That project failed and $100 million of taxpayers' money was wasted. We are in such a dire financial situation that we cannot afford to put any more taxpayers' money at risk. (Time expired) Finance Corporation because it is a vital piece in this nation's armoury to combat climate change. I am going to go back to some facts that seem to have passed the previous speaker by. The consensus in science now is that man-made climate change is as certain as the fact that tobacco causes cancer. They are that certain now, but that fact is rejected by those on the other side. Another fact is international action. Over a billion people now live in nations or provinces where there is a carbon price of some form.

53,Mr Conroy (Charlton) (12:31,"I rise to oppose the abolition of the Clean Energypeople. Those on the other side are condemning us to trade retaliation if we do not put an effective carbon price on to combat climate change. The third fact is that every decent economist-none on that side-has concluded that a market based system, principally either an emissions trading scheme or a fixed price, is the most effective way of combating climate change-a market price complemented by adequate industry and innovation policy measures to support this transition. If we go back to the basis of all this, we are living in a carbonconstrained world. The nations that succeed in the future will be the ones that decarbonise their economies-countries like China, where 200 million people now already live in provinces where there is an emissions trading scheme. By 2016 the entire nation is to have an emissions trading scheme driving their economy. Economic history shows that the countries that take advantage and move first are the ones that benefit from industrial revolutions, whether it was the English during the first industrial revolution based on steam and textiles; the second industrial revolution based on chemicals and electricity, being the United States and Germany; or the third industrial revolution based on electronics and the transistor in particular, driven by Japan and the United States. The next one will be about decarbonising our economy. I want my daughter to grow up in an economy where we have invested to make that transition so that our industries have a chance to compete globally, our industries are not horse and cart industries in the era of the automotive car. This is a great debate to have because it shows how the other side just don't get it. We had a previous speaker, someone on the front bench, talk about risk. They wilfully misunderstood the innovation cycle-that the first-of-type projects often do not get a full commercial rate of return. They can still get a decent rate of return, but they do not often overcome the barriers to reach the 10 or 15 per cent that the private sector demands to take a risk. It is entirely appropriate that the Commonwealth support innovation and industry policy, support the firstof-type projects, for example large-scale solar thermal, very revolutionary energy efficiency projects. Not only are they important for being the first-mover types that demonstrate to the private sector that they can take action; they also can have a rate of return. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation has already invested in $2.2 billion worth of projects, where the average yield is projected to be 7.33 per cent on average. That is well above the long-term bond rate. Yes, it is below the internal rate of return that some in the private sector demand, but it is return which is well and truly paying back the debt that is being taken on to fund these important projects. This covers 39 projects already in play. A further 170 proposals with a cumulative investment of $15 billion are approaching the Clean Energy Finance Corporation for investment. I return to the substance of this, which is: how best do we combat climate change? We have the command and control over there by Comrade Abbott, a return to central planning that Lenin and Stalin would be proud of. This is what the Liberal Party has degenerated into: state directed investment of the worse sort that we have not seen since the 1930s in Russia. This is versus a market based system that every economist worth their salt-Ross Garnaut, Lord Stern, people supported by both sides of politics-supports. The member for Wentworth supported it in a previous life. Market based systems are the most efficient way of tackling climate change-backed up by sound industry policy that makes the Commonwealth money and that has first-of-type demonstration effects for the rest of the economy. This is the sensible way. This is what those on the other side are voting against, because they are economic philistines. As former Treasurer Peter Costello said of Tony Abbott, 'He just doesn't get economics.' He just doesn't get economics and with his knighthoods he just wants to return to the past, condemning our future. (Time expired) (Abolition) Bill 2013 [No. 2] consideration in detail stage. The government is reintroducing this legislation in an identical form to the bill that was first introduced to the House of Representatives on 13 November 2013 and rejected by the Senate on 10 December 2013. The bill repeals the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Act 2012, the CEFC Act, thereby abolishing the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the CEFC, and it makes a number of consequential amendments. The CEFC's assets and liabilities will be transferred to the Commonwealth by statutory novation and will be managed by the Treasury. It should not be the job of the government to operate banking services for industries which are already supported through commercial banking services. It is very unusual for a government to be operating banking services for industries, but this is what has been occurring since the CEFC was established on 3 August 2012 under the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Act 2012. In the few cases where the government does operate such investment services, these are limited and targeted. Examples include the Indigenous Land Corporation and Screen Australia. But the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is certainly a different case, not least because it is providing assistance to projects that would already be going ahead in order to meet the renewable energy target. The coalition predicted this would be the case when the CEFC was introduced by the previous Labor-Greens government, and it has been proven correct, with the CEFC board choosing to lend to large-scale commercial wind farms. This potential duplication also calls into question the claims by the CEFC that the existing projects they have financed have resulted in 3.88 million tonnes of emissions reductions each year. Two-thirds of the claimed abatement comes from the Taralga, Portland and Macarthur wind farms, which are already supported through the renewable energy target, so these emissions reductions would have happened without the CEFC and indeed will continue without the CEFC, at no cost to Australian taxpayers. This, of course, is not the only example of the Labor government being only too keen to throw money at any sector in the hope it solves the problem without doing the research to see if it is truly needed. Too often the Labor Party instinctively reach for the chequebook without seeing if the money is really needed. For them it is all about the headline in the paper the next day and not about sound treatment of taxpayers' money. Mr Bandt: Cadbury! this bill is a threat to the way of life. The Greens would have us go back to horse and cart and burning wood, destroying the livelihoods and lives of Australians purely through their own ideology. Mr Husic: 'What about Cadbury?' is what he said. will be heard in silence.

56,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Vasta,"Order! The member for Swan has the call andParliament Kevin Rudd, the Prime Minister of the time, introduced funding for solar projects and asked for submissions from all around Australia. I know there were some very good submissions put in from Western Australia that were actually commercially viable. But guess what: the five projects that were awarded funds were all in Queensland. And guess where the Prime Minister's seat was: in Queensland. So none of them went to Western Australia at all. This is another example of the Labor-Greens alliance working against the Western Australian economy, including by keeping this carbon tax. You said I would bring it up and I did; I have brought the carbon tax up. So this is another perfect example of how the Greens-Labor alliance works against Western Australia. In 2011 I went on the ASEAN delegation, and in that time we went to Singapore. We had the previous member for Braddon there. We also had the previous member for beef stroganoff-sorry, the previous member for Reid. We met with the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, and these two members spoke to the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation and said, 'What do you think about investing in renewable energy programs and things like that?' The Singaporean government official just said, 'We will not invest in non-sustainable projects, so we have not invested in any renewable energy targets at all.' So there is a perfect example of a sensible government leaving it to industry to drive that part of the sector. Of course, this bill was part of the carbon tax repeal bills, and I mention that just for the member for Melbourne. This bill sits within that context. I support the bill. However, in one moment the Labor Party chose to make the parliament's focus the introduction of a carbon tax without any mandate-in fact, with a mandate not to introduce a carbon tax-and with it other possibilities were extinguished. (Abolition) Bill 2013 [No. 2], and I want to speak on some concerns of process as well as some matters of substance. On the process, it is extraordinary that, in a week when we have heard so much cant about freedom, again we see a major debate in this place gagged. Going to that point, I should congratulate the member for Swan, because he did in fact talk about the legislation that is before the parliament, unlike the member for Hughes. He talked about Labor rushing to get the chequebook. I think what we are doing here is rushing through this legislative process when there is some significant evidence we should be considering, not least the rationale adopted by the Senate in rejecting this legislation late last year and the important work done by the Senate committee, which I will turn to briefly. It is telling that the broad attitude of the coalition can be summed up by two things here: (1) a failure to engage with the fundamental challenge that is combating climate change; and (2) utter lack of interest in the substance of the bill that is before us. It is quite extraordinary that the member for Hughes spent most of his time talking about the investment decisions the member for Rankin and I can make. He obviously has great confidence in our financial capacity to make these investments-misplaced confidence-but he has nothing to say about the legislation that is before us. Mr Ciobo: Hear, hear! It is misplaced confidence. I've got no confidence, for what it's worth, especially in Rankin. You make a compelling point.

58,Mr Giles (Scullin) (12:42,"I rise in opposition to the Clean Energy Finance Corporationcomprehensive commercial loans for both renewable energy and cleaner energy technology investments and is set to fund emissions reductions at a negative cost to government-to turn a profit. This government's alternative plan for an Emissions Reduction Fund-I do not think that was very well understood by the member for Hughes, but I am sure the parliamentary secretary can take him through it-will consume billions from consolidated revenue. It is simply bizarre that a government supposedly obsessed with reducing debt and deficit would oppose a market-orientated scheme that turns a profit. Clearly the motive here is purely ideological and not for financial, much less environmental, reasons. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation has been a success and will return real dividends. In its first months of operation it has been strikingly successful in providing loans to organisations. Over time we see the capacity to make investments that would account for 50 per cent of the five per cent emissions reduction target by 2020, at a profit to the taxpayer of $2.40 a tonne. In 12 months we have seen great success, but, despite these successful operations, through this bill the government is seeking to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. This government has been unable to see past its ideological blinkers and appreciate the role the Clean Energy Finance Corporation has been playing in facilitating investment in renewable energy that would otherwise be missed by normal commercial banks. I touched earlier on the Senate inquiry. Many stakeholders gave evidence to the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee regarding the work to date and argued strongly and persuasively that the CEFC should be retained. The CEO of the Investor Group on Climate Change, Mr Nathan Fabian, summarised the need for the CEFC in evidence to the committee: The CEFC is one example of what are now 14I emphasise 14co-financing institutions around the world. These organisations are needed for five reasons. Firstly, governments cannot sufficiently finance low-carbon alternatives to meet a two-degree outcome and private capital is needed. Secondly, the low-carbon investment market is relatively young and so deal flow needs to be supported. Thirdly, capacity in the finance sector must be increased through the experience of financing investments. Fourthly, financial participants welcome investment opportunities presented in a new market by an objective third party, even more than by investment banks. Lastly, cofinancing organisations can actually earn financial returns for governments, delivering abatement at negative costs-and we think this is appealing and makes sense to all parties. Given the government's infrastructure agenda, we think that dismissing co-financing as a useful policy instrument may be premature. Those are five very strong arguments that should not fall on deaf ears but seemingly will. In the northern suburbs of Melbourne, energy efficiency gains are already being realised at the Labelmakers printing services store. The CEFC has helped finance three new energyefficient presses that operate at twice the speed, using half the energy, of the old presses, while allowing a broader range of higher quality printed materials to be manufactured. It has supported jobs in the communities I represent, as well as environmental outcomes. This is just one of many projects the CEFC has helped bring to fruition. It makes a mockery of the Treasurer's claim in his second reading speech that investments were made in high-risk ventures. The second reading speech, as ever, was strong on rhetoric, low on detail and utterly unpersuasive.",73,Arena Does With Its $3 Billion Budget To Support Emerging Technologies Like Solar Thermal
59,Mr Giles,"Well, listen a bit longer. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation facilitateslistened to the Labor and Greens contributors to this debate, you would be scratching your head and wondering how on earth the world ever reached the stage that it has reached. If it were not for these grandiose schemes funded by taxpayers, there would be no innovation. We would still be living back in the dark ages. I wonder how the first aircraft became airborne, how the first ship or the first submarine sailed, or indeed how any of the advancements that have been made with respect to medical technology, computing, IT and communications were made. The government must have been at the epicentre of every single one of these innovations! If it were not for the government, how on earth would the private sector have ever innovated in any particular way? For goodness sake. I have got to say I am not surprised, because that lot over there have always been exceedingly generous with other people's money. There has never been a time when the Labor Party have said, 'No, we don't want to invest taxpayers' funds in that.' There has never been a deal that has been put to the Labor Party, or to the Greens, that they have not wanted to sign up to with taxpayers' money. But the unfortunate thing about all of this debate is this. The Greens and the Labor Party wring their hands and stand over there with their faux concern about the next generation of Australians and they say, 'Why won't the Liberals and the Nationals do something to ensure the safety of the next generation of Australians?' If only they had 10 per cent of that concern for how the next generation of Australians are going to pay back all the debt that Labor and the Greens left. If only they had the smallest bit of concern for the fact that it will be our children that will be paying back Labor's debt for the next 20 years. If only they had the smallest bit of concern for the fact that, in five years, they managed to indebt the next generation of Australians for decades. Then maybe we on this side of the chamber would take them a little bit more seriously. Maybe they should have considered and recognised the fact that they have effectively put a ball and chain around the ankle of every Australian for the next 20 or 30 years, instead of just focusing on the fact that Australia does contribute about 1½ to two per cent of global CO2 emissions and saying, 'If only we had renewable energy and if only we had mass-scale investment then we could probably shave off about 0.001 per cent,' or 0.0012 per cent or 0.015 per cent or whatever the number is. For goodness sake; it is no wonder the Australian people woke up to the Australian Labor Party. Mr Dreyfus: You want to do nothing! have got a newsflash for you, buddy: it is called the Direct Action Plan. Under the Direct Action Plan, the coalition will deliver five per cent reductions on CO2 emissions, which, incidentally, is more than Labor was going to do. Under Labor modelling, CO2 emissions were going to go up. The only way they were going to actually achieve a reduction was by buying permits.

He said that the opposition is exceedingly generous with other people's money. Perhaps he should look very carefully at the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the returns that it will provide to the Australian public. It is very clear that this is not being exceedingly generous with other people's money but rather providing a return to the Australian taxpayers on the money that is going to be expended-a return in the order of some seven per cent, or $200 million a year, over the next few years. I want to go to another point that he made which, I think, is even more critical. He made the point that we are going to burden future generations with this so-called debt. I ask the member for Moncrieff: what kind of burden would he have us leave future generations if we, as a society, do nothing about the impacts of climate change? These are impacts which, I might say, have been confirmed time and time again by the scientific community of the world. The most recent reports, including reports from the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology here in Australia, confirm the predictions made years ago that our climate is changing, it is changing in a very severe way and the impacts of that change are going to be very severe for future generations, who will have to wear those costs. In fact, in the last summer alone, my recollection is that there were 156 records broken in terms of the climate of this country.

70,Mr Zappia (Makin) (12:52,"CanI go straight to a couple of the remarks that were just… the farce that the coalition's policy, of lack of policy, on climate change has descended into … You cannot cut emissions without a cost … Somebody has to pay. Those are comments from one of their own members, not from people on this side of the House but from someone who at least has the decency to acknowledge that that science in respect of climate change is right. But I will go further. Lord Deben, a former Tory minister and now the head of the UK's independent Committee on Climate Change, described the Abbott government's approach to climate change as being: … so unintellectual as to be unacceptable; I mean, it is just amazing. This legislation that the government seeks to repeal was put in place as part of a total package to manage the concerns that society has about climate change. Part of that strategy is, in fact, not only to have a mechanism by which polluters will reduce the amount of pollution that they create but also to encourage investment in innovation in areas where we will reduce the amount of carbon that is emitted into the atmosphere. You can only do that if you invest in new technology. Members opposite say, 'Are you prepared to invest your own money into the new technology?' I say to them: how can you expect anyone to invest their money in new technology when they have no certainty of policy because members of the government on that side said that, if they got elected, they would change the policy as they are doing right now? You cannot get certainty of investment if you are going to change your policies from one election to another. If they were prepared to be honest about this whole issue and at least agree to stick to the commitments around the renewable energy targets and the targets to reduce emissions by five per cent by 2020, at least that would provide some level of certainty to those people who are prepared to invest in new technologies because they know that, ultimately, we have to do so. The Abbott government is clearly showing that it is prepared to turn its back on the science of climate change, and, in doing so, is turning its back on future generations, who will, indeed, have to pay dearly because of the inaction of this government. We are not only seeing it through this legislation; we are seeing it across the board. In fact, yesterday in question time the Minister for the Environment could barely utter the words 'climate change'. I think he did it once in response to a question about the very subject. That is how committed the government is to climate change. We saw it also with respect to the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill-again, deletion of all reference to climate change. They want to hide it away and bury it away because, that way, they can pretend it does not exist. Well, the truth is: it does exist. If this government is prepared to turn its back on this kind of initiative, then what it is really saying is that it does not care about future generations. It is prepared to capitalise on profiting today so that others pay dearly in the future. (Time expired) you this opportunity to speak, but I just thought that I would like to continue with my comments. One of the things that the member for Makin-and it is good to see him quoting Tory politicians-talked about was changes of promises. If we go back to pre-2010, we can remember the changes of promises that every Australian remembers. The Greens and Labor broke the promise not to introduce a carbon tax. The people in Western Australia will remember that next Saturday when it comes to the election. The Greens-Labor alliance lied to the Australian people about the carbon tax that they said they would never introduce under their government.",76,Arena Does With Its $3 Billion Budget To Support Emerging Technologies Like Solar Thermal
71,Mr Irons (Swan) (12:57,"I see the member for Melbourne rose. I am sorry to take fromOf course, this bill was part of the carbon tax repeal bills. This bill sits within that context. The coalition went to the election with the clearest possible position on the subject of the carbon tax. We announced a policy many months-if not years-out from the election. The policy was communicated in budget reply speeches, in press releases, in debates during the campaign and in the election material of every single Liberal and National candidate across the country. The leader of the coalition at the time, Tony Abbott, was bold enough to declare that the 2013 federal election would be a referendum on the carbon tax. This was an accurate description of what the election turned out to be. But the people on that side of the chamber want to ignore the will of the Australian people. Mr Bandt: Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. This bill is not about the carbon tax. This bill is about the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. declare that the 2013 federal election would be a referendum on the carbon tax, and this was an accurate description of what the election turned out to be. Again, as I said, people on that side of the chamber just seem to have totally ignored what the will of the Australian people indicated on 7 September 2013. Kevin Rudd recognised that it was a referendum on the carbon tax, because, during the campaign, he said he had terminated the carbon tax. What a misrepresentation that turned out to be! And now we see the WA Senate candidates in Western Australia saying that they are going to terminate the carbon tax. They are not. They have been here and they have voted against terminating it. The Western Australian people need to know that when they go to the polls next Saturday. Most members in this place would agree that, for better or for worse, the carbon tax became the key issue of the 43rd Parliament. It was the major issue, because the Labor Party made it a major issue. It became so the moment the Labor Party decided to break the infamous promise that there would be no carbon tax under a Gillard government. The 43rd Parliament did not have to be about the carbon tax. If Labor had showed some spine and not been jelly-backed and had stood up to the Greens and said, 'No, we will honour our commitments,' the last parliament could have been about better things. It could have been about the welfare of the Australian people. It could have been about delivering the infrastructure of the 21st century. It could have been about rebuilding our national finances, about stopping the boats, about delivering on broadband for the Australian people or even paying for a national disability insurance scheme. We heard the member for Charlton say that he wants Australian companies to be able to compete internationally. But, if we talk to most manufacturers in Western Australiaparticularly in the concrete sector-the carbon tax and the mining tax are the things that are stopping them being competitive internationally. We are seeing concrete products being imported into Australia and into Western Australia because of the deficiencies of the carbon tax and the negative aspect it has on business for people in Western Australia. We also heard comment about providing a return on investment from the CEFC, but what about the NBN? The Labor Party also said that the NBN would provide a return. Well, we know that is not true.

It is with great pleasure that I join the debate in relation to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014. I congratulate the Minister for the Environment for the work he has already done in consulting, particularly with coalition members, on a whole range of programs throughout Australia, especially in regional Australia. When this election commitment was made by the coalition, it was very warmly received across the electorate of Gippsland. I encourage people in my community, particularly groups involved with Landcare, Coastwatch and other organisations with a focus on practical environmental measures-those groups welcomed the announcement because it gave them the opportunity to put forward programs and projects within the electorate, which would have a real practical benefit in terms of environmental management. In bringing this bill to the House today, the coalition is delivering on an important election commitment. There is one very significant difference between this coalition government and the former Rudd-GillardRudd Labor government, and that is we take our election commitments seriously. When we make promises to the Australian people we intend to deliver them. Our election commitment was to build a 15,000-strong Green Army across our nation. I am very proud of the role that members on this side of the House have played today in delivering on the Green Army promise. When the policy was first announced it was very warmly received across the Gippsland electorate because it gave Landcare, Coastcare and other organisations the opportunity to put forward projects to be considered by the Minister for the Environment and Minister Hartsuyker, who has a role in delivering the program. I have been impressed by the quality of the projects that have been put forward by community groups, individuals and councils across the entire Gippsland electorate. WhatI like about the Green Army Program is that it draws very much on the inspiration of the previous Howard government's Green Corps program, which was implemented almost 20",79,Arena Does With Its $3 Billion Budget To Support Emerging Technologies Like Solar Thermal
78,Mr Chester (Gippsland,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (13:13):years ago. In my previous roles as a local newspaper journalist and an advocate for community issues I had the opportunity to work with the former member for Gippsland Peter McGauran on the implementation of several Green Corps projects in the Gippsland region. Without exception, they were well received because they provided opportunities for young people with a particular passion for environmental projects to develop new skills and make a real difference in their communities in terms of restoring our natural and cultural environments. I refer specifically to the cultural environment because in Gippsland with previous programs under these types of initiatives we had the opportunity to involve the Indigenous community directly in projects which they were passionate about in the Gippsland region. This program will provided some extraordinary opportunities for hands-on, practical, grassroots environmental action. Not the type of environmental action we see from the Greens political party, which likes to indulge in grand rhetoric but never gets its hands dirty. The people of Gippsland and the people involved with Landcare, Coastcare and other organisations want to do practical work and actually make a real change within the environment on either a local scale, such as a small gullying project or reducing pest plants and animals, or a more broader landscape scale, such as improving the quality of the water coming into streams, fencing off parts of the riversides to prevent stock access and doing more broader land management action. I am very pleased to see that the focus of both ministers involved in this project is on making sure that the young people who get involved in this program have the opportunity to develop real skills. It is an opportunity for them to develop skills and job training in areas like land management, park management, landscaping and horticulture. They can pick up important skills that will assist them to obtain full-time employment in the future. I would hate to see a program like this become just a make-work scheme. I want it to be a pathway towards gainful and sustainable employment for the people who participate. I will be working very closely with my electorate, the community groups and the local councils to make sure the projects we put forward under this program allow young people to have a pathway from unemployment into the Green Army, where they will learn practical skills and make a real difference in their community, and then hopefully to full-time and sustainable employment within my region. The work that the Green Army will be undertaking across Australia will be vital to the regeneration and the preservation of vital areas of our natural environment. I understand that already the minister has indicated to many members in this place the projects that have been successful and will be funded under the initial rounds. These include the propagation and planting of native seedlings across the nation, weed control initiatives, the revegetation and regeneration of local parks, habitat protection and restoration, improving water quality by cleaning up waterways, the revegetation of sand dunes and mangroves, creek bank regeneration, foreshore and beach restoration, the construction of boardwalks and walking tracks to protect local wildlife, and cultural heritage conservation. In relation to the control of pest plants and pest animals, in particular I want to mention an announcement this week that I was particularly heartened by-the agreement between the Victorian government and the new federal government that aerial baiting of wild dogs will now be allowed in Victoria. Again, you can see a clear difference between this government and the previous government on issues relating to the management of the environment. It appalled me that the previous government refused to allow the Victorian state government to aerial bait wild dogs in Victoria when across the border in New South Wales aerial baiting had been allowed. It was a bizarre circumstance. The excuses and the obfuscation that went on by the previous minister in relation to this issue were quite ridiculous. So it is very pleasing that as of this week an agreement has been reached between the Commonwealth and the state government to allow for the aerial baiting of wild dogs in Victoria. I encourage Victorian minister Peter Walsh in his efforts to control wild dogs in Victoria. We know and we accept that you will never eradicate the problem of wild dogs, but you can certainly do a lot more than the previous Commonwealth government was prepared to do to assist in that regard. In Victoria the impact of wild dogs on our environment is significant. It is often referred to as a farmers' issue because of the stock losses that are associated with it. It is very much an issue for people who make a living from the land, but it is also an environmental concern. The fact that we had wild dogs feasting on our native fauna on a daily basis while very little effort was being made by the Commonwealth to control them, I think was a condemnation of the previous federal government in that regard. I am very pleased that this week the Victorian state government and the new Abbott-Truss coalition government have been able to reach an agreement that will allow aerial baiting to be introduced in Victoria in the future. It will be a combined measure. There will be ongoing measures of ground baiting and shooting, but aerial baiting will give the government the opportunity to reach areas which are very inaccessible. In the aftermath of the bushfires we had in Victoria, there is no doubt that predation by wild dogs will be an issue for us as they are forced out of the bush and onto farmland. Our landholders are going to need every bit of support they can get in terms of reducing the impact of these wild dogs. It is just another example of how this new government is prepared to work in a practical way with measures to improve the natural environment and work with local communities to make sure we can deliver sustainable results and assist people as they undertake practical environmental works across our community. In closing, I would simply say that I am a very strong supporter of the Green Army Program. I look forward to working with the relevant ministers and working with my community to help make a real difference to improving the environment in our communities. We have done some great work in Gippsland over the past 20 or 30 years with Landcare organisations and other organisations which have been instrumental in making very significant improvements to our region. I refer to the work that has been done, in particular, with the management of the catchment of the Gippsland Lakes. One of the great icons of Australia is the Gippsland Lakes network. It is the largest network of lakes in the southern hemisphere. It is fed by six major rivers, and there has been a lot of work undertaken by both the Labor and the coalition governments in partnership with local communities to improve the water quality entering the Gippsland Lakes and to reduce the impact of things like algal blooms, which are obviously a major concern for the tourism industry and also for the enjoyment of the lake system by local residents. It is very important that the government-in this case the coalition government at federal level-works with the state government, works with the local government and works with local communities to make sure that we can deliver programs on the ground which actually make a real difference to the environment. I commend the bill to the House. respect to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014. This legislation supposedly forms the centrepiece of the Abbott government's direct action policy response to climate change-a response, as we saw earlier today, that does not take climate change seriously. This legislation is further confirmation that the Abbott government does not take climate change seriously, does not believe in the science being presented by the scientists around the world and is prepared to turn its back on future generations by leaving them with the burden that climate change adaption, which should be taken now, will be left for them if it is not taken now. What is even more concerning, with respect to this proposition-and as good as it might be for the environment-is that the legislation is clearly not satisfactory, or adequate, to respond to the needs that arise as a result of climate change. There is no credible commentator that I can find who supports the direct action policy of the Abbott government-with the Green Army or the Green Corps as the centrepiece-as being a responsible response to what we should be doing in order to mitigate the effects of climate change. In fact, I want to quote from an assessment of this program that was done by Tim Lubcke from Flinders University in South Australia only a year ago. He says that the analysis concluded that to achieve the required target of 85 million tonnes of CO2 abatement: … this amounts to between 2.2 and 2.57 million hectares of annual wood production land. The fact is that this proposal will not achieve that. But it is even more concerning because, quite frankly, it is a proposal that has been criticised and not supported by anyone with any credibility. That brings me to the real point with respect to this legislation, and that is: why is the government introducing this proposal in the way that it is as a pretentious response to climate change when in fact it knows that it is not? This is a proposal that simply re-badges similar propositions or proposals that were already in place-put in place right back in 1992 by the Keating government, at the time known as the Landcare and Environmental Action Plan, the LEAP program. Subsequently, it was supported by government after government in one form or another. There is nothing new in this proposal. What really concerns me is that the government will seek to re-badge or relaunch programs that are currently in existence and which form part of our analysis and measurement CO2 abatement measures that are already in place so that the net effect will be even worse than what the government pretends. If it were a brand-new proposal, then you could at least have some confidence that the figures that the Abbott government is using in terms of CO2 abatement might be true. But my concern is that it is not a new proposal. It is a re-badged proposal of what is already taking place. Communities around Australia are already engaged in tree-planting programs. In fact, in the council area where I was mayor for 10 years we literally planted tens of thousands of trees every year-it was nothing new. The South Australian Labor government, on coming to office in 2002, committed to a program of planting two million trees around the metropolitan area and those programs carried on and were in fact delivered. So there is nothing new in a program that seeks to say, 'We are going to plant trees, planting trees is good for the environment'-we accept that-but then it also ought to say, 'And it will mitigate the effects",81,Arena Does With Its $3 Billion Budget To Support Emerging Technologies Like Solar Thermal
79,Mr Zappia (Makin) (13:24,"I support the amendments moved by the opposition inof climate change being caused by carbon dioxide emissions, which in turn are caused by human activity across the world.' What is more incredible is that we have a program where the government says, 'Let's plant trees because trees will absorb the carbon dioxide and mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide pollution,' while simultaneously saying to the Australian people, 'We will simultaneously release 74,000 hectares of preserved wood forest in Tasmania and unlock them for forestry.' So on one hand we are going to plant trees-supposedly to have one effect-and on the other hand we are going to unlock 74,000 hectares of trees that are already in existence. You could only conclude that at the very least one will offset the other, and that is if we plant 74,000 hectares of trees at the same pace as we are going to unlock the ones that are already growing. It simply proves that this policy is nothing but a farce when it comes to a response to climate change. interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. Dunsdon Foundation Taxation Foundation: Col Roach, John Quinlan and Bruce Baylis, who are constituents in my electorate. The Dunsdon Foundation is a trust which was set up after the tragic death in July 2009 of Mark Dunsdon, who was raising four children alone, who at the time of his death were all under 10 years of age. They are now being raised by their grandmother, Carole Dunsdon. The generous community donations to the foundation were invested and the interest has provided important assistance to Carole and the boys towards expenses including tuition fees and recreational activities. This financial help is vital to the boys' lives. Unfortunately, the foundation has found itself the unintended victim of changes to the low-income tax offset. After1 July 2011, the LITO of $1,500 was removed on unearned income by minors from discretionary trusts, dividends, interest, rent, royalties and other incomes from property. The foundation is seeking amendments to the income tax assessment act regarding the LITO to give the Commissioner of Taxation discretion to make a ruling that the act does not apply in the circumstances of the boys. I have written to the Treasurer, requesting the government investigate making these changes. This is not a partisan political issue. The changes to the LITO were necessary to crack down on tax avoidance. The distributions to the boys are not large, but the high tax rate of 45 per cent applying results in a relatively large reduction in the amounts which can be distributed. The foundation is seeking a sensible change to the act, due to an unintended consequence in the current legislation. I fully support these suggested changes.

Human Rights: Somphone, Mr Sombath Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (13:32): Today, I would like to raise the disappearance in Laos of Mr Sombath Somphone, a leading humanitarian and community development worker. As evidenced by CCTV footage on 15 December 2012, Mr Somphone was abducted after being pulled over for questioning by state police in Vientiane. The Laos government has asserted that there was no official involvement in his disappearance, but there does not appear to have been an investigation into his whereabouts. There are a number of critical questions that remain unanswered in relation to the CCTV footage; yet, the Laos government has refused the offer of technical assistance by several countries to examine the CCTV footage. The issue has been raised by successive US secretaries of state, Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, by the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, by the European Parliament and by 62 NGOs, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. We have a role to ensure that universal human rights are observed and upheld across the world but particularly in those places where we might have some influence. Australia is one of Laos' major aid donors. I encourage my parliamentary colleagues and the government to visit the website-www.sombath.org-that sets out the social justice contributions of Mr Somphone to the well-being of his fellow Lao citizens and the worrying circumstances of his disappearance; to join in international calls for the government of Laos to undertake prompt, transparent and thorough investigations in accordance with their obligations under international human rights law; and to ensure the immediate and safe return of Sombath Somphone to his family and community.

This petition was submitted by Pastor Bruce Hallam from the Dalby Churches of Christ and contains some 120 signatures from those in the support of this cause.

I am sure many parts of Australia would have the same sentiment as Pastor Bruce Hallam and the Dalby Churches of Christ and others across my constituency. Homelessness Australia Ms CLAYDON (Newcastle) (13:36): I rise today to call on the government to put an end to the cruel uncertainty that faces so many of our community services because of this government's refusal to commit to funding of their operations beyond 30 June. Yesterday, I met with Homelessness Australia to discuss the situation faced by their members and services across the country. They have every right to be worried about this government's failure to commit to the ongoing funding of their work. More than 3,000 workers around the country deliver 180 programs to some 80,000 Australians who depend on the support the programs offer. This is a sector that is already stretched, with more than 400 requests for help having to be turned away each day. While campaigning in WA, I note that the Prime Minister, when pressed on the issue during a Perth radio interview two weeks ago, sought to give a veiled assurance to homeless service providers when he declared, 'Come budget night, all will be revealed, and I think people will be happy.' You may think this assurance is enough; however, I wish to reflect on what the now Prime Minister openly said in 2010 on the 7.30 Report, when he stated that 'commitments given on radio are not real commitments. Commitments must be on paper to be confirmed.' Prime Minister, homelessness service providers need to know their fate now, not in seven weeks time on budget night. Are they listed in the hidden commission of cuts? Is their funding secure? They need to know now. I call on the Prime Minister to fund these(Time expired) Green Army Green Army project to restore the long-term health of Kogarah Bay and the Cooks River within my electorate as part of ongoing project submissions to the Green Army taskforce. Prior to my election, I met with local stakeholders to ascertain concerns for Barton's waterways and found that water quality was suffering and salt marsh communities were under threat. The health of these natural habitats have been diminishing over the last decade and they require regular maintenance. As a result of these consultations, I met recently with the environment minister, the Hon. Greg Hunt MP, and highlighted the community's concerns. Subsequently, I submitted a proposal for the Green Army to launch an on-the-ground project at Kogarah Bay and Cooks River.",86,Statements By Members

Furthermore, the Green Army could provide a much-needed clean-up of the rubbish-strewn water and surrounding banks of these waterways. It is important for prospective Green Army projects to provide support to preexisting community initiatives. The Cooks River Alliance has been fantastic in advocating for improved water quality and the health of our wetlands over the past three years and I hope this potential project will work to address their ongoing concerns. I also hope that my submission for the maintenance of these waterways will be met with enthusiasm from the number of young people from the electorate who are keen to make a difference to Barton's local environment. Qantas Qantas workers here in Parliament House. Some of these Qantas workers are not the highest paid, but they are some of the most skilled workers in our community. Roughly, there are 6,500 employed in Australian Services Union areas. Many of these staff work in front and back of house of Qantas-they work in customer service, airline freight, operations, catering, and even in Qantas lounges, which a number of us will be visiting this afternoon. The base salary of these workers is anywhere from $36,000 to $53,000 per year, so they are not the highest paid in our community. What these workers ask of the government is quite simple. They ask that the government withdraw the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill, prioritise local jobs when negotiating air service agreements and demand that foreign carriers operating in Australia invest in local jobs-and they call on the government and members of the House to support Qantas workers and their families. These are things that a number of people in my community and the majority of Australians support. Given Qantas's track record, I agree with them that these are important issues. Over 10,000 jobs are at risk through the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill alone. This is on top of the thousands of jobs that Qantas has already cut over the past decade. Over 3,000 of these jobs have been offshored, something I know most Australians do not support. Esperance Port Access Corridor Project Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, the Hon. Warren Truss, in officially opening the Esperance Port Access Corridor Project. Jointly funded by the federal and state governments, the $120 million project was launched early in 2012 following a comprehensive planning and consultation exercise. This important project includes the construction of two road bridges, a rail tunnel, a pedestrian underpass, the realignment of 1.3 kilometres of railway, the realignment of 1.8 kilometres of Harbour Road, shared-use pathways and extensive landscaping and revegetation. The project will significantly improve safety for all road and railway users, including cyclists and pedestrians, by eliminating road and rail conflicts. It will provide the infrastructure to support the economic and regional development of the town of Esperance and the Esperance Port, and the significant mining and agricultural interests in the region. It will also enhance community access across the transport corridor through the construction of grade-separated crossings, which will be safer and more efficient than the existing railway level crossings.",87,Statements By Members

Greek Independence Day attending the Greek Independence Day commemoration at the Cenotaph in Sydney to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in the Greek War of Independence. I was also fortunate to view the Independence Day march through Sydney with the Archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Church, His Eminence Archbishop Stylianos. The Independence Day celebration brings together schools, RSLs, churches and community groups for a celebration of Greek history, heritage and culture and, of course, Australian multiculturalism. The pride of the Greek community was well and truly on display on the day, particularly the role Greeks have played in the development of modern civilisation and democracy. I am blessed with a very large and active Greek community in my area. The two Greek Orthodox churches, St Catherine's in Mascot and St Spyridon's in Kingsford, stand as wonderful monuments to the contribution of the Greek community to multiculturalism in Australia. I want to pay tribute to those who participated in the march, in particular to the students of St Spyridon College, and thank Father Steven Scoutas, Elia Economou and Efrosini Stefanou-Haag for their wonderful contribution to multiculturalism in our community. Dillon, Ms Helene Forde Electorate: Merino Country one of my wonderful constituents, Helene Dillon, as the winner of the Heritage Bank's People First Award in their annual volunteer of the year competition. Ms Dillon, at 84, was nominated for her commitment to some 30 years of support of the elderly and people with disabilities through her work at Flexible Living. In that time, Ms Dillon has put in over 14,000 hours of voluntary work, made some 36,000 of her famous scones and supported more than 5,000 people. I would like to congratulate her for her wonderful achievements. It was a well-deserved award and she is a credit to our community, having been involved in volunteering for over 60 years. I would also like to congratulate the efforts of Merino Country, an undergarment and active wear manufacturer who uses 100 per cent merino wool. Merino Country is one of our manufacturing success stories, and they are big supporters of Dragons Abreast, a national notfor-profit registered charity for breast cancer survivors and supporters. When people purchase one of their baa bras, Merino Country make a donation to Dragons Abreast, a dragon boat paddling team. The innovative design of the baa bra has been praised by cancer patients and survivors as the most comfortable bra on the market.

My heart goes out to those who Glenn leaves behind: Linda, his wife of 31 years, and Sarah and Megan, his daughters. Glenn started his career as an apprentice mechanic with the ACT government in 1976 but moved his family to Queensland in 1994 to start a new career as a firefighter. This was a perfect position for someone with such a passion for helping the broader community. Progressing through to senior firefighter, Glenn became a mentor to many, with an ability to develop and nurture new recruits. Glenn's passion for skydiving saw him take over 10,000 jumps. He was a proficient tandem instructor and a student freefall instructor. He was well known in the skydiving community as being loyal, honest, and a brilliant teacher. He was a passionate advocate for the local community. Active in many charities, he used his other passion of cycling to assist many through various charity rides. Our local firies are such an important part of our community-and every community. Glenn was a man with a passion for ensuring we look out for each other and look after each other. He will be sorely missed, not only by those he worked with at Woodridge fire station in my electorate but by all whose lives were touched by his integrity, honesty and generosity. Petition: Energy Drinks on behalf of the Country Women's Association of New South Wales. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of concerned Country Women's Association members and members of the general public draws to the attention of the House: Our concern that dangerous 'energy drinks' are sold to minors. Energy drinks contain high amounts of caffeine mixed with ingredients like taurine, guarana, glucuronolactone and ginseng which elevates heart rate and blood pressure and disrupts sleep. To children this is dangerous, especially when these beverages can be purchased practically anywhere with no limit as to how many can be bought at the one time. These drinks are chemical concoctions in cute cans and long term effects are not yet known. We protect our children from alcohol and tobacco and believe that energy drinks should also be included on this list. We therefore ask the House to legislate to ban the sale of energy drinks to children under the age of 18 with proof of age required for purchase. from 13,287 citizens Petition received. years of age.

90,Mr Coulton,"This petition seeks to ban the sale of energy drinks to children under 18I would particularly like to mention the role that Tanya Cameron, the President of the New South Wales Country Women's Association, has played in facilitating this petition. The CWA has sought to bring this issue to the nation's agenda because energy drinks with high amounts of caffeine and other ingredients can have serious implications for the health of our young people. These drinks can have a detrimental effect on an individual's health, including insomnia, headaches, rapid heart rate, nervousness, hypertension, anxiety, diarrhoea and caffeine dependence. They have the potential to be particularly harmful to young people under the age of 18. The drinks also have the potential to disrupt schooling. I congratulate the CWA on this effective campaign to address this issue. I recommend this petition to the House. Road Safety manufacturing hub of Melbourne's west and Melbourne's ports. As a result, trucks have long been a frequent sight on our streets. When homes, schools and playgrounds are located on streets that are heavily trafficked routes for thousands of large trucks, the risk of accident is significant. This danger is increased by the physical and emotional stresses placed on many truck drivers. Many truck drivers are given unreasonable deadlines and encouraged to break speed restrictions to do their jobs. In fact, a recent study by the Transport Workers Union revealed that 31 per cent of drivers surveyed felt a pressure to exceed safe driving hours and that 11 per cent felt pressure to take stimulants just to stay awake. Work environments that produce overtired and mentally stressed truck drivers are an unacceptable risk to our community. We need to act to stop the tragedies that occur as a result of this situation. This requires looking at both the workplace demands placed on truck drivers and the infrastructure that supports them. With workplace protections, like the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, established by the previous Labor government, we can deliver safe and fair workplace conditions for truckies. With investment in infrastructure, like the West Gate distributor, promised by the state Labor opposition for my electorate, we can get 5,000 trucks a day off residential streets and onto their own roads to minimise risks to the community in Melbourne's west. I urge anyone who is concerned about truck safety in my electorate to support the TWU's safe rates campaign and to support the state Labor opposition, which will build the West Gate distributor in government. Only the Labor Party at the state and federal level has a plan to address truck safety in Melbourne's west. Western Australia Senate Election Ms MARINO (Forrest-Government Whip) (13:49): Next Saturday is a crucial date for the future of Western Australia. Voters will go back to the polls to elect six senators to represent our great state. This is an opportunity for Western Australians: it is actually another opportunity to reject the high-spending and high-taxing policies of the Labor Party. It is a chance to repudiate the party that left us with gross debt of $667 billion, thanks to $123 billion in accumulated deficits. It is an opportunity to reject the Labor and Greens taxes on Western Australia: the carbon tax and mining tax. It is the chance for Western Australian voters to help get Australia back on track and open for business. It is an opportunity to support small business by getting rid of red tape and regulations.",90,Statements By Members

I hope they see through the dalliance with minor parties, who have their own agendas that are not the interests of the state of Western Australia. Most of all, 5 April is an opportunity not to be missed to deliver a simple message to Labor and Greens: get out of the way of change for the better for Australia. I hope that message is delivered loudly and very clearly. Greek Independence Day the anniversary of the Greek War of Independence. Yesterday, the Greek community in Scullin, at their premises in Lalor, had a lunch in celebration of Greek Independence Day. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend, being here, but I am advised the event was, as usual, very well attended, with almost 150 present. Members of the Greek community have made a significant and very valuable contribution to Scullin and to the Australian community more generally. Since the mass migration of the post-war years, when the Greek community came to Australia, often with little money but with much heart, they have made an enormous contribution and reshaped Melbourne profoundly and for the better. Since becoming the Labor candidate for Scullin and now member, I have been struck by the passion and commitment of the members of the Greek community in the northern suburbs. I have also been struck by the warmth they have shown to me, despite my very poor Greek dancing! SoI pay tribute to the tireless efforts of the president, Kyriakos Aristidou; the secretary, George Tsiogris, who kindly invited me; John Chrisomalis; Con Constantineas; Heleni Argiriou; Anna Economidis; and Georgia Sahinis in particular, who arranged the lunch and did so much. I am sure the lunch ended in the traditional manner, with demonstrations of support for Greece and for Australia. And so I say: ZitoE Elarda and Zito Australia! for the dancing though!

Youth Connections Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (13:54): I rise today to speak about a very important issue in my local community, and that is the Abbott government's failure to recommit to funding for Youth Connections providers which runs out at the end of this year. Our Youth Connections program, which was created by the former Labor government in 2010, provides a crucial support network for young people in my local area. The program provides one-on-one support to help young people overcome barriers which make it difficult to participate in school or training. Workskil runs the Youth Connections program in my electorate in Hallett Cove and supports many very vulnerable young people in our local area. Nicole Dwyer from Workskil has told me she holds deep concerns about these young people's futures if the government scraps the funding. Nicole says that the young people in their program may be homeless, not eating, victims of physical or mental abuse or have mental health or drug and alcohol issues. Importantly, this program provides support for these young people and their parents, and also provides a pathway into employment. Nicole says that often the youth workers, as part of this program, are in emergency departments at night dealing with young people in crisis, and their program is very critical to preventing youth suicide. I call on the Abbott government to commit to ongoing funding for the Youth Connections program to get these vulnerable young people and their carers support and hope for the future. (Time expired) Hinkler Electorate: Holden Family the Holden family from the Elliott Heads Surf Life Saving Club in my electorate of Hinkler. Bob and Shirley are life members of the club, and Craig and Freddo are their children who now have their own generation who are members of the surf lifesaving club as well. So three generations of the Holden family are in the Elliott Heads Surf Life Saving Club. On a personal note, I would like to thank Bob and Shirley for their introduction to fundraising, because the first opportunity for me to learn as a young teenager around how it was done was at the Tattersalls Hotel in Bundaberg, selling meat raffles on a Saturday morning. Unbeknownst to me as a young teenage lifesaver, this was the only source of income for a surf club which supported up to 100 members. So $250 a week was about what they made, and at times that was all that there was. It is a wonderful effort by the family to be life members. Their son Craig has gone on to be a local branch manager, a Wide Bay Capricorn branch manager, a Queensland surf lifesaver and is well known in surf lifesaving circles. I am sure they would like to get him to Brisbane into the state centre, but that does not seem like an opportunity. I congratulate the Holdens.

Canberra Electorate: Parties at the Shops Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Service Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (13:57): One of the most successful aspects of Canberra's centenary celebrations was Parties at the Shops, celebrating Canberra's unique local shops culture. I am very pleased that Parties at the Shops has continued beyond the centenary year and is now an ongoing celebration. This weekend, the party will be at Hughes Shops, which turns 50, and I wish the Hughes residents the best of luck and I hope the rain stays away. Last SaturdayI attended the party at Narrabundah Shops, and I would like to congratulate Austin Lynch and the Old Narrabundah Community Council for a successful event. The best thing about the Parties at the Shops is that they bring together the local community. While I was at Narrabundah, I spoke to staff from the Winnunga health service, an Aboriginal community-run health service based in Narrabundah, which services the Indigenous community for the whole of the ACT and much of south-east New South Wales. Winnunga is primarily funded by the federal government, and I was very concerned to learn that its current three-year funding deal runs out at the end of this financial year, but it has not been provided with a new contract by the Abbott government. In fact, despite the best efforts of Julie Tongs and her team, Winnunga is yet to even begin the process of negotiating a new contract. As it currently stands, Winnunga's funding will run out in just three months, and there is no certainty that it will be replaced. This is simply not good enough and I call on the Abbott government to end the funding uncertainty for Winnunga as a matter of priority. Western Australia: Economy economy, its contribution to the national economy and the relevance to the Senate election coming up in one week's time. During the worse times of the global financial crisis, there was a 12-month period where 70 per cent of all the new jobs created in Australia were created in Western Australia. That occurred at the peak of the global financial crisis. It is no exaggeration to say that, had it not been for the performance of the Western Australian economy during the global financial crisis, this country would have suffered quite devastating effects. In fact, the Western Australian economy exports more to China and their economy than the entire United States, with a population not much more than the prison population of the United States-a remarkable feat for such a small place, representing only 10 per cent of the Australia population. Forty-seven per cent of all of the export income for the entire nation is generated by Western Australia. Two things started to bring this to an unfortunate and premature end. The first was the carbon tax, and the second was the mining tax. During the height of a global financial crisis, when Western Australia was saving the Australian economy, it had imposed upon it two taxes that now should absolutely be removed in the Senate. If that does not happen before this state election, there is no doubt that the people of Western Australia will pass their judgement upon that.",93,Statements By Members

This government understands that you cannot fix the economy unless you fix the budget, and a stronger budget means lower taxes and more jobs. We were very up-front with the Australian people before the election: the schoolkids bonus would go, the income support bonus would go, because you cannot give what you have not got, and you cannot give away to people what you just cannot afford. And Labor's mining tax, which is supposed to support $13 billion worth of spending, was raising just $300 million. That is why these things simply cannot be afforded. We have had $20 billion in savings before the Senate-$15 billion of coalition savings, $5 billion in Labor savings-and Labor is against all of it. They just do not get it.

In fact, they all promised there would be a surplus. There was no surplus. There is no surplus. In fact, the legacy of Labor is that over the next 10 years there is no surplus, there is no repayment of debt. So, as you can see, the Labor party legacy of debt and deficit was not just for the period they were in government; it is for as far as you can see in the years ahead$667 billion. Labor's legacy out of all of that-which they are in denial about-is that they left an economic environment with deteriorating terms of trade, with rising unemployment, and with below trend growth.

The reason these standing orders need to be suspended, Madam Speaker, is in the first instanceGovernment members interjectingsuspending standing orders. Never before in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia has someone been named for calling out 'Madam Speaker'. That is what just happened in this House. Under no definition of what is within House Practice or of history or of anything that has happened in this parliament since 1901 has anyone claimed that the words 'Madam Speaker' or ' Mr Speaker' were unparliamentary. And yet the member for Isaacs did not just get warned or thrown out; he got named for calling you 'Madam Speaker'. Yesterday, we had a member of parliament thrown out for laughing. Madam Speaker, we have spent months watching you laugh at every joke from the ministers at the expense of members of the opposition. But, somehow, that is an appropriate way to conduct the role. Madam Speaker, I do not dispute what you said before that there are times in this chamber when things are cooperative. The example you gave this morning you articulated in a way that I would not disagree with one bit. But I do disagree with your decision to make that argument from the chair before the Leader of the House decides whether or not to grant leave. The comments you made, Madam Speaker, were reasonable comments for someone on either side of the chamber to make but not reasonable if you are meant to be the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Madam Speaker, it is acknowledged on both sides of this House and throughout the country that you are a formidable parliamentarian. That is acknowledged. It is acknowledged that, for your entire time in opposition and when you have sat on those benches opposite, you have been one of the people who have been able to come to the dispatch box and launch scathing and effective attacks on us as the Labor Party. You are respected as a member of parliament for that. But we cannot support you continuing to behave that way when you want to sit in the Speaker's chair.",100,Motions

140,Mr Burke,"Madam Speaker, what has just happened in this House is worthy ofIn response to the claim of 'stunt' that I heard from the front bench, Madam Speaker, we have not rushed to this. We raised concern on the day that you were elected as Speaker. The tradition referred to in Practice-and this is why we should be suspending standing ordersthat non-executive members nominate and second the election of Speaker, and then bring the Speaker to the chair, is one of the powers of the backbench and the non-executive members of this House. That tradition was broken the moment you became Speaker. We then found on 13 November last year that, despite the Prime Minister claiming that certain words specifically were sure to be considered unparliamentary, you decided that name-calling was going to be considered legitimate in this parliament. On 19 November last year, on issues relatingA government member: Have you got a speech ready? considering that for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth someone was thrown out for saying 'Madam Speaker', everybody has to acknowledge that this farce has gone on for far too long. Madam Speaker, on 19 November last year, you reinterpreted a question asked by the member for Herbert, who had made no mention of numbers in the question. I raised a point of order, saying that there was an issue of direct relevance, and your response was: The question was one that was pertaining to numbers, as clearly was indicated by the questioner. Notwithstanding that there was no reference to that in the question at all, you came up with a new question to get around standing order 104. When we debated the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill, you waited until the moment when the opposition were moving amendments and then decided that amendments which had been flagged and had gone through the appropriate processes of checking would be disallowed by you, denying the opposition the capacity to put our amendments. We were not expecting to win the vote, but we were expecting to have our right to make our case. Madam Speaker, on 2 December last year, we had a circumstance where the Leader of the Opposition after he was given the call for one purpose went on to seek leave for another. You claimed that you had called on him to resume his seat prior to him saying, 'I seek leave,' and we asked you to check the tapes. You came back, allegedly having checked the tapes, Madam Speaker, and what you told the House was not true. You told the House that he, the Leader of the Opposition, again sought the call. The tapes do not reflect that. The tapes show the exact opposite. But, once again, the information provided to this parliament was changed so that you could pretend to be acting within the standing orders. Madam Speaker, the issue of time limits has been one where time and again we have seen ministers in this House be allowed to continue their comments for quite a period after their speaking time has elapsed. But, when an opposition member asks a question, suddenly the 30second rule is enforced-and enforced completely strictly. If you want to provide a level of lenience for government members, that is fine; it is the impartiality of the way you do this job that is at issue, Madam Speaker. To have a circumstance where leave is not granted for this motion is extraordinary. As to the action that you took today, 98 people have now been thrown out of the House by you-every one of them from the opposition. So it is 98-love. No Speaker in the history of Federation has a record like that.",101,Motions
141,Mr Burke,"We prepare a sheet most days, I am afraid. Today is the day when,We have had situations with amendments. I remember we had an amendment that I moved to a motion from the member for Denison, where you ruled, in answer to a point of order from the Leader of the House, that the amendment was too far away from the original motionnotwithstanding that on 2 December last year you allowed the Leader of the House to move an amendment to a motion from the Leader of the Opposition that completely reversed everything that was in the first motion. Madam Speaker, if I stand to raise a point of order, you wait until the minister has completed before you hear the point of order. At each issue, at each part of this, the practice that is followed is the same on every occasion. The Prime Minister is now laughing, but he will not be thrown out-nor should he be. But I can tell you that when he defends knights and dames it is really funny and we will laugh. This motion today is not one that people rush to move. On every occasion that a motion of this nature is moved-whether it is a suspension of standing orders or whether leave is not granted-it is carried forever in practice. When opposition members get to this point they do not expect to win the vote, but they do expect to have a situation where everyone in Australia knows bias when they see it. Madam Speaker, we do not doubt for one minute your effectiveness as a warrior for the Liberal Party, but that is not the job you chose to take on. Yet in the Speaker's chair you have continued to act as though enjoying the victory for your own side is your job. Madam Speaker, the parliament deserves more than that. The parliament cannot have confidence in a Speaker who refuses to be impartial. Mr Albanese: I second the motion and reserve my right to speak. Speaker, I rise to defend your position as Speaker and to speak against the motion to suspend standing orders moved by the Manager of Opposition Business. I would say to government members that we regard this vote as a vote of confidence in the Speaker. As far as the government is concerned, when the vote is taken, this will be a vote of confidence in the Speaker-and I am very confident that the Speaker will win. The fact that this is a stunt is so clearly indicated by the fact that the Manager of Opposition Business came into the chamber with a prepared speech, which he then read from throughout his 10-minute contribution to the House. Madam Speaker, the Manager of Opposition Business has been building up to this since the first day that you were elected Speaker. I would remind him that, when you were elected Speaker on 12 November last year, the Manager of Opposition Business said, 'When they all return to Hogwarts, Dumbledore is gone and Dolores Umbridge is now in charge of the school.' From the first day that you were Speaker, the Manager of Opposition Business and his cohorts on the front bench, like the member for Grayndler, the member for Isaacs, the member for Sydney and the member for Ballarat, have been deliberately trying to create an issue around the speakership by being rude, by being aggressive and by behaving quite intolerably badly towards a woman in the chair. The member for Sydney had cause to say in August 2012, about the then Leader of the Opposition, that perhaps he had trouble with strong women in public life. She said, 'I think he does find it very difficult that he's dealing with two women in positions of authority'-being then, the member for Chisholm and the then Prime Minister.

143,Mr Pyne (Sturt,"Leader of the House and Minister for Education) (14:33): MadamSpeaker, the former Leader of the Opposition never spoke to either the member for Chisholm or the former Prime Minister in the way that the member for Isaacs speaks to you in the chair. Mr Burke interjectingbully-and an aggressive one at that-and he has deliberately been trying to be rude to you from his position, with his shouting and being over the top and loud. It was all, I think, part of a deliberate strategy. May I say, Madam Speaker, that I am no sook. I was Manager of Opposition Business for five years. I was Manager of Opposition Business for three years in a hung parliament. I hold the record for being ejected from this place by Speakers in the parliament. But I never complained. I did not stand up like a great big sook-like the Manager of Opposition Business did today-and say, like one of my four children, that I had had my toy taken away from me. I know opposition is tough. Opposition is not challenging. It is not satisfying. You do not get to make any decisions. Paul Keating put it very well in a debate on a matter of public importance in response to the then member for Flinders, Mr Reith, when he said, 'Honourable members opposite have three more years of their lives trotting around in opposition, three more years in the corridors at night wandering in and out of each other's offices, having cold cups of tea at 11 o'clock.' And you have fallen silent, because you know it is true. The sadness for the opposition is that you lost the election. You have three yearshopefully more-in opposition, and you just have to get used to it. When you are in opposition, you do get thrown out of parliament more often than members of the government. When I was in government, I was thrown out of the chamber, as was the Prime Minister when he was the Leader of the House. You have to put up with it; that is the way it is. You should hold the government to account because that is what a good opposition does and the crossbenchers should do so as well. But when you speak to the Speaker, when you deal with the chair-the way you deal with the member for Mackellar is utterly unprecedented in this place. I have been here for 21 years and I am shocked and appalled, as I hope a gentleman would be, by the way you speak to the Speaker. The member for Isaacs was named today and it was thoroughly deserved. For you to move this motion of no confidence the first time the Speaker names a member is bizarre; it is ludicrous; it is over the top; it is a stunt; it is designed to hide the fact that the opposition does not have anything to say about the issues that the public care about. The opposition have nothing to say concerning issues the public care about-lowering taxation, cutting regulation, abolishing the carbon tax, reducing cost-of-living pressures on Australian families or returning the rule of law to the workplace. Therefore, the tactic of the opposition has been one of trying to create distractions from the fact that they stand for nothing. My advice to the opposition is: you have three years to learn why you lost the election in 2010 and why you lost the election in 2013. In 2010, you only hung on to power because you were able to negotiate with the crossbenches and after one term you had fewer seats than the Liberal Party and the National Party in this House. The opposition have made no effort to do the hard work, to prepare policies, to think about what they stand for.",103,Motions
144,Mr Pyne,"Not as badly, Manager of Opposition Business. The member for Isaacs is aGraham Richardson tried to give you advice in The Australian a couple of weeks ago in one of his columns. You should listen to Graham Richardson because he was part of a successful Labor government. None of you were, I know; you were part of a very failed government. It could not have been easy for former ministers sitting opposite to accept that after three years they had fewer seats on their side of the House and after six years they were thrown from office in a landslide defeat. It is hard for them to accept that, I know. But quite frankly, they have to accept it and get on with it, if they want to serve in government ever again-hopefully, a more successful government than the last one. They have to do the work. When we were in opposition, the former member for Scullin was in the chair. He lost a vote on the floor of this House by throwing out a member-it was the member for Paterson, Bob Baldwin. The Leader of the Opposition immediately moved a motion of confidence in the Speaker-immediately, straight after. The then Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, had to second the motion because Labor's instinct was not to protect the Speaker. Labor's intention was not to uphold the dignity of the office of Speaker; it was to use it as a pawn, as a negotiating tool to get the then member for Fisher to sit in the speakership and save one vote. That is how the Labor Party thinks the speakership should be treated. It did not actually work very well for them, I hate to tell them-another piece of advice. That did not go so well, did it? Unfortunately, the former member for Fisher did not measure up as well as you had hoped. The Labor Party's tactics in this place have been chaotic from day one. Their questions are very broad and should be ruled out of order, but quite frankly the Speaker has been very tolerant. If the questions being asked by the opposition had been asked by me when we were in opposition, I would never have got away with them. They are full of argument; they are full of abuse; yet the Speaker has been very tolerant and very generous. The reason the Speaker has been tolerant and generous to the opposition is that she was a very effective member of the opposition over a long period of time and has been an effective member of government. She knows that, for democracy to work, question time needs to be allowed to run, to flow. Due to her innate understanding of how our democracy works, the Speaker has allowed the opposition to get away with a great deal more than I was ever allowed to get away with when we were in opposition. Rather than trying to make a political point and distract the public from their paucity of ideas by moving this motion, the opposition should be congratulating you in the chair, Madam Speaker, because you have been much more generous to the opposition then I would be were I in your place. Woe betide that day, should it ever come! the speeches you have. My advice to the opposition is to get on with the job of opposition. As somebody once said, 'Opposition is slowly boring through hard boards,' and it is. It is not something that you can just deal with. This is a tactic, this is a stunt, this is simply designed to distract the House, the public and the people from the shabby tactics of the Labor Party. We have absolute confidence in the Speaker and, as long as the Speaker wants to serve in that role, the government will support her from this side of the House. The vote that we are about to take is a vote of confidence in the Speaker. I will be voting with the Speaker and I assume the government will be too. I ask the crossbenches to turn their backs on this shabby stunt and to support the Speaker.",104,Motions

How sad is it, having achieved his ambition, that you have chosen the low road of partisanship, rather than the high road of independence that this office demands. Madam Speaker, when you were the member for Mackellar you were very fond of the big book, House of Representatives Practice. I draw your attention to pages 163 and 164, which state a very simple principle: The Speaker must show impartiality in the Chamber above all else. That is the fundamental principle upon which the reliance and integrity of this parliament resides. Those opposite say, 'Oh, but we won the election.' That is absolutely true-there is a majority there. But there are millions of Australians who voted for us on this side and they also deserve to be represented and not be treated with contempt by the Speaker of the House of Representatives. It is one thing for this Prime Minister when he was Leader of the Opposition to want to trash the 43rd Parliament and come in here every day and move to suspend the standing orders and engage in disruptive conduct as a tactic, but it is another thing, having won the election and achieved the high office of Prime Minister, for him and his team to trash the 44th Parliament. So addicted are they to negative tactics, they engage in them. We see it every day. We saw the Prime Minister last week, while the sand was going through the hourglass for a division, looking upwards and giving directions to you, Madam Speaker, saying: 'Close the door. Close the door. Close the door.' We see, time after time, the Leader of the House give instructions to you as the chair, including today. Madam Speaker, we have a penalty count at the moment. If this were a Souths-Manly game and the penalty count was 98 to nil in favour of the home team, they would be jumping the fence. What we have day after day in this parliament is partisanship from the chair, is abuse of standing orders and is treatment of those on this side of the House with contempt. We are seeing it by this very process. We are seeing it by the process whereby those opposite are not even allowing the motion to be debated. We are having to suspend the standing orders. What they should do is allow the motion, and then it will be a vote in the confidence of your speakership. As it is, it is left hanging as a result of them not even allowing the motion to proceed. attention to it. just given a cracker of an example, Madam Speaker, of your partisanship. HereI am saying why they should be suspended so that we can have the proper debate and have a vote in your speakership, as to whether you have the confidence of the House, and you interject from the chair in order to slap that down. Today we had, in the naming of the member for Isaacs, unprecedented action taken for such a minimal statement.

We have been at pains to demonstrate that it has the wrong priorities. But this week there have been three dreadful mistakes which have, I think, pushed the opposition's message right into the core of public consciousness. There was this laughable bunyip aristocracy nonsense from the fawning attitudes of a very few in the government, who have said, when there is an economic problem like unemployment, when there is a challenge about the budget: 'What should we do? Let's create some knights and some dames.' What a very weak proposition that is. It is not just the opposition who know that that is weak. I compliment members of the government; I compliment the anonymous backbencher-not for his courage but maybe for his wisdom in staying anonymous-who said, 'This is absolutely insane.' We are having a sweep on this side on who in the government was smart enough to have thought of that; we have come up with 25 names. Then we get to the member for Herbert, Ewen Jones. To be fair, he has a good turn of phrase sometimes. He makes us laugh, at least until that is made illegal in this House! He at least said, 'I guess there are other issues that we have got to work on.' Then you have Senator Ron Boswell. In 'Boswellian' style, without necessarily a lot of words, he expressed his surprise at this development. I acknowledge the elegant understatement of the member over there, whose seat I have momentarily forgotten, Mr Broadbent. An honourable member: McMillan. from the days when the Liberal Party might have been someone you could vote for. He said it was 'an interesting surprise'. I think that is a masterful understatement. I, of course, liked what the Minister for Communications had to say last night. It was written up as 'gently mocking' the proposal-gentle! He is a known republican. I do not want him to run the next republic campaign, because we will lose it. I do know that he did say, dipping into his vast repository of republican knowledge, 'Well, they do it in Guatemala, they do it in Brazil and they do it in Peru, so why shouldn’t we do it here?' Why not indeed? I give him points for trying. The knights and dames decision is not actually the worse decision they have made this week. It is certainly the funniest one they have made this week. One of the other bad decisions is the refusal to come out with a commission of audit. That is a cowardly government. Mr Frydenberg: In good time. time is before an election.

There is a third decision, which I believe is the most reprehensible of their priorities. The contender for the third could have been the cutting of benefits to the orphans-that is just stupid. There is no debate needed on that. That is literally one of the dumbest decisions I have ever seen an arrogant mob make: 1,200 kids, $215.60 each, 'Quick, let's cut that, because we said we would.' As if they ever said they would. Find me one document where they said, '1,239 orphans or double orphans, the children of totally and permanently disabled service people, or people who have made the ultimate sacrifice, will have benefits cut'. They never said that. What an unscrupulous bunch of scallywags they are! But the worse decision this week is watering down the protections against bigotry and racism. There was some competition this week for the weakest contribution to public policy in parliament in Australia. The Prime Minister came close and, to be fair, the knights and dames decision deserves an honourable mention. But the silliest, the most outrageous and the worse statement, which I never expected to hear in the parliament, is that 'you have a right to be a bigot'-wow, a right to be a bigot!-from the Attorney-General of Australia. That must fill people who are concerned about being humiliated or vilified by racism with a lot of confidence. We have the Attorney-General of this country saying, 'There is a right to be a bigot.' I know that when the opposition raised this with the Prime Minister in question time on Tuesday there were members of the government who simply did not believe what we said. They literally thought we were making it up, because there are people of good spirit on that side, and I recognise that. There are people of good spirit on that side, Member for Hasluck. There are people of good spirit on that side, Member for Gippsland. Do not get your hopes up, Member for Kooyong-I will stop the list there. I do think he is in a difficult position; I just worry he has gone the wrong way. What is wrong about this decision is that we should not be sending the message in a multicultural nation that it is okay to be a bigot. It is never okay to be a racist and it is never okay to be a bigot. Let me draw to the attention of the House Premier O'Farrell's comments. He has called the Abbott Liberal government for its disgraceful attitude. Premier O'Farrell said today: Bigotry should never be sanctioned, whether intentionally or unintentionally. Vilification on the grounds of race or religion is always wrong. There is no place for inciting hatreds within our Australian society Premier O'Farrell has said that bigotry should never be sanctioned, whether intentionally or unintentionally. Where on earth does that put the Attorney-General of Australia? Premier O'Farrell said what millions of Australians think, what every man and woman on this side of the parliament thinks and what tens of thousands of members of the public listening to Parliament know: it is not okay to be a bigot. When the Attorney-General of Australia says there is a right to be a bigot, that is a wrong priority. When they want to lower the protections in 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, when they want to disarm the guardians of protecting, all Australians, those are wrong priorities. When you are an Australian, it should not matter your religion, it should not matter your gender, and it certainly should not matter your ethnicity. I am proud of the fact that nearly 27 in every 100 Australians were born overseas. I am proud of the fact that, since 1945, we have brought 7.5 million Australians here to become Australian citizens. I am proud that, in my electorate of Maribyrnong, 51 in every 100 Australians has a language other than English at home. I am very proud of the fact that this is the most migrant nation in the world. I am not proud of the Attorney-General of Australia. I am not proud of the Abbott Liberal government changing the laws. I do not accept that bigotry is okay. I agree with Premier O'Farrell. I agree, in this case, with Warren Mundine, who described the whole thing as quite offensive. I agree with Vic Alhadeff, the Chief Executive Officer of the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies, that it is a retrograde step that significantly weakens protections. I agree with Colin Rubenstein, head of the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council, that to pass the amendments as they stand would risk emboldening racists. I also happen to agree with the million Australians who visited our Facebook to express their concern about racism. This is the week of freedom of speech, but when you have the Attorney-General of Australia advocating the right of people to be bigots, that is not freedom of speech-that is abuse of freedom of speech. This week we have seen a government with wrong priorities: this facile distraction of honours-of knights and dames-and the unwillingness to reveal the Commission of Audit. This is a shifty, sneaky government with the wrong priorities. If they will persist in defending the right of people to be bigots and trampling the rights of others, we will oppose them every day until the next election. (Time expired) It is a great privilege to speak on this MPI. I was going to start by speaking about our economic record, but the Leader of the Opposition raises the issue of multiculturalism. I want to say that, on this side of the House, we are pleased and proud that the first Indigenous member of the House of Representatives is our colleague, Ken Wyatt. We on this side of the House are proud that, if we won every seat at the last election, the most common name in the party room of the coalition would have been Nguyen. We are proud, on this side of the House, that I, the member for Kooyong, am the first ever Jewish Liberal member of the House of Representatives. We are proud, on this side of the House, that the Father of the House, Phillip Ruddock, has done more than anyone in this parliament to support immigrant communities and to uphold the values that we hold dear. We will not be lectured in this House by the sanctimonious Leader of the Opposition who tells us that they understand migrant communities better than we do. We have a very proud record that goes back to the start of Federation. The member for Kooyong in the 1930s, Sir John Latham, was the first ever foreign minister to go to Asia on a designated trip. Malcolm Fraser opened the doors to thousands and thousands of Vietnamese boat people to come to this country, and John Howard lifted immigration to the highest records this country has ever known. That is the proud record of my party and this Prime Minister, and we will not be lectured by the other side. I have come to this dispatch box to do more than defend the record of this government. I have come to inform the opposition that we have had to correct the economic mess that they left us after six disastrous years in government. I remind the House that the Labor Party, under the Rudd and Gillard governments, gave us not only three Prime Ministers in less than",115,Matters Of Public Importance
219,Mr Frydenberg (Kooyong,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (15:26):six years, multiple foreign ministers and defence ministers, and six ministers for small business but also the disasters of Fuelwatch, GroceryWatch, 'cash for clunkers', the overpriced school halls, the pink batts disaster and record debt and deficit. That is your legacy of five and a half years in government-$667 billion of debt over the coming decade. That is the equivalent of $23,000 for every Australian man, woman and child, and a $12 billion annual interest bill. I can inform those opposite that, when we were in government, we had zero government debt. We paid back your $96 billion of debt, but we did not have to fork out $12 billion every year just to pay the interest on your bill. That is the equivalent of more than 12 teaching hospitals every year that could be built around Australia. That is more than the East West Link and more than the National Disability Insurance Scheme-and that is just the price of your debt. And, what is more, under the previous Labor government we had more than 200,000 unemployed. Those on this side of the House would know that the number of long-term unemployed people-people who are unemployed for more than 52 weeks-doubled under the past Labor government. Youth unemployment went from 19 to 27 per cent; one in 10 jobs in manufacturing was lost. And childcare clinics, GP superclinics and trade training centres were always promised but never delivered. I want to tell you what the 10 priorities have been for the Abbott government in just the six months we have been in government. The first has been paying back the debt. We have more than $20 billion in savings sitting before the Senate. We have commissioned Tony Shepherd to produce a commission of audit which will allow us to go about fixing the fiscal mess that they left us. Second, we are about reintroducing the Australian Building and Construction Commission, which is a cop on the beat. In 2004 there were 224 days lost for every 1,000 employees due to industrial disputation, but just two years later, in 2006-as a result of the ABCC-that was cut from 224 to just 24 days. It was a $6 billion annual productivity dividend to the Australian people. We are also having the royal commission into union malfeasance, because we need to get to the bottom of that mess. The third priority for us is about serious tax reform and abolishing the punishing carbon tax and the mining tax that produces no revenue. In Western Australia, as they come before an election in the coming week, they know that getting rid of the carbon tax and the mining tax will be a green light to investment in that state. And we are committed to serious tax reform in commissioning a white paper-because under Labor they had the Henry Tax Review, and the only recommendation they took up was the disastrous mining tax. Do you know that in Australia we have 125 taxes? And 115 of those taxes produce just 10 per cent of the revenue. We have 10 taxes that produce 90 per cent of the revenue. We are over-taxed at the different levels of government. We need genuine tax reform. The fourth area we are going to focus on is trade. We have already made major steps forward with South Korea, and the Prime Minister's upcoming trip to South Korea will be an important stamp on that free trade agreement. We are also proceeding abreast with Japan and with China. The fifth priority is about infrastructure. This Prime Minister is going to be the Infrastructure Prime Minister-$6.7 billion for the Bruce Highway, $5.6 billion for the Pacific Highway, $1½ billion for the East West Link in Victoria, and $1½ billion for WestConnex. They are some of the major infrastructure spending proposals that we are going to carry through. Sixth is education, which is a major priority for us, because we have restored $1.2 billion that Labor ripped out of the school budgets. We are better for schools than they will ever be. Seventh is boats. We are about stopping the boats-it is 98 days since the last unauthorised boat arrival. More than 50,000 unauthorised arrivals came on Labor's watch. More than $11 billion was blown in the budget and, tragically, more than 1,000 people lost their lives at sea. And as the Prime Minister told the House today, four detention centres have now closed. The eighth priority is victims of terrorism. The Prime Minister made it very clear that one of his first actions on coming into government would be to ensure that victims of terrorism after 10 September 2001 would be able to accept a payment from the government. That was an incredibly important initiative by the Prime Minister. Ninth is the NBN. What a mess the Labor Party left us with the NBN. Those on this side of the House know that nearly six years have passed-$7 billion has been spent-but only three per cent of the NBN rollout has been completed. Shame on you, Labor Party. Senator Conroy, who has made a fool of himself in relation to the Defence Force, had absolutely wrecked the NBN rollout, and it is now up to Malcolm Turnbull, the Minister for Communications, to clean up that mess. In my last minute I want to talk about the 10th priority for this government-and it is no surprise to those on this side of the House. It is about cutting red and green tape. We had a successful repeal day where we got rid of more than 10,000 acts and regulations that were dragging down productivity, dragging down innovation, and were a drag on investment and the creation of jobs. We have avoided duplication between the state and federal levels, we have streamlined existing processes, and we are trying to remove ourselves from the nanny state that Labor created. We are determined to free up the private sector and the not-for-profit sector to do what they do best: to employ people and to help those most in need. This government is a government of action. This government is a government with a proud record, and we will not be lectured to by the other side, who gave us six of the worse years of government this country has ever seen. this government, we have seen its priorities. We have seen a government introduce a scheme so anachronistic that not even John Winston Howard thought it was a good idea, and he has distanced himself from it. We have seen a government embrace old imperial honours that have been gone for almost 30 years, but a government that today trashed the Westminster tradition in this House for their own partisan advantage. They love tradition when it comes to honours for themselves, but they hate tradition when it comes to a fair parliament. But even more than that, we have seen their priorities when it comes to the budget. We have seen them playing partisan politics with the budget just as they have played partisan politics with the traditions of this parliament. This is a very transparent game. We have called it for what it is, and we will continue to call it for what it is. It is a transparent game to inflate the projections on budget deficits, for their own cheap and tawdry partisan politics. They are talking down the national economy for their own cheap political gains. How are they doing this? We have seen it on display in the House this week. We had the Treasurer's mid-year economic forecast. He was beating his chest, huffing and puffing as he so likes to do, with big numbers on budget deficits. However, when you look at the analysis, one deficit after another has been added to by this government as a result of their own",117,Matters Of Public Importance
220,Mr Bowen (Mcmahon) (15:36,"This week, perhaps more than in any other week ofdecisions-$68 billion worth has been added to the budget deficits over the projection period, more than doubling the deficit. How have they done this? Just have a look at what happened in the House this week. We had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ask a very straightforward question to the Prime Minister: 'What is the government's policy on overseas development assistance, and when will they meet the target of 0.5 per cent of gross national income?' The Prime Minister gave an honest answer. He said it is an aspiration. We would like to get there one day, but not until the budget is back in surplus. Fair enough, that is government policy. But what does the government's budget document say? What does their mid-year economic forecast very clearly say, in black and white? It says that target will be met at the cost of billions of dollars in 2017-18, and it is not even government policy. Why would that be the case? Why would the Treasurer-this is his document with his name on it-have that written into the mid-year economic forecast when it does not represent the government's position to inflate the deficit by billions of dollars? We have also seen the Treasurer fail at the dispatch box to defend his projections on company profits-growing at nine per cent per annum, but he cut the projections to a quarter of their long-run average to try to reduce the projections on government revenue and make the deficits bigger. We have also seen the $9 billion transfer to the Reserve Bank of Australia, which was not asked for, not requested, but gifted by this Treasurer to inflate the budget deficit, and that in the hope of getting dividends from the Reserve Bank of Australia in future years. Those are the lengths this Treasurer will go to. This is not a Treasury position and it is not a Department of Finance position. These are all decisions of the Treasurer of Australia. We have even see him change the methodology for forecasting unemployment-the same methodology that applied when I was Treasurer, that applied when the member for Lilley was Treasurer and that applied when Peter Costello was Treasurer. But, no, that methodology is not good enough for this Treasurer. He had to change it in order to inflate the budget deficit yet again. As much as $68 billion has been added to the budget deficits by changes in the economic assumptions and by the spending decisions of the Treasurer. Why would they do this? What game are they playing? It is very clear what they are doing here. They are inflating the budget deficits for two reasons. First, to soften up the Australian people for cuts they always intended to make; cuts they always in their hearts wanted to make; cuts that they kept secret during the election campaign; cuts that are contained in a 900page document that the Prime Minister has seen, the Treasurer has seen, the Minister for Finance has seen, but not even the rest of the Cabinet has seen-let alone the voters of Western Australia, who will go to the polls in a couple of weeks without the benefit of knowing what their government has in store. The second reason is to help their attempt to mislead the Australian people about the legacy of the previous government, for their own cheap and tawdry purposes. I give credit to Peter Costello for introducing the Charter of Budget Honesty Act, and that means this game is false, because the days of a Treasurer playing this game are gone. The state of the budget, inherited by this government, was in the pre-election economic forecast. Anything the Treasurer has done since are his tawdry games. importance and we have heard from the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition. We on this side of the House look at those former members of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments, and I have to say it is as competitive as an Olympic 100-metre final. It really is, but for all the wrong reasons. It is a photo finish as to who has the worse policy record. We sat here during the interrupted question time thinking: who could have penned this Matter of public importance? It is a matter of public importance that is based on the premise that the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments made the right choices and had the right priorities for Australia. You can argue with us, but do not argue with the outcome of the election, which was an endorsement of the choices and priorities that are now being pursued by members on this side so that we can restore what Labor damaged or destroyed. For the shadow Treasurer to stand here and lecture this side of the House on budget ethics, budget honesty, or budget competence is absolutely astounding. But as I said before, they are nothing if not unembarrassable. The member for Lilley rightly cops a lot of opprobrium from this side of the House. He is easily the worse Treasurer in our nation's history. I do not say that lightly. I say that after reflecting on even the Whitlam government Treasurers. They might have been as bad, but he had longer to do more damage, and damage he did. Now we have the Labor Party, watching the government in this House, on behalf of the Australian people, clean up the mess Labor caused. We have to deal with Labor's chaos. They complain about the clean-up. It is absolutely unbelievable, particularly for the shadow Treasurer, who began back in 2007 as the Assistant Treasurer, to be lecturing on policy competence. His first three acts were: Fuelwatch, and it was a fool watch; Grocery Choice; and the employee share schemes debacle. After the shocker of the employee share schemes and the fall of Fuelwatch, he then caps it off in his last months as Treasurer in the Rudd government. And what is he going to be remembered for in that campaign? For misleading and misrepresenting Treasury costings documents. The Treasury themselves, together with the Department of Finance, in an unprecedented move in an election campaign, belled the cat on the shadow Treasurer. Then you look at what happened with the budget. The previous speaker on this side went through-and no doubt the next speakers on this side will go through it again, as they should-Labor's dramatic fiscal failure. It was absolutely unbelievable-and for the shadow Treasurer to be lecturing! He talked about the Reserve Bank replenishment. He did not talk about the Reserve Bank Reserve Fund. You only need to look at the words of the Governor of the Reserve Bank. I know my friend and colleague the member for Higgins, on the Standing Committee on Economics, has asked many questions on this very point. It requires a certain human capacity to ignore the truth with a straight face, to actually ignore documents signed off by the Reserve Bank governor. This is a special skill that those opposite have. I do not know whether they go to a factory to learn this skill or whether they are programmed with this skill, but they have this great capacity to look people in the eye and say, 'Collingwood won last year's grand final.' They just say it with such conviction. But the Reserve Bank governor-it is in black and white, as the member for Higgins will outline-said, 'Don't take a dividend; don't run down the Reserve Bank Reserve Fund.' He is only the Reserve Bank",119,Matters Of Public Importance
221,Mr Tony Smith (Casey) (15:41,"We have seen the wording of this matter of publicgovernor; what would he know! It is there in black and white. He wrote to the Treasurer saying, 'Don't do it.' Then they mount some argument that the Reserve Bank Reserve Fund should not be replenished. This is the last sitting day before the budget. What Labor have demonstrated is that they are just as fiscally incompetent as they were six months ago. Dr CHALMERS (Rankin) (15:46): Thank you for the call, Deputy Speaker Scott. This place would be a much fairer place if you were in charge full time, so we are very pleased to have you in the chair. It could not be any less fair, so we are very pleased to be joining you this afternoon. This week the government discovered time travel. We went back in time to the nostalgic world that the Prime Minister occupies, the black-and-white world where it is okay to be a bigot. Ms O'Dwyer: Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I ask that you draw the speaker's attention to the fact that he should not reflect upon the chair, which he has done in his opening statement here today. I ask him to withdraw. personal comment, I think. There is no point of order. Dr CHALMERS: Let me reword it and say that the Deputy Speaker is a very fair man. We returned this week and the government discovered time travel. We went back in time to this black-and-white nostalgic world that the Prime Minister occupies, a world where it is okay to be a bigot, where people are walking around tugging the forelock-'M'Lord, M'Lady', all this sort of crazy stuff-a world of dirt roads clogged up with carriages, with servants, with women like the member for Higgins knocking on the door of the cabinet room, locked out of the cabinet room. That is the world that our Prime Minister operates in. One of the Prime Minister's heroes is Margaret Thatcher, of course. She said famously, in a great quote, that she did not have a reverse gear. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister does not have any gears that go forwards. He is unlike Margaret Thatcher in that respect. It must been devastating for a retro Prime Minister like our own to see that not even John Howard could be as old-fashioned as he was. You are in trouble when John Howard is calling you old fashioned! The truth is that Australia does have a whole range of challenges, and they lie in the future, not in the past. Our challenges are not found 50 or 100 years ago; they lie in the future. We have an uncertain labour market. We have all the things that flow from the massive middleclassing of Asia-all the challenges and opportunities that brings, all of the changing industrial base, all of what it means for global inequality, all of what rising technology means for training, for human capital and all these sorts of things. How we respond to these big global pressures will really determine whether in the future we rise or fall as a nation. These are the crucial issues that we have got. The member for Wakefield was right to say before that our current Prime Minister makes Joe Lyons look progressive, but I want to comment on something that the Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, said, because I also agree with that. He said that the Australian people want us focused on jobs, the economy, growth and prosperity. I could not agree more, but what have we got instead? We have got a Prime Minister sitting around dreaming of knights and dames and all the rest of it. The Treasurer was right to say we should be on about",121,Matters Of Public Importance
222,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Bc Scott,"It was not a reflection on the chair. It was ajobs. The Prime Minister is sitting in his office under the portrait of the Queen, thinking about knights and dames. That is really the problem that we have got with his priorities and his choices. I read in the paper today that somebody said of the Attorney-General that he has drunk the right-wing Kool-Aid. The truth is that the whole show over that side must have drunk the right-wing Kool-Aid. You can imagine them sitting around clinking their glasses-'Servant, bring me more Kool-Aid, I tell you!'-and drinking the Kool-Aid. My point about this is: you can drink the right-wing Kool-Aid if you want, but do not make the whole country drink it. Some of us want to get on with dealing with the big challenges in our community. More than any other week, this week shone the light on the bad choices and wrong priorities of the government. Yes, some of it was pretty funny, as my colleague at the table here, the member for Franklin, found. Some of it was a bit funny, but a lot of it was really serious. The priorities are so skewed in this government. There are serious problems: a PPL scheme that gives $75,000 to the wealthiest mums; tax breaks for the people at the very top of the income scale-all at the same time as they are cutting money for orphans. They are introducing a GP tax. They are attacking cleaners, via repeal day. They are attacking charities. They are attacking seniors who want good financial advice. This all shows how skewed their priorities are. As the member for McMahon, the shadow Treasurer, said, this Treasurer has doubled the deficit-he has added $68 billion to the deficit. When he has got a problem like this in his budget, in his MYEFO, we have got a government running around talking about knights and dames. That is really the problem. Australians want a government with the right policies, with the right choices and with an eye to the future. Unfortunately for them, the big shame is that, instead of that, they have got this lot. matter of public importance, which I think is about pots calling kettles black or great cases of irony in parliament. This is one. I follow the member for Rankin, and I suppose I can be grateful for one thing-that, unlike his predecessor, he is not going to burst into song. We are being lectured here by members of the opposition about the government making the right choices. This is the party that gave us a carbon tax that went through to the power points of every home and every business in Australia. This is the government that gave us a carbon tax that means that the pensioners in my electorate now in wintertime stay in bed all day because they cannot turn on their heaters. This is the party that organised a mining tax that generated no income and then spent the income it did not generate and plunged the economy further into debt. This is the party that, in 2008, changed the border protection policy. I can remember sitting here in 2008-as is my lot in life I was probably sitting in this very spot in 2008; I have not gone very far-and listening to the speeches from the then government side talking about how it was changing the way that we were going to handle illegal migrants. Since that time, we have had over 1,000 deaths and 50,000 people turn up unannounced on our doors. I can still remember that day. There are some days that are imprinted in my memory. That was the day that the government changed a policy that worked into a policy that was a disaster, with the amount of grief, heartache, anxiety and pain that it caused. This is the party that is trying to lecture this government about the right choices.",122,Matters Of Public Importance
223,Mr Coulton (Parkes,"The Nationals Chief Whip) (15:51): I speak today on thisWe have made some strong choices in the last six or so months. Despite the fact that we are getting opposition in the Senate, we have made the choice to scrap the world's biggest carbon tax. We are scrapping the mining tax and we are fixing the budget, which was in an endless spiral downhill. We are going to make the tough decisions that are needed to get this country back on track. This, indeed, is a daunting task, but it is one that we are up for. Our Prime Minister has shown incredible leadership. He has not chosen to take the populist path of the three previous prime ministers; he has shown strong leadership, he has shown restraint, he has shown dignity and he has shown that, indeed, he is a statesman in guiding this country back on track. In a bit over a week's time, the people of Western Australia have to make a choice. They have to make a choice in their half-Senate election as to whether they want to support the chaos that is the opposition side. Will they support the candidates from this little fairyland that sits up behind me? Will they support the candidate from the Palmer United Party? Clive Palmer has shown that he is the biggest distraction in Canberra but is completely irrelevant to what goes on in this place. The people in Western Australia have a choice to make. Do they want stable government? Do they want a Senate that is going to scrap the carbon tax and scrap the mining tax? Supporting the Roads to Recovery program would be a nice start from those opposite. Are we going to get a Senate on 1 July with Western Australian senators that can actually govern for the country and not for some ginger group, as we are seeing? I suggest that the people in Western Australia should look at the coalition ticket-at the Liberal ticket and, particularly, at the National ticket. If they want to vote for the National Party, they should think of Shane Van Styn. Shane Van Styn would be a wonderful advocate for Western Australia in this place. Shane Van Styn will not be playing stunts out on the front lawn with these people behind me. Shane Van Styn will not be bound to the ginger groups from the left, as the opposition is. Shane Van Styn will bring strong representation from the west and get our country back on track. Ms CLAYDON (Newcastle) (15:56): I rise today to speak on today's matter of public importance: The Abbott Government's failure to make the right choices and pursue the right priorities for Australia's future. Yes, we have seen the government time and time again prove that their priorities are in the wrong place. The list is long-way too long for the five minutes I have today-so let's just focus on a few. Just this week, of course, we saw the infamous knights and dames announcement. This came off the back of the $75,000 gold-plated paid parental leave scheme that the Prime Minister announced, albeit not necessarily with his cabinet's support; the cutting of funding and access to our local schools; and, of course, the giving of a green light to bigotry in Australia through changes to the Racial Discrimination Act. And that is just for this week. On the proposed changes to the Racial Discrimination Act, I think it is worth quoting an article from The Age today. I believe my colleague the member for Rankin made reference to it earlier. Quoted in the article is an unnamed source that was, however, clearly identified as a government minister, reflecting on the Attorney-General's controversial changes to the race hate laws. He says: George has really drunk the right-wing Kool-Aid. AndI would suggest the Kool-Aid has been pretty free flowing from the taps in the offices of those opposite. It is the only way that I can explain some of their decisions. Honestly, does the government think that the Australian people want their elected representatives to be hiding 900 pages of deep cuts from the public? We know that the Commission of Audit has been sitting on the desk of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer for nearly six weeks, but the publicparticularly the voters of Western Australia-have absolutely no idea what is in store for them. Does this government think that the Australian people want their representatives to provide extravagant rewards for a small segment of the community as part of the gold-plated paid parental leave scheme at the expense of providing shelter and services for the homeless in our communities? Does this government think that the Australian people want a government to slap a new tax on them every time they go to see their GP, making health care less and less accessible and undoing the universality of Medicare-the quintessential goal of every Liberal government that has ever sat in this House? Do they think that the Australian people want representatives to strip away funding from infrastructure projects? We have already seen the government cut half a billion dollars from infrastructure projects in Western Australia. Do the government really think that the Australian people want a Treasurer and a government prepared to cynically manipulate the budget in order to create a distorted picture of the state of the budget in order to justify their severe cuts to essential services? Independent advice from the Parliamentary Budget Office has shown that the decision by the government to ditch the previous government's fiscal rules dramatically inflated the level of net debt by an incredible $260 billion-and, as we heard time and time again today, $68 billion of that is in this term of this government alone. It is absolutely this Treasurer's own problem. It is his spending priorities and his changed economic assumptions that have added $68 billion of new debt-doubling the deficit under this Treasurer's watch. There is no-one else to blame; that is his doing. So here we are with dramatic inflation of the state of the budget, which buys into the government rhetoric of requiring massive ideological cuts in the upcoming budget. We have already had some warning bells ringing about needing to scale back the alleged unaffordability of the National Disability Insurance Scheme-a scheme which this government assured us had bipartisan support. But everyone is fearful that this softening up of the unaffordability of this scheme is in fact paving the way for it to be scaled back. In my electorate of Newcastle, which is a national launch site, this is a major issue and it is very stressful for carers and families in the region. And what about this trumped up 'repeal day'? It is nothing more than a distraction from cuts to protections for seniors, consumers, workers and investors. What about jobs? This government has no plan to save Australian jobs or to save Australian industry. It is a government willing to sit back and watch the ship-building industry in my electorate and many others go the same way as the automotive industry. An opposition member interjectingMs CLAYDON: It is a shame. It is time that this government got itself together and started focusing on the issues important to the people of Australia. We want a plan for Australian jobs. We want a plan for Australian industry. We want a plan for a future-not looking back. Ms O'DWYER (Higgins) (16:01): I have to say that I am really delighted to be able to speak on this matter of public importance, which focuses on the right priorities and the right choices for Australia's future. I find it pretty extraordinary that those opposite would dare to come into this place and try to suggest that somehow we on this side of the parliament are not facing up to the right priorities and the right future for this country. It takes a particular front. As my mother would say, 'They have more front than Myer.' I will give you a couple of examples as to how this is so. If you cast your minds back to the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd ALP-Greens government over their six years, you will note that their priorities were on spin, not substance. Let me take you to their focus, the thing that they lauded that they would do in government-tax reform. They said that they were going to have the most comprehensive tax reform that this nation has ever seen and they appointed Ken Henry for this task. It cost $10 million, we saw 123 recommendations and they sat on that report for more than four months. So what happened? Well, not very much. Less than a handful of those recommendations were adopted. Instead, what they did-these people who proclaimed that they were going to reform the tax systemwas bring in one large tax, in the carbon tax, and one not so large tax, in the mining tax. Let me take you to the carbon tax. They promised not to bring in a carbon tax. Before the election, they promised not to do it and they brought it in after the election-a $9 billion a year tax; a $9 billion a year hit on business and households. On average, Australian households will be paying $550 more because of this tax. Shame on those opposite, who would increase the cost of living for Australians-Australians who are trying to do their best and work hard and provide for their families. What about the mining tax? There were five different versions. They got out the white-out and the sticky tape and they put it all together-and what did they come up with? They came up with a mining tax which, really, on a good day is going to raise around $300 million; yet they had spent against this mining tax more than $13 billion. Those opposite simply cannot add up. The figures do not match. This is why we have such a budget problem-a budget problem that we have inherited, that we will need to repair come May. Our priority of course in this place has been to cut both in government-to cut the carbon tax and to cut the mining tax. We were successful in this House. No thanks to those opposite, we did pass legislation to cut the mining tax and to cut carbon tax. But what happened in the Senate? In the Senate we were not successful, because we were blocked. We were blocked by the Labor Party on our priorities. We were blocked by the Greens-their coalition partnersbecause they did not accept the mandate that we were given at the Australian election to get rid of both of these taxes that are a huge impost on this country. So we are trying, but we have seen from the Labor Party that their priority is not to do what the Australian people have asked them to do. Their priority in this place has been to play games. We saw no better example today than their attack on the Speaker, Bronwyn Bishop-a fine Speaker. Their attack on Bronwyn Bishop in this place today will go down in history-go down in infamy-because of their priorities to wreck and to distract. In the remaining 30 seconds that I have here I want to say that we have been successful in so many ways in being able to do the things that need to be done for this country. We are compassionate towards asylum seekers. That is why we do not want to see more asylum seekers die on the journey, at sea. That is why we have brought into place Operation Sovereign Borders. We have brought in Operation Sovereign Borders and, as Gillian Triggs, President of the Human Rights Commission, said, no people have died at sea on our watch, because we have stopped the boats. In 98 days that is what we have done. Ms BUTLER (Griffith) (16:06): As the Leader of the Opposition said in his great speech yesterday, a government's priorities can determine whether people are the victims of change or its beneficiaries. That is why the choices the government must make in its upcoming budget are so important. The Abbott government's failure to make the right choices and pursue the right priorities for Australia's future is a matter of great public importance. Only a government with twisted priorities would be spending time and energy establishing knighthoods when it should be working on improving education for this country's future. Only a government with twisted priorities would set up a $5.5 billion Paid Parental Leave scheme when it should be making quality child care accessible and affordable. Instead we are talking about a $5.5 billion Paid Parental Leave scheme that will give women on high incomes, parents on high incomes $75,000 each when they have a child-that is, $75,000 for a single individual under this $5.5 billion Paid Parental Leave scheme. It is a twisted priority. Only a government with twisted priorities would devote resources to remove protections from hate speech, when it should be addressing community concerns about funding for services. Only a government with twisted priorities would set up a slush fund to pay polluters, when it should be introducing an ETS. Only a government with twisted priorities would spend its time trying to work out how to wind back consumer protections, when it should be trying to work out a plan for jobs in this country. Last week the Prime Minister said: … regulatory burdens around what are ethical givens are, I think, a classic case of regulatory overkill. He was talking about the obligation to act in the best interests of clients of financial planners. I do not think that is overkill. Consumer protection is more important than ever. This week is the anniversary of the liquidation of Storm Financial-a sobering reminder of the need for regulation and protection. We know that retirees and mum and dad investors are burnt by the failure to provide consumer protections. I also know about that from being a Queenslander. AndI know that, like Queenslanders, Western Australians understand the need for consumer protection laws. The collapse of Westpoint led to $388 million in losses to investors. The Abbott government's retreat this week from removing consumer protections is a positive thing for our community. But let us hope this is not just a stopgap to avoid further scrutiny in the lead-up to the Western Australian Senate by-election. The retreat on this issue should give this government an opportunity to reflect on its twisted priorities. Like many in this place, and like my community on the south side of Brisbane, I am dismayed at the Abbott government's choices and its failure to work out what the real priorities are for this country. This government said that it would create one million jobs, but when you look at the actions of this government, you see that jobs are not their priority. Since this government has been elected, we have seen 60,000 full-time jobs being lost-that is, 5,000 jobs lost at Qantas; 2,500 direct jobs lost at Toyota; 2,900 direct jobs lost at Holden; 1,100 Rio Tinto jobs lost up at Gove; 544 jobs lost at Electrolux in Orange; 110 jobs lost at Simplot; more than 200 jobs at Peabody; 200 jobs at Caterpillar; and many other indirect jobs have been lost. Sadly, we know there will be more indirect job losses as a consequence. If jobs were a priority for this government, why has it turned its back on providing support for training the future workforce of this country? Mr Abbott has already broken his promise that there would be no cuts to education by cutting $1 billion from the trades training centres. We have not even seen what Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey have in store for this country under the 'commission of cuts'. The government has had the Commission of Audit report for a very long time, since just before the Griffith by-elections. I am very concerned that the record reflects that the government had that Commission of Audit report before that by-election. Did it release the cuts before that by-election? No, the government did not. Will it release the cuts before the Western Australian Senate by-election? This is the chance that the government has to, at least in part, make up to Australian voters for its failure to tell voters before the Griffith by-elections what cuts it was considering. Why does the Abbott government not now tell Western Australian voters what cuts it is considering in the Commission of Audit? Why does it not come clean with the Western Australian voters? is not implementing the right priorities for Australia. The Prime Minister, as leader of the coalition, took a very clear plan to the election last year and he is now getting on with the job. Our plan included building a stronger economy so that everyone can get ahead, abolishing the carbon tax, ending the waste, stopping the boats and building the roads of the 21st century. These key issues were and are important to all Australians. If we look at what the coalition inherited from Labor's gross incompetence, we can see that the coalition has taken on an enormous responsibility in fixing Labor's mess. Labor's legacy to Australia is: 200,000 more unemployed, gross debt projected to rise to $667 billion, $123 billion in cumulative deficits, more than 50,000 illegal arrivals by boat and the world's biggest carbon tax. If we break down each of the points in the coalition's plan to fix this mess, we can see that at every step Labor has blocked the legislation introduced by the coalition. This legislation included repealing the carbon tax, repealing the mining tax, temporary protection visas to stop the boats and building vital infrastructure that Australia needs, with particular reference to the Roads to Recovery program. I will deal with these on a point by point basis. The government introduced and passed legislation in the House to abolish the carbon tax, which will save the average Western Australian family $550 on their power bills and up to 10 per cent on the cost of electricity for small business. The legislation is currently being blocked in the Senate by the Labor Party and their Green allies. In Western Australia, ALP Senate No. 1 candidate Joe Bullock declared that the Labor Party would be scrapping the carbon tax, yet on the same day, here in Canberra, the Labor Party voted to block it. Repealing the mining tax: the government introduced and passed legislation to abolish the mining tax. My electorate of O'Connor has numerous mining and resources companies that are critically important to the economy of the region, the state and the nation. This mining tax has destroyed the confidence in the capital markets and seen greenfields exploration come to a virtual halt. This is a tax on investment and jobs. It is an anti-Western Australia tax. This",123,Matters Of Public Importance
224,Mr Wilson (O'connor) (16:11,"I rise to dispel any notion that the Abbott governmentlegislation is currently being blocked in the Senate by the Labor Party and their Green allies, threatening Australia's economy. When it comes to stopping the boats, the coalition promised in last year's election that we would stop the boats, and we have. Operation Sovereign Borders has seen a dramatic reduction in asylum seekers coming to Australia. It has been 98 days since a boat successfully arrived on our shores. In the last four months of the Rudd and Gillard governments, 174 boats with 12,603 asylum seekers arrived. Yet still the Labor Party block our efforts to re-introduce temporary protection visas in the Senate. Building the vital infrastructure that Australia needs: this government is delivering the biggest infrastructure agenda in Australia's history with the $35.5 billion Infrastructure Investment Program that will build the vital road and rail projects to improve efficiency, boost productivity and drive Australia's economy forward. In this program there is a commitment to the Roads to Recovery Program, locking in its future for a further five years with $1.75 billion of funding. I have spoken this week about the importance of the Roads to Recovery Program because it provides vital funding to local governments for the maintenance of the nation's local road infrastructure. However, this too is in jeopardy because the opposition has vowed to block it in the Senate. In my electorate alone, if Labor continues to block this program, $18 million worth of investments in vital roads will be lost. In WA the Abbott government has made a major investment in road projects, including $308 million for the Great Northern Highway, $686 million for Gateway WA, $615 million for the Swan Valley bypass, $140 million for the Tonkin Highway upgrade, $174 million for the North West Coastal Highway and $42 million for the Great Eastern Highway in my electorate between Coolgardie and Bullabulling. The coalition is so committed to these plans that, despite the revenue from the mining tax not appearing, these projects will go ahead. This is once again an example of the coalition fixing Labor's mess. Finally, I want to say to the people of Western Australia that we have a great opportunity on 5 April to return three Liberal senators to help the coalition get its legislation through the Senate and allow this government to deliver the plan we took to the people and get on with building the economy of this nation and, more particularly, Western Australia.

225,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Bc Scott,"Order! The discussion is now concluded.to which the following amendment was moved: That all the words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading the House notes the: (1) program will be deeply flawed in its design and implementation given the poor environmental record of the current Government; (2) bill provides insufficient protections for participants in the areas of occupational health and safety, workers compensation and rehabilitation; (3) Government should clarify why participants do not have employee status even though they are to be removed from the social security system and paid an equivalent training wage; (4) Government must provide assurance that the Green Army Program will not displace or reduce employment opportunities for existing workers; (5) lack of detail of the training provisions in the program, namely specified minimum hours, provision of accredited recognised training and opportunities for ongoing training and career pathways; and (6) importance of supporting young people to make the transition to meaningful work and further training opportunities."" Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014 forms the centrepiece to the Abbott government's response to climate change. It is clear that, if this is the centrepiece to the Abbott government's response to climate change, the Abbott government does not take climate change seriously. What is even more concerning is that the climate change sceptics in the coalition party room are now in control, so much so that when you look at important documents like A Plan for a Cleaner Environment produced by the Abbott government, you will struggle to find the words 'climate change' in it. In fact, I could not. PerhapsI missed it, but I could not find the words 'climate change' in what is a critical document dealing with the environment. Secondly, when you look at the white paper on agriculture and go to the terms of reference, again you cannot find the term 'climate change'. Most scientists would say to the government and the people of Australia that climate change is going to be one of the greatest challenges for the agriculture sector in years to come. You can argue about what is causing it, but you cannot deny that our climate is changing. In fact, the evidence is mounting every day. What is even more concerning is that the evidence is confirming what the scientific community have been saying for years-that greenhouse gas emissions are contributing to these changes and each year that we do nothing makes it more difficult for future generations to manage the problem. I pointed out the following statistics in a speech I made to this parliament only last week. Temperatures across this country have increased by about one degree over the last 100 years. There have been massive ice melts in Antarctic and Greenland icesheets. Sea levels have increased by 225 millimetres since 1880 and extreme weather events and changes in seasonal trends are now becoming a part of everyday life. Those extreme weather changes are having a direct impact on the social costs, the environmental costs and the economic costs of this country. Those costs will escalate as CO2 levels and greenhouse gas emission levels rise even further if we do nothing about it. The government's response to all of those concerns-concerns which are taken seriously by most other governments of the world-is to support a policy that is estimated to increase",129,Bills
226,Mr Zappia (Makin) (16:17,"I began my remarks by pointing out that the Socialgreenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent by the year 2050, at the same time subsidising the big corporate polluters to the tune of $50 billion by 2020. I understand that the IMF, the World Bank, the United Nations, the OECD, the Climate Change Authority and 33 out of 35 of Australia's leading economists have all urged the Prime Minister not to abandon a price on carbon. So why does the Abbott government persist with this flawed policy? It is a policy that, as I pointed out earlier today, is criticised by one of their own members, the member for Wentworth. It is a policy that we know will cost householders in the order of $1,200 to $1,300 each year, more than twice what they claimed that the Labor government's price on carbon imposes on householders. It is a policy that does not achieve the desired or required reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. It is, in fact, a policy that is at odds with what every other responsible government around the world is doing. What is even more concerning is that it is a policy that is at serious risk of failing because of the very climate effects that we seek to mitigate. By that I mean that you plant trees right around the country but in future years we are likely to face severe fires or severe droughts. What are the first things to be affected when you have a severe drought or a severe fire? Probably the very trees that you have planted. We have evidence of that over the last few years. I can point to areas where the large tree plantings done by state governments, local councils and community groups all died as a result of the long drought. I have no doubt that there were trees destroyed as a result of the bushfires that we have seen on a regular basis. So there is no guarantee that we will ever even get the benefits of this flawed policy. The Abbott government knows that their policy will not work. The reason they know it is because they have turned their backs on our commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, to reducing the renewable energy targets and so on. Their philosophy is quite simple: 'We are not going to achieve the targets that we are expected to; we know we won't, so we'll just change the targets. That way, if we change the targets, then we will achieve them.' This is a policy that, when all is said and done, can never, ever be evaluated until long after this government is gone. In turn, they will never, ever be held to account. There is no way that, even if you roll out the policy over the years ahead, any government will be in a position to measure or quantify the effect that it has had on reducing greenhouse gas emissions until many years have passed. And so, it is a convenient way for this government to just pretend to do something but never to be held to account with respect to it. The other problem with this policy is, as I said earlier, that it actually gives money to the big polluters throughout this country who, in turn, obviously will have no incentive to do anything other than what they would have otherwise done. I can understand why the government wants to bring this policy in. Part of the reason is that apart from creating an appearance that it is doing something with respect to climate change mitigation, it is also a convenient way of getting people off the unemployment queues and, in turn, reducing the unemployment numbers. Not in a real sense, but in a pretentious sense. You can take them off unemployment and then give them some kind of subsidy to go and do this, and that way it makes your unemployment figures look as if they have actually dropped when the reality is that very little has changed. Talking about employment, this policy fails not only as an environmental policy but also fails if you are going to treat it as an employment policy. As an employment policy there is no provision within it for minimum remuneration rates, there is no provision within it for workers' compensation if someone happens to get hurt, there is no provision within it for leave entitlements, there is no provision within it for public liability and there is no provision within it for any training that might be needed. I do not have a criticism of training on the job and on the spot that; if that is going to help someone, by all means it is good thing. But where are all these people going to go once they have done all of this in terms of having a real job? I suspect that they will go back onto the unemployment queues from which they originally came. If the government really wants to plant trees, it simply needs to proceed with the policies that are already in place and being carried out by community groups around the country. I can talk about community groups in my own electorate, like Friends of Cobbler Creek, Friends of Dry Creek and Friends of Anstey Hill, who continuously plant trees. Support those organisations because not only will they plant the trees but they will maintain and care for them long after they have planted them and ensure that they continue to do the job that they do. This is a policy that is nothing more than a cop-out by a government that wants to pretend that it cares about the environment and cares about climate change when, in fact, it wants to do nothing. Ms SCOTT (Lindsay) (16:26): I am extremely pleased to rise in support of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014. This bill will have a direct action affect on our environment and in delivering the coalition's election commitment in the deployment of a standing Green Army, 15,000 strong. With the introduction of this amendment, the Abbott government is delivering a real, tangible solution to the maintenance, restoration and beautification of our collective natural assets. In providing such a remarkable benefit to all Australians, the Green Army will serve to provide our youth with a gateway to employment through training and skills development, an acute appreciation of our natural Australian environment and its conservation and preservation for future generations. As such, I am extremely proud to stand in support of this bill. I would also like to congratulate the Minister for Environment and the honourable member for Flinders for his unrelenting energy, his passion, his support and his belief in this legislation. Minister Hunt has been an amazing advocate for the Cumberland Plain Woodlands lending his voice to the conservation issues and preservation of this critically endangered habitat. He has visited the electorate of Lindsay many times, meeting with local conservationists, environmental groups and local schools to ensure the Lindsay component of the Green Army has real traction and applicability on the ground. I commend him for his commitment, for his work and for his unrelenting understanding of how important the Cumberland Plain Woodland are to the people of Western Sydney. In my opinion, the success of the Green Army will be singularly realised by the work that the minister has personally committed to, and is engaging in still, with so many local communities like mine. By creating a standing army, we will be committed to make a real contribution to the preservation and conservation of our natural assets. The minister's passion and enthusiasm in this initiative has created interest in other groups in my community, like Muru Mittigar, a local Indigenous community that also provides a commercial horticultural facility that is growing specific plants that are unique to the region. In doing so, it will be restoring our bushland to how it was originally made. The coalition of Liberal and National parties stand proud of our strong record in delivering on-the-ground environmental projects and tackling environmental issues head-on. I, like the Prime Minister, have long been an ardent supporter of the Green Army, a signature policy of the coalition government that is designed to help the environment, to deliver on our reductions in emission targets and to provide workforce training. To this point the Prime Minister has been a passionate supporter, and has taken a lead role in the development of this legislation. It is worth noting that the Green Army builds on the Howard government's successful Green Corps program. Like so many other successful programs, the Green Corps, too, saw the knife of the previous Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government. Like its predecessor, the Green Army will provide our youth with improved career and employment options through facilitated accreditation programs in training whilst participating in our critical environmental and heritage projects. The hallmark of these two programs residesDebate interrupted. That the House do now adjourn. Donations to Political Parties Member for Dobell Ms HALL (Shortland-Opposition Whip) (16:30): I am concerned about issues surrounding three New South Wales state MPs on the Central Coast who have been forced to resign from the Liberal Party, pending an Independent Commission Against Corruption inquiry. The member for Wyong, Darren Webber, is currently being investigated by ICAC, as are the member for The Entrance, Chris Spence, and the member for Terrigal, Chris Hartcher. The offices of Mr Webber and Mr Spence were raided by ICAC investigators in September last year. Then, in December last year, ICAC investigators raided the office of Mr Hartcher in Erina and took several items of computer equipment. Mr Hartcher has been a Liberal Party powerbroker and was the New South Wales Minister for Energy and Resources, Minister for the Central Coast and Special Minister of State. Following the ICAC raid on his office, Mr Hartcher resigned his cabinet position. ICAC is holding public inquiries involving these MPs. The inquiries will examine whether certain members of the New South Wales parliament-including Mr Hartcher, Mr Webber companies, including prohibited donors contrary to the Election Funding Expenditure and Disclosures Act 1981. The inquiries will examine if members concealed payments from various sources, in return for favouring the interests of those responsible for the payments. In 2010-11, the current federal member for Dobell was the campaign manager for Darren Webber, when he was running for the state seat of Wyong. As the campaign manager, she reportedly claimed to have raised up to $100,000 for Mr Webber's state election campaign. It",130,Bills

228,And Mr Spence,"corruptly solicited, received and failed to disclose political donations fromwas also reported officially, in the Liberal Party's head office, that the fundraising figures were far less-$50,000 or even as low as $15,000. This is a major discrepancy. Newspaper reports have pointed to claims by a local interest group, the Australian Coal Alliance, that it was advised to hold a fundraising dinner for Mr Webber in 2010. It is claimed suggested funds be donated by the Coal Alliance as a community group, rather than from an individual member, so the funds would not need to be officially declared. Further claims have been made that a company called Eightbyfive has allegedly accepted money on behalf of state Liberal MPs and candidates. It is alleged that this occurred through the business so that donors could avoid declaring official donations to the Election Funding Authority. I note that the member for Dobell informed federal parliament on 27 February 2014 that she was not under investigation by ICAC and was not a person of interest. In September 2013, a reporter from The Daily Telegraph asked the member for Wyong why the federal member for Dobell was not returning phone calls. In response, the member for Wyong reportedly said, 'Anyone who has dealings with ICAC is not allowed to comment.' So does this mean that the member for Dobell has, in fact, had dealings with ICAC, but has simply not been free to comment? I think the people of Wyong Shire deserve to know the truth. I would not like to pre-empt the ICAC public inquiry and the outcomes which may result. However, I am concerned about the good people of the Central Coast-particularly those in Wyong Shire-not being properly represented by their local members of parliament. People on the Central Coast have had enough of ICAC hearings and corruption allegations. Instead, they want honest, fair and accountable local members who will serve the best interests of the community, not the best interests of themselves. I call on the member for Dobell to answer the following questions. How much money did she actually raise for Darren Webber's state campaign? Why was there a discrepancy between the reported amount and the amount declared to the Liberal Party head office? Were any campaign funds raised directly or indirectly from developers? What advice did she give the Australian Coal Alliance in relation to political donations and a fundraising dinner for Darren Webber at Kooindah Waters in 2010? What links or dealings has she had with the company Eightbyfive or its operator, Tim Koelma? What is and was her relationship with the former state minister Chris Hartcher? Deregulation in our region and the export opportunities provided by free trade agreements, a more efficient private sector will be the key to economic growth and prosperity for our nation. Currently, the cost of compliance with government legislation and regulation continues to be a major impediment for business across Australia. If our domestic industry is to be competitive, an administrative burden of excessive bureaucracy must be lifted. Business leaders have raised concerns that their operations are being restricted by an increasingly complex, multi-tiered, regulatory system that can often be so complex and technical that it is necessary to engage specialist consultants to achieve compliance. All, from small businesses through to large corporations, are affected. The cost of compliance, coupled with additional holding costs imposed by delays, has a detrimental",133,Adjournment

230,Mr Goodenough (Moore) (16:35,"Faced with increasing competition from countrieseffect on the financial viability of both business operations and key economic development projects. In response to feedback from the business community, the coalition government has introduced legislation during the current sitting of parliament to repeal approximately 10,000 items of legislation and regulations, equating to some 50,000 pages of text to be removed from the statute books. The repeals are wide ranging across all ministerial portfolios, including the Attorney-General's Department, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the departments of Defence; Education; Employment; the Environment; Finance; Foreign Affairs and Trade; Health; Immigration and Border Protection; Infrastructure and Regional Development; Social Services; and Veterans' Affairs. The estimated cost saving to the economy is in the order of $719 million per annum. This only represents the government's first phase of repealing redundant legislation. The regulation repeal process is an ongoing commitment of government, with two parliamentary repeal days scheduled every year to achieve the target of $1 billion reduction in red-tape compliance costs. Members of the public are encouraged to make submissions specifically identifying areas where repeal and reform are warranted via the Australian government's online deregulation resource, the www.cuttingredtape.gov.au website. Memoranda of understanding have been signed with all states and territories establishing a single point of contact for environmental approvals. No longer will separate Commonwealth assessment and approval under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act be required when an accredited state approval is already in place. Within the electorate of Moore, the major local projects which will benefit from the new regime include the redevelopment of the Ocean Reef Marina, and the Neerabup Industrial Area, which have both experienced significant delays as a result of the outdated multi-tiered system of environmental approvals. The coalition government is addressing the way policy makers approach the issue of future regulation across government departments with the introduction of regulatory impact statements, which are mandatory for all cabinet submissions, and establishing a deregulation unit in every portfolio. This will ensure that new regulation is introduced sparingly and as a means of last resort. Deregulation will help ensure that the Australian economy is able to compete on a level playing field with emerging economies in our region. With the advent of free trade and a globalised economy, with mobility of capital and investment across national borders, the Australian economy must be in good shape to compete with the rest of the world. The electors of Moore, in my home state of Western Australia, know that only a coalition government, matched by a strong team of senators, will deliver economic results for all Australians. Hotham Electorate: Moorabbin Airport Development Ms O'NEIL (Hotham) (16:37): I rise to make a statement on behalf of Dingley Village residents in relation to Moorabbin Airport. Dingley Village is a tight-knit community with great schools and active community groups in the south-east corner of my electorate of Hotham. It is a place where people look after each other's kids and keep an eye out for their neighbours. It is a suburb built in the shadow of Moorabbin Airport, and tonight I want to report to the House on some issues of concern that have been raised with me. By and large, Dingley Village residents were attracted to live in this area because of its semi-rural character. Moorabbin Airport is in one of Melbourne's green wedges, an area we call the lungs of the south-east. When the airport opened in the 1940s, on 294 hectares of crown land, the area was full of market gardens, florists and dairy farms. Since then, Moorabbin Airport has become the third busiest airport in Australia by flight movements250,000 movements in and out of the airport each year-and the busiest airport in Australia for pilot training. The use of that land has fundamentally changed. Instead of public land being used for the public benefit, the airport is becoming a giant retail complex operated by the one of the largest commercial companies in Australia. Making a statement today is necessary because of some very recent developments. Last year, the owner of Moorabbin Airport proposed to build a huge 12,000-square-metre Westfarmers retail space. Dingley Village has its own shopping centre and its own supermarket. The residents tell me that although they would like to see that centre upgraded it is still the heart and soul of their local community. Kingston Council has predicted that the Westfarmers development could cause a drop in trade of 46 per cent in these local shops. There are already 20 empty shops. The development of a retail space at the airport will make the existing local shopping centre unviable. That is why many Dingley Village residents were relieved when, under the previous government, the then Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, the member for Grayndler, decided to refuse the proposal. Last September, as we know, a new government was elected and the member for Wide Bay has taken over with quite a different approach. We have been told that the minister has instructed Commonwealth lawyers to tone down their objection to the retail development at Moorabbin Airport. Dingley Village Community Association, the main community group operating in this suburb, asked to be joined as a party to the hearing-a request I strongly supported-into whether the proposal should be approved. Minister Truss has taken the opposite view, and instructed his lawyers to oppose the DVCA, the most significant local community group in the area, being joined to the hearing. Further, the Minister will not meet with me or acknowledge my letters. The shadow attorney-general-the member for Isaacs, who is just next door to me-and I have both written to the minister asking to meet with him to put forward the views of local residents. It was a pretty basic request stemming from my rights as a member of parliament. But, imagine, the minister refuses to meet with a local member who simply wants to put forward the views of local residents. The good news is that we will have another opportunity to engage in consultation soon. In 2015, the minister will have to sign off on the next airport master plan. To ensure I properly understood the views of my local community, I recently surveyed Dingley residents to gauge their opinions. WhatI found was that most residents do not support more retail development at the airport. In addition, most do not support more development in the green wedge. The other issue the survey covered was aircraft noise, which negatively impacts on many of these residents on a daily basis. Most residents said that aircraft noise was worse in the late evening, but only 15 per cent have ever lodged a formal complaint, with many telling me that there was no point in doing so because they felt it would go unacknowledged. Despite the substantial changes and the substantial increase in the size of the suburbs surrounding the airport since the airport was established, aircraft movements have remain uncapped-the sky is the limit. There are 250,000 movements per annum, two-thirds of which are related to pilot training. Think of the frustration that many of these residents must experience. The 2010 master plan projects that aircraft movements will double by 2029. That will be half a million movements a year. This is an airport that is in the middle of suburban Melbourne. That is why it is critical that the minister be aware of community concerns before he signs off on the next master plan. Dingley Village residents, who experience thousands of aircraft movements above their area each day, deserve to be heard. I return to the fundamental question: is the public land of Moorabbin Airport being used for public benefit? As a local member, I will continue to fight to have the voices of my constituents heard in decisions that so profoundly affect their local area. Western Australia Senate Election Ms PRICE (Durack) (16:44): The Labor Party must think people in Western Australia are fools. It was only last week that Mr Shorten came to Western Australia and said, 'Labor is scrapping the carbon tax,' then came back to this place and continued Labor's betrayal of Western Australia by joining with the Greens to block the Abbott-led government's carbon tax repeal. On Tuesday he took this insult one step further by blocking the abolition of the mining tax. These are both anti-WA taxes. Last year alone the carbon tax cost Western Australians $600 million, while the mining tax continues to discourage investment in Australia's vital resources industry. This has had a significant impact on Durack, with the electorate accounting for 84.6 per cent of Western Australia's resources sector. Rather than politicking and flip-flopping on policy, as those opposite do, our government is implementing strategic policies by working with industry and the community at a grassroots level and by doing what members opposite could not, or would not do: reducing regulation and cutting red and green tape so that Australia can move forward and develop as a nation. We often use the word 'grassroots' without establishing what it really means. When I look at the grassroots of Australia and my electorate of Durack, one of my key focuses has been, and will continue to be, small business. Although the success of small business requires a personal commitment, the sector needs government leadership and effective policy decisions to flourish. In Durack, one of the biggest sectors suffering is the small business sector, particularly in the Pilbara and in wheat belt regions. In the Pilbara, as we know, we have a resources sector that contributed over $22 billion annually or some 75 per cent of total output in 2010-11. However, this has created a challenging environment, where towns such as Karratha are now playing catch-up in terms of infrastructure, community services, high rents and living expenses. This makes it difficult for established small business to remain open and makes it almost impossible for new businesses to start up. In the wheat belt, we see the same result but for different causes. Here, small businesses are fighting to keep their doors open due to a shrinking agricultural community. Members on this side of the House know that small businesses are often the glue that holds communities together, particularly in regional areas. The focus on business, the economy and the creation of jobs by the Abbott-led government was highlighted yesterday, when we held the first ever red tape repeal day, to remove over 10,000 pieces, and 50,000 pages, of legislation and regulation, which will save over $700 million in compliance costs. This important day was part of the government's deregulation agenda, which will cut $1 billion in red and green tape each year to improve productivity, investment and employment opportunities for all Australians-compared to Labor's approach, which saw the introduction of more than 975 new or amending pieces of legislation and over 21,000 additional regulations. Small business in particular has the potential to contribute to the growth of Australia. It is through the reduction of unnecessary regulations, and working with industry, rather than against it, that we will be able to achieve this potential. Unfortunately, those opposite continue to cling to the past and not accept the mandate that the Australian people gave the government at the federal election: that ineffective policies such as the mining tax and the carbon tax, which have hurt the hip-pocket of all Australians, need to go. Although it is under regrettable circumstances, Western Australians will have the opportunity on 5 April to once again reaffirm their desire for a strong government and, more importantly, to ensure that Western Australia has a strong Liberal voice in the Senate, so that we can ensure that the interests of Australians are once again represented. Thankfully, in Durack we have people who are already working with me to fight for jobs and to fight for business. The Small Business Centre West Pilbara is one organisation that has been working to create new opportunities for small businesses through the establishment of business incubators. This concept aims to provide a more affordable option for start-up businesses, where tenants co-share office space, while also providing critical support in terms of advice, coaching and mentoring. It is the establishment of these forward-thinking concepts-reducing regulation and repealing crippling legislation such as the carbon taxthat will allow small businesses in Durack and throughout Australia to grow and invest, ultimately strengthening our local economy and creating more jobs. Asylum Seekers Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (16:49): I take this opportunity, before the parliament rises for a significant period, to make some comments on the asylum seeker issue. It is no great secret that I have not rejoiced in policies that were put in place on a bipartisan basis by the former government in relation to offshore processing-policies that have now been continued, expanded and made many times worse by the current government. I accept that many parliamentarians on all sides have been motivated by a desire to reduce deaths at sea, but if we are really concerned about people taking dangerous boat journeys why then are we punishing people when they have already made the journey and survived it, instead of working to prevent it happening in the first place? Prevention would involve such measures as significantly increasing our humanitarian intake, working with other countries in the region to make conditions safer in transit countries and speeding up the processing of claims. It also means maintaining sufficient levels of foreign aid to address the root causes and improve conditions and the rule of law in the places from which people are escaping. Pure deterrence can never be a solution, unless we seek to become as vicious and cowardly as the harm from which people are fleeing. And when we do, like Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray, succeed in our program and start to look as ugly as we act, does anyone stop to think about what happens to the people who are so deterred from taking those boat journeys to Australia, or who are towed back to Indonesia on an orange lifeboat? A great many of them will still be refugees fleeing persecution, they will still need a safe haven and they will still be facing uncertain and precarious existences without rights in transit countries. They may well still die fleeing persecution on a different sea or trapped in an airless container. We do not reduce the risk to these people by taking away one of their escape options; we merely displace the risk to another time and place. Through the tow back actions-illegal under international law-we also further imperil our formerly close relationship with Indonesia and our reputation. What of the people caught in existential limbo on Manus and Nauru-places where Australia has made independent oversight near impossible, where those countries are barring any examination of human rights, where asylum claims are not being processed and where people have been killed, injured or driven by despair, fear and hopelessness to riots or suicide? It is not okay. This is not what the Australian community understood at the time those centres were re-established on Manus and Nauru, when parliamentarians solemnly promised to ensure that the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and international human rights would be respected, and that there would be independent oversight of offshore processing centres, especially in relation to the physical and mental health of detainees. Australia cannot contract out its obligations under international law to poor neighbouring countries. We have a responsibility to ensure the convention is complied with in respect of the people who have claimed asylum, even where these claims are being processed in a third country. This is patently not happening. Clearly the conditions under which Labor undertook offshore processing when in government are no longer being complied with, and as a nation we are in violation of our international legal obligations. In my view, either the protections required as preconditions to offshore processing must be restored or put in place, or the centres on Manus and Nauru cannot be supported and must be shut down. And what of those people in detention on Christmas Island and on mainland Australia, whose rights to legal representation, of appeal and support are being stripped away; whose children are not receiving appropriate education, as we have seen from reports of Christmas Island; and those refugees who are facing indefinite detention because of a negative security assessment from ASIO, a situation described this week by Sydney University's Professor of International Law Ben Saul in The New York Times as 'Australia's Guantanamo'. It is as if we have gone back in time to an Australia that was proud to be white and that put up countless legal, administrative and social obstacles for outsiders to come here, but much of that shameful past can be attributed to ignorance and to its time. What is our excuse now? This prosperous, educated, outward-looking Australia that prides itself on the fair go, on tolerance and egalitarianism, and on mateship-mateship for whom? Those exactly like us? As we gaze at this beautiful portrait of ourselves, let us endeavour to be that Australia and not be consumed by the darker side of human nature or, just as wrongly, avert our eyes so that we do not see any unpleasantness. We cannot hide behind the notion that we are being cruel to be kind, that we are saving people from themselves or that we know best-actually, we do not. As someone who has lived and worked in places afflicted by war and oppression, I am aware of how remote Australia is from the factors that are driving millions of desperate people worldwide to leave everything they know and to seek refuge. That is why it is incumbent on those in leadership positions to present all the facts and to seek to inform rather than politicise this issue. As in the past with the Vietnamese refugees, we need benevolent bipartisanship and a genuinely regional burden-sharing approach. (Time expired) Western Australia Senate Election April. It has been just over 200 days since Western Australians went to the polls and elected a coalition government. Since the result on 7 September, the Abbott government has been getting on with the job we were elected to do. The Australian public voted in the coalition because they wanted a stable government that would focus on people, not personalities within the party. The result of the last election also sent a clear message that they wanted a government which would do what they said they would do, and not a party which would say one thing before the election and another thing after the election. But despite the result of the last election, the Labor Party continues to mislead voters and should not be trusted when Western Australians cast their vote in the re-run Senate election in nine days' time. The Labor Party's most recent example of why they cannot be trusted was just last week in The West Australian newspaper. In the 20 March edition, Mr Bullock said that Labor was 'repealing the carbon tax.' So when the Senate voted on the repealing of the carbon tax last Thursday, Western Australians would have expected to hear that the carbon tax had been repealed. Sadly, this was not the case. Instead, the very same day that Labor claimed they were repealing the carbon tax, Labor aligned with the Greens and blocked this repeal in the Senate. It is clear that Labor has not learnt from its mistakes. No matter how much they say they have distanced themselves from the Greens, we know from the events of the last week that a vote for Labor is still a vote for the Greens. We all know about the chaos and dysfunction that Labor and the Greens delivered during the last parliament. Only by voting for the Liberal Party in the Senate can WA voters be guaranteed. With many fly-in fly-out workers in my electorate of Hasluck, it is important that there is confidence in WA's mining and resource sector. Confidence is important for companies to invest in the sector and for fly-in fly-out workers to be confident about job security. The only party which is committed to a strong and confident mining and resource sector in WA is the Liberal Party. We are committed to reinvigorating the sector by repealing the mining tax, but again, in another sign that the Labor Party is snubbing its nose at what the Australian people wanted at the last election, Labor is standing in the way of the removal of this legislation. Never has a vote for the Liberal Party been so important than on 5 April. I know from speaking with people in my electorate that they have been struggling to balance their household budgets since the former government introduced the carbon tax, a tax which they said they were not going to do. But since the former government hit the Australian people with this big new tax, the task is for families to balance their weekly budgets, and it has got harder. My electorate of Hasluck has more than 40,000 families, and every day that Labor continues to support the carbon tax they are continuing to inflict pain on families in my electorate and across Australia. When businesses think of where to put their vote for in the WA Senate election on 5 April, there could not be two more contrasting choices: the party that will encourage economic growth, the party which will support jobs and the party which will cut red tape for businesses is the coalition party.

I will conclude by reminding the people of Western Australia that, when they consider their vote for the Senate election, the only party which will stand up for WA and is continuing to do so is the Liberal Party. It is the Liberal Party which is committed to repealing the mining tax to reinvigorate mining investment. It is the Liberal Party which is committed to repealing the carbon tax to reduce living and business costs, so WA families can save $550 a year on their power bills alone. Our Senate team of the Senator the Hon. David Johnston, Senator the Hon. Michaelia Cash, Linda Reynolds and Slade Brockman will ensure WA has a dedicated team which works hard for Western Australians and represents the values and families of Western Australia.

Thursday, 27 March 2014 Nelson, Ms Kathrine (Kath) state secretary of the Australian Services Union, Kath Nelson, a friend of mine, a fierce advocate for workers and a Labor loyalist. At just 43 years of age, Kath left us too soon. Kath was a vibrant, earthy, smart, strong woman who dedicated her working life to working people. Survived by her loving partner, Brett, and her devoted son, Spencer, Kath's beautiful smile, infectious laughter and generous nature will be sadly missed by many, including the broader labour movement and the Labor Party, especially in Queensland. Born and raised in Brisbane, Kath's working life commenced when she was behind the bar at the Embassy Hotel in Brisbane. Regular customer and local unionist John Forrester saw the potential in Kath and encouraged her to get involved with the union movement. Kath started working in administration with the union which later was to become the Australian Services Union. She worked her way up through the ranks and was appointed to the top job, Queensland secretary, in April 2011. She was the first woman to ever hold this position, and around that time she was elected the national vice-president of the ASU. Kath was a member of the Administrative Committee of the Australian Labor Party Queensland branch and a member of the National Executive of the Australian Labor Party. Sitting beside Kath at Queensland state conferences of the Labor Party was entertaining and informative. She was acerbic in her wit, down to earth in her manner and politically intuitive. But not even Kath was tough enough to conquer leukaemia. Kath was an accomplished industrial relations professional. She was respected by employers and by government for her toughness, her fairness and her integrity. She was respected not just for her intellect and her tenacity but for her compassion. Kath had superb negotiating skills. She was a strong lobbyist and an inspiring leader. These skills led to some major wins for Queensland workers, including the development of the Queensland Local Government (Workforce Transition Code of Practice) Notice in 2007 and the South-East Queensland Distribution and Retail Water Reform Workforce Framework in 2009. Kath played a pivotal role in the historic social and community services pay equity case in Queensland in 2008. You may recall this case. It was historic because it proved that Queensland workers in the social and community sector were underpaid solely as a result of their gender. The case laid the foundation for the federal pay equity case, which was completed in 2012. Kath upheld the philosophy of the Australian Labor Party in every sense of the word. She believed in a fair go for all and she lived those values each and every day of her life. Kath's moving and emotional funeral service, held at St John's Cathedral in Brisbane, was attended by many hundreds. She will be mourned for many years to come and I extend my sincere condolence to her union mates and her family. She was beloved and we will miss her terribly. Vale, Kath Nelson.",140,Adjournment

233,Mr Neumann (Blair) (09:30,"Last Friday, I attended the funeral of the QueenslandHinkler Electorate: Aged Care concern to my constituents for many years, and that is the issue of aged-care services. ABS data shows that the median age in Hinkler is 44 compared to 37 for Queensland. Almost 3,000 residents are over the age of 85, making it the largest single age group in my electorate. Last month, I wrote to Senator Mitch Fifield, the Assistant Minister for Social Services, to raise Hinkler residents' concerns that there is only one aged-care assessor in Bundaberg and only two in Hervey Bay. One elderly lady who cares for her husband told my office she now has health issues and contacted ACAT for an assessment but was told it could take as long as six months for her husband to be seen. Senator Fifield agreed that a waiting time of six months is not acceptable and has referred the matter to Queensland Health, which operates the service. The workload of our local assessors has grown significantly in volume and complexity, and more and more Australians are choosing to stay at home for longer and only enter facilities when they require a high level of care. Unfortunately, there are not enough beds. During Senate estimates in 2010, the Department of Health and Ageing indicated there were 429 aged-care beds across the Wide Bay region that were funded but not built by providers. By 30 June last year, under Labor that figure had blown out to 730. The aged-care ratio in the Wide Bay region is 92.2 aged-care places for every 1,000 people aged 70 or over. That is compared to the Queensland ratio of 109.2. I recently met with a not-for-profit aged care provider, who said the high cost of constructing new facilities meant Hinkler residents could not afford a placement. Hinkler has the fourth highest unemployment rate in the country. We have among the highest rates of disability, obesity, diabetes and smoking. The median weekly personal income in Hinkler is $411. To put that in perspective, the median weekly rental is $240, which is more than half of what they earn. This makes saving for retirement and aged care almost impossible. Land values in Bundaberg have dropped by 40 per cent since the last valuation was issued prior to the January 2013 floods. What this means is that in many cases the nest egg they have worked their entire lives to pay off is now worth significantly less than they had anticipated or planned for. I recently announced $1.7 million to help Hinkler residents who want to remain in their homes or are waiting for a placement. The funding will enable six local organisations to provide domestic assistance like home maintenance, meals and cleaning as well as nursing care, social support and transport. The construction of 730 beds across the region would not only reduce the waiting list for people who deserve to live out their remaining days with dignity but it would also stimulate the construction industry and the local economy more broadly. It would create jobs and training opportunities in nursing, allied health, pharmacy, administration and retail. SoI look forward to working with Senator Fifield to ensure that these beds are delivered for the people of my electorate. Live Animal Exports International Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian People Ms HALL (Shortland-Opposition Whip) (09:36): Like most Australians, I have been horrified by the ongoing images of acts of cruelty to Australian animals exported through Australia's live export trade.

234,Mr Pitt (Hinkler) (09:33,"I rise to speak about an issue that has been of significantthose have died on the way to their destination. They have been exported to countries where there are no laws to protect animals from cruelty. Animal welfare issues on board the boats and the transport conditions have been less than satisfactory. The Australian government cannot ensure animals will be slaughtered humanely when they reach their destination or even handled humanely. They are handled contrary to Australian standards. I do not think this is good enough. The government is set to drastically expand export trade; along with that expansion there needs to be some proper legislative requirements put in place. I call on the government to appoint an independent officer to oversee this trade. The other issue I want to raise and give my support to is the International Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. There was an event held here this week where a number of members from both sides of the House attended to offer their support to the Palestinian people. Those members who attended support a two-state solution. We would like to see Israel stop its settlement program because it is undermining the prospect of ever achieving a two-state solution. I would like to put on the record my disgust at the abuse of the Palestinian people by the occupying forces. It is not good enough to sit back and let these atrocities continue. I think it important for members on both sides of this parliament to speak out against it. I call on the government to adopt the same position that the previous government did to the motion before the United Nations, support the Palestinian people and, in doing so, support a two-state solution in the Middle East. La Trobe Electorate: Sport champion grants to some of our dynamic young sports boys and girls at an afternoon tea in my electorate of La Trobe. The Local Sporting Championship program is an Australian government initiative designed to provide financial assistance for young people aged between 12 and 18. I congratulate the following rising stars. Berwick's Sophia Locandro received her grant to play in the school sport Australian basketball championships. At just 13 years of age, Sophia is already a veteran of the Dandenong Rangers representative system. Sophia first started playing at the age of just seven after watching her older cousins get so much enjoyment out of the sport. Rachel Guy received her grant to attend the Australian women's under-15 hockey championships. Rachel is determined to play hockey for Australia one day. But for now, the 15-year-old from Berwick has her sights set on winning gold at the hockey championships. Rachel took out top goal scorer in the Waverley under-14s girls team last year, scoring an incredible 23 goals throughout the season. Emerald's Bryce Haesler is a local gymnast who is being helped to participate in the Australian championships. Sixteen-year-old Bryce was previously selected for the state squad and has picked up a gold medal. Bryce began gymnastics at the age of two. Narre Warren South hockey player Samantha Wagg received a grant for the national indoor hockey championships. Samantha's parents, Phil and Sandi, played the sport in the state league. Samantha made her Victorian debut at the Pacific School Games a few years ago, where she and her teammates settled for a runners-up finish to the New South Wales team after a nailbiting penalty stroke ending.",144,Constituency Statements

The nine-year-old Beaconhills College student has been training with her 19-year-old horse, Lakevale Wizard-known as Wiz. Jessica is a member of the Hallam Valley Pony Club. Year9 student, Aaron Currie at Fountain Gate Secondary College was presented with the grant for outstanding performance in his chosen sport, lacrosse. Congratulations must also go to other grant recipients: Mike Jarrod and the Target Rifle Victoria Team for the youth national championships, Steve Dawson for his participation in the under-19 boys softball championships, Hayden Trezise for under-17 boys softball championships, Montana Chavasse for School Sports Victoria under-12 girls softball and Dylan Donnelly for the under-14 nationals. I congratulate all these fantastic sports stars. Atypical Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome Ms BUTLER (Griffith) (09:42): I rise today to bring to the attention of this parliament the rare and life-threatening disease, atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome. AHUS, as it is known, is a genetic disease which can severely damage vital organs such as the kidneys, heart and brain. It causes abnormal blood clots to form in small blood vessels in the kidneys. If the clots restrict or block blood flow they can cause serious medical problems. The condition can occur at any age but more than half of those affected are children. Associate Professor David Mudge, Consultant Nephrologist at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Griffith, runs a national AHUS patient register. He has reported that more than two-thirds of AHUS patients die, require dialysis or develop permanent kidney damage within one year of diagnosis, while 32 per cent die within four years. Sufferers' health can be greatly improved with access to the drug known as Soliris. Unfortunately, this drug comes at a cost of $600,000 a year, which is well outside the reach of most sufferers. Nineteen-year-old Isabelle Ruiz was recently diagnosed with this rare, incurable illness by the Royal Melbourne Hospital after passing out in the street. Isabelle had just finished her first year of a biomedical science degree at Swinburne University and she had received a high distinction in chemistry. The Royal Melbourne Hospital was able to provide Isabelle with six doses of Soliris, but that supply is now depleted. Isabelle's family, friends and supporters are now trying to raise awareness and, of course, money to purchase a further supply of this lifesaving drug, at a cost of about $20,000 a dose. Soliris saved Isabelle's life. It saved the lives of many other suffers who have been fortunate enough to get access to this medication. The AHUS Patient Support Group of Australia, as well as health professionals and families and friends of AHUS sufferers, have urged the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to recommend to the Minister for Health that Soliris be funded through the Life Saving Drugs Program. Soliris is the only treatment available and clinically proven to prevent premature death and vital organ damage in those with AHUS. The Therapeutic Goods Administration approved Soliris for use in October 2012. Patients in 30 countries-including the USA, countries throughout Europe, and Japan-have access to this lifesaving therapy while Australia is lagging behind. This needs to change. I urge all members of the community to go to the AHUS Patient Support Group Association website to find out how you can support the association's campaign, and I urge the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee and the health minister to approve the funding of Soliris so that Isabelle and others like her have some chance of living a longer life. Stirling Electorate: Balga Senior High School of the House to a group of impressive young people in my electorate at Balga Senior High School who have successfully integrated into mainstream classes from the school's Intensive English Centre and who were in Canberra last week for the F1 in Schools Technology Challenge. I had the pleasure of meeting the students: Amirali Azimi, Bakr Al-Qaraghuli, Asung Tamom, Dat Phan and Hae Ser Hae Ser, originally from Iran, Iraq, Burma, Vietnam and Thailand. They were accompanied by three dedicated staff from Balga Senior High School: Rosemary Evans, Trisha Dean and Michael Spanier. Balga Senior High School is a culturally diverse, inclusive school with students from more than 40 nations. The school is a strong representation of the diverse cultures within my electorate. Balga Senior High School's motto is 'Strength in Unity', and some of the programs aimed at bringing together students from various backgrounds include the highly successful programs run by its Intensive English Centre. The centre provides students with the skills required to transition into classrooms teaching the Australian Curriculum. The F1 challenge is the world's largest secondary school technology program, incorporating the four key subjects of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. It involves students from 17,000 schools in 40 different nations. The patron of the program is F1 founder Bernie Ecclestone. The program requires students to use specialised computer software to design, manufacture, test and then race miniature air powered Formula One cars. In November 2013, three teams from Balga Senior High School entered the WA state finals of the F1 school program. This is no mean feat-creating these miniature race cars and tracks takes several months of planning and design which students do on top of their regular school work. Balga Senior High School was competing against schools with bigger budgets, better technology and better resources. Notwithstanding this, the team I had the pleasure of meeting won the junior development class at the state titles which afforded them the opportunity to compete in the national titles here in Canberra. At the national awards ceremony Amirali, Bakr, Asung, Dat and Hae Ser impressed the judges with their F1 creation called 'Cheetah a Power' and went home with the encouragement award in their division. Their involvement in the competition enabled them to develop project management, business planning, public speaking, marketing and collaboration skills, and this is a remarkable achievement for five students who just a few years ago had little or no English. I congratulate the team on their award which recognises the incredible motivation of these students in overcoming language and cultural barriers and having the confidence to succeed. I also commend the role played by Balga Senior High School and its dedicated teachers, who provided ongoing support to the students. Under the leadership of principal Geoff Harris, these teachers believe in what they do and give the students the inspiration to achieve. I am a great fan of what Balga Senior High School does in my electorate. They have a very diverse school community and they always roll up their sleeves and get the job done of making sure those students get the best out of their high school education.",145,Constituency Statements
236,Mr Keenan (Stirling,"Minister for Justice) (09:45): I would like to draw the attentionFremantle Electorate: Homelessness Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (09:48): I would like to take this opportunity to raise the importance of homelessness support services in my electorate, and in doing so to highlight the urgent need for the government to move quickly to extend the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness. Homelessness is a paralysing condition. It impacts upon or cuts altogether the connections people have to work, education and health services, and community and family life. People experiencing primary homelessness or sleeping rough are really caught up in a day-to-day game of survival. People in unstable or overcrowded housing are enduring conditions in which a focus on employment, education, basic health and emotional well-being is forced into the background or off the agenda altogether. For many Australians this kind of existence is hard to imagine. It is something they might glimpse in a bundled form under the portico of a public building or maybe hear about when their kids mention a friend who cannot host a sleepover because they are already living with another family. There are 100,000 Australians who did not last night and will not tonight and tomorrow night have a place they can call home. For those people the ungraspable reality of a safe and permanent place of their own is what they deal with and think about almost constantly. There are also thousands more who are at risk of homelessness, whether through mental ill health, domestic violence, alcohol and drug abuse issues or people released from prison. At the same time there are people who do not fall into high-risk categories and yet are perhaps only one piece of misfortune, such as family breakdown or losing their job, away from becoming homeless; or, in the case of a young person, one big family blow-up away from leaving home and becoming so. When I was the Parliamentary Secretary for Homelessness and Social Housing, I mentioned on a couple of occasions the story of a young woman, a single parent who lived in the same street as my electorate office, who went from living in a private rental, to learning that her tenancy would not be renewed because the owner was selling the house, to living with friends while she searched frantically for a house she could afford to rent, to sleeping in her car with her three young children during some incredibly hot Perth summer nights because there simply were no affordable places to rent and the waiting list for state Homeswest housing was seven years. That situation, that story, bears repeating simply because it illustrates the fragility of home for some people and the gravity of coming unstuck from stable housing. It also highlights the impact of homelessness on children. As the member for Fremantle I have always been engaged with the issues of homelessness, housing stress and housing affordability, because they are clearly present in my community. I value enormously the crisis and homelessness support services that are provided by a range of organisations in my electorate and indeed right around Australia. I implore the government to work urgently with state governments to give those organisations the funding certainty they need. I would also like to take this opportunity to urge colleagues to support The Big Issue, a fortnightly newspaper written by professional journalists which is sold on the streets by homeless people, who receive half of the proceeds of the sale. Braidwood: Seniors Week Dr HENDY (Eden-Monaro) (09:51): Last FridayI had the great pleasure of attending a senior citizens event, a seniors expo, held in Braidwood during Seniors Week. For those of you who have never been there, Braidwood is one of the many glorious historic towns in Eden-Monaro. It was a goldmining town in the 1860s and was famously raided by Ben Hall, the bushranger, during those years. There are some really classic examples of early Australian buildings in Braidwood that have been restored such that the main street is arguably one of the very best in New South Wales. Although in the recent past it was a town largely built around sheep and cattle farming, Braidwood is now being revitalised by an influx of creative people-artists, writers, potters, quilters and artisans-all attracted by the rural lifestyle and wonderful pace of life in a rural community. The Braidwood seniors expo was sponsored by Ageing, Disability and Home Care, part of the New South Wales Department of Family and Community Services. All credit to the O'Farrell government for sponsoring the seniors expo. It was held at the National Theatre and Community Centre in Wallace Street, thought to be the oldest operating picture theatre in Australia. The Braidwood seniors expo aimed to provide information on the services and products available for seniors in the Braidwood region. There were static displays from various organisations on health issues, financial services and other topics of interest to seniors. There were some social and cultural groups demonstrating their skills, including the SES seeking volunteers. I talked to many people manning the various stalls. We spoke about the recently dry weather conditions and the relief that recent rains have brought. Indeed, it has been pouring over the last 24 hours. Many people also raised mobile phone and other black spot issues, which I have passed on to the Minister for Communications. During the opening of formal proceedings that morning, I was especially pleased to be able to present a certificate to Marge McCann, who recently published an account of her life in a book entitled Bobby. In a moving speech, Marge reminisced about her life and reminded us all about valuing life and life's journey and the importance of family. Congratulations to all those involved in this seniors expo. Events like this one are not a success by accident. I would especially like to pass on my thanks to organiser Judy Marston for such a great morning in Braidwood. As I have often said, volunteers are the lifeblood of rural and regional communities. We can never thank them enough for the selfless work they do. Racial Discrimination Act 1975 Mundine, a person I am honoured to call a friend, made some very prescient observations on radio the other day and previously on Lateline about this debate on the Racial Discrimination Act, particularly on the ability of people to object to racial slurs, intimidation and vilification. He wondered out loud why the government is contemplating this legislation. He said that from the government's point of view this is a very foolish thing to do, because it is sucking the air out of their news agenda. I think he is right. Why is this happening? It is happening because of one case. As the President of the Human Rights Commission, Gillian Triggs, said on radio this morning, you learn in law school that",147,Constituency Statements
237,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (09:54,"The Prime Minister's Indigenous adviser, Warrenone bad case makes bad law. That case is the Andrew Bolt case that took place three years ago. That case, strangely, was not appealed by Mr Bolt or the The Herald-Sun and The Weekly Times. So now we have a national furore being created on the basis of a law that was not fully tested by the person who was so aggrieved. I believe that while Bolt's views were factually wrong, the judge's interpretation could have been seen as harsh and that if The Herald-Sun and The Weekly Times and Mr Bolt had had the courage of their convictions they would have taken the case to a higher court, where it would probably have been overrulednot because we should allow such slurs against Indigenous people, but because there were exemptions already under the Racial Discrimination Act that would have allowed another judge to have made a different judgement. It is causing a public furore also because of the transition of the Institute of Public Affairs from being a venerable conservative organisation to being an organisation of ideological zealots who are pushing this issue onto the current government. Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act existed for the 11 years of the Howard government. It worked very well. There were 1,650 complaints, 500 of those dealt with conciliation and most of the rest were dropped-very few went to court. If it was good enough for John Howard for all of those years, I cannot understand what is not good enough for this government. Why is it doing this? That is a very good question asked by Warren Mundine. It is a question that the Australian people will be scratching their heads about. Robertson Electorate: Defence Force Retirement Benefits the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, for his championing of and leadership on the Defence Force Retirement Benefits Legislation Amendment (Fair Indexation) Bill 2014, because it is legislation that will finally give veterans in my electorate of Robertson a fair go. It demonstrates how the government is committed to veterans and their families. It is about recognising the unique nature of military service, in particular for our military superannuants aged 55 and over. The coalition pledged that it would deliver this commitment not just before the 2013 election but also in 2010. When these important changes finally come in to place on 1 July, the government will have delivered on its pledge. This bill will index the Defence Force retirement benefits scheme, known as DFRB, and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme, or DFRDB, pensions in the same way as age pensions and service pensions. I spoke recently with veterans to Gosford RSL Sub Branch-a sub-branch that has been in existence since 1917. Sub-branch vice president David Russell said that fair indexation is a valuable part of making sure the right compensation and care is provided. David served overseas in the Royal Australian Air Force for 33 years in East Timor, the Middle East, Somalia, Kuwait and beyond. He said that only the coalition and Prime Minister Tony Abbott have listened and are delivering a fair go. David is one of 56,000 veterans across Australia-over 13,000 in New South Wales and nearly 200 in my electorate of Robertson-who are DFRB or DFRDB recipients. Mick Wardle, the president of Terrigal-Wamberal RSL Sub Branch also told me stories of half a dozen veterans on the DFRB or DFRDB pension in his sub-branch. One of the men served for more than 20 years, mainly in Vietnam. He was a full colonel in the Army and is a distinguished veteran in our community. Mr Wardle said that many veterans are struggling severely with the cost of living under the current pension scheme and that their lack of",149,Constituency Statements

Another resident, Mr Gordon Clunes, served for three decades in the Navy in Korea, Malaya and Borneo. He is now a member of Woy Woy Ettalong-Hardys Bay RSL Sub Branch and respected former leader of the Central Coast naval association. Mr Clunes said that, despite 30 years of service, he also was feeling cost of living pressures, partly because of this unfair indexation. It happened because in the last parliament Labor and the Greens refused to listen to our veterans. Right across the Central Coast there are veterans like Mr Clunes, Mr Russell and others that deserve a fair go, and only the coalition is delivering this fair go for some of our most valuable and respected citizens. I take the opportunity to thank the presidents of various subbranches in my electorate for their passion, advocacy and commitment to this particular issue, including Greg Mawson, president of Gosford RSL subbranch, Wally Sheargold from Davistown, Bevan Router from Woy Woy Ettalong-Hardys Bay subbranch, Danny Wilmott from Mangrove Mountain and Mick Wardle from Terrigal Womberal RSL. time for constituency statements has expired, but I know it would suit the convenience of the Federation Chamber to continue with constituency statements. I call the member for Bendigo. Rasmussen, Ms Carol Long Gully community. Carol Rasmussen served the Long Gully community for over 25 years. She is the retiring coordinator of the Long Gully Neighbourhood Centre and on Tuesday this week people from across Bendigo gathered to honour her work and service at a lunch. Carol started work in 1984 in the playgroup in Long Gully and from there was promoted to be the coordinator. Carol said it was a privilege to work in the sector and she has made many friends through working with the community. She said at the lunch, 'The community has taught me just as much as I have taught them. I have loved seeing people grow up. It has been lovely to support the community in which I live.' Jodie Watt and Candice Bergman said that Carol was like a mum to them. Debbie Steele, who has worked in the centre for 3½ years, said that Carol was a mentor-'She brought out my confidence. She gave me the ability to approach people and that has helped me go on to find employment.' It is going to be hard to find a new coordinator like Carol. She is a mum, she is an auntie, she is a sister and she is a friend. Kangaroo Flat Community House coordinator Elaine McNamara has worked with Carol for 18 years and she said that Carol has been a tower of strength and a good sounding board-'She is an excellent person to work with and a real coordinator willing to do anything for her community. She will be sadly missed by everybody in the area.' Our community houses and neighbourhood centres are the backbone of our community. They pick up the jobs that are too tough for others. They ensure that everybody has a mum, a sister or a friend to talk to. They deal with the issues that others quite often do not want to deal with. Whether it be helping young mums, the after-school program that nobody else has or community lunches to ensure that we have community connectedness, our neighbourhood centres are strong foundations for our communities. They reflect what the community needs. In my electorate we have a number of them. Carol is loved by her community and her leadership will be missed, but she has committed to staying on as a volunteer after retiring and she will continue to be on the lunch roster. I am sure many in Long Gully will be proud to join her for lunch. I call on the federal government",150,Constituency Statements

The award was a new category in the New South Wales government Women of the Year awards held annually on the eve of International Women's Day, with the winner chosen by public vote. I thank all my constituents and friends on my Facebook page who voted for Lakshmi. This year's group of over 200 candidates was outstanding, with a long list of very impressive achievements. Lakshmi's success is a credit to her dedication to community work. I first came into contact with Lakshmi in 2011, when she entered into the annual essaywriting competition I hold for year 11 students within the seat of Hughes. The prize on that occasion was to hear President Obama's address to the House of Representatives during his 2011 visit. I was immediately impressed with Lakshmi and her long list of achievements. As school captain of St George Girls High School, Lakshmi initiated a program that collected government funded disused laptops from school leavers and donated them to students in developing countries. For these efforts Lakshmi was recognised with a New South Wales Minister's Award for Excellence in Student Achievement. Lakshmi has sought to address the pressing need for readily accessible computer resources in developing countries. Now in its third year, the program has branched out to a number of schools across Sydney which are collecting hundreds of disused laptops and sending them to schoolchildren in developing countries. The first beneficiaries of Lakshmi's laptop initiative were students in war affected regions of Sri Lanka and Kenya. Lakshmi has continued to build on her success with the laptop computer project by being part of a team that last year was successful in receiving a grant from the Holroyd City Council Community Assistance Program. That grant will fund a program that will teach computer skills to newly arrived migrants. We are all very proud of Lakshmi, and we look forward to her continued success and her inspirational community work. I also take this opportunity to acknowledge the other award winners of the New South Wales Woman of the Year, Turia Pitt and community hero Faten El Dana. Congratulations to all. And in the remaining time. I have, I would like to also congratulate Lakshmi's parents, who came down to Canberra and sat in my office to watch President Obama's address. They are great citizens of our country who have come from a war affected region. They have a wonderful daughter, and they should be congratulated. Petition: Coal Seam Gas Petition: Coastal Erosion Dr GILLESPIE (Lyne) (10:07): I rise to table two petitions that have been through the petitions committee. The first one is in order with the committee. It is from citizens in the",151,Constituency Statements
241,Mr Craig Kelly (Hughes) (10:04,"I am pleased to report to the House the specialLyne electorate who are concerned about coal seam gas mining. And there are many other citizens around the nation who have affixed their name to this petition. They are concerned about the effects of unconventional gas mining on water quality, farmlands, the environment, the community, residents' health, property values and tourism. They are also concerned about greenhouse emissions from large-scale methane leakage associated with coal seam gas and other unconventional gas mining. They are concerned about the evidence that coal seam gas fracking in tide sands, shale and other gas mining might lower the freshwater table. They are calling for an immediate moratorium on these processes. I seek leave to table the petition. Leave granted. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This Petition of citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House:  present and potential negative impacts of the Coal Seam Gas Mining (CSG) Industry, fracking, tight sands, shale and all other unconventional forms of gas mining on water quality, farm lands, the environment, communities, residents' health, property values and tourism;  that CSG, fracking, tight sands, shale and all other unconventional gas mining produce green house gas emissions particularly from large scale methane leakage such that these industries have a global warming impact that is as bad as if not worse than coal, over a twenty year period;  that there is evidence that CSG, fracking, tight sands, shale and all other unconventional gas mining lower the fresh water table. We therefore ask the House to:  declare an immediate moratorium on all CSG, fracking, tight sands, shale and all other unconventional gas mining activities and licences within the boundaries of Australia and its Territorial Seas;  declare Australia and its Territorial Seas to be a 'CSG, fracking, tight sands, shale and all other unconventional gas mining free zone' and thereafter off limits to these industries. from 7,488 citizens Petition received. Dr GILLESPIE: The second petition is from constituents of the Lyne electorate around Old Bar Beach, which is at the mouth of the Manning River. They are concerned about the coastal erosion issue that is threatening houses, schools and public lands and roads. They are requesting that the state and federal governments address this by the use of artificial sand reefs, which break the strength of the waves that cause the erosion. These reefs are not seen under the waves. They colonise with coral and become a reserve for fisheries. They can, if positioned in the right way-parallel to the coast-create a shadow to protect the sands from being eroded on the coastline. They present a very cost-effective way to address a widespread problem across all of Australia, not just the Lyne electorate. Up and down the east coast of Australia there are many hot spots with coastal erosion, and it is a very cost-effective manner compared with all the other procedures. It is not a magic bullet. It has been employed for years on the Gold Coast, where it protected vast swathes of very expensive real estate. And it has the potential for use in the armamentarium of state and local governments, who are the responsible authorities. I will table this petition as a document, because it is deemed out of order. These two issues are vitally important to a lot of people in the electorate and around the nation. I present it to the parliament. The petition will go to the responsible minister. McBride, Mr Tom McBride, the principal of St Johns Park Public School, on 60 years of service in public education. I recently had the opportunity to present him with a community service award marking this monumental achievement. Tom McBride was the first teacher and principal in New South Wales to receive the 60 years service certificate from the Department of Education. Over the past 60 years, since beginning his humble career as a 19-year-old at Garah Public School in the state's north-west where he was one of only two teachers, Tom has taught in 12 schools across New South Wales. He settled in St Johns Park Public School in 2002. His dedication to and passion for education, and for providing for the future of our children, is unparalleled. Tom is highly respected and a much loved member of our community. He is regarded well by students and parents alike-as a matter of fact, by our community as a whole. As an educator his greatest commitment has been to providing education for children with disadvantaged backgrounds, making sure that they do not fall through the cracks and miss out on education and the opportunities that presents for them in the future. He spent time teaching in Northcott crippled children's school and the Forster Central School, making sure that children who did not have the easiest start in life did not miss out on the benefits of a good education. Education is clearly one of the most important and effective tools for breaking the cycle of poverty and disadvantage. Tom has been a champion of various initiatives to improve education standards in this country. He has raised his voice on his professional concerns over governments' lack of enthusiasm for continuing efforts to improve our international competitiveness in the delivery of our education. Good education is a vital step in gaining the skills and knowledge necessary to fill the jobs of the future. Educating our future generations is the only way we can ensure our economy will stay strong into the future. Our teachers and principals, including the veteran Tom McBride, are doing a fantastic job on the ground in working towards this goal, but they need all the support and commitment of our community as a whole. On behalf of a very grateful community I congratulate Tom McBride on his 60 years of dedicated service to education in New South Wales and thank him for the vital role he has played in educating many of our young people for the roles they will go on to play in the future of our country. Greenway Electorate: Medicare Office Ms ROWLAND (Greenway) (10:13): I rise to raise the issue of the recent action by the Minister for Human Services and self-appointed Liberal 'duty senator' for Greenway, Senator Payne, to close Blacktown's Medicare office on Saturdays. This is a callous decision. It is going to have an extremely detrimental impact on my constituents and it reflects on a government that is completely out of touch with the community. They are more concerned with introducing an archaic honours system than improving services in Blacktown and Western Sydney in general.",152,Constituency Statements
242,Mr Hayes (Fowler,"Chief Opposition Whip) (10:10): I rise today to congratulate TomI am quite outraged about this not only because of the substance of this action but because of the way it has come about. The minister has cut this service to my constituents-another broken promise from this government which promised not to cut health services-but the minister and her office did not even have the courtesy to inform me as the local member. It is not like she is any stranger to Blacktown. I have before me, and I am very happy to table it if anyone wants me to, a picture of Minister Payne who at the time was also the self-appointed 'duty senator' out doing the campaign launch for Jaymes Diaz in Greenway, so it is not like she does not know where we are. She is very happy to go and hang out with Jaymes Diaz, but she cannot do the right thing-the courteous thing-and let the local member know about this. It stands in stark contrast to when Labor was in government. We recognised in particular that working families need accessibility; they need to have opportunities where they can access these services. Thanks to a community campaign by residents in the north of my electorate-around Stanhope Gardens, The Ponds and Kellyville Ridge-where the nearest Medicare offices are a fair distance away, either in Castle Hill or in Blacktown, we opened a new Medicare kiosk in Rouse Hill to make it accessible for them. Minister Kim Carr came out and, within about a week, he was able to tell me that it had far exceeded expectations. What kind of a government operates like this? It was a sneaky, mean move by a government with very twisted priorities. My constituents who work Monday to Friday and cannot get to their Medicare office during the week rely on it to be open on Saturdays. This decision was made without prior community consultation and without even informing the local member. If the minister or anyone thinks that all these services can be delivered online they are plain wrong. As has been pointed out by some of my colleagues, when you need to perform certain functions you need to go in in person. This is an outrageous decision by a government with very twisted priorities. Broadband Ms PRICE (Durack) (10:15): This week's attack by the member for Perth, Alannah MacTiernan, on the Abbott government's rollout of the NBN was nothing more than an attempt by the Labor Party to use the regions for their own political gain. The member for metropolitan Perth has no interest in helping the people of Geraldton or the rest of regional Western Australia; she just wants to use them as a political football. Why else would she go out of her way to use valuable parliamentary time to talk about a region outside of her electorate? Is nothing else happening in Perth? Her speech was a fumbling, inaccurate account of Geraldton's NBN rollout that was focused on attacking a highly respected minister rather than the issue at hand. As Geraldton residents would know from the many times I have updated them on the NBN, our government is working to resolve the many issues caused by Labor's failed attempt to roll out this service while ensuring it continues in a timely and cost-effective manner. In fact, our rollout will save Australian taxpayers some $29 billion. In Geraldton specifically we have continued to progress with design work while we look to negotiate new contracts to build the network. We are hopeful these will be signed in coming months. What a lot of people do not realise is that, under Labor, work in Geraldton had come to a grinding halt. Syntheo had walked away from the project months before the federal election in 2013. Labor's constant attack of the NBN rollout is nothing more than a smokescreen for their own failure and a way for them to pass the buck. The truth is that, despite Labor's shameful promise that they would deliver the NBN to regional Australia, NBN Co never owned the radio spectrum to cover the wireless footprint. In other words, it was never going to happen and we have been left to the pick up the mess. The member for Perth has done nothing more than create another mythical world for Labor rather than live in reality. The reality for Geraldton is this: Labor became fixated on one form of technology-fibre to the premises-and have tried to claim that this is the only way Australia can achieve very fast broadband, which is simply not the case. The UK and the USA have both successfully used fibre to the node, so it is not remotely experimental and has been proven not only to deliver very fast broadband but to deliver it cost-effectively-something the Labor Party does not seem to understand. Despite this, Minister Turnbull said only yesterday in the House that it is very likely that the rollout of the last four contracts in Geraldton will be fibre to the premises. Unlike Labor, our government does not want to make promises we cannot keep. Lung Cancer research and support for those suffering from lung cancer. Many members, including the member for Shortland, were at a function just the other day put on by the Lung Foundation of Australia to raise awareness within the parliament and the community of the issues facing those with lung cancer. Lung cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the biggest cancer killer in Australia. It kills more than 20 people each day-more than breast, ovarian and prostate cancers combined. The economic and social burden of lung cancer is high, and, as we know, survival rates are low. What has become clear with respect to treatment for lung cancer is that there is a need to take a multidisciplinary approach and a need to ensure not only that care involves specialists but that lung-cancer nurse specialists particularly are made available to provide a complete mode of treatment for those who are suffering from this debilitating disease. Studies have been done showing that an approach of that nature actually will have a positive impact not only on the well-being of the sufferer but also on their survival rates over time. The Lung Foundation is saying to the government that there is a need to do a pilot in relation to lung-cancer nurses and it is seeking some $12.6 million over two years to establish this program and test its viability and success for those who are suffering from this debilitating disease. I would urge the government to consider this submission very seriously. There is no doubt that lung cancer is a terrible killer and there is no doubt that providing people with a multidisciplinary approach is important, particularly with nursing care from experts who understand the nature of both the treatments and the debilitating condition that this cancer is. It is an important part of giving people the best possible care in what will often be the most traumatic time of their lives, not only for them but also for their families. We have multidisciplinary approaches and cancer-specialist nurses in some other fields of cancer. Lung cancer is certainly deserving of this sort of support. I urge the government to consider this submission very seriously. Times may be tough, but, if you are in a situation",154,Constituency Statements
243,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (10:18,"I rise today to remind the House of the importance ofwhere you are suffering from something like lung cancer, then, frankly, the circumstances of your life are absolutely appalling. I urge the government to consider this submission seriously. It is well written, it is important and it concerns something that will provide real care and support for people going through devastating times. Qantas Qantas crew base in Cairns, who received the shattering news four weeks ago that their base will be closed. One hundred and ten crew and their families were given just two weeks to decide whether they would relocate to another base, or resign and take a redundancy. Staff members have contacted me telling me how the closure would impact on them. They saidand this is typical of the comments: 'As a family we love living in Cairns and we are not planning to relocate anywhere in the future. Qantas has forced us to uproot our lives, take our kids out of day care, forced my husband to leave his job, and made major changes regarding our financial stability.' 'We have been challenged and distressed by Qantas's decision. Our family enjoys living and working in Cairns. We share a sense of passion and engagement amongst the community and the diverse environment.' 'As locals on flights, we give great advice on what to see and do in Far North Queensland. We recommend locally owned operators and businesses. No other port in Australia has a crew so dedicated to promotion of their area.' 'Our outstanding commitment and performance has been overlooked by the upper echelon of corporate Qantas.' These comments are backed by the fact that Cairns consistently rates high in its customer service scores, as voted by the passengers, coming first in Australia in January, December and November. This is adding to Qantas's bottom line, as fantastic customer service has economic value and encourages repeat and referral bookings. I wrote to the CEO of Qantas, Alan Joyce, on 4 March and asked him to reconsider his decision, allowing the base to remain, with a reduction in staff size if absolutely necessary, or to phase out the base over an extended period of time, with a review in 12 months. To date, unsurprisingly, I have received no response. TodayI have learnt that some crew have accepted redundancies because they are unable to relocate to a major city. They finish on 4 May. Those crews that are in a position where they have to uproot and move to Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne and Perth will be gone by 30 June. This is very disappointing news. Consider that the Qantas board of directors had a choice of three people to take on the CEO role. Their choice took a world-class, full-service airline and transformed it into a lowcost, no-frills carrier. On the other hand, one of the unsuccessful candidates moved to a lowcost, no-frills carrier and turned it into an outstanding full-service carrier. One ponders on who got the best deal: Qantas or Virgin. I would suggest many of Qantas's woes could be addressed if the board were to revisit that decision. Qantas is a great airline with great staff and a great future. What it needs is a leader with comprehensive knowledge and the commitment to rebuilding and maintaining a full-service airline.

244,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt) (10:22,"I rise today to speak on behalf of the members of theChifley Electorate: 2014 Coral McLean Awards breakfast that coincides with International Women's Day. The focus of the breakfast is to commemorate the service of Coral McLean. Coral McLean passed away from cancer in 2011. She had a long battle with cancer and unfortunately she succumbed. While her passing caused a lot of grief in our area, there were a lot of people that wanted to celebrate all the things she had done, particularly the selfless dedication she provided to our community, where it was estimated she dedicated 100,000 hours of her time to helping others. So we hold a breakfast every year where we celebrate the commitment of women who are contributing to community groups and improving community life across the Chifley area. It is done, as I said, to recognise the efforts of the 'Mother of Mount Druitt', Coral McLean. On 11 MarchI hosted the breakfast in Mount Druitt, and Coral, while sadly not with us, was there in spirit through her police officer son, Mark. We were able to recognise a number of women for their contributions in our area. These women were nominated by their peers and were then assessed by the judging panel-and here I want to thank Julie Dubuc from the Ted Noffs Foundation, West Tradies Director Doreen O'Grady, and Evans High School Principal Kay Smith, who went through all the nominees. The winner was Blacktown's Merleen Millson. Merleen joined with Coral McLean in setting up the Mount Druitt and Area Community Legal Centre and she has been so passionate and very forceful in her advocacy of the service. She was joined by Aunty Jenny Ebsworth and Debbie Higginson, who were jointly named Chifley Woman of the Year, and Christa Anthony, who was named Chifley Young Woman of the Year. We were all very grateful to have present with us the Hon. Justice Margaret Beazley, a woman of incredible substance and achievement in her own right and the first female president of the New South Wales Court of Appeal. IfI may in the remaining seconds just reflect on Merleen's contribution. Merleen has worked across a number of areas and she is someone I count as a very near and dear friend. I was grateful that the independent judging panel selected her, but she should be recognised for her deep, passionate commitment to our area. It was through her work that the Mount Druitt and Area Community Legal Centre was able to secure continued funding to help support people in our area who are in great legal need. I congratulate her on getting the Coral McLean Award. I congratulate the other winners and nominees and commend them for what they do for our community.

It struck me that in the countries they have come from and whatever has brought them here, the one thing I heard time and time again that day was the opportunities they have here versus in their homelands. They are truly great Australians and they appreciate it greatly. There is probably no better illustration and, at the risk of embarrassing Najeeba, than Najeeba Wazefadost. She is a Hazara Afghani and she ran the ceremony. Here is a refugee, now Australian citizen, who came to this country some ten years ago and who speaks better English, quite frankly, than I do-although that is not hard. She ran the ceremony, she knows everyone in our community, she works with Tia at ADSI to implement some great programs on the ground and she works with Violet for SSI. It is great to think that the circle has come back to the end for Najeeba and she can give back to our community in Reid to deliver great results on the ground. I know it is no different for the member for Chifley in his electorate. He and I talk about this a lot. Our paths overlap so we run into each other a lot. What Suzie and I took away that day and what we see time and time again on the ground in the frontline in my wonderful electorate is it is great to be surrounded by community minded people that put in day in, day out on the frontlines to make a real difference. They do not seek praise; they do it because they believe in the cause. They want to give back to our country, they are great people and they deserve our praise, and they most duly get it from me. the time for constituency statements has concluded.

Those three weeks have been harrowing and bewildering, not least for the families of the 227 passengers. I can scarcely imagine the trauma these family members have suffered as they waited for news about the fate of the aircraft. It is indeed with a heavy heart that I make my contribution today and offer my sincere condolences to the families of all those passengers and crew. They will live with the dreadful finality of this incident for the rest of their days. It is fitting that this parliament acknowledge this loss. I have heard directly from my constituents who, like just about everyone on the globe, have been shaken by this tragedy.

248,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (10:48,"Rarely in my lifetime has the world seen a greaterThe people of the inner west of Sydney are thinking of you, just as I am sure every citizen of this nation shares your sense of sadness and loss. In this era of affordable air travel, increasing disposable incomes and generally high aviation safety standards, it is easy to forget that flying in an aeroplane involves risks, just as there are also risks in driving a car or taking a train ride. But people still eagerly fly, because aviation opens the world to us. It allows us to do things once unimaginable. Not long ago, air travel was out of the financial reach of many Australians. Air travel is in fact five times more affordable today than it was 20 years ago. I was in my 20s before I went on my first plane trip, which was from Sydney to Canberra as a ministerial adviser. My family did not have a car; our preferred mode of transport was the bus. It is a very different world today whereby people cross this nation to go to football games and to meet with each other. The increasing affordability of air travel with the arrival of low-cost carriers has also driven increased success in this sector. Over all of my time watching federal parliament, both sides of politics have displayed maturity and goodwill in working together to maintain the highest standard of aviation safety. As the minister responsible for six years, I knew that this would not be a subject of partisan debate and I have undertaken a reciprocal obligation in how I handle my work as shadow transport minister at the moment. Our airlines also constantly strive to lift our already excellent safety standards, and that is something that we can be proud of. But, no matter how much we dedicate ourselves to aviation safety, no matter how much airlines invest in safer aircraft and no matter how many satellites we can use to track aircraft, we will never completely eliminate the possibility of accidents. Today, as we think about the victims of MH370 and their families, we should rededicate ourselves to doing all we can to reduce that risk. Today, I also want to pay tribute to our defence forces and the great people, who I know well, at the Australian Maritime Safety Authority who are leading this search. These are people we call on in difficult times and they never ever let us down. Similarly, as we have watched the difficult challenges facing the governments of Malaysia, China and more than 20 other nations, both inside and outside our region, we should remember our shared humanity. There are many aspects of global affairs that cause division among the nations of the world. During this extraordinary incident a positive aspect has been the way that countries have worked together. Seeing airlines from not just our own country but also China assisting the search from Pearce air base in Western Australia is very positive. But nothing can bring back the victims of this dreadful incident, and investigators will no doubt spend months trying to piece together the events surrounding the loss of MH370. I hope that over time they will ascertain the facts of what occurred. I am confident that, if they learn anything from this tragedy, their lessons will be applied to the never-ending battle to improve safety in our skies. Once again, I express my condolences to the families who have lost loved ones in this terrible tragedy. electorate, in fact, in a search area the size of South Africa, that the hunt continues to recover physical evidence of what we now know must be the wreckage of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370.

249,Mr Porter (Pearce) (10:54,"It is 2½ thousand kilometres off the coast of the Pearcecity of Perth is framed by that incredible expansive ocean that you look out on. The southern Indian Ocean, off the Perth coast, is one of the purest parts of the natural world and, like all truly wild things, it is incomparably beautiful as well as incomprehensibly dangerous. That expanse of ocean was the perilous pathway for the first European contact with the Australian mainland, and for hundreds of years it has been the scene of great drama and great tragedy. In rising in condolence for all of the terrible loss of life aboard flight MH370, I wish to pay particular tribute to a single man who, for the past several years, had made his home in the electorate of Pearce. Aboard that flight was Paul Weeks. Paul had moved into the electorate of Pearce approximately 2½ years ago, following the devastating earthquakes that had affected Christchurch in 2011 and ruined his family home. I had not met Paul and I wish to pay him in this place sincere condolence based on what we know about a father of two sons, three years and 11 months old, and a loving and loved husband of Danica Weeks. Paul was born in New Zealand. He went to school and studied at the University of Canterbury as a mechanical engineer before serving as a soldier in the New Zealand armed forces. Whilst backpacking in Europe, he met his wife, Danica, and they both lived together in London before moving back to New Zealand. In September 2011, following the New Zealand earthquakes, he turned his attentions to Australia, where he set out to take advantage of employment generated by Western Australia's great mineral wealth. Within a week of arriving in Australia, he had three job offers and was settling in to a bright future. As things transpired, Paul ultimately accepted a job in Mongolia with Transwest Mongolia as a fly-in fly-out worker from WA. On8 March 2014, he was actually on his way to commencing his first four-week stint. His family reported that he was excited about this new opportunity, but, as one would expect, this excitement was balanced with the sadness of leaving his family behind. His is a story which so many Western Australians would be familiar with: the sacrifice to provide for a much loved family leading to the very hard reality of long stretches away from home. It has been reported that, before heading to his new job, he devoted himself to squeezing in as much time with his family as he could. His final words were contained in an email to his wife, sent on his journey to Mongolia. They were the words of a loving husband missing his family, words that people who travel too often away from their families would be familiar with. It does not feel quite right to read those words here, but they were very sad words. He was 39 years old. I sincerely extend my condolences to Danica Weeks and her two sons, who have been left without their father as a consequence of this tragic mystery. Paul was one of 227 other people-mothers, fathers, sons and daughters-and 12 crew who all disappeared without apparent explanation from the lives of their families on 8 March 2014. I extend my sorrow to the families of all of them, particularly the families of the six Australians. The thought that a plane carrying 227 passengers can disappear is a terrifying one, but for the families I have mentioned it is a life-changing tragedy. In deep sympathy for those families, I support this condolence motion. Finally, in doing so, I would like to take the opportunity to note the dedication of the men of service at the Pearce air base in my electorate, who have played an instrumental part in Australia's ongoing role in this investigation. I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for their contributions and the efforts that they have made and are making. Many of the inroads into this mystery have come from the hard work of these service personnel, who have had to visually search across the ocean and try to pick up signs of debris or parts that perhaps may be related to this aircraft's disappearance. To give some idea of the work involved, just the Australian operation alone has covered some 500,000 square kilometres. Ultimately, this operation has been essential to making some small headway towards giving the families that we have referred to some closure, and I thank the personnel at RAAF Base Pearce for the small amount of comfort this has no doubt provided to them. Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and all of the previous speakers on this motion. I express my heartfelt condolences to the families and friends of all those who have, tragically, lost their lives as a result of the disappearance of flight MH370. In particular, my thoughts are with the families of Rodney and Mary Burrows, from Middle Park in my electorate, as well as Bob and Cathy Lawton from Springfield Lakes, also in my electorate. I can only imagine the emotional journey that these families have been through since the plane was first reported missing, the anxiety and growing sense of dread that they must have felt until they received confirmation of their worse fears. You are in our thoughts and prayers. As you grieve for your loved ones, we also think of you and grieve with you for those you have suddenly and tragically lost. I also want to pay tribute to and pay my respects to the Australian military and service personnel who are doing an incredible and difficult job as part of the search teams with the rest of the world, trying to uncover and find what is necessary to lay to rest the tragedy of this flight. I also want to express my thanks to those who are offering spiritual comfort and guidance to the bereaved and the families not only in my electorate but in Australia and across the world in other countries. I know this tragedy has stirred many emotions for a lot of people, but I have seen one of the finest displays of humanity with countries assisting each other that would normally not directly assist each other, particularly not in an open manner. I think sometimes through tragedy we see good things as well. This tragedy is a reminder to us all that we are on this planet for only a short period of time and we should all remember that.

There is a significant search and recovery operation being run from Pearce air base in Perth. It has been taking place since the beginning of last week. There have also been flights leaving from Perth Airport within my electorate. The search is being coordinated by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11:02 to 11:14 Australia take responsibility for the search for the missing aircraft in what has become known as the southern vector, one of the two possible flight path arcs which satellite data suggests the plane might have flown.

252,Mr Irons,"On 17 March the Malaysian Prime Minister, Najib Razak, requested thatMalaysian Prime Minister additional maritime surveillance resources, which he gratefully accepted. Since then, multiple unidentified objects have been spotted by sources in the Indian Ocean somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 kilometres from Perth, and satellite data analysis has suggested a high likelihood that this passenger jet went down in the southern Indian Ocean. This has led to an announcement by the Malaysian government that flight MH370 was lost in the southern Indian Ocean and that all on board have perished. It is, however, important that there is, if possible, identification of the objects spotted by the satellites, to ensure closure for the families. There is also the task of locating the black box and working out what led to this plane ending up so far off course. There are no comparable incidents of this nature in aviation history. Given the remoteness of the site and the time elapsed since the calculated time of impact, we can only assume that this is going to be a long investigation and recovery effort. Perth, as the nearest city, will host the investigation. As mentioned in The West Australian yesterday, the only other similar situation to this was the search for Air France flight 447, and that took two years to locate, in calmer mid-Atlantic waters. I am sure that lessons learnt from that search will assist in the search for MH370. I note the Prime Minister's comments yesterday that many of the grieving relatives are expected to come to Perth to be closer to the search and recovery effort. While Perth is a long way from this remote search area, it is indeed the closest place, and it is understandable that relatives will seek to come to Western Australia. I welcome the Prime Minister's comments that visa fees for grieving relatives will be waived and note Premier Colin Barnett's comments yesterday that the people of Perth and WA will be very welcoming and understanding. I commend the Australian Air Force and their search-and-rescue pilots for the important work they are doing in tough conditions. I note that conditions were classified 'sea state 7' this week, which, on a scale of one to nine, is extremely tough searching conditions. I also recognise the international help at Pearce air base, including two Japanese P3s, one New Zealand P3, a P8 from the United States, two Ilyushin 76s from China and a P3 coming from Korea, with a C130H. When I left Perth earlier this week to come to Canberra, I saw the crew of the US P8 taking a rest stop before heading back out to conduct the search. I also make special note in this condolence motion of Paul Weeks, who was a resident of Perth. His young family will obviously be grieving at this time. My sympathies, along with those of my fellow Western Australians, are with you and we are sorry for your loss. To the 239 people on that plane-some who were going home, some who were going to work, some who were just going on holidays or visiting loved ones-our thoughts are with you and with those who are left behind to grieve. Any time we see a loss of life through misfortune or accident in this world, we as a nation unite to assist where we can, but in this instance we have seen the uniting of nations to assist and aid wherever or in any way possible. We hold on with hope that some of these people, who many of us have never known, could be rescued or saved. That is the humanity of our lives coming through, the goodness that rises in us when we see tragedies that have occurred and the dramatic effects of those tragedies on loved ones left behind. We will hear many stories in the coming years of why, how, what and when-similar to the stories we have heard about tragedies like the Titanic. I will leave the technical side of what may have happened to those who are better placed to tell those stories. In closing, I offer my condolences once again to the people who were on MH370 and their families. God bless you all. member for Swan about the work of the Australian aircrew. Reluctantly, I even have to endorse his words about the Australian government acting in a timely and humane way over this issue. I think the government in this instance is doing a good job, as you would expect an Australian government to behave in circumstances like this. Like him and the government, the opposition mourns for the six Australians who apparently have lost their lives and shares the grief of their families. I want to take a different angle in looking at this issue, and that is to look at how this has been handled in Malaysia. Frankly, I have a very harsh view, but I believe it is shared by the majority of Malaysians. The events of the last three weeks, if they have highlighted anything, have shown democrats all around the world the consequences of the lack of transparency and democracy in Malaysia. Not only have we seen the Malaysian government demonstrating a lack of leadership following the disappearance of this flight but it seems, as The Australian editorial noted, that it has been 'chaotic and confused'. The New York Times has described the effects of this. When I mention all these newspapers I am not doing it to drop names. There seems to have been international consensus developed across the Asian, Chinese and Western press to describe what has happened over the last three weeks as 'the dysfunctional leadership in Malaysia', 'poor investigation of the missing flight' and 'the suppression of information, obfuscation and contradiction'. My friend Anwar Ibrahim has been the source of a lot of criticism by the Malaysian government because at one point it appeared that the pilot was a supporter of his. The Malaysian opposition leader sent me Tuesday's The Washington Post, which says: From the moment the plane went missing, the Malaysian government has been ham-handed in its dealings with grieving families and the global glare of attention. It delayed for hours saying anything after the plane first vanished, and over the next few weeks much of the information it disseminated was conflicting, wrong or misleading. The most serious thing for all of us, particularly those who are in a defence relationship with Malaysia, is that apparently only after a week did the Malaysian government advise us that the plane crossed back over the Malaysian Peninsula and that their defence radars seemed to have missed that entirely. The Malaysian government has shown signs of a deeper malaise that comes from half a century of rule without challenge or transparency. When Malaysia's Prime Minister was about to make a statement recently, his spokesperson told reporters that there would be no questions. When reporters pressed for more access, the reply came back from his minders, 'Go and watch a movie.' Malaysia has been ruled by the same governing coalition since independence and has enjoyed strong economic growth. Democrats all around the world had hopes that the last elections would be free and fair and that the country would go down the path toward a more competitive democracy. Mr Najib has taken steps towards modernisation and reform, and he",162,Condolences
253,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (11:18,"I want first of all to endorse the words of theis owed great credit for that. But the election fell should ort. The Najib coalition, UMNO, won a majority of seats in parliament, largely through gerrymandered districts, while the opposition coalition, led by Anwar Ibrahim, won a popular majority and disputed the outcome. Clearly there is a rising popular discontent with corruption, authoritarianism and ethnic favouritism in the ruling powers. It is very encouraging, actually, for Malaysia's future that the opposition coalition consists of younger Malays and ethnic Chinese and Indians, and that it is not simply based on one ethnic group. The six Australians who were on that plane naturally led me to make comments about this and the Malaysian government's handling of this on my Twitter page. In response, a minority-and I would make it very clear that it was a minority-made comments that were highly inappropriate, of a highly-sexualised content and of a homophobic nature. They were not just abusing me, which I do not mind in that I have not lost any relatives and I am not seeking to make myself the centre of this, but abusing the Malaysian leader of the opposition. To an Australian talking about the disappearance of a plane on a political website, it is frankly weird to have people commenting and tweeting to you homophobic comments about the leader of the opposition in Malaysia, as if that had anything to do with the situation. On behalf of people who want an investigation into what happened I regret that, and I regret it very strongly. I would ask the Malaysian government, in its investigation of what happened to this plane, to cease seeking to link the disappearance of the plane to its obsession with the leader of the democratic opposition in Malaysia, who, as I said, enjoyed the support of 52 per cent of the people at the recent elections. The political allegiances of the captain of the plane seem to have little to do with the disappearance of the plane. It is absurd to say that because he had such a view this is somehow a motive for the disappearance of this aircraft in the tragedy that has happened. If that were the case, then the majority of Malaysians would be equally responsible. I commend the Australian government for its humane treatment in this matter regarding our citizens who have been lost and the international citizens who will be coming to visit Perth. I commend the aircrew who, as the member for Swan pointed out, are on very difficult missions very far from Australia. The search area is about as far away from anywhere as it could possibly be. I hope we can all cooperate in a completely non-political way, including within the Malaysian domestic circumstances. This is a great mystery and a great tragedy. How this event will play out, as the former chairman of Qantas security said today, will probably change forever the way all international aircraft movements are undertaken. None of us would have believed that a modern aircraft like a Boeing 777, with all its built-in communications systems, could simply disappear in these circumstances. We are very lucky that international satellites, particularly British satellites, seem to have been able to track where this aircraft apparently has come down in the Indian Ocean. I grieve for the families and I hope that this investigation gets to the bottom of what happened to that aircraft in a non-political way, certainly not exploiting it for domestic advantage in Malaysia. Regional Development) (11:26): I would like to join the Prime Minister and other speakers in extending my sincere condolences to families and friends of passengers on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, now presumed lost in the Indian Ocean, approximately 2,500 kilometres south-",164,Condolences
254,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure andwest of Perth. This is a mystery and a tragedy that has touched the lives of people around the world, particularly in China and Malaysia. I welcome the Prime Minister's offer of support to families who may wish to travel to Western Australia to seek closure around this distressing event. Sadly, six Australians and two New Zealanders were among the 239 passengers and crew when the plane went missing on 8 March and lost all communications with the ground. This is a sorrowful and difficult time, and our thoughts are certainly with the passengers' loved ones. Queensland holidaymakers Rod and Mary Burrows were taking a holiday to China while Mary was on long service leave from the Queensland Police Academy's constable development program. They were travelling with friends, fellow Queenslanders Catherine and Robert Lawton. Yesterday I had the privilege of meeting members of the Burrows and Lawton families while they were in the House of Representatives for the condolence motion. Later it was arranged for them to visit AMSA, which is essentially the nerve centre for the current search operations, so that they could have an understanding that Australia was devoting every possible effort to locating this aircraft and to doing what we can to help these people understand what happened and, as a result, have some closure from this event. Amanda Lawton, a daughter of Robert and Catherine Lawton, and Deborah Hanger, the sister of Robert, and Jayden and Melia Burrows, the son and daughter of the Burrows family, are facing a particular burden and shock loss at this time. We feel especially for them and the other members of their families as we go about the task of trying to understand what happened and recover what may be left of this aircraft. Young Sydney couple Yuan Li and Naijun Gu were heading to Beijing to spend some time with their children. Also on board was Perth based New Zealander Paul Weeks, a father of two, who had moved his young family to Perth in the wake of the earthquakes which devastated their home in Christchurch. A search and recovery operation coordinated by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority has been active ever since it was suggested, maybe counterintuitively, that this aircraft might well have been lost off the Australian coast, completely in the wrong direction from where it was intended to be travelling and almost without any kind of logical explanation. But as a result of modern satellite telecommunications and advice from the engine manufacturer, which monitors movement of aircraft around the world, it was determined that there were two possible paths for this aircraft, and one of them was in the Southern Ocean near Australia. As time has moved on, the northern option has been largely discounted and all of the global effort now is focused on an area some 2,500 kilometres off the Australian coast. Because Australia is the nearest landfall area, but particularly because this area is within Australia's search and rescue zone, under the Chicago convention we have been taking the leadership role in this search operation. This operation is building momentum. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority was yesterday able to resume the search following a day lost because of heavy rain, rough seas and gale-force winds. Today there are 10 aircraft and five ships operating in the area. The five military aircraft come from three countries-Orions, a Japanese Gulfstream and a US Navy P8 Poseidon. There are also five civilian aircraft involved in the search. A number of countries are now involved, and it seems that others will join in this search operation over the days ahead. As others have mentioned, it is a particularly difficult search. It is at the extent of the range of the aircraft that are involved in the search. They only have an hour or two over the site and then they must return to base. Often during the search period items which were thought to be of interest have been found by visual observation, only to have a subsequent aircraft come in to continue the observation and not be able to pick them up. We have even had cases where debris potentially from the aircraft-but, of course, no-one knows-has been plotted and the site has been clearly identified but, when the Australian naval vessel in the area came to pick it up, it could not find it. That has been the exercise all the way through. This morning the Malaysians spoke about satellite pictures which identified 122 objects which may be of interest in the search. This was the precise area where the search aircraft were operating the day before, and none of these objects were sighted. So it is becoming a real demonstration that no matter how advanced the technology is-and let me say that the US, Chinese, Japanese and Australian search aircraft working in that area have at their disposal the best search equipment available anywhere in the world-the most valuable piece of assistance in spotting debris and then recovery is actually people's eyes. That is why the commercial aircraft are of real value in this search, because they have seats to be able to carry a number of observers who hopefully can pick up sightings of some of what may be left from this aircraft. It has already been a week of enormous effort, with the eyes of the world on the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and our leadership in the search and rescue effort. The exhaustive search effort has drawn on the full depth of the expertise available to AMSA, and I can assure families that we will continue our vigilance in seeking signs of the aircraft. Based on the initial advice developed by the US National Transportation Safety Board, AMSA has undertaken drift modelling and other analysis to develop and continually refine the search area in the southern Indian Ocean. Obviously recovery of any kind of debris that may be related to the aircraft will be important for the investigative stage, so it is very important for us to try to find as much of the aircraft as we possibly can. The ideal, obviously, would be to locate as much of the wreckage as possible. That will require sophisticated equipment, some of which we do not have in Australia and much of which will have to be brought from the United States, in particular. It is a priority to recover the flight data and cockpit voice recorders from the aircraft. Machinery to detect the signals sent out by the black box flight recorder is now in Australia and ready to be deployed for that task. We will need assistance with technology, from countries such as the US, to be able to work at those depths in the search area to recover the equipment. It is thought that the aircraft will be lying in waters between 1,000 and 6,000 metres deep. That is exceptionally deep water to be trying to recover anything of importance to the investigation. There are 12 aircraft and at least five ships involved from six countries-Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Japan, China and the Republic of Korea-searching in the area. India has also offered to join the mission. When the investigative stage is undertaken, Malaysia as the flag of the aircraft will have primary responsibility under the Chicago convention, but the US as the manufacturer of the aircraft and something like 14 other countries who have passengers on board will also have a right to be involved in the investigation. Australia has offered its services to support that investigation. I remind members that Australia invented the black box, which may well be a key part of this investigation-probably the most important item in the search. We therefore have good skills in interpreting the data, and hopefully can obtain as much information as we can. This is without question an unprecedented disaster. Once again, I offer my sincere condolences to the families and friends of passengers on flight MH370. There will be no closure for them or the world until we locate the aircraft and exhaust all avenues in unravelling the mystery of this flight. There are a thousand theories about what may have happened. All of them are easy to discount. This is clearly one of the great mysteries of global aviation. We need to find out what happened. Australia remains determined to do its duty to the aviation world and to fulfil its responsibilities to the families of the passengers and crew who were on board. While there is any hope of finding answers we will be strong and determined. We are anxious to work with the international community to find solutions which will help to give closure to the families of all of those who grieve this day. of all of those who are presumed to have been lost on flight MH370. Every one of the 239 passengers and crew have families and loved ones who are going through unspeakable grief at this time. We cannot begin to understand what they are going through or in any way lessen their pain, but we can tell them that they are in our thoughts and prayers. For the six Australians on the flight we feel a particular loss. To the families of Mary and Rodney Burrows, Catherine and Robert Lawton and Yuan Li and Naijun Gu we in this parliament offer the condolences of our fellow Australians. Yuan Li and Naijun Gu were residents of southern Sydney and, I understand, had recently been living in Hurstville, in my electorate of Banks. To their families and loved ones, who are mourning for them at this time: I know that nothing can take the pain away, but I want you to know that I and all the people of Banks are thinking of you. We cannot pretend that we truly know how you feel but we can tell you that we mourn with you and are deeply sorry for your loss. I would like also to offer my condolences to the family of New Zealander Paul Weeks, who was a resident of Perth. We feel a special connection with our New Zealand neighbours and we feel deeply for Mr Weeks's wife and family. At times like this we understand the limitations of mere words. To the families of those lost on MH370 I offer my deepest condolences. I rise to support this condolence motion and associate myself with the comments made by many members in this place, particularly those by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. This is an extraordinary disaster. As the Deputy Prime Minister correctly identified just a few moments ago, it will remain one of the great aviation mysteries of modern history. We last heard from flight MH370 on 8 March, which is almost three weeks ago. It is now presumed lost with all on board perishing. On behalf of the people of Gippsland, I extend my condolences to those who have suffered losses in this extraordinary event. We can empathise and we can sympathise, but we cannot possibly comprehend the grief they must feel and the uncertainty that surrounds their lost loved ones. This event has generated an extraordinary level of interest across Australia and throughout the world. The media coverage has been almost unprecedented in its depth and extent, primarily because of the mystery that the Deputy Prime Minister referred to earlier. The global reaction has been one of disbelief that a modern plane with so many inbuilt security features and technological advances could simply disappear in the manner in which it did. And we have been subjected to all manner of theories and opinions about that. I will leave it",165,Condolences
255,Mr Coleman (Banks) (11:38,I rise to convey my deepest condolences to the families,168,Condolences
256,Mr Chester (Gippsland,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (11:39):to the experts to hopefully uncover what did transpire. The bottom line is that we may never know what actually happened with flight MH370. Our thoughts and our prayers are obviously with the 239 passengers and crew members, including the six Australians whom many members here have spoken about today, who perished. Part of the reason for the global reaction to this event is that air travel in the 21st century has become common to us all. We are so used to getting on board aircraft and just presuming we will get to our destination safely. Air travel in Australia in particular has a great safety record. It is a common experience for us to get on board and expect to land at our destination whether it be for work or for pleasure. I suppose this event has reminded us all of the frailty of human life and that there are risks associated with flight, whether it be risks due to engineering or technical faults or due to human action. I am sure we will be subjected to many more theories in the weeks and months ahead, but for today in this place I think it is most appropriate that we rise to extend our condolences in the manner in which we do in the parliament of Australia. I want to reflect for a moment on the multinational search effort surrounding MH370 and the huge logistical exercise which has transpired over the past three weeks. In particular, I want to give credit to the Australian authorities who have been involved almost every step of the way. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, I have had the opportunity to meet many of our crews over the last six months and without exception they have impressed me with their dedication and enthusiasm, and their youthfulness. It is quite staggering when you see the age of these young pilots, navigators and crew members who are involved in this search effort. Many of them are in their early 20s and they do an extraordinary job on behalf of our nation. I note the member for Riverina's encouragement just now. Given his close relationship with Defence Force personnel in his own electorate, he knows very well what a contribution those young men and women make to our community. The Australian Defence Force contribution in this case has been quite staggering. We have four P3 aircraft in the air and we have the supply ship HMAS Success as well as base support and personnel support. The Royal Australian Navy vessel Ocean Shield is due to arrive on 29 March and we are hopeful that it will play a critical and successful role in the search for sunken wreckage, including the flight recorder, which we all hope will provide some of the answers to the questions we have been asking over the past three weeks. I take this opportunity to publicly thank all of the crews who have been involved, both Australian and international, who have persevered in this search despite some extraordinarily long hours and the difficult search area off the Western Australian coast. If there is a positive to come out of this disaster, it has to be the extraordinary international effort that has been brought to bear on this task. People often question their contribution-the demand placed on the public purse by organisations like the Australian Defence Force or the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. It is in events like this that we see why it is so important we have that capability. Our crews are among the best in the world, if not the best. If there is something to be found there, I am confident that our crews are well placed to do that for us-on behalf not just of the Australian community but also of the international community, which is so captivated by this issue. We do have a great capability for search and rescue and I am confident that if there is something to be found, and it is possible to find it, our crews will be up to the task. The Acting Prime Minister at the time, Warren Truss, and the Defence minister, Senator Johnston, have both visited the Pearce air base. I had the opportunity to visit Pearce last weekend as the search effort was gearing up, and there was an extraordinary level of activity at Pearce as they awaited the arrival of several international aircraft. I reflect for a moment that the international media contingent-the camera crews-numbered into the thirties out the front of the Pearce air base. It was the real focal point of activity in terms of media interest in this issue. I commend the local base staff for the way they managed this issue on the day, and the way they continue to manage the issue, in terms of pride and support for that international media contingent. I also congratulate them on the way they have pulled together this extraordinary logistical effort. As the Minister for Defence himself indicated, the task involved in flying up to four hours to the search zone means they only have about two hours on station to do their work in terms of the search effort-then another four hours back. It is putting a huge demand on our crews. As I indicated earlier, they are young crews; they are enthusiastic and dedicated but they are also extremely well trained and they are doing credit to our nation in the work that they do. I commend them for that effort. It is a difficult area to access. It is also a perilous area for these types of activities, and we wish them every safety as they go about their task. We are talking about some of the worse oceanic conditions in the world. I understand the sea state was No. 7 in the last couple of days. For those who do not travel much out of lakes and rivers, like myself, trying to carry out your work in sea state 7 is quite extraordinary. I wish them sincerely every safety as the crews go about their dangerous task. The importance of this effort in terms of recovery of wreckage cannot be underestimated. It will provide clues for the investigators as they go about their work of trying to uncover what exactly happened to MH370. As we grieve with the families and friends of the passengers and crew, we should also spare a thought for the other staff of Malaysia Airlines. The Malaysia Airlines staff, who would have known the people onboard-the crew-and who now continue to fly those aircraft would have uncertainties and concerns of their own. We should think about them in the days and weeks ahead. The tragedy is that some of their colleagues have perished, people they worked with on a daily basis, and they continue to fly the particular aircraft. That would actually be something quite difficult for them to come to terms with. I wish them well as they go about their task, also, in the weeks and months ahead. Finally, we need to prepare ourselves for the possibility that this mystery may not be solved. To the grieving relatives and friends: I fear we may not ever get a full explanation of what transpired on that flight. In supporting the condolence motion, I simply wish them well in the very difficult time they have ahead of them and again congratulate the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, our Defence personnel, and the civilians who have been involved in this task. They have done us proud and I wish them every safety as they go about that task. debate. When we are in this place, just about all of us use aircraft to travel here regularly; and we travel frequently for other aspects of our positions. We certainly have an affinity with the families and with those who lost their lives on MH370. It is a reality that air travel is extremely safe but there are occasions when things go wrong, and clearly this is one of those occasions. The only hope I really hold is that resolution will",168,Condolences
257,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (11:48,"I also wish to add my voice to this condolence motioncome quickly, after this, for the families-an idea of what actually happened to make some sense of the tragedy and the loss they have had to endure. The trouble with what has happened here-the way the whole bizarre circumstances have transpired with a plane leaving from Kuala Lumpur heading for Beijing, disappearing-is the expectation that it has crashed somewhere on that route. There was some information at the start of this tragedy that it might have crashed south of Vietnam or around the south of Vietnam in the sea, but more and more as we went on the circumstances changed and now it seems absolutely certain that the plane has ended up south-west of Perth, 2,500 kilometres out to sea, under bizarre circumstances. What makes it truly personal for so many of us is the nightly TV news reports where you see the faces of family members in Beijing or in Kuala Lumpur devastated by the tragedy that has occurred. Of course information is going to be very hard to come by, something like the fog of war. When you do not have witnesses and you do not have a whole lot of electronic information, it is very hard to know exactly what happened. Some of the speculation has not been helpful, but it is human nature that there will be speculation along the way. I am confident that in the fullness of time, similar to the Air France flight that crashed in the South Atlantic Ocean, the black boxes will be found, and resolution, closure, will be available to the families of those on board. As we know, six Australians have lost their lives. Six families in this country have been closely and personally affected. I heard the former member for Pearce speak and he reflected on the fact that New Zealander, but Australian resident, Paul Weeks was a resident of Pearce. We have also heard from the member for Banks that there was a couple from the south of Sydney also on the plane. That brings it home even more to all of us and to those people who live in those areas and to a wider group of people that actually knew someone on MH 370. I really did not expect that I would have any real relationship or any personal contact with someone affected by this tragedy, but last weekend I was in my backyard playing with my dog and I heard some movement across the fence. My neighbour Dion said to me, 'Luke, I have to inform you that Jessica's brother'-his wife's brother-'was on the plane.' I have known these guys for some period of time and, whilst he was not an Australian citizen, his sister Jessica, Dion and their son are Australian citizens and they are personally affected. So, whilst we look at this list of Australians and at Paul Weeks from New Zealand and we think, 'This is as close as it gets,' sometimes it is just across your back fence, in the suburbs of Cowan. Maybe that is something similar to what has happened where, at the start, we think of this plane crashing off Vietnam, being lost somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere, and then suddenly it is across your back fence, across the park or across the water; it is close to home. I thank the members of the Australian Defence Force, particularly the Air Force crews, who, in very difficult circumstances, are doing their best to bring resolution to the families of those who have lost their lives on this flight. I pay tribute as well to all those countries that have sent assets and will be sending assets to Perth, to Pearce air force base, and helping with the search to close one aspect of this story. I suspect many of those relatives who will be heading to Perth hoping to receive the remains of their relatives will be greatly disappointed, but my thoughts and prayers go to all those people as well. This is a time of great sadness for many families-not just in Australia but in Malaysia and China and all the way around the world. This tragedy has affected them seriously, and I am pleased that so many Australians are now stepping up to help and to bring closure to this sad and tragic event. Again, our condolences, thoughts and prayers go to all the families. chorus of many, kicking off with the Prime Minister, in this condolence motion for all those on board MH370. Further to the comments of the Prime Minister and my colleagues, I pass on my thoughts and prayers to the families of all involved. I note that the passengers came from a range of nations-China, Malaysia, Indonesia, India, France, USA, Canada, New Zealand, Ukraine, the Netherlands, Russia, Taiwan and Iran-but I focus my comments on those directly affected in our homeland. The Australian passengers were Bob and Catherine Lawton; Rodney and Mary Burrows; Li Yuan and Gu Naijun, who the member for Banks told us earlier were residents of his electorate; and a New Zealand resident, Paul Weeks-we just heard a touching story from the member for Cowan about his wife and children, and we also heard from the member for Pearce that they were residents of his electorate. My family has a sad history in this space. I lost my grandfather in an aircraft tragedy in 1969. I was not born at that stage; I was born in 1971. As my thoughts and prayers go to the families of all 227 passengers and 12 crew, I know that today, some 44 years after my father lost his father in an aircraft accident, he cannot have a conversation about these things without choking. When I stand here and say that I wish them well and they are in my thoughts and prayers, I understand the harsh reality that this will be something they carry with them for the rest of their lives. I hope that through the work of our Air Force and our Navy crews that are steaming to this location as we speak we can recover not only the wreckage but, most importantly, the black box flight recorder so that at least we can in some way do two thingslearn what it was that caused this tragedy and learn for the future so that other aircraft may not suffer the same fate. If we can do that, these people's lives will not have been lost in vain. As I say, my thoughts and prayers go out to all of those affected. Like the member for Banks, I have a large Chinese community in my electorate. We have been in Canberra for the last couple of weeks, but it would not surprise me if I headed back to my electorate tonight and heard over the next week that I have people in my community who have been adversely impacted. To all involved, my thoughts and prayers are with you now and always, and may the souls of those that are departed rest in eternal peace. and join with the world in registering my sorrow and sadness for those on board Malaysia Airlines flight 370, following these tragic circumstances. My condolences go out to the families and loved ones of all 239 souls aboard MH370. I am thinking of them and praying for them through what must be nothing short of a personal nightmare. Those aboard the flight hailed from 15 different nations. Indeed, this has been a global tragedy with significant relevance to our nation as it sits on Asia's doorstep. The majority of those aboard were from the People's Republic of China, a country that Australia has a strong relationship with. Considering the number of Chinese residents in my electorate, this element of the tragedy has touched those in Barton all the more. Most particularly, my heart goes out to the families of those six Australians who left Kuala Lumpur on that ill-fated day. The cruelty of this tragedy has surely been the helplessness it has engendered in these loved ones left without answers. Among them were Queensland couple Rod and Mary Burrows. Rod and Mary were loving parents and were due to become",170,Condolences

259,Mr Varvaris (Barton) (11:59,"I rise to add my condolences to those of my colleaguesgrandparents next month. Mary was a hard working civilian worker in the police force, embarking on a much-deserved long service leave with her husband and two Australian friends, Rob and Cathy Lawton. The families of these four much-loved Australians have inspired us all by rallying together in this difficult time. Sydney couple, Yuan Li and Naijun Gu, in the prime of their lives-in their early thirties-were heading to Beijing to spend time with their children. This surely inspired grief in us all when they were found to be among the passengers lost. These Australians were remarkable for the extent to which we can identify with them. They had working lives, much loved children and loved to travel when they could. The gap that the loss of these Australians leaves in the lives of those close to them will never be filled. Exceptional circumstances have claimed the lives of everyday Australians, just like us, and that is what has touched our community so deeply. This tragedy has touched our community, but it has also impressed upon the international community the essential nature of cooperation and multilateral operations in the face of global tragedy. Examples of this spirit of cooperation include our own Prime Minister's contribution of four P3C Orion aircraft as the world was waiting for all those in the region with the resources, the time and the compassion to step up in aid of the gruelling search. Also encouraging was the Prime Minister's assurance to those international visitors who had dropped everything to fly to Perth after debris was found off the coast, in the Southern Indian Ocean, that they were in the arms of a decent country. That statement was most profound in expressing the sorrow and compassion of Australians following this tragedy. This accompanied an announcement that visa fees would be waived for all the relatives of the MH370 passengers who had rushed to Australia. If there is one thing that we can garner from the extraordinary outpouring of attention and media reporting dedicated to the loss of MH370 right across the world, it is that there is an unlimited amount of heartfelt interest in the case. This was not because people are looking for intrigue or mystery but because we all understand the painful reality when grief is denied answers. As human beings, we have to know; and we especially cannot bear to be left in the dark concerning that which lies most heavily on the hearts of all people: the well-being of our loved ones. Hope after hope has been dashed but countless fine nations have put themselves and their resources on the line to demonstrate their care and commitment. We are committed to ensure that those who are lost are found, and that those who are grieving and questioning receive the answers they need. I commend those fine Australian men and women who have led the international search effort in the waters off our western coast. We may be assured that Australians answered the call and led the way both in the desperate search to find MH370 and in the compassion extended to those who have suffered an unimaginable loss. On behalf of the electorate of Barton, I extend to the relatives of those on board countless thoughts, prayers and offers of goodwill. Ms SCOTT (Lindsay) (12:04): I rise today to convey my deepest sympathy to family and friends with loved ones aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, which disappeared on 8 March 2014. As a nation we mourn the 239 lives-passengers and crew-including six Australians and two New Zealanders, aboard the flight that day. We think of the human tragedy-239 lives. There are 239 people not coming home. I would like to associate myself with the heartfelt remarks of both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition and all other speakers in regards to this tragic loss. To the families of Rodney and Mary Burrows, Bob and Cathy Lawton, Yuan Li, Naijun Gu and Paul Weeks: we send you our deepest sympathy. Sitting in the chamber here today it was very hard to listen to the personal remarks of the members for Cowan and Pearce about the intense personal anguish felt by families here in Australia but also right around the world. It is to these families, friends and loved ones that our hearts go out in this time of grief. I would like to pass on our thanks and gratitude to the Australian Defence Force personnel now responsible for the search. We thank them for their extraordinary efforts. In the words of our Prime Minister, Tony Abbott: The crash zone is about as close to nowhere as it is possible to be, but it is closer to Australia than to anywhere else. The effort is made even more extraordinary by weather conditions in some of the most challenging oceanic environments. I would also like to acknowledge the efforts of many nations involved in the search and recovery activities-China, the United States, Japan, Korea, New Zealand and, of course, Malaysia. We wish all Defence Force personnel safe passage in their work and their efforts in this extraordinary task. Over the coming days, months and years the mystery of the events that led to this terrible tragedy will generate many stories, theories and speculation. I hope we are able to recover the black box so we can ascertain what has caused this tragic loss and ensure it never happens again and also to provide closure for the families and loved ones. At all times we should be respectful of and reflective on the loss of life of mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters, on the loss of 239 people who will never return home. Loved ones will ache for their return and will always feel a hole in their hearts from a life cut off too soon. We grieve for you as you try to make sense of this terrible tragedy, and we stand beside you as you try to find closure for your loss. May God bless you all. the family and friends of all 239 people whom we now believe perished on flight MH370. This has been a highly unusual and tragic situation in which the world waited anxiously for 17 days for some evidence as to what occurred on this flight. There are still many, many questions as to why and how the plane crashed so far away from its flight path-indeed, so far away from anywhere. The crash site in the southern Indian Ocean, 2,500 kilometres from Perth, has been identified by debris found in an international search effort led by Australia. I will return to our role in that search effort soon. I want to endorse what our Prime Minister has said. We extend our nation's deepest sympathies to the families of those on board. They are in our hearts and our minds at this time. The unusual nature of this tragedy has, I think, made it particularly difficult for the loved ones of those on board. It is right that we do whatever we can to show thoughtfulness and compassion at this time. We have extended an invitation-and I know, as is the Australian way, we will be welcoming and understanding-to anyone wishing to make a vigil here to pay respects and mourn their loved ones. Of course our hearts go out to the families of the Australians on board. Two Queensland couples who were friends travelling together-Rodney and Mary Burrows, and Catherine and Robert Lawton-were much-loved parents, grandparents, siblings and friends and, by all",172,Condolences
260,Mrs Andrews (Mcpherson) (12:07,"I rise today to express my sincere condolences toaccounts, fantastic neighbours and members of their community. Also there was a young Sydney couple, Yuan Li and Naijun Gu, who it is reported had two young children living in China. There was also a Perth resident and New Zealand national, Paul Weeks. I know that some family members were present in the gallery yesterday when the Prime Minister moved this motion. I hope they know that Australians are thinking of them at this very sad time. I think the nature of this tragedy makes us all think deeply and reassess. That a commercial flight could go missing for so long and under such unusual circumstances has certainly made the global community question some of the things we take for granted every day. While we still do not know the exact nature of what occurred on that flight-and I am not about to speculate on that at all today-it does remind us that we must remain vigilant to the threats and potential threats that exist in our world today. I want to take a little time in this debate to recognise and thank the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and our Air Force and Navy personnel, who have been and continue to be part of the effort to locate the plane and retrieve the debris. This has not been an easy task, covering a vast area that is so far from the west coast of Australia and under weather conditions that were so bad that the efforts had to be called off for a time on Tuesday. Australia has taken on a leadership and coordination role, with other nations joining the effort, and I want to acknowledge the fine work of our service men and women and the Maritime Safety Authority. I note that the recovery efforts continue today, with military aircraft, civil aircraft and ships searching. We must all recognise that the search and recovery effort is not without risk itself and that the personnel involved are working at the request of our government to help find debris that could provide answers so that the world can gain some understanding of what actually happened. We seek answers so that the families of those on board can have some closure and, most importantly, so that we can prevent something like this from happening in the future. That is what our brave defence and maritime safety personnel are focused on, and I take time during this debate to thank them for their efforts. Once again, to the families of those on board MH370, both here and around the world, I express sympathy on behalf of the community I represent. Our thoughts are with you at this time. this parliament in offering my deep and sincere condolences to the families of all those souls who have been lost with the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370-239 souls, and of course in each case a circle of friends and family of a far and dramatically greater proportion. We acknowledge, grieve for and recognise those who have been lost, and then we realise that for each life lost there are hundreds of people who are potentially affected through the extended network of friends and family; it is a profound ripple effect through numerous countries. Australia, of course, has lost six nationals and one resident. The loss of each of them is mourned. And the survivors-the friends and family-will number in the hundreds in almost every case. These impacts flow throughout communities-in Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and particularly China, which has suffered such a terrible loss.",174,Condolences
261,Mr Hunt (Flinders,"Minister for the Environment) (12:11): I want to join with others inI think it is important to recognise that in the midst of these tragedies we often find the missing best part of ourselves as communities and societies. At the same time that this has occurred we have had a tragic mudslide in the town of Oso in the north-western United States. It may well be that the loss there is similar to the numbers lost in the Bali bombings and the Victoria Black Saturday bushfires. The hallmark of each of these events has been that the best of the human spirit has responded. We see that in the search and rescue that is currently underway, under Australia's guidance-because the likely debris zone off the coast of Western Australia, somewhere in the vicinity of 2½ thousand kilometres or so, is within our search-and-rescue zone. So, the Australian government-in particular, AMSA and the military-and civilian volunteers who are assisting as additional pairs of eyes on the search-and-rescue planes are providing extraordinary support. They are being backed up by international satellite cooperation which is arguably unprecedented. The international satellite cooperation, to the best of my knowledge, has no parallel example, but it is an outstanding exemplar for the future of cooperation. Of course, it is not just Australia but other countries are involved. The United States, China, Malaysia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea and other countries are also involved, and so all of these states coming together represents a critical task. I want to acknowledge the work of everybody who has been involved, particularly the leadership of AMSA. It is something in which the Prime Minister himself has taken a deep weight of personal responsibility. The last thing I want to do is to talk about why we seek answers to this great mystery. Time will tell what the cause was, I hope, but we seek answers for two reasons: to provide closure for the families but also to provide reassurance and greater safety for future travellers. All of us in this place travel on aircraft. All of us have friends and family who travel on aircraft. If there is a new form of threat then we need to know, we need to prepare and we need to be vigilant. We cannot stop all the tragedies but there may be lessons to be learned. That is why we seek the answers, and we will not rest until we give the families closure. (12:16): The circumstances and tragedy of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 is almost incomprehensible. For the families, the friends, the co-workers and communities who have lost loved ones, MH370 is an event which cannot be properly explained. On8 March 2014, Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 departed the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, bound for Beijing in China with 239 people on board. There were parents, grandparents, artists, school students, holiday-makers, people on business trips and, of course, staff of the airline. About an hour into the flight the aircraft disappeared from civilian radar screens and so began the heartache and the horror for the families and loved ones at home. Even as we stand here today, nearly three weeks later, there are still no definite answers. Nations around the world have worked together to try to find some answers and to bring some sort of closure to the families and the communities touched by this awful tragedy. While the search efforts have found pieces of debris which could well be part of the missing jet, the closure which those families and communities so desperately need and the answers they so desperately seek are yet forthcoming. While we are doing our very best to find those answers and to bring closure, Australia is certainly playing its part in the search process. I have to say: search and rescue is something",175,Condolences
262,Mr Mccormack (Riverina,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance)that we do very, very well. Our Navy and Air Force personnel are exceptional at it. As the Prime Minister has said, if there is something out there, we will find it. We are certainly hoping to bring closure to those families. We have seen again how Australia's defence and service personnel will do their very best and give of themselves in times of need. A potential 122 pieces of wreckage have been found off the coast of Western Australia and our defence personnel have been working around the clock to try to solve this mystery. But, as we have heard many others say, we are searching an area of 400 square kilometres. That is bigger than all metropolitan electorates. It is a huge search area and it is so inaccessible. There is nothing out there in the southern Indian Ocean but waves-big waves and the storms that often brew over those waves has made rescue and search efforts almost impossible. P3 Orions go into the area and they have a window of opportunity of only about an hour or two to see if there is anything down there before they have to go back to base. Even if they see something at some particular time, when they go back there or when Navy vessels go out there not long after the pieces may have been taken by waves and floated many miles elsewhere. We are looking for the black box flight data recorder. We are talking about an implement which is not very big. We know that HMAS Sydney sunk in battle in 1941 and the wreck was discovered in 2008. That wreck was 160 metres long. The RMS Titanic was lost when it struck an iceberg in 1912 and it was not found until 1985. It was 269 metres long. We are looking for a black box flight data recorder that is not that big, eventually, at the bottom of a very deep sea and it is going to be very difficult to find. Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss, who was Acting Prime Minister at the time of the event, visited the RAAF Base Pearce in Western Australia last weekend. He had the opportunity to meet with many of the service men and women who are doing their best in this tragedy. Sitting suspended from 12:20 to 12:22 to speak to the RAAF and the Royal Australian Navy service men and women, our best and brightest, who are part of the search crew. I pay tribute to those service men and women who have helped the Australian efforts in finding the missing plane. We know that there were six Australian souls on board that missing plane. We also know that we are doing our very best to locate anything that can identify the plane and to draw the correlation that the wreckage that has been spotted by satellite is in fact part of MH370. Then of course the search will be on to find that black box flight data recorder. The box flight recorder was an invention of David Warren, who lived from 1925 to 2010. His father died when the Miss Hobart crashed in Bass Strait whilst he was on board as an Anglican missionary, flying from Victoria to Tasmania in 1934. One of the last presents that his dad gave him was a crystal radio set which inspired him, and obviously the awful family tragedy, to invent the black box flight data recorder. I am proud to say that he was one of the inductees in the Australian Aviation Hall of Fame in Wagga Wagga late last year. Of course we do need that black box flight recorder to be found to find out what went wrong with this flight. In coming together today as a parliament to express the nation's condolences to the families of those on MH370, few words can explain the tragedy. Few words can console the mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, daughters and sons of those on board, but we can offer them our",176,Condolences
263,Mr Mccormack,"As I was saying, Deputy Prime Minister Truss had the opportunitythoughts and prayers as Australian and international service people continue the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 plane. Mr O'DOWD (Flynn) (12:23): When Malaysia Airlines MH370 went down in the southern Indian Ocean some 2,500 kilometres from Perth it took many lives, including six Australians and one New Zealander, who was actually living in Australia. In the face of tragedy, the families who are left behind must cope with the fact that little is known of how and why the plane ditched into the Indian Ocean. If the authorities can recover the black box then they may solve some of the mysteries surrounding this tragic flight. Two of the Australian victims, Rod and Mary Burrows, had strong family connections in my seat of Flynn and I now give a brief summary of their lives and pay condolence to their families. Rod was the eldest child of George and Irene Burrows from Thangool, near Biloela, who have just moved to Biloela, and the brother of Greg, Paul and Kaylene. Rod was schooled in Thangool and went away to boarding school at St Brendan's College in Yeppoon for his secondary schooling. Rod worked at the power station at Biloela and at the Moura mine before moving to Melbourne, then moved back to Brisbane where he married Mary in the early eighties. They had three children: Jayden, Karla and Melia. Rod was an electrician by trade but worked at the Energex head office until his retirement. Mary worked at the police academy for about 20 years in an administration role and was going to make her decision regarding retirement when she returned from these holidays. Both Rod and Mary had been looking forward to meeting the first child of their eldest daughter, Karla, and her husband, Brendan; this was also their first 'grandbaby'. 'Grandbaby' was a word that Sandra used, so I wonder if that is what they did and what they were going to call the baby. They intended to spend about a month at home and had then planned for another five-week European trip. A little bit more family history: George Burrows, 86, moved with his family from Wondai in the South Burnett area to Thangool in the early 1940s. George continued to live on the property with his wife until they retired to Biloela. Their second son, Greg, and his wife, Sandra, still continue to live on that original property. A special service for Rod and Mary Burrows will be held at 11 am on Friday, 4 April at St Joseph's Catholic Church at Biloela. When their son spoke to the media he said: 'They always put family first. They worked hard to reap the rewards of their retirement so they could travel and spend time with their families in their retirement.'

265,The Deputy Speaker,"I thank the chamber.Tasmania Ms COLLINS (Franklin) (12:29): Tasmania went to the polls on 15 March and, of course, the Tasmanian people voted for a change of government, a government that will come into effect in coming days, as the Tasmanian Electoral Commission goes through the process of counting a Hare-Clark ballot. I want to put on record my congratulations to the new Liberal government and the new Liberal Premier, Will Hodgman, but, importantly, I want to put on the record the achievements of 16 years of Labor. Sixteen years is a very long time for anybody to be in government. That time has seen Premier Jim Bacon, Premier Paul Lennon, Premier David Bartlett and Premier Lara Giddings working to turn the state of Tasmania around. As Labor leave office in Tasmania, we leave the state in a better place than we found it in 1998. I happened to be there when we took office on 14 September 1998 with Premier Jim Bacon. Jim wanted to turn Tasmania around. He wanted to stop the cultural cringe that Tasmanians had about themselves and that others had about Tasmania. He slowly set about that task. He talked repeatedly of the archipelago of islands that make up Tasmania-334 of them, indeed. He talked passionately about Tasmania's positives, about our cultural heritage, about the life in Tasmania and about our food and our produce. He always talked Tasmania up. It took many, many years for Tasmania's economy to turn around, but there was a stage there where we were the fastest-growing economy in Australia, under Premier Bartlett. When we took office, unemployment in Tasmania was 10.9 per cent. Under former Liberal premiers Ray Groom and Robin Gray, it was 13 and 11 per cent, respectively-far too high indeed. As we leave office, the unemployment rate in Tasmania is 7.4 per cent, which, of course, is still far too high, but, given we had a global financial crisis and the state of Tasmania's finances post that, it is an achievement to get it to that level, considering what we inherited. The many, many achievements of those four governments over those 16 years are hard to list, but I will attempt to do so today. They are things like the creation of the Basslink Interconnector, sending Tasmania's clean, green power across Bass Strait to mainland Australia. We wiped out the state debt that we inherited, $1.6 billion, in just six years. Jim Bacon and the Labor government purchased the two Spirit of Tasmania ships to start more regular crossings of Bass Strait to bring more people to the great state of Tasmania. Mr Bacon was always, as I said, talking up the tourism opportunities, but there were some great social reforms under Labor in Tasmania, particularly the Safe at Home legislation. We were the first state in Australia to introduce this legislation to stamp out domestic and family violence in the home. It was a remarkable achievement and a remarkable moment for Tasmania. Also, in May 2005, we were one of the first states to apologise to children who were abused in state care and to offer compensation. We also apologised to the parents and children and families affected by forced adoption in Tasmania. There was so much done. New abortion laws were passed and Labor made significant changes around surrogacy laws as well. Then we undertook something very difficult indeed: to end the forestry debate in Tasmania. That had been going on for decades and decades to try and achieve peace and get agreement between the environmental groups and the forestry workers and industry in Tasmania. I am pleased to say we did achieve all of that. In the last six years, working hand in hand with federal Labor, we delivered record investments in infrastructure in Tasmania, in health care in Tasmania, in irrigation in Tasmania and in education in Tasmania and, of course, we increased the affordable housing stock in the state considerably-all through state and federal Labor working together. So much was undertaken, including the NBN rollout that so many Tasmanians were promised prior to the last federal election regardless of which party won and that they are now not getting. Tasmanians are pretty unhappy about that. There is no doubt that the new Premier, Will Hodgman, has a lot to do. He has promised a lot to Tasmanians and he will need to deliver. He made over $300 million worth of election commitments, so much more than Labor. He will need to deliver and I intend to make sure he does. Dobell Electorate: Marine Rescue Volunteers give up countless hours of their time to improve social, environmental and economic outcomes for our community. The 2001 census found that in Wyong Shire 14 per cent of people participated in some form of voluntary work. This equates to over 16,000 men and women who give their time back to the Wyong community. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the particular contribution of two voluntary organisations in Dobell, Marine Rescue Tuggerah Lakes and Marine Rescue Norah Head. We are blessed in Dobell to have the beautiful Tuggerah Lakes and a coastline of scenic beaches that are the drawcard for tens of thousands of tourists each year. The natural beauty of our beaches and lakes can, however, be deceiving, giving way to dangerous conditions. Unfortunately, people can find themselves underprepared or unaware of the difficult conditions that may be present. When people find themselves in peril they can rely on the hard working, dedicated volunteers of our Marine Rescue bases to provide assistance. Marine Rescue New South Wales is the state's official volunteer marine rescue service. Their members are committed to saving lives on our waterways and provide a number of vital safety services to the New South Wales boating community, including swift, coordinated marine emergency response; search and recovery; boating safety education and a marine licence course for local boaters; and continuous radio coverage along the coastline. Across New South Wales there are more than 3,000 Marine Rescue members based in 46 locations. On call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, the two Marine Rescue bases located in Dobell do a tremendous job in providing protection on our waterways as well as providing educational services to our community. I recently had the honour of joining the crew from Marine Rescue Tuggerah Lakes, accompanying them on a tour of the lake and observing their daily activities and procedures. Marine Rescue Tuggerah Lakes was formed in February of this year, following a vote of members from Marine Rescue The Entrance and Marine Rescue Toukley to amalgamate both organisations. The 80 member strong Marine Rescue Tuggerah Lakes unit will service Tuggerah and Budgewoi lakes, which form part of the largest and most popular of the Central Coast waterways. Marine Rescue Tuggerah Lakes will operate out of two bases located three kilometres apart on the water at The Entrance North and Toukley. Together the bases work in unison to provide stronger operations, with more efficient use of resources that will ensure that volunteers have safe and timely access to the lakes in order to respond to people in distress. My experience with the crew on Tuggerah Lakes allowed me to gain a deeper",178,Adjournment
266,Mrs Mcnamara (Dobell) (12:34,"Volunteers are the glue that binds our community.appreciation of the challenges faced by our Marine Rescue volunteers. I would like to thank Denis, Clem, Peter and the crew at Marine Rescue Tuggerah Lakes for providing me with this great opportunity. The second Marine Rescue base in Dobell is located at Norah Head. The Norah Head Lighthouse acts as a constant reminder of the dangerous conditions seafarers encounter off Dobell's coastline. The volunteers based at Norah Head often brave dangerous conditions to assist those who have encountered difficulties off our coast as well as conducting search and recovery operations. Prior to the 2013 federal election I was privileged to accompany the crew at Marine Rescue Norah Head at sea and experience the challenging conditions the crew face on a daily basis when conducting their operations. In addition to their operations on Tuggerah Lakes and at sea, our Marine Rescue bases also provide a number of services to our local community. Marine Rescue Norah Head helps coordinate the annual merchant mariners' memorial service, which I have previously spoken about in the parliament. The base also provides assistance for sporting events that take place on the ocean to ensure the safety and well-being of competitors. Marine Rescue Tuggerah Lakes are responsible for positioning the fireworks display on Tuggerah Lakes, a highlight of our local New Year's Eve and Australia Day celebrations. These activities clearly demonstrate the benefits our community receive from the hard work of our local Marine Rescue crews, who often put their own lives at risk to save others. I would like to sincerely thank all the volunteers involved in our local Marine Rescue bases for their tireless work in keeping our lakes and oceans safe. Their work is a great example of how communities are enriched through the work of local volunteers. I wish them a very safe current season as well. Richmond Electorate: Budget Richmond Electorate: Environment locals in Richmond have about some of the actions of both the federal and state governments. In the federal arena many locals are very concerned about the potential impacts of the budget in May and what will also come out of the Commission of Audit with potential cuts and the impact that will have on locals. They are very worried about the potential $6 doctor tax and also the dismantling of Medicare. The many low income earners and pensioners in my electorate are very worried about that. They are equally concerned about potential cuts to education and the NDIS and to pensions-particularly when the Prime Minister did not rule that out in question time, yesterday. They are also concerned about any cuts to regional funding, which is very important to our area in terms of infrastructure investment. Another very broad area of concern is the lack of environmental protection from both the federal and state governments. In fact, many locals tell me that, when they look to the Liberal and National parties at state and federal levels they just see environmental vandals. Of course, we see that all the time in our campaigns to have a coal-seam-gas-free North Coast. We saw yesterday the state Liberal and National party government put what I would call a rather pathetic pre-election freeze for six months on new coal-seam-gas licences. That is not what we want. We actually want a CSG-free North Coast, and we will keep on making that clear. We also see the destruction of our marine parks and we have seen the state government allow shooting in national parks.",180,Adjournment
267,Mrs Elliot (Richmond) (12:39,"I rise today to speak about many of the concernsAnother very important environmental issue in my electorate that I want to touch on today is saving lot 490. Lot 490 is a vital piece of open space on the foreshore at Kingscliff, a wonderful coastal town in my electorate. I would like to note that two of the people involved with the Save Lot 490 group, Ron Cooper and Jeremy Cornford, have been outstanding in the work they have done to raise this issue. They have had more than 11,000 people sign their petition to save lot 490. Our National Party state MP, Geoff Provest, and the Premier, Barry O'Farrell, want to sell lot 490, Kingscliff's last coastal reserve, for commercial development. This is Crown land, which rightly belongs to all Australians to enjoy. They have changed it to government property so they can sell it off with no public benefit. Commercial development would deprive everybody of access to the beach, foreshore and bushland and destroy the habitat of a number of highly endangered plants and animals, including the glossy black cockatoo. Crown land and coastal reserves are designed to bring enjoyment to every Australian, not just the privileged few. I stand with them in the need to preserve this land for public use. We have to ensure that it remains in public hands for future generations to be able to enjoy. I commend the Save Lot 490 group for getting more than 11,000 people to sign their petition. Save Lot 490 have released their own concept draft plan aimed at increasing recreational access and preserving the conservation values of the reserve. The plan features increased parking and access to the beach, a series of walking and cycle tracks, dedicated protection areas for endangered plants and enhanced planting of native plants and trees to support the species that are there. Congratulations to the group for doing that. I was pleased in February to join their campaign and sign the petition and stand with them. I challenged the state local MP, Geoff Provest, to rule out his government's sale of lot 490 to private developers. He refused to do that. We have heard nothing from him. The community and I want to ensure that it is retained and managed as community parkland, but our state MP, Geoff Provest, has been completely silent on this issue. I think he hopes it will go away. It will not. The more than 11,000 people who have signed the petition are adamant about preserving this land in public hands. It is too important. We must keep it as a coastal reserve. Many Labor people have not been silent. They have been out speaking about how important it is. The Labor candidate for Tweed, Ron Goodman, last week signed the petition. He stood with the people from Save Lot 490, saying how important it was to stand with them to make sure that we preserve this as public open space. He made the point that, with all the new developments in the area, we need to make sure that we can have public open space at lot 490 and make sure it is maintained for the amenity of the area and also for future residents. I congratulate the Labor candidate, Ron Goodman, for making that very public stand. We need to have the zoning for lot 490 changed to what is known as 'E2'. We need that because that is the only way we can ensure it is retained as a coastal reserve for public open use and not have development there. People do not want development. They do not want a caravan park development there. They want to ensure it is as per the plan created by the lot 490 group. You have all these Labor people who are out there in the community-our state candidate, Ron Goodman; our deputy mayor, Michael Armstrong; our shadow minister for the North Coast, Walt Secord; and me-all united, standing with the community in wanting to see this area preserved. On the other hand, you have the National Party, which will not listen to the concerns of the community-it will not address them at all. It is obviously committed to flogging off this land to whomever they can sell it to. But I reiterate my position: I want to make sure that lot 490 is preserved in public hands. I want to see its zoning changed to E2. I want to see it remain as a great public asset in what is one of the most beautiful parts of Australia. Kingscliff is a wonderful little coastal village as well. We have to retain lot 490 in public hands. Deregulation Ms LANDRY (Capricornia) (12:44): When I walk around and talk to small businesses and industries in my electorate of Capricornia they tell me they are hurting. Things are tough and global markets are down, and some local industries have faced many job cuts as a result-the other day, one manual labour business put off 60 staff. This is a direct result of the legacy left by the previous Labor government. They overspent and recklessly racked up the national credit card. They left small business choking in a stagnant economic environment. Small-business owners ask me what we are doing to help. Unlike Labor, we have a plan, starting with cutting red tape. We take the bureaucratic frustration out of running a small business. This week we launched what is anticipated to be the first of many repeal days. Over 10,000 regulations and laws are going, saving over $700 million a year. This is one of the many steps forward to build a better economic environment in which small business can regroup and thrive. Previously I ran a bookkeeping business in Central Queensland. Through my clients, I am well aware of the burden of red tape. Small businesses are overwhelmingly run off their feet with unnecessary tax and regulation. This week we are making life easier by cutting red tape, but it does not end with repeal day. Cutting red tape and reducing the compliance burden on our business community also includes repealing the carbon tax. Recently senators from Labor and the Greens voted to keep the carbon tax. Their failure to axe the tax is costing big employers in my electorate of Capricornia millions of dollars, and it is causing financial pain for small businesses in places like Rockhampton, Dysart, Yeppoon, Moranbah, Sarina and West Mackay. Labor and the Greens have the cure for this pain, but, shockingly, they refuse to help our local businesses. Instead, Labor and the Greens behave like doctors who have the cure for a terrible disease but who refuse to pass it on to their patients. The government is cutting red tape and tax, while Labor and the Greens sit on their hands. Their carbon tax continues to reduce the potential for job growth in Capricornia. Let me give you some examples. I come from Australia's beef capital. Here the Teys meat-processing plant exports beef. It is one of Rockhampton's largest employers, hiring up to 1,000 people. It is forced to pay $1.8 million in direct and indirect costs due to the carbon tax. In another part of my electorate, in the small town of Sarina, a local butcher has complained of paying costs associated with the carbon tax and is happy to give it the chop. But-guess what?-Labor and the Greens will not do it. They do not care about local butcher shops in this country. This ispardon the pun-an 'offal' situation! I will not mince my words. It is time the carbon tax was deboned, was 'lamb-basted' and got the chop. There is a lot at 'steak'. Responsible action is required to beef up our economy. This tax even affects homeowners and business premises. It has been suggested that, if the tax were axed, council rates in places like West Mackay and Sarina should drop slightly because of the levy paid by ratepayers to offset the tax. That means that small businesses which own their own premises would be better off. But guess what? Labor and the Greens do not care about the bureaucratic burdens facing small business in Central Queensland, because Labor and the Greens want to keep the biggest red tape of them all, the carbon tax. Our government is cutting red tape, while Labor and the Greens are using the carbon tax and red tape to strangle job opportunities and business growth in Capricornia. Global Gardens of Peace Petition: Age Pension Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (12:47): On Tuesday, together with my colleague and coconvener of the Parliamentary Friends of Multiculturalism, the member for McMillan, I was pleased to host the launch of the international charity Global Gardens of Peace here in Parliament House. The charity was established by Moira Kelly AO with the vision to create children's gardens in those communities around the world that have experienced incredible hardship as a result of war or natural disaster. I was particularly pleased to be hosting this function, as it expanded on the theme of another function which I hosted on Monday as the co-convenor of the Parliamentary Friends of Palestine, where we acknowledged the UN International Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. It was perhaps coincidence that these two functions were interrelated, as the Global Gardens of Peace event centred on the unveiling of the charity's first garden, and this garden will be in Khan Younis, in the Gaza Strip. I would like to thank international humanitarian Moira Kelly, and Beatrice Imbert, who is the chair of the Global Gardens of Peace. I would like to thank Julie Ebbott and the project coordinator, Philip Sacca, and everyone else involved in the charity not only for their contribution in making the event possible but also for their contribution in realising the very admirable vision and very, very humane dream that Moira and her team have. The Global Gardens of Peace charity commenced in 2013, but the origins of this charity go back to 2004, when Moira Kelly visited Gaza, in Palestine, on a humanitarian trip. She is known for scouring the world for children who need urgent and immediate medical attention and cannot get it in their own home countries. Moira brings them to Australia to receive lifesaving surgery and treatment. She is revered in Australia for that purpose and also internationally. She was in Gaza. She despaired at the lack of green space and safe play space that was available to children. As a result, typical of Moira Kelly, she became determined to act. She very boldly expressed her desire to create a place for children and their families to the Palestinian government. In 2007 she was met by a delegation from Palestine who came to Australia to see Moira and to hand her an envelope in which she was given a parcel of land and the title for that land in order to realise her aspiration of a garden for children. So in 2013 a Global Gardens of Peace delegation visited the region to secure this 20,000 square metre site in Khan Younis, which, as I said, is a municipality of Gaza City, in order to create Moira's garden. This project is the inaugural project of Moira's long-term vision. Khan Younis will, within the next five years, house a population of 500,000 people. The Global Gardens of Peace project will become the anchor project to see the development of that community. The Australian team of passionate volunteers is working on facilitating the growth of this community. The garden, designed by Andrew Laidlaw, is modelled on the children's garden at the botanical gardens in Melbourne. It will be a natural play space for children and a place for families to come together in a safe and natural environment-something we are all very familiar with in Australia and take for granted, but not so the case in places such as Palestine and in particular in Gaza. Moira Kelly is adamant that this project will occur and that it will be a gift from the Australian people to the people of Palestine. Although her initiative has been met with mixed reactions, as one could imagine, she believes that no matter what your political affiliations are you have to 'do what is right by the children'-and that is exactly what she intends to do. I want to praise Moira Kelly and thank her for her enduring commitment and for her humanity to children, particularly those who have become victims of war, of political squabbling, of poverty and of natural disasters. Finally, from my own electorate I would like to table a petition. I inform the chamber that this petition was considered at a recent meeting of the Standing Committee on Petitions and certified as being in accordance with standing orders. The petition calls on the government to reconsider the decision to limit access to pensions to six weeks while overseas and to extend it to a period have three months as was originally the case. This was a decision taken by the former Labor government. My petitioner, Mrs Ergul Ozturk, undertook to take 633 signatures asking for a return to the original three-month period. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of the undersigned residents of Australia draws the attention of the House to an issue affecting the portability of aged pensions. We feel we have spent our entire working lives in Australia and should be permitted to receive our pensions in manner that does not restrict our freedom to move. We feel the Government should reconsider the decision to limit access to the pension for 6 weeks while overseas, and extend it to a period of three months, as it was originally. We therefore ask the House to request the Government to: 1. Reassess the criteria of awarding aged care and disability pensions for Australians who wish to visit families overseas for a period longer than six weeks. from 633 citizens Petition received. Economy more fundamental than making sure that the economy is strong. That applies to every electorate around Australia and certainly none more so than my electorate of Banks. We have many people in our community who do so much work in seeking to build our economy and to create job opportunities, but those people need the fundamentals to be right in order for their efforts to be as successful as they can be. Our fundamental responsibility here is to get the economy strong so that all of the people in our local communities, such as in my community of Banks, who want to get out there and who want to create jobs can do so. RecentlyI conducted a small business marathon, where I went across the suburbs of Penshurst, Narwee and Peakhurst in my electorate and met with scores of individual business owners one-on-one. The frustration that they expressed with where the economy was over the previous year was palpable. Many of them express a perceived lack of consumer confidence that is holding back their businesses and making it more difficult for them to employ people",181,Adjournment
268,Mr Coleman (Banks) (12:53,"We have many responsibilities in this place but none is that they want to employ. As a government, and indeed more broadly as a parliament, we have to focus on policies that will help to create jobs. It is very clear where the contrasts lie here between the approach of the previous government, on the one hand, and the approach of the current government. We do not think you can tax your way to prosperity, so you have to get rid of bad taxes that harm economic development, and no tax is worse than the carbon tax. We should not forget, of course, the impact of the mining tax on the critical industry of mining and on Western Australia. We have to get rid of these taxes. I think Australians in their heart of hearts know that, and I suspect that many members opposite in their heart of hearts know that too-yet they refuse to act. Let us hope that we see some change so that we can get that much needed relief through. We have to get red tape off small business. There is nothing worse than filling out forms for the government when you are in small business. I have done it, and as a small business owner you have so many things to worry about every day and there are so many more productive things you can be doing than filling out forms and going through bureaucratic processes. I am very pleased to see the strong stance that has been taken on that. We also have to get the burden of regulation off big infrastructure projects and get those projects happening. There have been $400 billion worth of environmental approvals since the coalition was elected, and some of those projects are very large and will create many thousands of jobs. There are terrific initiatives for job creation, and at a more local level for me, in Banks, the WestConnex project, which has been championed by the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, is a tremendous initiative. It will save the average person travelling from Beverly Hills in my electorate to the city about 25 minutes. Think about that in the sense of productivity-it means that you get to your meetings faster, it means you get more done in the day, and the more we can increase productivity the stronger our local businesses are, and the stronger our local businesses are the more people they employ. We do not create jobs by inventing make-work schemes. Businesses create jobs; government's job is to create the broad parameters in which businesses can prosper. It is not to seek to micromanage every business or every activity of society; it is to create those broad parameters so that businesses can do their best. Another thing, that goes to confidence, is government's management and frankly the basic perception of government competence. It is very hard for a small business person to feel confident about investing when they are not confident about the people with their hands on the big macro-economic levers. There has been a lack of confidence in that area. We need to take hard decisions, and those hard decisions involve addressing the extraordinary mountain of debt, approaching two-thirds of a trillion dollars in the next decade. Those decisions will not be easy but they need to be made to get the budget back on track, the government back on track, and that flows through to confidence in the community and that flows through to job creation.
