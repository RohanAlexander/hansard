Although the States have been working in harmony, so far as that could be secured by regular meetings of their representatives, the harmony has been imperfect, and it is certain that a great deal of the work done by the offices of the Agents-General has been duplicated at unnecessary expense. Moreover, it has been less effective than is desirable. No doubt critics at this distance should refrain from saying more. We are all willing to believe that these gentlemen, placed in a somewhat anomalous position, have done their best in trying circumstances. achieved, though only in a partial way, for which we are indebted to them. It is not quite natural to expect that the occupants of these offices will now prepare to commit the happy despatch, and no one desires that they should. Still, it is desirable that some friendly arrangement should be made by which there will be a closer and better cooperation than has yet been achieved in which the expense ratio will be reduced, and which will, in addition, afford the 1 Commonwealth a proper opportunity of throwing its whole weight behind the endeavours which are put forward by the representatives of the States in their own interests. building devoted to one purpose. At that I admit that this is a work calling for a good deal of diplomacy and for mutual concessions; but, for my own part, I doubt if we could have had as the representative of Australia a better man, or one more qualified by nature and by practice, for composing differences amongst those with whom he is working, or by whom he is surrounded. on Sir George Reid to do all that the Commonwealth seeks in this regard. Amongst the first responsibilities by is known as the Trafalgar Square site. which we are faced is undoubtedly that of housing the Commonwealth representatives in London. This work was commenced, as I have said, seven or eight from Morley's Hotel, close to the Charing years ago, and assumed a practical shape, Cross railway station, and almost opposite I think, in 1906. proposition of 1905, except that it was great attraction was that the site is freeof a very general character. At any hold, though it was awkwardly shaped. rate, we commenced about 1905 or 1906; though the first occasion on which, so to accept that site. far as I recollect, still speaking from memory, any definite proposal was laid before Parliament was in 1907. This was after there had been an opportunity of inspecting several sites under the conditions on which they were then offered. We recommended to Parliament, and could have carried here, a proposal to establish Commonwealth offices in Aldwych. I now recollect that the Minister of Home Affairs is right; there was previously a proposal in regard to Aldwych in connection with a vote °f j ^ , ° ° o submitted in order to test the I feeling of both Chambers. The proposal then, however, was to acquire only one part of the site. What was always felt to be the grave objection to the project as a whole was the refusal of the London County Council to part with the freehold. Although we were satisfied of the possibiliA good deal has been ties of the position, it was most unwillingly that we undertook, and rather doubtfully that the House nearly accepted, a proposal which would have left us tenants for a long term of years. However, that proposal commended itself because we felt the urgency of taking some action. As we did not take the opportunity to acquire that site, it was then supposed we should be compelled to choose elsewhere; but there can be no doubt that the Aldwych piece of land had very great recommendations. It is one of the few blocks consisting, so to speak, of an island surrounded by highways, and capable of being occupied by one time, however, we were negotiating for only a portion with a frontage to the Strand. Though thus limited, the area, no doubt, would have sufficed for many years, but there was another element which detracted from it at that particular time. After visiting London in 1907, and taking special opportunities afforded to investigate the I think we can safely rely available sites, and having regard to the fact that the London County Council still insisted on retaining the freehold at Aldwych, we entered into negotiations for what the Admiralty.

The proposal was negatived by another place, and we did not proceed with it. memory, I should have said that the Minister of External Affairs was right in his first statement. As a matter of fact, we had the numbers here, but I have confused what was with what might have been had we proceeded. Trafalgar Square, I still submit, possesses many advantages which the Strand site does not. The Trafalgar Square site is passed every day by a greater stream' of people than any other spot in London. falgar Square occupies an extraordinary position, which, however, it is unnecessary to describe, since we are not dealing with any site there. As it happens, owing to Charing Cross station, and to its central position, the hundreds of thousands of people who pass through the square every day furnishes one of the most astonishing spectacles in London. Of course, crowds can be found in the Strand and the narrower thoroughfares in London, where we find frequent blocks in the road traffic; Still, there is manifest congestion even in Trafalgar-square with all its exits and -entrances. should have see""h it on the occasion of a Labour demonstration as I have when a young man ! falgar Square area lay in the particular shape which would have made it somewhat difficult to expand the accommodation as required. difficulty about the title? posed of. Since then the situation has been entirely altered by the reluctant and tardy consent of the London County Council to part with the freehold of the Aldwych site, of which the Government now invite our acceptance. We must admit that this .great area enjoys an exceptional position on the highway, equi-distant between the two best-advertised and bestknown sections of London-the city proper, where all the financial interests are centred, penditure is a glance at what Canada has and the west end, where politics are centred and the Departments of the Government are gathered together. There we are in touch with many of the great shipping and other interests, so that, though it is not, perhaps, in itself as good as a site of equal size, either in the centre of the city or in the centre of Trafalgar Square, this block presents advantages impossible elsewhere except at a far higher figure than we are prepared to give. It appears to me the best site we are likely to obtain. On this site, always a conspicuous position in London, we may well be content to erect the buildingto house our representative men in London, whose business it will be to study Australian interests at that centre. It will be confessed that we have been rather tardy both in our choice and in this action, especially when we take into account the extraordinary success of the efforts which have been put forward by the great Dominion of Canada during all the years that we have been idle. which have been put forward those of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company? have a Government which is entirely sympathetic, which lends its assistance to every possible agency for the development of its territory, year after year throwing the whole weight of its most experienced and able High Commissioner into the balance. But it has also the Canadian Pacific Railway Company-on e of the greatest financial bodies represented, even in the city of London-whic h spares no expenditure and no advertisement to bring about the same result. To-day the second great trunk line of Canada is being constructed by the Dominion Government, thus increasing the man hunger and the woman hunger of the great Canadian West, where in the near future some millions of our people will be settled as prosperous land-owners. With this great example before us and with the keen competition to which we shall then be exposed, it becomes necessary for Australia to enter into a scheme, which, I confess, at first sight, rather shocked me by reason of its seeming extravagance. To me, _£6oo,ooo appears a very large sum to invest upon London offices, especially when we consider that their adequate upkeep will involve a large annual outlay. But what braces one up to face this large exdone and at the reward which she has reaped. In that country, in spite of certain disabilities, the rate of progress is amazing.

The day of this competition is by no means past, and is not likely to pass. are doing their best to prevent competition, best to limit competition to that which can be beneficial to themselves. After all, there are trusts and trusts, and no particular line of industry of any size here is under the thumb of only one trust. Competition is not likely to cease. ourselves in friendly fashion against our own relatives in the Empirei f we are to secure our share of that stream of. British immigrants which will not be indefinitely continued, and which we must confess is partly stimulated by conditions in the Mother Country that are open to question. We have no time to lose, and in these circumstances I think that this Parliament can be persuaded to approve of the proposal of the Government. I must confess that if we could have started operations on a smaller scale I should have preferred it. It seems to me, however, that the situation has been narrowed down by investigation, until the only choice we have to-day is between the smaller area, with its frontage to the Strand, and the whole area. There is no doubt that the 13,600 square feet which front the Strand represent, from an advertising point of view, by far the best portion of the whole block. The remainder of the site will front the new streets called into being by the London County Council very fine and very handsome streets, but thoroughfares which do not carry a tithe of the population that flows to and fro along the Strand. Under these circumstances, although I cannot but grudge the money-althoug h ' I cannot but feel that we are being committed to a lavish expenditure-havin g in view the developments which we. are reasonably entitled to hope will at once follow, and the gradual expansion which, under ordinary circumstances, we may anticipate, I am of opinion that, from a national point of view, we should acquire the larger area. The possibilities of our achievements in the Mother Country, as the result of our embarkation upon an active policy, are not shown merely in the case of Canada. They have been shown evenfmore to our discredit if I may be permitted to use that termby the manner in which New Zealand, despite her small area and .population, has contrived to cut a figure in the Mother Country enabling her to appear as if she could offer the same opportunities for development as the whole of this continent. All credit is due to the active and energetic New Zealanders who have initiated and continued this policy, and who have managed to keep their Dominion to the front under good or ill circumstances. That country affords us an object-lesson of what can be accomplished We have to pit even upon a relatively small scale. The investment which is now proposed is, of course, somewhat speculative. But we cannot get rid of that element if we are to provide in advance for the possible and probable developments of the future. If our agency is to be truly Australian-that is to say, if it not only justifies the confidence of our people as a whole by the ability and vigilance with which it is conducted, but, if by judicious and friendly consideration, we are fortunate enough to enlist-as we ought to be able to enlist-the co-operation of the several State Governments with us in at least as mucb of this work as is common to them., we shall not only have set a good object-lesson in London as well as here, but we shall have united our forces in such a manner as to obtain the best possible results. State representation in London? the States are great buyers of material for their railways. passed the railways will be Commonwealth property. meantime they are State property. In addition to that, the States are deeply interested in the sale of their citizens' produce to the greatest advantage in the London market. Amongi the functions with which the Commonwealth is associated, this represents one of the most important to us from the £ s. d. point of view. In this matter there need be no exclusiveness. I am sure there would be no gain if we wiped the slate clean of all State activities and agencies in the Mother Country to concentrate them in ourselves. What we",18,Thomas

However, a lease, especially of that duration, can be disposed of at any time on fair terms.

I therefore take its reply merely as an intimation of one obstacle, which, I am satisfied, will be overEmpire in those striking and vivid events come long before we are able to offer anybody an actual home in the new building. Possibly some of us are still smarting under our recollections of the manner in which our overtures for Federal unity ,were received in many quarters, but, as these die away, we shall have, I hope, no motives of any kind for impairing the friendlier relations which we hope to see established, or for delaying the cementing of our Australian aims and feelings. This will be within our grasp when the building has been established and is occupied both by those who will speak for the Commonwealth and those who will speak in their individual matters for the several States. The cost is the only question which we are called upon to consider now. After r several years of negotiations, we may be fairly satisfied that we cannot expect to beat down the County Council any lower. I do not know that we are entitled to try, because this is a wholly exceptional part of London; but even if we were inclined to try, we must realize that it is hopeless. We can, I think, put that course out of court. It is now a question of "" take it on those terms, or leave it . "" In the circumstances, our path is plain. We must have a wise regard to the opportunities which we need, and of which we ought to make use, for popularizing Australia in the Mother Country. This is a work which will bear fruit in many ways at first unseen, and affect, I hope, our relations with When more intimate confidences are established between us, when we are more in touch with Downing-street, and Downingstreet is more in touch with us, the few remaining causes of friction among those that existed during our experience as a 'Commonwealth will be removed.

We have already delayed too long. Although we have great projects before us, involving the It is not a expenditure of large sums of money, and huge in the amount of work which they will entail, I believe that this additional proposal is not too much for Australia to In face.

The Prime Minister in his Budget speech said that a great building such as this would be a bigger advertisement for Australia than, perhaps, £100,000 spent in any other way. Well, as an advertisement, I do not think that it is quite worth ,£600,000. It may serve a necessary purpose, but we must not forget that there is no great urgency about the work. It is not urgent that we should spend £600,000 to proThe site is also vide a building for the High Commissioner at the present time. The opportunities for obtaining a suitable site will not be less, I suppose, as time goes on. But at So that it is centhe same time we must not forget that in this new country we require very much for the development of our own resources. We have a new land requiring development. We need almost all the capital that we can command to facilitate settlement. We want railways, roads, water supply, and other necessary works in order that this great territory of ours There is not the noise there may be occupied. We require numbers of our own countrymen-thos e of the stock from which we spring-to come here, and take a part in helping to develop Australia, and to make it a place that will be self. reliant and able to defend itself in such times of difficulty as have been referred to by the Leader of the Opposition. When we require all these things, is it necessary that we should spend £600,000 at the present time? The States are making every effort-at present to develop their lands, and we are taxing the people very heavily to obtain the necessary funds for carrying on Government projects of various kinds, and since we have also to take in hand that great work, the development of the Northern Territory, we ought to consider whether we may not be open to the charge of being rather reckless in proposing to expend £600,000 upon a show place even in London.

I cannot agree with the remarks of the last two speakers. opinion that the site proposed to be acquired is a very good one, they seem to condemn it and to prefer the Trafalgar-square site. I consider the latter site utterly inadequate for our purposes. cient; the existing building would have to be levelled to the ground and a new structure put up, and it would be possible only to get a lease of that site. . With all deference to the opinions of some honourable members, I think it would be very unwise that a Government representing the Australian people should be under any obligation with respect to a lease to any person in the Old Country. I do not intend to refer to tlie sentimental aspect of the question. I would not persuade any honourable member to agree to this morion on the ground that a number of persons passing this building would say what a wonderful building it was, and what a wonderful country Australia must be. expensive undertaking if proposed for the sake of an advertisement alone. in the large centres of population in the Old Country are so familiar with advertising that they take no notice of advertisements at all, unless they are of a specially artistic and striking character. I think the mistake we are liable to make is this: We are looking for a site for a .building which will represent Australia. The Commonwealth, which is only ten years old, has a great future, and we should regard ourselves as shareholders in a big company which is considering a business proposition. Long after we have passed away, the Commonwealth will be recognised all over the world and in the Mother Country. If the Old Country continues to progress, from a material point of view, as she is doing at presentI wish I could see the same rate of progress in other respectswe shall be able, by the proposed investment, to double our money within twenty or twenty-five years. That, surely, is good business. other State capitals, you find shipping and [i47] . insurance companies erecting palatial buildings, in which most of the accommodation is subsequently let out for offices. The companies get good returns from these investments. A shipping company, in its calculation of profits, pays regard to the return from its ships. Business men are fond of saying that politicians have no capacity for business, but the Government is now submitting one of the best business Although they are of propositions that could be made. Undoubtedly we shall have to incur a large expenditure, but if we do not close with the offer of the London County Council, that body will not have to go begging to some The area is not suffione else. Any one who has seen London during the last few years knows that. The Council has gone out of its way to make us a generous offer. Its policy is to. let its land on leasehold, but it has made an exception in our favour, and offers us a freehold. ' I do not know where else in London we could get a freehold to-day. That we have big public works to carry out in Australia is not a reason why we should be blind to what is taking ""place in other parts of the world. The right honourable member for Swan suggests tiiat we should go all round London, leasing this corner and that corner, and being kicked out every few years. This would be rather an thing of the kind. People member said that it is possible for us to lease the land that we require. I do not think that it would be dignified for us to take a leasehold, and be liable to be dispossessed after a comparatively short time, to make way for a leviathan restaurant or some other enterprise of the kind. The desire is that the Governments of the States shall lease parts of this building from us, and it is intended to provide a central place in the heart of the Empire where any one seeking information with regard to Australia can obtain it. It is said that the States do not wish to join in with the Commonwealth, but the day will come when this prejudice will cease. In any case, by letting the spare space for office accommodation, the Commonwealth will be able to get its money back.

In the case of Queensland we can understand that, owing to the fact that . a very extended lease has been entered into . by the State, and some money spent in connection therewith, there may be some hesitation at first j but this, I hope, is only a matter of negotiation. from any of the States except Victoria, the Government of which have already arranged for offices on the same site. ground, because the ideal represented in this building is the true ideal of the Australian people. events must be to concentrate all such efforts for the sake of efficiency, economy, and harmony. Let the Government induce as many States as possible to co-operate, and I believe that we shall ultimately have all under one roof, and thus accomplish the results we desire. My own opinion is that the Commonwealth could well afford to lose even £10,000 a year, considering the -prominence of this building and the advertisement it will be to the Commonwealth. The building will represent to England what Australia is and what it hopes to beit will be the embodiment of the power of a Dominion. The accommodation now provided for the High Commissioner is utterly unsatisfactory, and I believe that the first instruction given to Sir George Reid, after his appointment, was to look out for availThe accommodation at our present offices is very unsatisfactory in every way, and removal to more convenient and suitable premises is urgently So urgent is the need that he addsEveni f the scheme which I have so strongly recommended for the purchase of the site offered by the London County Council in the Strand, and the erection of offices thereon, is soon approved, there will be a long delay before the new offices can be completed. If the site is purchased 1 will recommend that we get as near it as we can as soon as possible on a short tenancy. As to the expenditure of £600,000, we ought to look at it r.ather from an interest point of view. On a 4 per cent, basis, it represents an annual expenditure of £23,480; and, on a by no means oversanguine estimate of receipts, the estimated cost to the Commonwealth is £11,288 per annum. wealth gets all the accommodation that it requires. cludes a common-room for exhibitions, which, of course, will be at the disposal of all the States. If we did not acquire this site, and had to pay for adequate office accommodation in London, our outlay would be at least £5,000 per annum. Even that sum would not be sufficient to provide reasonable space in which to exhibit Australian products. So that, allowing for the growth which we must contemplate in the future, it seems to me that the proposition put forward by the Government is a sound and business-like one. What we have chiefly The ultimate trend of to remember is that the building which it is proposed to erect is intended to serve certain definite purposes-purpose s which are as wide as are the duties of the High Commissioner. We require central offices in which the High Commissioner and the whole of his staff may be established. The inspection of materials purchased for the Commonwealth or the States will thus be carried out with greater economy. Then, the building will prove a boon to those seeking information concerning Australia, so that from the immigration stand-point the position will be infinitely better than it is to-day. I trust that the products of Australia which will be under the control of the High Commissioner will be used for exhibition purposes in various parts of Great Britain.

We are all particularly indebted to the late Mr Batchelor for his efforts in that direction. The opportunity of inspecting these sites was availed of by almost every honourable member who journeyed to London, and, as a result, we are now able to cast a conscientious vote upon this question. opinion that the Government have selected the best site available, and that they are getting a splendid bargain. The sum of £600,000 is a very small one to pay for such a valuable block of land as that which it is proposed to acquire and for the buildings which are to be erected upon it. I hope, therefore, 'that there will be no delay in closing with this magnificent offer. During my limited stay in the Old CountryI fully recognised the necessity of establishing the High Commissioner in more suitable offices. At present he is dreadfully hampered for want of room, and I feel sure that he would do much better work for the Commonwealth if he were located in offices which gave greater floor space, and especially if the Agents-General of the various States could be induced to occupy the same building. a good deal about the development of Canada. recognise that the Canadian-Pacific Railway Company has done much to advertise tliat country. Why? Because those interested in it realize that every individual who is brought into the Dominion will add to its wealth, and assist in enhancing the value of the land which has been give-' to them by the Canadian Government. The great question which presents itself to my mind is, "" Are all the immigrants who are attracted to Canada of a desirable class?"" To my mind they are not. If we establish our High Commissioner and the Agents-General of the States in the same building in London we shall be able to do much to advertise Australia, and to secure to the Commonwealth that stream of immigration which we all desire. Seeing that so much reference has been made to the question of immigration the right honourable member for Swan when I am pleased to place upon record the he referred to that subject. my remarks are out of order, because I desired to read an extract from the report of the High Commissioner, showing that the stream of immigration to Australia today is greater than it has ever been. Even now Sir George Reid is doing much to advertise the Commonwealth, but he will be able to do infinitely more when he secures an exhibition of Australian products in the building which it is intended to erect upon the site which is now under Personally I am of consideration. I am quite in accord with the proposal of the Government, and I think that the money about to be expended upon this project will be well spent. Like the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, I desire to thank the Government, and especially the late Minister of External Affairs, Mr Batchelor, for having afforded honourable members who recently visited London an opportunity of inspecting the various sites for Commonwealth offices which were then under offer. I am very ipleased to be able to support the Government in this scheme. They are doing the right thing. While in London, we were shown over the present offices of the High Commissioner, and I have no hesitation in saying that they are miserably small and inconvenient, and in During this debate we have heard the wrong place. After inspecting all the sites, I am convinced that But honourable members must the one now offered is the very best. It is much superior to the Trafalgar Square site. With the land costing £364,000, and the building estimated to cost £223,000, the site is a very cheap one indeed, considering the space available, and I agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh that in twenty years' time the land and buildingwill have more than doubled in value. After going through the country, we did not think Great Britain was at all decadent. Rather we thought it was growing every day.

Honourable members who have lately had the privilege of visiting the Old Country are in favour of the project, and we must be largely guided by their opinion. We shall be able to erect a building which will be fairly representative of the Commonwealth, and shall be able, not only to assist in working with State agencies, but also to show to the people of the Old Country something of the relation between the Commonwealth and the States. As far as I can judge, some such building is very necessary at the present. There seems to be a vast amount of ignorance amongst people at Home as to Australia generally, and especially as to the relation between the Federal Government and the States. In such .a building as it is proposed to erect, the Commonwealth and States will be able to co-operate, not only in the great .work of immigration, but also in developing markets for Australian produce in England and on the Continent.

I am glad that the Commonwealth is acquiring the freehold of the London property. Honourable members opposite have hitherto professed that they favoured leaseholds rather than freeholds. Now, however, they prefer a freehold. I congratulate the Government on being able to acquire the freehold of a great London property. I am satisfied that we should not do better by waiting. We have offered to us a site that seems adequate for our purposes, and the best thing we can do is to close with the offer as quickly as possible. By taking this step we shall put ourselves in a far better position to advertise our resources than we have hitherto occupied. I do not like a proposal to sink £600,000 in this way, and if we could use a portion of that money in other directions we might get better value for it. ber suggests that we should have a perambulating office on wheels? ing that we might get more for our money by advertising; but since we are going to acquire the land, the sooner we erect a suitthe figures in the Estimates, for cost able building the better.

I hope that when the Government come finally to deal with this matter they will endeavour to make two ends meet. WhilstI do not think that they propose any undue expenditure, I believe it is possible to so arrange matters 'that they may derive from the building an even greater income than that outlined in the scheme put before us. I agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh that business firms do not erect palatial premises for philanthropic reasons. Such enterprises are keen business, propositions, and we should be able to deal in the same way with the buildingi to be erected on this magnificent site. We have placed before us two sets of figures. One of these, prepared by Messrs. Hampton and Sons, appears at page 12, and the other, for which I do not know who is responsible, on page 13 of the memorandum issued by the Minister. There is a considerable discrepancy between the two. Messrs. Hampton and Sons' figures show that we shall stand to lose £9,958 per annum on these buildings, or, in other words, that that will be the actual amount that the Commonwealth would have to pay by way of rental. In the other estimate the net annual cost to the Commonwealth is put at £7,368, or a difference of over £2,000. In all probability, both estimates on thefiguresgiven us by the Government will be exceeded. I think that the cost will be more than £600,000. Honourable members will recognise that these figures are merely an estimate, and they are given on the assumption that the whole of the lettable space is continuously occupied. That, I think, is hardly likely, and in all probability we shall be paying about £12,500 per annum for the premises that we actually occupy. That position, I think, can be improved upon, but even if it is not, what will be the position? We shall be paying for the conduct of our offices in London, and for the great services which that office renders, £3,000 per annum to the High Commissioner, £12,500 for the rent of our premises, and £12,755, according to of management-no t including the present rental of about £1,700 per annummaking a total of £28,255. Taking into consideration the enormous adthat is not an exorbitant sum to pay. I think it possible, however, for the Commonwealth Government to obtain a better return from these premises. Firms doing business with Australia would no doubt like to obtain accommodation there, and even our own business firms which have London offices will realize that they are likely to be materially benefited by concentrating their business agencies in the actual business office for the Commonwealth. big wine cellars there. that would be altogether an advantage; but we need not go into details at this",31,Thomas

I believe they are acting wisely, and I trust that in carrying out this scheme they will exercise due economy. I presume that these offices are to be built out of loan funds. Expense of this kind is properly chargeable to capital account, with, no doubt, a sinking fund providing for repayments over a long period. There is no reason why our current revenue should be immediately burdened with a heavy expenditure of this sort. The expenditure should be extended over a term of years, and as we shall only be paying a small rental, the cost to the Commonwealth will be very small. only warning note I wish to sound is that we ought not to endeavour either tacitly or openly to increase the idea that we want the Agents-General, as such, gathered into this building. I think that the interests of the States and' of the people of Australia require now that the Agents-General as such should be retrenched. The States will require financial agencies in London, but now that we have a High Commissioner I do not think that we need a sort of second-rate ambassador for each of the States of the Commonwealth. general agents because the States have peculiar interests that require peculiar representation; but we do not require a sort of semiambassador on behalf of any State. If we have such men they will undoubtedly tend to detract from the importance that should attach to representations made in London by the Australian High Commissioner. The site selected, I think, is the best that could be got, and the Government should be able to make a deal in getting rid of the surplus office accommodation.

The manufacturing and industrial community must be considerably disappointed by this measure. discount the value of many of these proposals from the departmental stand-point, as they probably assist classification and interpretation, and the removal of minor anomalies. But remembering the harrowing pictures drawn by the Minister of Trade and Customs and other Labour members during .the last electoral campaign, when we were told that Protection was in danger, and that industries were languishing and dying because of the want of sympathy on the part of the then Administration, the present fiscal makeshift seems grotesquebut there it is-the product of eighteen months of Labour rule. I think that some explanation is called for from those now in power. The measure before us, except for three or four items, might have been introduced by a Free Trade Government. The Prime Minister, speaking in March, 1909, said that Australians had, rightly or wrongly, settled-on the policy of Protection for Australia-apparentl y he had not made up his mind as to whether the policy was the right or the wrong one to adopt-and that it was the intention of the people that it should continue. That remark indicates the attitude of the Government, and the half-hearted feeling of the Government so far as Protection is concerned. The Minister of Trade and Customs, who was at one time almost a -prohibitionist, when asked by the honourable member for Wimmerai f this is the complete policy of the Government, said that the schedule he was submitting constituted as much as we should be able to deal with in the two or three days that could be devoted to the consideration of the question before Christmas. more time available? of business is entirely a matter for the Government. Ministers know the relative importance of their proposals, and had they been sincere in the profession of a desire for Tariff revision, they could have allowed the necessary time for it. Had the policy of the last Administration obtained effect, Parliament would now be in a position to deal with the Tariff in the light of the fullest information. That policy was set forth during the electoral campaign in 1910, when we stated our intention to rectify anomalies harmoniously with the protectionist policy of the country. The rectification of anomalies would new Parliament had we been returned topower. Concurrently we intended to proI do not pose the appointment of a Board of Trade, charged with the investigation of Tariff questions, to enable them to be dealt with by Parliament in the light of the fullest knowledge. Had the last Administration been able to give effect to that policy, we should now have all information possible to guide us. The homoeopathic dose of Tariff reform now offered cannot be satisfactory to either Protectionists or Free Traders. Although many of these proposals are simple, they are far-reaching in their effects. It is impossible to deal with any considerable number of items without seriously affecting many others. That has happened in this case. Deputations presenting various requests have waited on the Minister, and honourable members have been deluged with circulars and letters relating to Tariff reform. We are invited to deal with the Tariff in the absence of any information whatever. This is exceedingly unsatisfactory; and in so proceeding, we are doing an injustice to ourselves, and, quite unconsciously, to various industries affected. how can the alterations affect other industries so much ? point. This is possibly one of the simplest forms in which a Tariff could be placed before us-that is to say, the vast majority of the items are more or less formal and harmless in many respects; and yet there are others which seriously affect industries.

155,Sir Robert Best,"The interjecmember shows clearly how utterly incapable this Committee is of dealing with the Tariff without inquiry. The circular proceedsThe balance of imported white pine (the offcuts), is used in various industries, such as making fish, cheese, rabbit, potato, onion, ancl poultry crates, fruit, jam, and malt cases, sultana and raisin trays, &c.; also in the furniture trade, for which a light weight and white timber is demanded (such as for cheap table tops, safes, &c), and practically the only other timber that would be accepted for the bulk of these boxes and crates would be American spruce, Pacific and Japanese pines, so that under the present conditions of the Tariff it will be foreign timbers (not Australian) that will benefit by the lessened imports of New Zealand pines, as no doubt the New Zealand red pine and cheaper lines of kauri, which, besides white pine, have been used for the above articles, will probably come into the Commonwealth in lesser quantities as they will not be able to pay the proposed rise of duty and compete with the cheap foreign pines. Thi., I think, fairly summarizes the position. I admit the difficulty that we have to accept ex -parte statements of this kind, and urge that we ought not to be placed at that serious disadvantage. same position. that the Minister has satisfied himself in some way, though he has given us no information as to the foundation of his recommendations. ber think that it would have been better to leave the Tariff as it was? that the alterations are not sound and good. Tariff should have been left as it was? I think the Minister's recommendations are capable of amendment so as to do justice all round. Motor car chassis under the Tariff of 1908 were subject to a duty of 5 per cent, general Tariff, and free from the United Kingdom. It is now proposed to subject them to duties of 15 and 10 per cent, respectively. According to the information at hand, this proposal is unwarranted and far-reaching in its effects, and will hamper a growing trade and discourage the use of industrial motor vehicles. I am informed that the new duty will average £ 4 0 per commercial car lorry, and give a serious set-back to the movement for the use of motor vehicles for carriage and tran-* sit purposes. The outcome will probably be that cars will be imported completely made up, whereas up to the present the chassis have been imported free or subjected to a duty of only 5 per cent., and the bodies of the cars have been made here. The proposal to encourage the assembling of the cars here will not, I am informed, be of any real value, because the cars are made up in the Old Country and tested before they are sent out here, and to pull them to pieces again in order to send them out here in parts would be an expensive process. It would be much cheaper to pay the higher duty and import the cars complete. WhatI most object to about this item is that it will be a serious blow to the motor body industry of Australia, which is becoming a splendid one. The practice is to import the chassis and make the bodies here. A vast number of men are employed in the industry, and are doing excellent work. It is within my own knowledge that the motor body makers have been so busy throughout Victoria, and I believe it is the same in the other States, that it is most difficult to get them to undertake any extra work at the present time. The manufacturers have made a very strong protest in this connection. It was publicly stated by one of them thatThe effect of putting a duty of 10 per cent. British, and 15. per cent, foreign, on motor-car chassis would be that complete motor-cars would be imported, and therefore the body-building trade of Victoria would be ruined. It was flourishing now, and men earning satisfactory wages would be thrown out of employment. He estimated that 300 men would be affected in Melbourne and its suburbs. The difference in the freight from England between a chassis and a complete car was only £2. Trade and Customs, who are the two archProtectionists of Victoria, cannot agree about this matter, how do you expect us to do so? other honourable members, I have received a number of letters from various workers throughout my constituency interested in these items, pointing out their serious effects and the probable consequent loss of employment in many cases. being made in Auburn. make bodies here because chassis are imported ? chassis is the raw material, so to speak, and if taxed, as proposed, it will be cheaper",35,Tudor

When chassis are brought out here the local manufacturers build bodies for them, and I am informed that the imposition of a duty on chassis will cause the complete cars to be importedWhile this proposal is made by the Minister in the utmost good faith, it will create an anomaly resulting immediately in loss of employment to some 300 workmen. We cannot consider that with equanimity. statements. ments made by manufacturers and workmen alike. made every time a Tariff is introduced. making is that the Committee is utterly incapable of dealing with questions of the kind without the fullest information and evidence. Sir manufacturers want a duty before? They wanted a duty on both the chassis and the body. representations of that kind to me. Another item which is going to cause a serious anomaly is that of flannelette. At present flannelette is dutiable at 5 per cent., general Tariff, and free from the United Kingdom. is called inflammable flannelette dutiable at 25 and 20 per cent, respectively, while admitting non-inflammable flannelette at the old rates; the non-inflammable to be dealt with by certain departmental tests.. I believe it is possible by a chemical process to make flannelette temporarily noninflamma'ble. quiry, however, w ill demonstrate that when flannelette so treated has been washed three or four times it becomes just as inflammable as before. It is also urged that the chemical process makes it more or less injurious to health. The important point is that we are seeking to do by means of the Tariff something which is outside the province of the Tariff altogether. The object sought to be achieved by the Minister is a matter rather for merchandise or health legislation. The question of the proposal is ridiculous. inflammable nature of flannelette has been the subject of inquiry by an Imfriend, who is in a position to judge a matperial Commission. sidered by the Tariff Commission, of posal is ridiculous. If the Government dewhich the honourable member for Bendigo sire to take action in this direction, let them was chairman. They decided that on the evidence brought before them they were not justified in making any recommendation on the subject. In view of the facts I have stated, it is a delusion and a snare to attempt to discriminate between inflammable and non-inflammable flannelette in the way now proposed. The proposal does not attempt to protect any industry. It is simply intended by a process of penalization to discourage the importation of flannelette, which after all is no more inflammable than calico. The Government might as well say they will penalize the introduction of calico. In Australia there are now large Similar statements are establishments where flannelette is made up into garments. These will be seriously interfered with by the proposed duty, which will probably lead to the introduction of an inferior and much more injurious class of material than that at present in use. Flannelette is used mainly by the workers, who therefore ought to pause before adopting this proposal to discriminate. I am told that it is completely unworkable, and if attempted to be put into force will result in vexatious delays, and be, at the best, most unsatisfactory. There is another item which shows the far-reaching effect of even these simple proposals. It is intended to impose a duty of 25 per cent, on oil or water It is now proposed to make what colour paintings other than those by Australian students or those presented to public art galleries or similar institutions. It is a retrograde step to attempt the taxation of art or literature by Tariff means. I would suggest to the Minister that it might be desirable to charge perhaps a fixed duty on pictures of the value of, say, £ 2 5 or less, but it would be a serious mistake to attempt to fax pictures of greater value and Indiscourage their importation into Australia, thereby discouraging their educational effect. Our anxiety should always be for the greater education of the people. tralians patronize Australian artists here?

It costs about is. od. per hide to prepare hides in the manner referred to.

If it were possible to induce the State Governments to effectively regulate the branding and flaying of hides this item would be fully justified, and 1 should be one of the first to support it. I have here a statement from a local firm of tanners thatThe fact of these hides being duty free has also enabled us to supply 'very large quantities of the finished article in competition with the outside world to the various States, and also New Zealand. The imposition of a duty as proposed by the Ministry means the annihilation of our industry, for it will be impossible for ns to cany on, as the average Australian hides offering at the present time will not suit our purpose, having far too many blemishes, owing to being badly and excessively branded, carelessly and until legislation is brought into existence compelling greater care in connection with this cannot be hoped for. Therefore, to impose this duty can hardly be considered in the interests of the public as it will confer an advantage on no one, but will force out of existence a growing industry and compel the users -of high-class leather to import their requirements. I have also the further statement thatThe labour expended on these hides after we receive them from New Zealand costs considerably over 15s. per hide in wages paid, which are based upon rates much higher than those de-' termined upon by the Wages Boards in connection with the tanners and curriers industry,and the proposed duty means sacrificing the whole of this besides preventing the public from obtaining the high-grade"" leather we are enabled to manufacture by virtue of being able to secure a special selection of skins for practically no gain to the worker seeing that, as previously stated, the amount of wages paid for the preparing of the hides in the manneT referred to in the proposed Tariff does not exceed is. gd. per hide.

No attempt is made to protect the making of oil engines. The present protection to the hat and cap making industry is ineffective, because of the keenness of foreign competition. In Italy the hours worked are from 60 to 70 per week, and the wages paid from15s. to 25s. The value of the importations of hats of f u r and wool increased from £ 1 1 8 , 4 7 4 in 1908, to £ 1 4 1 , 6 7 0 in 19.10, and of minor articles for hats and caps from £ 1 3 4 , 3 7 8 in 1906, 1 0 £ 3 3 J 7 9 2 in 2 1910.

The facts prove the need for a board of trade, or an advisory board, to collect information. In Germany there is an Imperial Consultative Board, and during the preparation of the last Tariff no fewer than 2,000 experts were consulted. In the United States of The America, in September, 1909, an Advisory Board was appointed to deal with Tariff matters. Its duty is to watch the operation of every item in the Tariff, to ascertain the chief sources of supply at home and abroad, and the uses to which the Tariff items are applied, and to collect all requisite statistics, so that Congress may be furnished with the most exhaustive information. The establishment of a board' of trade to deal with Tariff matters is a leading plank of the policy of the new Canadian Government. Australia is ripe for tlie creation of such a board.

208,Sir Robert Best,"The HomeTariff, may be furnished with full particulars regarding the position of every industry. Finality in Tariff matters cannot be expected. A Tariff must be kept up to date, and in conformity with the requirements of the country. That can only be done as the result of a precise and continuous investigation of all the factors of production, including cheapness of transit, and other operating causes. The Act defining the duties of the American Bureau of Manufactures saysIt shall be the province and duty of the said Bureau, under the direction of the Secretary, to foster, promote, and develop the various manufacturing industries of the United States nnd markets for fhe same at home and abroad, domestic and foreign, by gathering, compiling, publishing, and supplying all available and useful information concerning such industries and such markets, and by such other methods and means as may be prescribed by the Secretary or provided by law. And all consular officers of the United States, including Consuls-General, Consuls, and commercial agents, are hereby required, and it is made a part of their duty, under the direction of the Secretary of State, to gather and compile, from time to time, usef u l and material information and statistics in respect to the subjects enumerated in section three of this Act in the countries and the places to which such consular officers are accredited, and to send, under the direction of the Secretary of State, reports as often as required by the Secretary of Commerce and Labour of the information and statistics thus gathered and compiled. We require a body capable of undertaking a grave and important work of this kind. The last matter to which I desire to refer is one dealt with in an interview reported in the Sydney Morning Herald of the 8th December last with Mr Arthur Kidman, who has had a large hand in building up the frozen meat and butter trade between Australia, Canada, and the United States, on the question of reciprocal trade with the Dominion. Mr Kidman, in this interview, put forward a special plea for preference on the ground of the loss Australia is sustaining in the meantime. The report of 'the interview commences by saying thatTrade is gradually slipping away from the Commonwealth and going to New Zealand instead, owing to the fact that the latter now has first call on the refrigerated space in the mail steamers, and enjoys a Tariff advantage over Australia of a £d. per pound on both meat and butter under a reciprocal arrangement. That is a very serious handicap so far as Australia is concernedIt is undoubtedly a fact that Australia is most advantageously placed for the purpose of acting as food suppliers to the west coast of Canada and America, also interior points, and providing a. substantial reduction of their duty took place, our exports of food products-frozen meat, butter, canned. meats, onions, potatoes, fresh fruits, & c , but particularly the three former-woul d decidedly show a rapid increase. Let me point out in very few words the position of affairs. The total value of Australian exports to Canada in 1910 was £100,398. j imay say that the proposal is that there shall be extended to Canada the same preference that is now extended to the United Kingdom; and if that were done, of this £100,398 worth of exports, £63,000 worth would be subject to preference. The butter exported to Canada last year was 570,416 lbs., valued at £26,967. This butter is liable under the present arrangement to a duty of 2d. per lb., whereas, with a preference, the duty would have been i£d., thus showing a loss to Australia of £1,188. The exports of mutton and lamb were 2,331,652 lbs., valued at £23,745. The present duty is i j d . per lb., and the preferential duty would have been i d . , showing a loss to Australia of £4,857. The tinned meats exported were valued at £5,746. The duty on these meats at present is 27 per 1 cent., and the preferential duty would have been 17 per cent., showing a loss to 1 Australia of £574. The onions exported were valued at £2,757. The duty is 30 per cent., and the preferential duty would have been 15 per cent., showing a loss of £413. The total loss to Australia in excess duty paid on produce in Canada amounts to £;7,74o. I now desire to show how easily at the present time a reciprocal arrangement could be made with Canada. The total value of the imports from Canada in 1910 was £802,045. Of this the portion which would have been subject to Australian preference amounted to £119,612, and the portion not so subject to £682,433. This shows a loss to Canadian exporters, in excess duties paid, of £6,562. Honourable members will see that the total loss to Australia was £7,440, and the total loss to Canada £6,562 ; and, with figures so close, an adjustment might easily be made. The steamers subsidies paid by Canada are: to the Vancouver steamers £37,091, and to the Montreal and St. John's steamers £24,660, or a total of £61,751, equivalent to about 7$ per cent, on the total exports. Before leaving office, I prepared a Bill, having for its object the extension of the British preference to Canada, and it is available to the Minister. As the Minister is aware, the Canadian Government are prepared to make a reciprocal arrangement by which they will give us the benefit af their minimum Tariff, provided . we give them the benefit of the British preference; think that, even this session, there is time to bring about which would result in a large expansion of our primary industries. I urge on the Government two things most stronglyone is to bring in that Bill, and the other to seriously consider the advisability of establishing an advisory board, so that we may have the benefit of its conclusions when next we are called upon to effectively deal with Tariff revision. Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume) [3.52] The honourable member for Kooyong has made a very long speech, on which, however, I cannot compliment him. Although he is a Protectionist he has endeavoured' to blame the Government for doing what they can in the way of Tariff revision at this present stage of business in the House. But who was it prevented anything being done when I introduced the subject of Tariff revision some time ago? Was it not the members of the party with which the honourable member for Kooyong is now associated? And, regarding the Tariff, the opposition then came from ten Victorian representatives, who said they were Protectionists, but who voted Free Trade whenever they had the opportunity. Had that not been so, we should at the present time have had a much better Tariff. We have now arrived at a time when long speeches are unnecessary, and we should strictly confine ourselves to the essence of what we desire to say or what we wish to see done. I should like to know from the Chairman, or from the Minister, whether a private member will be at liberty to move any amendment in the way of an addition to these duties? to sav. rule any such amendment out of order. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -Then honourable members are placed in a rather awkward position. was the present Speaker or the late Speaker, Sir Frederick Holder, who ruled that such an amendment would be in order. Holder. Sir WILLIA M LYNE I do not know the opinion of the present Speaker, but it is rather anomalous to ask us to discuss this Tariff ought to be dealt with. Honourable matter if we are not to be allowed to move amendments. I should now like to know from the Minister whether if what he considers a righteous amendment is suggested and I he will accept it. a reciprocity what the amendment is before I can give an answer. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -Will there be a hard-and-fast rule that no amendment shall be accepted ? I do not suggest that many amendments should be suggested or moved, but there are certainly some which could be adopted with advantage. The honourable member for Kooyong blamed the Government for not bringing down these proposalssooner. But what did honourable membersopposite do when I introduced similar proposals two and a half years ago? The Government at that time would not do anything in the way of Tariff revision, and 1 submitted about 184 items. We could not expect anything else from a Government made up of half Protectionists and half Free Traders-w e could never expect a Tariff worthy of the name from such a medley. ment supporters are Free Traders! so; they have not said so. There may beFree Traders, but, under the peculiar circumstances, they are not prepared to carry out their Free Trade ideas. the honourable member through with hisTariff all right.

Those who should have helped me did not do so; and if they had been treated on their merits at the last election, they would have been rejected, because they belied the principles on which they were sent here. tionists helped the honourable member.

I am glad that the Minister has made this revision proposal, for, small though it may be, it is something.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE I do not think it would be a good thing. It would be altogether wrong. Very little notice was taken of the large amount of work done by the Tariff Commission, of which the honourable member fOr Bendigo was chairman. If we had a board with nothing to induce them to carry out either a Protectionist or Free Trade policy, and with no responsibility, we should have no results. We must have a party bias if we are to have Protection or Free Trade, and it must be carried out on party lines. I do not believe in this wishy-washy proposal -to have a board to bury tariffism so that it will not be heard of again. a live man in the Customs Department to deal with the question. 'have heard the Leader of the Opposition suggest the appointment of a Tariff board, but I never was, and never will be, in favour of it. The proposal is ridiculous. I see the Age to-day advocates the appointment of a board. want to drop its Protectionist views? Mr W. -will become a convert to Free Trade yet. Sir WILLIAM LYNE when it advocates the appointment of a board. I do not like to see it . There are a number of items which ought to appear in this amendment of the Tariff, but I shall refer only to one or two of them. I see no proposal to impose a duty on iron and steel. I am sorry, because there certainly should be a duty on them, but I suppose On both sides? we must wait until next year for it. It is the only way to get over the difficulties which the industry has to face at present. It is an industry which every Australian, whether Free Trader or Protectionist, ought W h a t will the poor to assist before any other, but we cannot do it unless a proper duty is imposed. I have tried three or four times to have I do not know a duty placed on iron and steel, but have failed. That is the only reason why I had to f a l l back upon the proposal for a bounty brought forward. I never believed in a bounty in comparison with a straight out duty. The honourable member for Kooyong referred to flannelette. Apparently he does not know that the late Mr Kingston, when Minister of Trade and Customs, imposed a duty on flannelette. He was stronger on that question than any We should never have, had a man I ever heard, because he thought it was dangerous to use so much flannelette, people imagining when they bought this cheap stuff that it was-flannel, and a great many young people having been injured in consequence. ought to be prohibited? Sir WILLIAM LYNE I think the honourable member is quite right. It ought practically to. be prohibited. I venture to think that a woollen of thin, light texture would be made to fill the gap if a heavy duty were placed on flannelette. to a practical test? What they say about making it non-inflammable is all bunkum. ment have prescribed a test, and flannelette which complies with those conditions may, What is wanted is to a certain extent,be reliable, although it is not wholly so.

The millers used to husk in bond, and send the rice out without paying the duty, and receive a good sum of money for it. stands, that is to be knocked on the head, because the duty causes more to be paid than can be obtained outside. able member for Kooyong referred to die chassis of motor cars. When I brought down the Tariff of 1907-8, I included the chassis as well as the body, and every one who had anything to do with the manufacture of chassis or motor cars was delighted. They were very angry with me when I agreed to take the duty off chassis; but I did so because I was informed that they could not be made here. I hear that they are now being made in one or two places in Australia, and certainly manufacturers are getting very close to it when they make the fine engines which are now turned out for motor boats. If the chassis cannot be made here, I say, "" Do not impose a duty "" .; but if there is any prospect of making them, and making, them well, most decidedly the duty ought to be imposed. The bodies now made here are better than the imported ones. They are made to suit the country and the climate by people who know what is required. The same thing applies to buggies and other vehicles. I am glad to learn from the honourable member for Dalley that chassis are now being made in New South Wales. We can make .everything of this kind, if we can make it at all, more suitable for the country than can people elsewhere who do not know anything about Australian conditions. That is the secret of the success of the American vehicles and machinery, because there is some similarity between their conditions and ours. Chassis made in France, Germany, England, or elsewhere, cannot be as well adapted to our conditions as those that will be made in Australia. If the Minister has satisfied himself that they can be made here, I hope he will retain the duty on them'. A board to deal with the Tariff will never give satisfaction. The only body that could get valuable information would be the Inter-State commission; but the man above all others who can obtain that information, because he has an army of assistants to help him, is the Minister of Trade and Customs. have any of the information he gets.

If , however, the task is left, to an outside board or commission, who. is going to justify it in the House? It will be a case of "" What is everybody's business is nobody's business,"" and we shall' never get a Tariff worth twopence.

Sir WILLIA M LYNE -It is abouttime we had some one of that calibre. The honourable member for Kooyong referred toreciprocal trade with Canada. I was deputed by the then Ministry to try to arrange a reciprocal Tariff with that country, and, with that object in view, met SirW i lfrid Laurier in London. iHe gave me a list of what he desired that we should admit free.

The whole kernel of their request was that we should allow their machinery to be admitted free to compete with our own people. It was impossible to get any reciprocal trade' arrangement under those conditions., and that is what is wrong now. The Government may try as much as they like, but the only reciprocal Tariff they could get with Canada would do a great injury to our manufacturers. I should like to see a reciprocal arrangement with Canada, if possible, but we must not surrender the interests of our own people to Canada, or any other country. I told SirW i l f r i d Laurier that if the Massey-Harris or tbe International Harvester people liked to come to Australia to manufacture, they would be very welcome; but they would have to do the work here under our own Tariff, and not in Canada under the Canadian Tariff, sending it here to compete with our own people. We also tried to arrange a reciprocal Tariff with New Zealand. We should have had a really good one in that case if that great man, Mr Seddon, had lived. I have in my possession at present documents which he signed agreeing to a reciprocal Tariff with Australia. He carried so much weight, that he would have put it through; but his successor, Sir Joseph Ward, would not have it . If the Ministry desire to arrange a reciprocal Tariff with New ZealandI think that they will have but little difficulty in securthe honourable member would do that if he ing one that wiil give satisfaction. I do not think, however, that it is possible to secure reciprocity with Canadaf o r some time to come. The Canadians produce little that we really require, and we cannot afford to allow them to compete with our local manufacturers. When I was in EnglandI had an opportunity of listening to leading members of both the Commons and the Lords, and I found that, save on some subject of special interest, such, for instance, as the Budget, none of them spoke very long.

I should not like to set an example in the way of long speeches to the honourable member for Lang and some other honourable members of the Opposition. does not think it wise for him to speak very long on this question ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE I do not. The Ministry are to be commended for bringing down even this amendment of the Tariff, because they are doing what the late Government did not, and would not do. chance. vernment had the chance, but would not, and dared not, avail itself of it . Would the honourable member for Parramatta have been a party to the introduction of a Tariff? Tariff. Sir WILLIAM LYNE And we want no other. I trust that next session the whole Tariff question will be brought under review. As the honourable member who preceded me remarked, a Tariff can never be wholly settled; it must be constantly under review in some form or other. way to settle it is to wipe it out altogether. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I know that had his way. He would bring us to the level of the blackfellow, so that we should pay wages equal to those received by the Fijians or other South Sea Islanders. If Australia is to be progressive-if her people are to learn to manufacture all that we require-w e must have Protection. We have the raw material to meet all our requirements, and. every inducement should be offered to the people to make up that raw material. Free Traders say that Protection means increased cost. I join issue with them, and contend that a Protective duty will only increase the price of the article to which it relates.until the local manufacturers get into f u l l swing. That stage having been reached, internal competition soon leads to a reduction in prices. MrW ELLIOT JOHNSON -But local manufacturers are always asking for more Protection.

240,,"I do, by pointSir WILLIAM LYNE -We can; butmanufacturing practically everything we require. We have also to overcome local prejudice. So strong was the prejudice against locally produced soap and boots that manufacturers here had to brand them as imported articles at one time, but I hope soon to see that prejudice overcome, and to see Australia manufacturing all that she requires for herself. During the last three years our imports have increased by leaps and bounds. that increase may be due to the dearth of labour. Many people have told me that they cannot obtain the labour they require. For instance, the owner of a woollen factory told me yesterday that he could manufacture on a much larger scale if he could obtain more hands. I refer to Mr Vicars. Mr J. H . CATTS -What is the use of putting on a Tariffi f the local manufacturer cannot supply orders? that the Government desired him to supply material for certain naval clothing, and that he could not meet the full requirements of the Department, because he was unable to obtain the necessary hands. Mr J. H . CATTS Mr Sparks, of the Parramatta Mills, makes the same statement. Sparks says on this question is generally fairly correct. The present Leader of the Opposition joined with me, when the Tariff was under consideration, in making a promise that we should see that it was completed by providing for new Protection. I tried to be true to my promise; I wonder whether he thinks he has been true to his ? That promise, at all events, ought to be fulfilled. If the manufacturers are to be advantaged by Protection, the workers should receive a proportionate share of the benefit so conferred. The bulk of the Labour party gave me their assistance in passing the Tariff, and they gave it to me ,on the strength of the promise to which I have just referred. They desired that the workers should receive a share of the benefits' that were being conferred on their employers. consumers to be protected. member is quite correct; the consumers were also to be protected. No time should be lost in providing for new Protection. If we .have not the power to pass the necessary legislation,' we should take steps to obtain it, and not.deal with the referendum as the last was treated. Mi. J. H . CATTS -Unfortunately , a number of manufacturers fought us on the rc f6 rem d ci Sir WILLIA M LYNE -No doubt. Any man whose pocket is affected by a proposal will resist it. Mr J. H . CATTS -That means that manufacturers do not want to give good wages. A proportion of A Sydney manufacturer, in a large way of business, recently told me that he should be glad if wages were fixed all round. He said that he had to pay the standard rates, but he found that others in competition with him were not doing so. He would be glad to see every one compelled to pay good wages, so that all concerned would be placed on an equal footing. My feeling is that next session we shall have a revision of the whole Tariff. That is what I have been promised. Let us have it, and let us go to the country with an undivided front. If the Ministry have the good sense with which I credit them, they will not allow next session to close without dealing with the Tariff. Let us see who are the straight out Free Traders and who are the Protectionists in this House. We do not want a board, for it would only be a means of sink everything that was submitted to it. Indeed, I feel we shall soon be governed altogether by boards. Boards are being appointed here and there, and I certainly do not like, the system. Men must stand up and fight for their principles, but many are prepared to sneak out of their responsibilities if they can do so by appointing a board. The question of Protection vitally affects the interests of Australia, and we should never rest until we have in operation a complete system of Protection, coupled witli the policy of new Protection. I would ask the honourable member for B.endigo, who was Chairman of the Tariff Commission, and who, in that capacity, worked very hard, whether the recommendations of his Commission received all the consideration they .ought to have had, and which they would have received had it not been that honourable members stepped in. The position would he the same if a board of trade were appointed. The recommendations of a board or committee must stand the test of debate in this House, and, whilst ih many cases I was able to assist the honourable member for' Bendigo as chairman of the Tariff Commission, the Committee would not listen to many of the proposals which that",45,Elliot Johnson Th E Age Mothers Buy These Materials For Their Little

I intend to be true to my promise not tp speak long at this stage, but I hope later on, when we come to deal with certain items, to go further into detail. I regret that the honourable member for Hume has seen fit to make remarks that appear to reflect on a number of members of the Opposition. I would remind him of the obvious fact that the Opposition has not a monopoly of the Free Traders in this House. There are quite a large number of Free Traders among the Labour party, and I think, therefore, that the honourable member ought to recognise that if a reasonable case for a revision of the Tariff is made out, there are on both sides of the House plenty of honourable members able and willing to support such a revision, or to deal witii special items, if a case is made out for their review. I do not know that there is any distinct group of members who, as suggested by the honourable member for Hume, wish to rip up the whole Tariff, after such a complete revision and classification as that to which it was subjected while the honourable member for Hume was in oflice. It is obvious, however, that in a great industrial country like Australia, where we have fluctuating changes, a Tariff must be dealt with according to the demands and requirements of the time, as well as in accordance with the weight of evidence and in the interests of the public. The honourable member seemed to be of _the opinion that the Minister of Trade and Customs should be the principal authority to deal with proposals for Tariff changes or modifications. The Minister of Trade and Customs has the responsibility of launching Tariff proposals, but to require him to enter into minute and complicated inquiries in regard to Tariff matters would be to impose an almost superhuman task. He is entitled to the best assistance of competent experts. I must express my appreciation of the difficulties which must have been encountered, even in the preparation of the small instalment of Tariff reform now under consideration. The Minister could not be expected to find time for the semi-judicial work required to determine the technical alterations needed in a Tariff, and the amendments necessary to secure the direct and indirect results which must be kept in view, and can be attained only by the constant modification of our industrial and commercial systems. The Minister, sitting in his office and surrounded by officials, has not the opportunity for investigating the causes which determine industrial development. Parliament, in considering Tariff proposals, must have regard, not merely to individual interests, but also to great economic causes and influences. I regret that the Minister has not been able to submit comprehensive proposals. Notwithstanding the shortness of the time that has elapsed since the last revision of the Tariff, there have been great changes in our commercial system, demanding, in many cases, fresh inquiry, and the reconsideration of duties. I do not refer to small changes, but to serious evolutionary movements. They are reflected in the statistics relating to oui importations. The honourable member for Kooyong dealt with: the increase of importations for the year 1909-10 as compared with previous years. I have a return showing the value of importations into the Commonwealth from oversea countries for the nine months ended 30th September, in a series of years, the figures being in accordance with the unrevised returns of the Central Customs Department. Leaving out of consideration the value of gold, silver, and bronze specie imported, the importations, of all merchandise for the nine months ended 30th September, 1908, were valued a t £ ^ , 2 o j , i 2 2; for the same period of I 9°9> at £35>955>39 ) for the same period 2 of 1910, at £42,510,000; and for the same period of 1911, at £48,133,665. The figures for 1911, as compared with those for 1910, show an increase of £5,500,000. These figures are so startling, and the increases are so regular, that they demand consideration. Further evidence of the increases is supplied by the Customs revenue for 1909-10, which was £9,500,000; while that for 1910-11 was £10,500,000, and that for 1911-12 is estimated at £11,154,000. It has been said that these increases are due, for the most part, to the great prosperity of the country, and the larger purchasing power of the people I have made an examination of the imports, and I find that the importations for the first nine months of this year of articles of luxury were valued, in the case of beer 1 and ale, at £50,000; champagne, at £50,000; spirits, such as brandy, whisky, and gin, at £210,140-ther e was a falling off in the importation of rum; confectionery, at £110,559 i unmanufactured tobacco, at £109,000; and manufactured tobacco, at £15,000. The increase in connection with tobacco was about 30 per cent, in each case. This makes a total increasein imports of luxuries equal to about.",46,Elliot Johnson Th E Age Mothers Buy These Materials For Their Little

In metals and machinery, the increase in the value of importations was £533,000, 01 26 per cent. The increase in the importation of manufactures of metals, free, was £160,000, or 10 per cent., and of dutiable metals, £337,000, or 30 per cent. The increase in the importation of tools of trade, some of which are free, amounted to £130,000; earthenware, china, pottery, tiles, and so forth, £185,560; timber, £779:537 ; boots and shoes, £10,000; cords and twine, £97,284. ber be able to show the dividends paid during the nine months by the companies manufacturing these goods? trying to classify these goods into luxuries and necessities, and showing that the increased importation is not all owing to the increased purchasing power of the people, which is, no doubt, expended upon articles of luxury ber will be able to complete the analogy, and prove that these imports are stifling local industries. member will permit me. I shall proceed to make my statement of the case. I am trying to point out the deep undercurrent of forces, in order to justify my argument that the Minister ought to have submitted a more comprehensive statement, and not merely have asked for a few small, isolated alterations here and there, yielding, possibly, to the greatest clamour; to the neglect, it may be, of industries not so clamorous, but equally entitled tp fair consideration. There has been a general increase in importation not only in the big items I have mentioned, but in ale and beer, animals, apparel and soft goods, boots and shoes, brushware, cement, clocks and watches, cocoa and chocolate, confectionery, cordage, and twines, drugs and chemicals, earthenware and china, fish of all kinds, furniture, hats and caps, agricultural implements, iron and steel bars, girders, galvanized-iron plate and sheet, jams . and The increases in connection and lampware, tobacco, and so forth. This list shows that the increase in imports is not owing merely to the general increase in the prosperity of the country, but must be owing to some other additional, supplementary cause; and it was the duty of the During the nine months Minister to submit to the House a more comprehensive and more reliable statement to justify even the limited revision to which he has invited our attention. Speaking generally, I find that, although his proposals number about 124 or 125, only about 30 involve what may be called substantial economic changes; that is, duties imposed for the purpose of excluding imports, or in favour of protected industries, and duties taken off for a, similar purpose. But even with regard to these, I think that a more business-like statement ought to have been submitted, showing for what general reasons or particular reasons those increases are necessary in favour or for the benefit of protected industries. I am aware that, in addition to the admitted increased prosperity and increased purchasing power of the country, another cause has been suggested to account for the fact that Australian manufacturers have not been in a position to cope with the demands which have resulted in increased imports. It has been said that many of the Australian manufacturers have not been able tb keep their factories going full-handed, for the I hope the honourable memsimple reason that they have found it impossible to obtain the necessary skilled labour. I observe that when a recent deputation waited on the Minister, he said that the increase in the imports was due to the want of labour. manufacturers had said. that the manufacturers had attributed the increase of imports to the scarcity of labour, and had emphasized the higher cost of production everywhere. That is a very important phase, which I think ought to be taken into consideration in connection with any proposed revision of the Tariff, whether that revision be great, or of a less ambitious character. If it be true, as the Minister was informed, that the increase in imports is due to the scarcity of labour, then Parliament and the country ought to know the fact. We ought to be placed in possession of reliable information in reference to this suggestion. jellies, jewellery, lamps made the statement.",47,Elliot Johnson Th E Age Mothers Buy These Materials For Their Little

I have no doubt that, whoever made the statement, made it for solid reasons; and if that be so, Parliament ought to be placed in a position, if possible, posing a duty on one item it may be found to rectify the grievance. Personally, I believe there is a great deal in the statement. I have seen assertions of a similar character made in the public press, namely, that a number of our mills, at present in the enjoyment of protective duties, are not able to secure the necessary hands. When I was on my way to England in the Orvieto, I met a woollen manufacturer, who was going Home to endeavour to secure the services of a number of expert employees whom he could not secure in Australia under the present working conditions. member for Hume, in his concluding remarks, very properly made reference to a similar complaint he had heard. It , therefore, appears that scarcity of labour may be the reason why Australian manufacturers are not able tp cope with the demands of the public, and why there is a tendency to increased imports. Under such circumstances, the Commonwealth Government ought to facilitate inquiries, and facilitate action in order to encourage the introduction of skilled labour, which may be utilized in our present factories, and in the establishment of other industries. A third cause for the increased importations is suggested in the complaint of manufacturers that, even when they are able to obtain the very best labour required, they are not able to compete with imports for a variety of reasons, amongst which is the fact that importers have been able to get finished articles turned but at low sweating rates of wages in England and on the Continent. There is also the important fact that within the last few years, since the revision of the Tariff, there has been, in all the States of Australia, an upward tendency in wages in nearly all the protected industries. This tendency, together with improved conditions in the shape of reduced hours, must have told most materially on the output and prospects of a number of our industries. Under the circumstances, the Minister of Trade and Customs, before he submitted even this limited scheme, ought to have taken steps to investigate these various suggested explanations for the increased imports during the last three years. It is -tterly impossible for the Minister to have launched any such complete investigation as I have indicated. I have had experience In any case, we are enof one Tariff Commission, and I know the recondite and complicated character of such an inquiry. I know how troublesome such an investigation is-ho w many are the conflicting issues and interests involved, even in an apparently simple proposal. In prothat we are touching the raw material of some industry-that the finished article of one industry is the raw material of another. It is necessary to trace line after line, and item after item in order to ascertain the true correlation; and no Minister would be justified in responding to an appeal through the post, or through a deputation, on the part of one manufacturer, or even a group of manufacturers, for increased duties, without making inquiry into the possibility of imposing burdens and difficulties on The honourable other manufacturers. No Minister of Customs, with the burden of parliamentary and Ministerial responsibility on him, can be expected to enter into an investigation of the far-reaching ramifications of Tariff proposals of the kind to which I refer. This, I think, constitutes the strongest argument in favour of having a periodical Tariff commission to deal with these questions as they become acute, or, in default of such a commission, a standing board. I do not know that the work would be sufficient to absorb the whole time of any such body; but the duty of investigating industrial questions, identified with, and forming part of, commercial questions, might be vested in a Government board responsible to Parliament and to the country. Such a board might be expected to deal with these questions from the stand-point of national policy, giving voice not merely to their own individual views, but to the tendencies of a nationally recognised policy in the direction of protection of native industries, coupled with a fair remuneration to the workers for the labour which they contribute towards their success. The tendency in all countries which have Tariffs such as we have, so complicated, far-reaching, and powerful in their inRuences upon trade and commerce, has been in the direction of the adoption of such a Tariff board. It might be that the work of a Tariff board should be added to the work of the Inter-State Commission, a tribunal which is recognised in our Constitution as one which will have to be created in course of time. The time has arrived when it is the duty of any Government in office to consider the advisability",48,Elliot Johnson Th E Age Mothers Buy These Materials For Their Little
257,Sir John Quick,"The Ministerof launching upon its career of usefulness the Inter-State Commission, which might deal not only with the special duties imposed on it by the Constitution, but also -these supplementary duties in the way of Tariff and industrial questions, which are so intimately blended that they can hardly be separated. I do not propose in these observations, which may be regarded as preliminary to the consideration of details, to enter into a minute analysis of the whole of the proposals before us. fairly be reserved for detailed consideration later on, but it is only wise and judicious to remind honourable members of their general effects. I have been asked by honourable members what the general tendency of the proposals is, and have made an analysis of some of them. I shall not go into details, but merely give the headings to show the principal items upon which increased duties are proposed. First on the list stands preserved fruits and vegetables, in respect to which the duties are to be increased to the same rates as those on pickles and sauces. small item "" Woven coat hangers and labels,"" the duty on which is to be increased from 30 and 25 per cent, to 40 ancl 35 per cent, respectively. That certainly seems a small and insignificant item for a Tariff alteration, and I do not know on whose request or. suggestion the proposal has been made, but it may prove a tax upon raw material, and even upon some of the complete finished articles. of inquiry. item, but I see no very serious change in that group, except a minor one relating to braids. It will be noticed that all the demands made by deputations and circulars for a special duty on mantles and women's clothing, which are said to be dumped into the Commonwealth at the end of London seasons, have not been complied with by the Minister. ably he found the problem almost insoluble. If he turns to the report of the Tariff Commission, of which I had the honour to be a member, he will see that some attempt at a solution was made in the shape of a differential duty, as we recommended a higher rate of duty on garments consisting of wool than upon garments not containing wool. With reference to the item of braids, they, as well as trimmings, constitute a raw material in a large number of garments which are made up ih Australia, and representations have already been made 'to me on behalf of the makers of AusSir John Quick -materials merely add to the ornamentation tralian garments, competing with imported mantles and clothing, that whilst they have had no increase of duty to enable them to compete with the heavy importations of London stocks, they are, on the contrary, being burdened by braids being taken from the free list and made dutiable at, I think, 25 per cent. I would suggest to the Minister that, even'with his knowledge and opportunties, he might well have argued to himself in this way : "" I find it difficult to That mav make up my mind to recommend an increased duty on the made-up garments; but, at any rate, I shall try to reduce the duties on the raw material in favour of the local manufacturers."" The Minister has not granted the manufacturers an increased Protection on the finished article, but, on the contrary, has imposed a duty on braids, which, I am told, are an essential part of many, ladies' garments. It is said that they will be classed as trimmings, and made dutiable.' Then, we find the in width. review any previous opinion I formed about trimmings and braids. When on the Tariff Commission, I was led to believe that many of them ought to bear duty, because they were ornamental, but I have since been disposed to come to the conclusion that some garments worn by ladies cannot be properly turned out without having some decorative This illustrates the advisability or ornamental material to make them attracApparel and attire is a big tive and saleable. Consequently, if a braid or trimming be necessary to make a garment wearable and give it popularity, that braid or trimming ought to be regarded as a raw material, and ought not to be taxed. Even in the simplest form of garments some form of ornamentation or beautification is necessary, particularly when they .are to be worn by ladies. If the Minister Prob.cannot grant increased duties on apparel and attire, he ought not to burden the manufacturers, who are fighting hard against these imports, by requiring them to pay a heavy duty on braids and trimmings. It cannot be said that either braids or trimmings can be made in Australia, or that anybody has attempted to do so. On the contrary, these duties can only be put on for revenue purposes. In view of the expansion of the Tariff and its extraordinary revenue-producing powers, we should be prepared to strike off the duties upon raw materials that are used in connection with articles of utility, even when those",49,Elliot Johnson Th E Age Mothers Buy These Materials For Their Little
258,Mr Tudor,Only those over an inch,50,Elliot Johnson Th E Age Mothers Buy These Materials For Their Little
259,Sir John Quick,"I feel disposed toor beautification of the garments. Natural birds and wings can hardly be said to come within my definition of mere ornamentation for the purpose of adding to attractiveness, because, probably, they would go beyond the meaning and usefulness of braid and trimming. There may, therefore, be some justification for the proposed increase of duty in their case. prefer to test it upon other grounds. If it is sentimental, the importation of the article can be prohibited altogether. may be said"" that these more flashy ornamentations in the shape of birds and wings may well be made to pay a high duty, if people insist on wearing them. I wish to draw particular attention to the item of flannelette. popular to suggest that flannelette should be either penalized by a high duty, or altogether excluded. The question was investigated by the Tariff Commission, and, therefore, is not new to me, or, I apprehend, to the bulk of honourable members. It was a vexed question for a long time, but, eventually, the whole Commission was united in a recommendation regarding it. found that, although flannelette was liable to take fire in certain cases, when brought into proximity to a live flame, the same argument might apply to a number of other inflammable articles. nelette is the raw material of a large number of industries. Since this duty was imposed, my attention has been drawn to the fact that flannelette is used by a number of manufacturers in Melbourne, who employ hundreds and thousands of women and children to turn out women and children's garments. They say that flannelette is the piece goods out of which the garments are made. The Tariff Commission were told die same all over Australia, and this is the recommendation signed by all of its members, Protectionists and Free Traders alikeThe chief reasons which induced your Commissioners to recommend the reduction of the duty on flannelette from 15 per cent, to 5 per -ent. were :(1) The great irritation to importers caused by the opening up of cases containing Sannelette and other cotton goods. (2) The suitability of flannelette as a material for wearing apparel, especially in the tropical portions of the Commonwealth. (3) The fact that no special import duty is placed on kerosene, methylated spirits, celluloid, or firearms, because of the danger attached to the careless use of such commodities. That recommendation was signed by all the members of the Commission. I do not think that the arguments so summarized have been dealt with by the Minister; and they are certainly not met by the proposal to distinguish between' non-inflammable and inflammable flannelette. From what I have heard, it will be absolutely impossible to draw any distinction between the two kinds of fabrics. The importers of this flannelette are Australian manufacturers, who have to fight the importers of made-up flannelette garments. But whilst such garments are It to continue to be imported at the same rate as before, these duties are imposed in respect of the raw material of the Australian manufacturers, who are offered the consolation that, if they can prove that any flannelette imported by them is non-inflamI t is sometimes considered mable, they shall obtain it free of duty. Such a burden of test cannot be complied with by any manufacturer'. cannot be made here ? has not yet been started. We made in Queensland; why can we not make cotton piece-goods? ventured to plank down the dollars to Start such an industry. Apparently, it is thought In addition, flanthat the risk is too great. No manufacturer is asking for this duty; and it is not to be imposed for protective purposes. It is proposed purely for the sentimental purpose of excludingflanneletteon the ground that it is dangerous. An argument so founded would apply to other inflammable articles, including matches, which are introduced into households; and whilst the Minister's intentions may be praiseworthy, we must consider the material interests of these manufacturers and their employees, as well as those of the consumer. The consumer in this case will immediately resort to the use of importedflannelettegarments. What, then, is to become of the local manufacturer? To say the least of it, this proposal, while it may be praiseworthy, is not well-considered from a general stand-point. There are other items with which I shall not deal at present. The timber duties, for instance, have already been dealt with by the honourable member for Kooyong. I should like, however, to refer briefly to talking machines, which, under the old Tariff, were free, but which it is now proposed to make' dutiable at furniture rates where they exceed the value of £ 5 .",50,Elliot Johnson Th E Age Mothers Buy These Materials For Their Little

265,Sir John Quick,"No one has yettheir cabinets, articles of furniture. they should be taxed as furniture, because they are enclosed in cabinets. They are of no use as furniture, and can hardly be said to be ornamental. If the duty has been imposed for revenue purposes, I would point out that no case has been made out for it, because we do not need any increase of revenue from the Tariff. With reference to the duty on motors and parts, I agree with the arguments of the honourable member for Kooyong. not maintain that we cannot make the chassis here? the term "" chassis "" includes the motorpower-that is to say, the cylinders, and the small engines under the car. Most of those engines are of special manufacture, and many of them are associated with patents. Their manufacture in America, England, and on the Continent, has been developed to a very high state of perfection, and probably the whole test of the value of these machines is their durability and reliability. The time may come when the Commonwealth may be able to manufacture these highly-advanced and powerful little engines; but I know of no attempt yet to start their manufacture here. The Tariff Commission took evidence in all the States with reference to the taxibility of chassis; and whilst we were strongly urged to impose a duty on motor cars generally, and also a duty on the framework, if admitted separately, we were not advised to impose a duty on the motive power. The report of the Protectionist section of the Commission sets forth, at page 380, thatA Western Australian carriage builder was of opinion that a substantial duty should be imposed on motor-cars except "" chasses."" The assothis question, because there seems to be a ciation represented by this witness submitted that if the parts of motor-cars were admitted free motor-cars could easily be built in Western Australia and Australia generally. That was the evidence of Mr Cockburn, as given in question 38,545. Then, again, A Melbourne agent for motor vehicles, desired that the chasse of motor waggons should be free. The body work could be dutiable at vehicle rates as it could be made in Australia. <Q. 8 So-i.) 7 5 'A Sydney witness requested that a composite duty of £ 2 0 and 15 per cent, ad valorem be placed on motor cars, exclusive of the machinery parts. These witnesses from three different States agreed that the machinery parts should be admitted free, and said that the carriage portion of the cars could be put together in the various carriage factories in Australia. I do not think that any industry is better established in Australia than is that of carriage-making generally. With the development of the use of motor cars, however, there has been a diminution in the output of that industry. Motor cars and waggons have largely superseded ordinary vehicles and waggons; but of late years tbe manufacturers of carriages have been getting into the habit of importing the under-gear of the motor cars, and making the carriage portion in Australia. This has led to a large and a growing trade, and it is far better to protect and develop that distinct expansion than to put a duty upon the machinery parts of motor cars, in the vague and visionary hope of the manufacture of the chassis or motor parts in Australia. There is no immediate prospect of their local manufacture. I wish now to refer briefly to the fact that the duty on pianos, as recommended by the Protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, differs to some extent from the duty now proposed. In our summary, as reported at page 605 of our report, the Protectionst section of the Commission recommended that on grand and semi-grand pianos there should be a duty of £ 1 5 or 30 per cent., which ever proved the higher duty, and that in the case of upright pianos there should be a duty of £ 5 or 30 per cent. The material point of difference between our recomtnendations and the Ministerial scheme now before us is that, whereas we proposed a fixed duty of £ 5 or 30 per cent, in respect of the cheaper class of instrument, the Government propose a duty of £ 7 each or 35 per cent. I do not express any final view on this matter. I am willing to hear further discussion on difference of opinion; but I feel that we are entitled to the benefit of a lot more information, quite apart from trade secrets, that ought to be in the possession of the Minister. No one wants to hear trade secrets. As chairman of the Tariff Commission, I refused to receive any trade secret which I could not use on the floor of the House. Of what value would it have been for a member of the Commission to receive, under the bond of confidence, information as to trade profits or operations that could not be used in this House or on the public platform? I realize, however, the difficulty of the Minister.",51,Elliot Johnson Th E Age Mothers Buy These Materials For Their Little

Some honourable members may be prepared to accept these proposals without question, but most of us wish to know the ground for them. Information regarding the operation of the Tariff should be submitted to Parliament, not by a Minister, but by a public tribunal, such as a Tariff board, which would gain it by the examination of witnesses in open day. If the manufacturers will not give such information, they must suffer. They cannot expect to get rates of duty increased unless they prove their case for increased Protection fairly and squarely. AlthoughI am a strong Protectionist, I decline to be influenced by statements made under the seal of secrecy. The Protectionist cause is strong enough to demand evidence open to public investigation and discussion. shall not occupy much time in discussing this matter, but its importance makes it necessary that we"" should express our opinion upon the proposals put forward. The honourable member for Kooyong has joined with the Leader of the Opposition in stating his dissatisfaction with the proposed the House how the proposed re-classification revision of the Tariff, and, judging by remarks which have fallen from the honourable member for Hume, and others, and the statements that have appeared in the Protectionist press, particularly of Victoria, the amended schedule does not give satisfaction to Protectionists. As a member of the Fusion party, I agreed to the rectification of anomalies, but I am greatly dissatisfied with what is now proposed. It is grossly wrong that this amended schedule should be introduced at the end of the session, accompanied by fhe threat that, if we do not pass it within two or three days, there must be another session after Christmas. I agree with the honourable member for Bendigo that Parliamait should have the fullest information regarding the operacould benefit by increased duties, they tion of the Tariff.

Although a Free Trader, I have no wish that any established industry shall suffer But I am not prepared to vote for alterations of duty which, while made in the interest of some industries, may prejudicially affect other industries giving employment to a large number of persons. That will be the result of some of the proposals before us. The Minister, in bringing in the schedule, supplied us with only very meagre information regarding it. According to one of the newspapers, the alterations proposed are to make clear the intention of Parliament, to insure uniformity in classification, and to put an end to the difficulties which arise from the present classification. No doubt the improvement of the classification may be necessary in the interests of administration, but alterations of duties have effects which sometimes only an expert can estimate. The Minister should have informed will affect the revenue. formation regarding every item. man pointed out that, in one or two instances, alterations of duties have been made to give more Protection. campaign, the honourable gentleman and every member of his party declared that if the proposals of the Government were not accepted by the people, so that the workers, as well as the manufacturers, would not increase the Protection given to any industry. Unless they could deal with industrial conditions generally, they pledged themselves not to increase the rates of duty. That pledge is now being broken.

A short time ago the honourable gentleman and his colleague were very anxious, not for the interests of the manufacturers, but for the interests of the workmen; but now, without any new Protection stipulations, they are championing the cause of the manufacturers, particularly in Victoria, and willing to give them a further opportunity for taking the life-blood of the people who have to pay the duties. turers not also benefit? any twopenny-halfpenny little industry here, employing two or three persons, has only to get the ear of the Minister in order to have Protection extended to it. The Minister of Trade and Customs, in the course of his speech, saidThe first item of importance is item 54. It relates to preserved fruits and vegetables, and places them at precisely the same rates of duly as pickles, sauces, and chutneys. In irjo6 there tation of gas meters in 1910 was valued at were over ^27,000 worth imported, and in 1910 the value of the imports had increased to ^50,000, and if there is one country in the world where we ought to grow our own fruits for preserving it is Australia. I quite agree with the Minister in that. We ought to grow our own fruits for preservingRegarding the preserved fruits, Queensland is affected, inasmuch as imports are brought from some of the Eastern countries, while the Queensland pineapples are going to' waste. Has the Minister made any special inquiries so far as Queensland is concerned? Pineapple is grown in Queensland in winter and in summer. In summer the fruit is not preserved, because there is an excellent market for it fresh, and in the winter the fruit is not so suitable for preserving, because it is "" woody."" Honourable members will agree with me that during last winter Queensland pineapples were hawked about Melbourne streets at 2d. and 3d. a-piece. In 1906, the Queensland factories produced 2,366,589 lbs., nearly the whole of which was scheduled as jams, with no preserved fruit. In 1910, the factories produced 4,626,846 lbs., of which 3,732,351 lbs. was preserved fruit. Does that look like a languishing industry which needs more protection ? It appears to me to represent one of the flourishing industries of Australia under the present Tariff. The Minister of Trade and Customs also pointed out that electroliers, gasoliers, and chandeliers stand at 20 per cent., and saidThis is another item where the finished article is under a lower duty than the raw material. I think the Minister was slightly ip error when he said that, because much of the raw material, such as brass, bronze, case tubing, and so forth, came in free under the old Tariff as minor articles 178B. will find that I am correct. When the Tariff was last before us, the item of gas meterscaused much debate, and out of consideration for the various gas companies of Australia the duty was left at 5 per cent, and free. It is now proposed, however, to make gas meters subject to a duty of 20 and 15 per cent. The value of the imports of electroliers-which , under the old Tariff, were 20 per cent., and under the proposed Tariff 30 and 25 per cent -wa s £29,925 in 1910, and of that £26,000 odd represented British manufacture. The impor£35,631, and the whole came from Great Britain. It appears from these, and other items, that the Minister is going out of his way to press hardly on the products of the manufacturers of the Old Country. We ought not to deal with them in this harsh fashion. We ought to do our utmost to give the manufacturers of Great Britain an opportunity to get their products into the Australian market at the lowest possible rate, consistent with raising the revenue necessary to carry on the Government of the country. In view of all that Great Britain has done for us in the past we ought not to go out of our way to impose a duty which strikes absolutely at products of British manufacture. It is unpatriotic, and absolutely opposed to that Imperialistic spirit, which not only men on this side of the House share, but which many honourable members opposite have professed to believe in.",54,Elliot Johnson Th E Age Mothers Buy These Materials For Their Little

But, as we all know, the duty on the articles is added on to the price of the article, and then passed on to the consumer. regard to the oil duties, so far as I can gather, appear to be of a technical character. The Minister said, "" We understand that the South Australian oil industry has suffered, and we are altering the duty so as to give greater protection to an established industry."" The House is entitled to a more definite statement, because a full inquiry was made into the matter by the Tariff Commission, and as the result of the report of the Protectionist section an increased duty was placed on oil, to protect the South Australian industry. It is a splendid industry, and the oil produced there is absolutely the best in the world. AllI know is that, although the representatives of the South Australian oil industry told the Tariff Commission that if the duty was imposed the price of oil would not be raised. I am now charged 3s. for the oil for which I used to pay 2s. 6d. a bottle some years ago. In the circumstances the South Australian industry is doing remarkably well. I hope when we deal with the item the Minister will be prepared with definite inraised 100 per cent, on pure vinegar which formation on the subject. Vinegar is now dutiable at 6d. per gallon when the produce of grain, malt, or fruit juice, and 2s. per gallon when produced from other material. The Minister stated that the analyst found it impossible to discriminate between the two classes, and instead of imposing a sixpenny rate on the one kind, and a 2s. rate on the other, he proposes to have an all round duty of is. per gallon. The honourable member for Capricornia, when a member of the Tariff Commission, made a strong report on vinegars distilled from wood and other materials, and, in consequence, the high duty of 2s. per gallon was imposed. In levelling the duty up from 6d. in the one case, and down from 2s. in the other, the Minister is really striking at the malt vinegar that comes from the Old Country. Practically the whole of the vinegar produced from malt, and imported into Australia, comes from Great Britain. In 1910 only 50 gallons of acetate vinegar was imported into Australia, but of malt vinegar 284,240 gallons, valued at £32,275, was imported, being nearly all ""British. The increase of duty from 6d. to is. per gallon, on the value of the vinegar imported in 1910, brings the duty up to 42 per cent. We ought to offer an inducement for pure vinegar to come in, and do everything to keep out the inferior stuff. is which. which is bad and which is good, we ought to give a substantial preference to the vinegar from the Old Country, because we know it is produced from malt, by leaving the duty on it at 6d. per gallon. According to yesterday's newspaper, Messrs. R. W. Thurlow and Company, of Brisbane, who aie large manufacturers of vinegar, state that they made no request for increased protection, and considered the old duty quite adequate. a request from any manufacturer for an increased duty on vinegar. Minister put it on? have amalgamated the two rates. This is a correction of the rates in. the old Tariff, to which the honourable member was supposed to agree. we ought to use, and decreased 100 per cent, on the inferior vinegar. I am glad to find the Minister thinks he ought to do something for the butter industry, and the deserving people who are engaged in it. He proposes to help them by allowing New Zealand pine used for butter boxes to come in free. I hope that will be the effect of his proposal. Has he satisfied himself that the re-arrangement of duties will make butter boxes cheaper? I cannot guarantee that the producers will not be robbed in between. has endeavoured to do his best in the matter, but some prominent men engaged in the business inform me that his proposal would not have the desired effect.

306,Mr Fuller,"I think the Ministerother hand, I have been advised by the manager of the Coastal Farmers Co-operative Company, in Sydney, which controls about 80 per cent, of the butter business of New South Wales, that, after making inquiries, they have come to the conclusion that the amendment will mean a reduction of about three-eighths of a penny on each butter box. However, the position does not appear to be clear, and I understand the Minister is prepared to make a necessary alteration in regard to the sizes specified in the schedule. industries as well as butter? to this matter as one of the anomalies. While very properly trying to benefit the butter industry, the Minister is adversely affecting, according to statements made to me, the people engaged in the fruit, rabbit, and other industries. white pine which are not suitable for butter boxes are used to make boxes for those industries, and the alteration of duty will make their boxes cost them more than they do now: of Australian timber suitable for fruitcases, and quite as cheap as New Zealand white pine. -should be perfectly clear as to the effect of the Minister's proposal. So many statements have been made about it, that I admit I do not know how it will work out in regard to butter boxes, but if the statements which I have received are correct, it appears probable that the people engaged in the fruit, rabbit, and other industries will be considerably handicapped. rejoicing that something is being done for the butter industry, in which my constituency is especially interested, I am""not so parochial as to desire other industries in other parts of Australia lo be damaged in consequence. We ought to endeavour to insure that all those people who are making their living out of the products of the land, and so adding to the wealth of Australia, are given the opportunity to carry on their business under the best possible conditions. operate against the fruit growers? formation supplied to me, the refuse of the logs, after the butter box timber is taken out, is used to make rabbit crates, fruit cases, and so on, and the reduction of the [148] duty on the portion used for butter boxes will mean an increased rate on the portion left over. cases every year out of our own local hardwood. apple industry will increase so rapidly that it will soon need 10,000,000 cases per year. I wish now to refer to the proposed increased duty on strawboard. Prior to 1907 there was a duty of is. per cwton strawboard, but in that year the duty was increased to is. 6d. per cwt., and it is now proposed to make it 2s. per cwt. in the case of imports from foreign countries, and is. 6d. per cwt. on imports from the United Kingdom. The proposed preference is of a rather farcical character, because I understand that no strawboard under the item The parts of the proposed to be amended comes from the Old Country. The whole of it is practically imported from Holland. The average value of the imports made in 1910 was 6s. 3d. per cwt., so that this duty will work out at over 30 per cent., which is a fairly high rate. The value of the strawboard imported, as shown in the Customs returns, suggests that practically nearly all the finer qualities are being imported, and that only the poorer classes are made here. qualities come in under another item. is referring to millboard, which is quite a different article. board, and leatherboard are the finer qualities. ter will make special inquiries, and give us definite information on the subject. The evidence given before the Tariff Commission will bear out my statement that there is practically a trust or combine controlling the strawboard-making industry in Australia. I was always under the impression that the very name of a trust or combine stank in the nostrils of honourable members opposite, and that it was one of their chief ambitions to prevent combines carrying on operations with a view of fleecing the people of Australia. It is perfectly clear,, however, from the evidence submitted to the Tariff Conunission, that an honourable understanding' or combine then existed amongst those engaged in the industry, and we know that it exists to-day.

318,While Mr Fuller,"I hope that the Minisand Messrs. Sands and McDougall Limited carry on the industry in Victoria. We find that last year there were 216 hands employed in the paper, straw, and millboard . factories in Victoria, as compared with 183 employed in 1906, so that it cannot be said that the industry is languishing. We find from the published reports that the net profit earned by the Australian Paper Mills Company Limited of Victoria in 1910 was, without depreciation, equal to 14.18 per cent, on capital. The directors stated inter alia that they had satisfaction in reporting sales greater than last year (1909), and that the various mills were fairly well employed. They concluded their report with the statement that: "" The directors consider the prospects good, and that the business is increasing."" In view of this statement, I think that we are entitled to fuller information before we agree to this increase of duty. We all know that strawboard is used by various industries which employ a large number of hands. I have before me a document showing that the users of strawboard throughout Australia employ about 5,000 hands, and that these will all be, more or less, prejudicially affected by the imposition of the duty. Strawboard is used by manufacturers of boxes, by printers and bookbinders, portmanteau-makers, and picture-framing works, and the number of hands engaged in the strawboard trade is small compared with the 5,000 employed in those industries. A strong case ought to be made out for the imposition of this duty when we know that it will mean an increase in the price of strawboard, and that already one or two families in Australia have grown rich by the manufacture of this article in the Commonwealth. The industry 'of strawboard making is one to which a member of the Labour party recently made very strong references. Senator Rae, speaking in another place, on 23rd November, 1910, saidOne of the principal articles of our faith is to secure protection, not only for the manufacturer, but for the employee' and the consumer. ' f h a t is quite right. If we get the endorsement of the people at the proposed referendum we shall compel protected manufacturers and producers to share their protection with their employees, and give some guarantee that they will not extort unfair prices from the consumer. Until we have some assurance that that blissful state of equilibrium, information; but I think the honorablecan be brought about, we are pledged not to give further protection through the Tariff, and I consider that we shall be going widely beyond the scope of a measure for the rectificaMr Fuller. tion of anomalies if we increase to such anenormous extent, the duties on these strawboards. I am credibly informed that it will strike a. tremendous blow at the manufacture of boxesout of this material, and we know that the finished product of one industry is the raw material of another. It appears to me that, the admissions of the Honorary Minister that these mills are working f u l l time, that they areproducing all that they can possibly produce,, and that it is intended to start another mill,, are evidence that the industry already enjoys a sufficient measure of protection. For my part,, it will receive no further protection until the public are assured that the employees in it are: going to get a fair deal, and that the consumers, are not to be fleeced. That was a very proper position to take up,, and I hope that it will be supported by this Committee, unless the Minister bringsforward very strong reasons for the imposition of the duty. referenda proposals said that they were not in favour of the consumer receiving protection. referenda were even thought of, I said in. this House that if Protection were granted to manufacturers we should take care that a proper proportion of the benefits so conferred was derived by the employees. Another 'member of the Labour party in the Senate-Senato r McDougall-said , on the same occasionI shall not support the proposed duly for two reasons. In the first place the imposition of that duty would hurt a number of my fellow workers. I have a letter in my possession from, the Secretary of the Factory Employes Union, in which he affirms that the proposed duty would"" prevent those employed in the industry from obtaining the better wages which they wilt presently get under existing conditions. Theemployers in the industry are willing that a Wages Board should be established in connection, with it. The other reason why I will not vote for the Government proposal is that I object to giving high duties to any industry which, will not treat its employees fairly. Before we are asked to grant an increased measure of protection to this industry, we should know the conditions under which its employees labour. Mi.

To show that the increase of duty is neces,[l 8]2 4 sary, the Minister should give us evidence that the piano-making industry is languishing. As a matter of fact, we know that cent, ad valorem was the highest rate he would ask for; but now that he has established his industry, he tells us that, without the world, whence pianos manufactured by Australia. In a circular which he has addressed to every member of the House, Mr Apart from other considerations, wages in almost every Department have increased considerably; those of cabinetmakers' polishers are fixed by the Furniture Trades Wages Board, the minimum being £ 3 weekly of 48 hours. Compare this with 26s. for the weekly average earnings by piece work for similar labour in Germany for 60 hours weekly, and you will readily understand that in wages alone the .Australian manufacturer has to pay more than double as much as Germany, and, in fact, European manufacturers. The average cost at the port of shipment in Europe of f u l ly 10,000 pianos (out of 14,000) exported to Australia annually, is less per piano than we have to pay in wages alone per instrument. Material, such as timber, has to be stocked by us in very large quantities for seasoning purposes. A large amount of capital remains locked up, and loss of interest annually is very considerable. Almost the whole of the timber is Australian, and we have induced the Victorian Forestry Department to cultivate such limbers, which we are, so far, forced to import, and thus hope in later years to be independent of foreign supplies. In fact, we have to rely entirely upon our own resources. and its legislation the wages of Australia would be as low as those of Germany.

I am attempting to show that increased duties, representing between £250,000 and £500,000, are being placed on the people of Australia, without justification, by means of this "" homoeopathic dose."" It is for the Minister and others who are in possession of information to show whether or not I am correct. Item 26IB includes caseine and dextrine. Caseine, which is made from milk, is already being manufactured here, and, therefore, there can be no necessity for a duty. a new industry 1 already in existence. Eextrine, which was formerly free, is now called upon, with caseine, to pay a duty of 25 and 20 per cent. I suppose that honourable members, in common with myself, have received a circular dealing with this item. to me. to the honourable gentleman, because, with his lack of information, it may help him to alter his mind. Dextrine is used in a large number of trades; and, according to the circular, which certainly requires answering, those trades will be very seriously affected by the proposed duty. Throughout Australia at the present time there is a widespread desire to promote sanitation; and this ought to be encouraged as much as possible. In the warmer parts of Australia, particularly in the north, sanitation is receiving the most earnest and careful attention of the authorities; and yet we find it proposed to place a duty on formaline, flypapers, fly-wire for doors, and so forth. Only yesterday I returned from a part of Australia where the flies were almost unbearable. the honourable member. that there are a good many "" flies "" at present buzzing about the lobby; and I always try to avoid them. This system of lobbying is most objectionable; and it would be a good thing if Mr Speaker, or whoever can exercise authority, would refuse to allow those persons to fill the corridors and the hall in their desire to interview nonor; able members. Let those peculiarly interested in the Tariff send any statements they choose in writing, but this lobbying, which has been the cause of so much corbe stopped in Australia, where we hope to keep our politics clean. thinks that we ought to enjoy a dignified isolation! are discussing the Tariff, we should be isolated to such an extent as to be free from persistent lobbyists. In my opinion, Tariff legislation throughout the years has been largely influenced by our environment. If the honourable member for Batman had been here when the Tariff was previously discussed, he would have seen the influence resulting from our meeting in Melbourne; and he would realize that many of our decisions have been arrived at, not for the benefit of the people generally, but for the benefit of those who happened to reside where Parliament meets. Under the Pure Foods Acts of Australia people are compelled to take every precaution, and yet we find that in connection with vinegar, wrapping paper paper is not altered. duty on paper is one that I propose to discuss when we reach the item. cannot point out to me an item in which the duty is altered in regard to wrapping paper. paper is made free; but the paper which is the off-cut of the newspapers, and which is used by butchers and others, will be much more expensive than hitherto. imported as news printing paper, and be used for another purpose?

365,Mr Fuller,"The honourable memberhad been made, both sides agreed in regard to a large number of items, but the Protectionists then brought in reports of their own in many cases, and the Free Traders did the same. When the Tariff was being considered, the honourable member for Hume time after time quoted the reports of the Protectionist wing of the Commission as being thereports of the Commission itself; and I was at pains to point out the error he was making. The -division of opinion on in connection with any Tariff Commission -composed in that way. I am satisfied that no political Commission of the sort will give the House the information which it ought to have before it deals with Tariff matters. In this matter, affecting the vital -interests of Australia, and particularly the pockets of the poorer classes, we ought to be prepared, in establishing a board, to secure the best men available, pay them salaries which will remunerate them for their labours, and put them in the position of judges, so that they may be able to inquire in the fullest possible way from time to time into the condition of Australian industries. We should then have their reports laid on the table of the House, and if we had in them the confidence that we should have, I am sure that if a fair and honest case were made out for the revision of duties by the House in connection with different industries, honourable members on both sides would be prepared immediately to do what was right. On the other hand, In the case of the Tariff Commission to which I have referred, honourable members with Protectionist proclivities took the reports of the Protectionist section, and honourable members with Free Trade proclivities took the reports of the Free Trade section, and the result was that,' the Protecfourteen years, whereas, unfortunately, tionists being in the majority in the House, in nearly every instance the report of the Protectionist wing was adopted. I trust that the Minister will seriously consider the advisability of appointing a .Tariff board, so that Parliament may have available the fullest and most reliable information regarding Australian industries, and so be in a position to deal with them on fair lines, instead of being asked to consider a Tariff schedule on secret information, in the way whicli the Minister now proposes. purpose to speak briefly, although this question is second in importance onlyto that of the great question of labour in Australia. At the same time, I recognise the difficulty facing any Government which brings in a Tariff schedule at the end of a session. The honourable member for Illawarra said the increase in the piano duties was proposed in order to give Protection against one of the most highly-protected countries in the world. Why not? He is surely aware of the statement made in a book published by the Tariff Reform League of Great Britaina body representing a movethat occurred ment which is gaining great weight, and that body will always obtain would be much more powerful than it is .to-day if it were only freed from the trammels and stigma of Conservatism-to the effect that Germany and other European countries send into England 600 pianos for every piano which England sends to Germany. Every honourable member will agree that the average Briton, if given equal conditions, will more than hold his own with the German, although Germany stands head and shoulders above most other countries in the secondary education which she gives to her artisans. At page 184 of the boqk to which I have referred, it is stated in regard to the year 1907Imports of pianos into United Kingdom from Germany, Holland, and Belgium. Year. No. Value. 1907 ... 20,798 ... ^632,788 Export of pianos from the United Kingdom to Germany1907. ... 34 ... ^1,249. It will be seen from these figures that for every piano we were able to send to Germany in 1907 Germany was able to send us 600. . . . During the last seventeen years no fewer than twelve important piano and organ manufactories have been closed up in London alone. This shows that, without a Tariff, England cannot possibly compete with Germany, even though in most German trades to-day the wages are higher than in England, and have even been increased within the last wages in England have been decreased. I must compliment the Government on proposing a fixed duty on pianos. My regret is that it will be the lowest fixed duty imposed on pianos by any Protectionist country in the world. In Germany, the charge is made by weight, going up £ 1 os. 40!. per cwt That is an instance of a highlyprotected country, with a thoroughly up to-date Tariff, thinking it necessary to impose a fixed duty. The United States of America charges 45 per cent, ad valorem, and Russia from jQio to ^17 per piano; France imposes a duty of from £ 2 to £ $ , but in addition charges so much per kilo, making",62,Imports 1910
366,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [8.39],"Ithe duty as high as £va ios. In Spain the duty is from £10 to ^13; in Portugal, £i\; is stated that England will lose the whole of her piano-making firms, with the exception of a. few very high-class makers, unless protective duties are imposed. Protection is absolutely necessary to a country. I am a Protectionist to the extent of prohibition. The women and girls who made match-boxes in the city of London at 2jd. per gross, finding their own paste, were sweated, yet in Japan it was found possible to make match-boxes, fill them with matches, and export them for less than id. per gross! In those circumstances of what use would a protective duty of even 100 per cent, be? So acute are the Japanese, that some years ago in New South Wales, their matches were being sold under the name of ""trade union matches."" I think that it was while the honourable member for Hume held office as Minister of Trade and Customs that I drew attention to the trouble, with the result that it Was ended. The position in regard to these matches shows how necessary it is to look forward to the imposition of duties, not of 10 or 15 per cent., but of hundreds per cent. Japan has the most up-to-date Tariff in the world, and no country is making more rapid improvement. Finding that the tobacco industry, if nationalized, would be regarded as a good security for a loan, which she was obliged to raise in Europe in consequence of the war with Russia, she took action to deal with the American tobacco combine, which had taught the Japanese to smoke cigarettes. The Japanese Govermnent made an offer to the combine which, feeling secure in its millions, however, simply scoffed at the proposal. further offer was likewise laughed to scorn, but Japan steadily increased her Tariff, entered into competition with the combine, and finally succeeded in ousting it. While this competition was in progress Senator Findley and I paid a visit to Japan, and were told by the Under-Secretory of Foreign Affairs that the utmost difficulty was experienced in inducing the Japanese to acquire a liking for the Government-made cigarettes, notwithstanding that only the best tobacco was used. About 1905 the Japanese further increased their Tariff on cigars, cigarettes, and tobacco to 150 per cent., and the combine, finding that the position was becoming serious, more especially as under the Constitution any article acquired for a Government Dr. Moloney. monopoly could be admitted free of duty, commenced to consider Japan's offer, but in Sweden, from to ;£«. It the Japanese took up a determined stand. In the following year the Tariff was raised to 250 per cent., and it now stands at 355 per cent Thus cigars, f.o.b., coming into Japan, for the combine, and valued at ;£io per 1,000, had to pay a duty of ,£35 per 1,000, plus landing and other charges,, whereas those required for the Government could be introduced at a cost of £ \ o per 1,000, plus only landing and other charges. The combine found themselves unable to contend against such a position, and finally the Japanese Government got the whole of their machinery, which could not be removed, and all their warehouses, for practically a song. The combine, regarding Japan as only a little bit of the world'ssurface, thought that they were done with it, but they have now to fight the Japanese national tobacco monopoly from Vladivostock to Bombay. The Japanese Government is able to undersell them owing to its cheap labour, and whilst I do not care to see white labour go under, I say all honour to Japan, since, by nationalizing the tobacco industry, she alone has been able to fight the tobacco combine of the United States of America. Two big companies doing business in Australia endeavoured to fight that combine, but woke up one morning, so to speak, to find that the majority of their shares had been purchased in the interests of the trust. With the exception of Messrs. Snider and Abraham, and Dudgeon and Arneil, all the tobacco manufacturers in Australia are now controlled by the American combine. I must admit that the combine are treating their employees here very well, and when I had the A privilege of visiting their works some time ago, I told their representatives that the better they treated their employees the more generosity they would be likely to receive from the Commonwealth when we were wise enough to nationalize the industry. I have here a list of trades in respect of which England is absolutely losing her business, and as the son of an English woman, with the rich red blood rushing from my heart, and giving thought to my brain, I strongly resent the inability of Great Britain to get fair play in regard to these trades. In regard to boots and shoes, carpets, cement, cotton, coal, and fruit, England is rapidly losing her trade. The glasstrade has been almost wiped out of Great Britain) and even Scottish granite ,is finding it hard to compete with that from abroad. also losing her trade in gloves, hats, and straw bonnets, hops, hosiery, iron and steel, jewellery, lace, musical instruments, pianos, pottery, silk, sugar refining, tanning, tin plates, and umbrellas and woollens. Who that has visited the hop fields of Kent will not deplore the fact that the rich lands of that county, which are unequalled in Europe for the production of hops, are gradually going out of cultivation? I recognise that neither Free Trade nor Protection has removed poverty from the world; but I have never seen in a protected country the misery, poverty, and wretchedness that I have witnessed in England. I have seen workers there trying to rear their children in mere lanes 3 or 4 feet wide, on which two-story houses abut. On the other hand, I have seen in Protectionist Germany sights that make me wish that the controlling powers of the large cities of England were equal to the controlling power of the city of Berlin. I did not see a single slum in that great city of 3,ooo,oco . people, and I should say that while London has improved 10 per cent., Paris has improved 20 per cent, and Berlin 50 per cent. Where ^1,000,000 is expended on improvement schemes in London, ^10,000,000 is expended in Berlin, and the improvement in the health of the people in the last-named city certainly justifies the expenditure. We shall never be able to adequately express our appreciation of the hospitality that was extended to the members of this Parliament who visited London on the occasion of the Coronation celebrations. As members of that delegation, we were permitted to visit ship-building yards, and other places that would not otherwise have been open to us, but the only healthy bodies of workers that my trained medical eye could detect were those employed at Port Sunlight, and at Cadbury's, where the hours of the men have been reduced to forty-eight per week, and those of the females to forty-five hours per Week. The death rate at Port Sunlight has been reduced to half that of a district but 300 yards away, by the erection of splendid buildings under healthy conditions, by Messrs. Lever Brothers. Messrs. Huntley and Palmer, biscuit manufacturers, Cadbury's, and Fry's, have also erected comfortable quarters for their employee's. While Germany is trying to build up a race of big men and women, England has found it necessary to reduce the measuremuch the same result. Surely we should ments required on the part of men for enThe Old Country is rolment in the Army. While in England, I met an Australian lady who has taken the platform there in advocacy of Protection, and gave her some photographs of the American tobacco works here, and of Messrs. Snider and Abraham's factory. She displayed these, and the people there were astonished to hear of the wages paid in the industry in Australia. When the Tariff was last before us, I took up a strong position in regard to women's and children's dress goods; but the Committee, as the result of false information, given principally by Mr Harold Sparks, came to the conclusion that such goods were made in Australia. As a matter of fact, they are not. I refer more particularly to the finer materials known as women's dress goods, which I do not think we shall be able to manufacture here for another half a century. I am sure it is not the desire of the House that a sex tax should be imposed; yet something like ,£500,000 per annum is collected in respect of these goods, and the impost is really a sex tax upon the women folk of our continent. Considering the voting power of our women folk, it would go hard with some candidates seeking their suffrages if they were only cognisant of the real effect of this tax. Perhaps the most important deputation that was ever received by a Minister waited on the honourable member for Kooyong in this building, when he held office as Minister of Trade and Customs, and made representations to him in regard to this very item. They went away, I am sorry to say, with the reverse of goodwill towards him. If , as a strong Minister, he had said that he would give them justice, they would have remembered him for all time. The present Minister of Trade and Customs is a Protectionist of Protectionists; but, unfortunately, he is trammelled by the position in which he finds himself. I regret the small modicum of Protection that we are securing under this Bill, but recognise that we could not expect to deal with the Tariff as a whole at practically the end of the session. The appointment of a commission or board, however, would lead only to further delay. There never was a commission that did not lead to delay; and I am reminded of the words of a cynical German philosopher that, if the Almighty had placed the making of the world in the hands of a commission, it would never have been made. The appointment of a board of three men to deal with Tariff questions would have not be afraid to face the work ourselves. I hope that some day we shall have in force the principle of the referendum, with the initiative. The people will then be inde-' pendent of Ministry and Opposition alike, and will be able to demand, by the initiative, what is required. When that state of affairs,is reached, we shall have a Protective Tariff worthy of the name. I wish to ask the Minister to give some attention to the dumping of dress-goods in Australia. Our season, fortunately or unfortunately, follows that in the Home land. Goods that are manufactured in England in large quantities lose their value at the end of a season and are dumped in Australia. For instance, ladies' overcoats, which might bring£ 5 5s. at the beginning of a season, are sold for £ 2 2%. towards the close of it ; wages in the weaving trade, which has been but, rather than sell them for less locally, business firms sell them for export to Australia. It was said that a mistress who had paid, in the height of the season, £ 5 5s. for a fashionable lady's overcoat, might object to see her servant wearing an equally good coat which she had purchased later in the season for ios. These made up overcoats are not shoddy, but of splendid material. They were bought at ss. u d . each, and the landing charges, duty, and freight brought the price up to 8s. 1 id. A deputation which waited on the Minister laid before him the sworn statement that similar coats could not be made under our Wages Board system for less than 21s. each. Did the public benefit by the importation? No. We traced the destination of some of the coats, and found that one was sold at 35s. in Prahran, arid another elsewhere for two guineas. I wish to see Protection given to the manufacturer and to the employ^, whose hours should be limited, and whose wages should be increased, while the public should get its goods at the lowest prices possible. This is schedule B of the Customs Tariff, No. 7, of 1908, rebate for home consumptionNumber of the item in schedule A 123. Piece goods of any material when used in the manufacture of rubber waterproof cloth. Rebate up to and including n t h December, 1907, three-fourths of the duty paid. I hope that the Minister will be able to induce his colleagues to give some relief to the manufacturers who suffer from the dumping to which I have alluded. We have tailors who can make garments fit for any prince, king, or emperor, and outfitters who can make clothes fit for any woman, be she as beautiful as Juno, or wise as Dr. Moloney. Minerva. I would, therefore, like to see the prohibition of the importation of garments. I hope that if we cannot get an alteration of the duty on dress goods this session relief may be' given to the manufacturers of women's and children's outer garments in some way. In some of the American States there is a super-Customs tax to prevent dumping. In the dear old Home land, they suffer from dumping even more than we do here. The honourable member for Illawarra spoke of the low wages in Germany. I am sure that he, like the rest of us, desires that every man in this community should have good wages, and be permitted to enjoy a high standard of living. I should like in this connection to read a comparison of German and English supplied to me by a keen student of statistics. WhatI am about to read is part of the official report of the Yorkshire Textile Workers Deputation, which made a comparison of wages, factory conditions, rent, taxes, and cost of living. With a magistrate as chairman, it was sent to Germany, and chose two communities as like as possible to the woollen districts of YorkshireThe following table shows the prices paid for weaving by five of the best firms in the heavy woollen district, side by side with the prices paid (1) in the factories near Berlin; (2) the mills of Cottbus; and (3) the mills of Forst :White cotton warfs, 21 strings, 2 shuttlesEnglish..

' . . . This little analysis shows at a glance that in their territory. I hope that we shall pass the "" Batley"" of Germany, where cloth ranging from is. to 5s. per yard is being made, and oearly 11,000 operatives ate engaged in the industry, the weavers are paid twelve and a half per cent, more for the work they do than the weavers receive in the best factories in the Yorkshire woollen district. No man has fought the Age newspaper more than I have done during the past twenty-one years, and I am prepared to fight it still, but for its advocacy of Protection I must pay it my meed of praise. I have to thank it for the fiscal views which I hold, and have no cause to regret. My recent visit to the Old Country confirmed the impression of thirty years ago, and established me in my convictions. Next to the land system, Free Trade is doing more to debase the United Kingdom, through injury to her manufactories and workers, than anything else. Germany has one of the most paternal Governments in the w» -ld, and her -educational facilities have pros, iced the strongest, most enlightened, and up-to-date body of workers that the world knows today. She has 3,250,000 educated workers, who are unequalled elsewhere. They are trying to hold the nations apart, although the war parties in Germany and England are snarling at each other. I love mv native Australia as much as any man could love his native land, and I wish to see a -protective policy established so strong that we shall be able to face the world. I do not think that that would remove poverty. The only way to do that would be tc nationalize industries, when we are wise -enough and educated enough to take them -over. The manufacturers to-day see that it is to their advantage to work amicably with their employees. they opposed the establishment of Wages Boards, they how desire them, because they are thus better able, with the assistance, of their employees, to obtain Tariff protection. I am proud fo say that I have given many a vote for the creation of Wages Boards. The late member for Gippsland, by a -stroke of statesmanship, insisted that a Wages Board should be appointed on the vote of one House. For three years that provision stood to his credit on the statute<book of Victoria, and helped much to benefit the workers. Boards are absurd, their operations being confined to the cities, so that men on one -side of the street may be receiving one rate -of wages, while those on the other are being sweated to the utmost. The neigh.bouring States, legislating later, have made Wages Boards applicable to the whole of such. legislation that all men, whether in town or in country, will receive decent wages. The workers are in the worse position in Queensland at present. In giving Protection to the employer, I hope that it will be insisted that every employee shall get his due share of the profit of his industry, and that the public shall not be robbed . by any combine, domestic or foreign. [9.14] -This is the third Tariff which has been dealt with by this Parliament, and it seems likely, at this rate, that in the future Tariff revision will be an annual event. The sooner the Tariff is placed under some better auspices, even if it should result in our having it as an annual, the better it will be for Australia. A Tariff is now submitted to the House without the slightest information as to what its effect is to be, or as to whether it will achieve the object which is written broadly over the preface. The Minister has information concerning some of the items, but he will not disclose it ; he asks us to take what he says on trust, and to believe that he is doing his best in the interests of Australia as a whole, and the interests of the Tariff in particular. That would be all very well if we did not know that the Minister himself is acting within very severe limitations, and is bound hand-and-foot by certain statements of his confreres and of the party in general. I .was very much struck with the remarks of the last speaker. We have heard him talk before of his desire to have a huge Tariff wall built around Australia; but, somehow or other, he seems to be sinWhereas formerly gularly unfortunate in his illustrations. He has quoted from a book with a glaring red cover, which he declares to contain the opinions of Tariff reformers at Home, Tariff Reform League, Victoria-street, Westminster. people writing books at Home which tell a very different story.

Of course, my honourable friend, with that capacity for fairness and impartiality which we know him to possess, quoted so much, and left us to quote the rest. If I believed in a Protection of ioo per cent., or in total prohibition, as the honourable member for Melbourne does, I should try to get some better illustrations than those he has furnished to-night. For instance, he has told us that in Japan, where labour can, I believe, be employed for is. per day, the Tariff has been raised to 350 per cent, against workmen in America, who are paid ten times as much in wages.

Why should a Labour party be required, when the very Government itself is socialistic?

Woe also is Protection, at least, in Japan1 Before the honourable member set out to champion Australian Protection, he ought to have selected better examples. He showed, if anything, that 300 per cent, duties and nationalization do not solve the social problem.

It seems but I think that we ought to consider the to me that Tariff revision is only an urgent matter when the Ministry are out of office. When they are in office, they think it sufficient to bring down a schedule containing two or three items. Their attitude reminds one of the story of the man who, while sleighing, was pursued by wolves, and, one by one, threw overboard the little ones who were with him. More is promised, I presume; but when, and in what -circumstances? Whilst there is still no means of giving effect to the new Protection policy, the Government have been warned by one of their staunch supporters, the honourable member for Hume, that they must expect a complete revision of the Tariff next session. He says, "" I have been promised it next session."" I do not know when the promise was made. Did the Minister give the honourable member any promise? orable member in private anything that I have not said in public by way of answers to questions in this House. orable member for Hume must have made an inaccurate statement.

Meantime the Ministry may find'something that will help them in this matter of the new Protection. The combined intellect of my honourable friends opposite should surely enable them to suggest some remedy, although it is difficult to see how they can get behind the unqualified statement of the Attorney-General, who has, perhaps, the cutest brains of any honourable member on the Government side of the House, that it is impossible to give the new Protectionthat it is impossible to guarantee better wages to the workers by means of these increased duties. fore, the spectacle of the Ministry throwing a little sop to a few manufacturersa sort of make-believe, this session-and the honourable member for Hume, in his anxiety to support these gentlemen, who will not give him what he wants-sai d he relies on some promise which has been made that there will be a complete revision of the Tariff next session.

CATTS -Even although those promises are against the Opposition policy ? It is tlie duty of the Opposition to see that the Government keep faith with the country. At the last general election the honourable member for Cook ridiculed our scheme to provide for new Protection. He told the electors that the Labour party would give them something better; that it would give them some guarantee that the workers would share in the benefits of whatever duties were imposed. He declared that a former Government had broken faith with him so far as the last Tariff revision was concerned. Mr J. H .

We now have it from the mouth of a leading member of his party that that is impossible; but that does not deter him from going on with the conferment of these further privileges on the manufacturers of Australia. This schedule is a further proof of the absolute necessity of removing the Tariff, so far as its genesis and the need for investigation go, from the political arena.

But it seems that only fifteen out of a hundred who . sent in returns are to be favoured. others Were not paying their workmen decent wages. the Minister has not told us anything about that. 1 think he ought to tell us some1 thing. I do not say that he ought to tell us what the individual cases are. He ought not to give' us any information which was supplied to him secretly, and under a bond. It would be a breach of faith if he did. But he ought to tell us broadly and generally why he has found that only fifteen out of the whole hundred are worthy ot increased duties. Are they making good wages, or are they paying bad ones? Are the 15 per cent, paying better wages and earning less than the 65 per cent, rejected ? The Minister could tell the House that. At least, he could tell us that these fifteen who are getting these duties are paying good wages, and are practically working their establishments under new Protection principles. In other words, it is upon the Minister to tell the House in a general way why "" some are taken and the others secrets in that procedure. But at present we have no information at all given to the Committee by the Minister, even after he has been able to go into all the ramifications oi the business of these men who consider themselves entitled to higher duties. We are told that importations are increasThe one hundred reing, but we are not told that the Minister, in out to what causes the increases are due. For instance, he should have analysed the Tariff to find out how much of the increased importations was due to prosperous times. In the next place, he should have told the Committee how much is due to shortness of labour. In my own State, the Labour Government appointed a Commissioner to inquire into that matter, and he reports that we want 3,500 artisans. If so is fair to assume that not fewer than 3,000 are required in Victoria. 1 suppose that that would represent a shortness of about 10,000 artisans in the whole of Australia. Does not that fact in itself almost account for these increased .importations? If not, is it not up to the Minister to show the House why not ? Ought he. not to tell us how much is due to shortness of artisan labour in the rest of the industries of Australia ? Then, again, while he is at it, he might very well investigate how far the importations arise from the labour troubles which are disturbwhich are leading people who would otherwise manufacture here to import instead. When he had made all these inquiries, and made all these allowances, he might tell us how much of the importations was. due to a defective Tariff.

He has not even told us that the duties which he is proposing to impose are for the purpose of protecting industries. In my opinion, the s or i o per cent, which he is holding out here and there will have no material effect, upon the imports which are coming in at the present time. In my judgment, it will further increase the revenue, if it does anything at all, and we shall find that the revenue derived from it will be very much larger than the estimate which has been given to the Committee by the honourable member for Illawarra. These are matters which we ought to have had some information about from the Minister. We should have been told how these importations are coming in, and the causes from which they arise-whethe r they arise from good times, from shortness of lahour. from lahour troubles, from a defective Tariff, or from all these things in combination.

I have made a few general observations on the subject, believing it to be my duty to make them, as I did before When my honourable friends proposed a Tariff without consideration, and without due care that the people that they specially represent here get their share of the benefits. Here is another opportunity for them to safeguard the interests of the. employees in these industries. But there is not a word about the But we have had an exnew Protection here. The Government say plainly that they cannot give it to the employees. But they proceed merrily along with a desire to confer further important protection upon the manufacturers of Australia. I hope that we shall deal with these items in Committee on their merits, trying to understand them as best we may; but we shall do it without knowledge, and we shall do it without understanding the bearing of these items upon other items in the Tariff. We shall do it further with a serious handicap, except there be first of all expert inquiry into all the ramifications of the industries, the wages paid, the extent of the industries, and the extent to which Protection is desired.

I find that the Minister of Trade and Customs was right in connection with the matter of the timber for fruit cases. I very much regret that he was rightI do not mean as between the honourable gentleman and myself-bu t as to the fact. I believe it is a fact that the Wood from which fruit cases are at present made is to be made dutiable. I understand that the duty is to be passed on in the shape of an extra charge of Jd. per case to the fruit-growers of New South"" Wales. This will be a clear tax upon men who are not receiving the benefit of any duty, and Whose industry is as hard pressed as any in the Commonwealth. However, this is one of the benefits they are to derive from the Tariff, but this is not the time to say any more about it. Once more I express the hope that, as suggested by the honourable member for Hunter, we shall be given time to consider the Estimates properly and fully, especially in view of the fact that our expenditure is leaping up by abnormal jumps to a point at which we shall have very soon to call a halt. I hope that when the Fusion party come face to face with my honourable friends opposite at the next election we shall be able to win without a resort to those tricks and devices. take this opportunity to bring under the notice of the Prime Minister the question of the establishment of the temporary Naval College. We are given to understand that sites at Geelong and other places have been inspected quite recently. I submitted to the Minister of Defence a site, at the mouth of the Shoalhaven River, in New South Wales, and 1 believe that Captain Chambers has 'been sent to inspect it. We are informed that the site at Geelong has been fully inspected, and that the Minister of Defence has given that particular site very favorable consideration. This is a matter of national importance, and I am glad to find that the Government, in the first instance, decided from the national point of view to establish the permanent Naval College on Federal territory. It appears that if the Geelong site for the temporary College is selected, a sum of £23,000 will to get a new have to be spent upon the buildings there to fit them for the purpose. It appears to me that if this sum has to be spent, and there is right alongside the proposed site for the permanent building a site whicli is quite as suitable for a temporary college as the site at Geelong, the Minister of Defence ought to give the matter very serious consideration. I think it is advisable that, in providing temporary accommodation, the money should be spent in such a position that, other things being equal, the improvements could, without difficulty, be removed to the permanent site for . the Naval College. buildings at the site to which the honourable member refers? fine building, which I believe would be quite as suitable as, from the descriptions I have heard, the building at Geelong.

In regard to the lads at Largs, I have a promise that the Department will try to make alterations at the beginning of the year, but during the last fortnight I have been informed that the boys are compelled to go by lonely farm roads to Hinton, which is some miles away. No provision has been made for drilling them in their own areas, although there is a considerable population. If the Government cannot see their way to get a sufficient number of instructors to drill the lads near their own places, they ought to exempt them. They will make the system unpopular if they do not attend to this matter at once. The parents will not be satisfied if the lads have to give up their time and walk some miles to the place of drill. The same thing applies to the boys at Miller's Forest, which, too, is a fanning district. They are compelled to go to Raymond Terrace to drill. The parents are taking exception to this action, and endeavouring to get it rectified. The Minister ought to take the matter into serious, consideration. It is a subject with which he cannot afford to play. He will find in the near future that the people will be up in arms against the system if proper facilities for drilling are not provided within steamers.

In my opinion, the time has long since passed when we should have had from the .Government a definite It happens pronouncement on this important matter. Under the Constitution we are supposed to undertake this branch of public policy. Both The Agents-General are doing the best they tan for tiieir States in advertising the resources of the Commonwealth; but a dead-lock has been reached. In London desirable immigrants by the thousands are ready to come to this continent, but no attempt is being made to provide ships to bring them here. It looks as though a good deal of paltering is taking place. I commend the Government for the admirable arrangement which they have made for the purchase of a site in London on which to erect public offices for the Commonwealth. But whilst it is proposed to spend £600,000 or £700,000 in providing a permanent and very desirable advertisement for the Commonwealth, the Government are making no attempt to do that which is even more essential to its prosperity, and that is to provide .the ships necessary to bring out the thousands of persons hi England who are awaiting transport.

At the same time, I think that they are afraid to move because the outside organizations which control their policy will not allow them to go in for a bigger scheme of introducing a desirable class of immigrants. true. struction which I can put upon their inaction. There never will be a more favorable time for the Government to undertake the important duty of assisting desirable persons to come to Australia. Money has been flowing freely into the Treasury, and a large surplus was shown in the last Budget statement. We have had magnificent seasons and abundant prosperity. Although everything has been favorable to the carrying out of a vigorous scheme of immigration, yet the Government have done nothing. Why? Simply because they have been afraid that the outside organizations which control their policy will not allow them to carry out what they believe to be necessary in the interests of the Commonwealth. The time has arrived when we ought to have from the Government a statement of their policy in respect of the Northern Territory. We shall have a further opportunity to discuss that question; but the enormous responsibility of settling the Territory can only be effectively met by laying upon a firm foundation a national policy in regard to it. There must be special legislation, and a special policy in respect of the Northern Territory. I rose particularly, however, to draw attention to the fact that the consideration of the imto be given an opportunity to learn what portant question of immigration is being put off by the Government from month to month. The people will show, by their votes at the next general election, that they do not endorse this systematic delay and this constant shirking of a most pressing responsibility. rise to complain of the replies that I have received to questions appertaining to important phases of administration. I recently put to the Minister of Home Affairs a question regarding applications that were [T5°] being invited from officers prepared to take charge of the Clerical and General Divisions of the Postmaster-General's Department. The replies I received were most evasive, and gave no information whatever. I inquired what duties these men would discharge, what position they would occupy, and with what section of the administration they were to be associated. When an honourable member puts a question to a Minister, he expects to receive a direct, and not a deceptive, answer. It is time that we should demand replies in keeping with the questions put to Ministers. Some little time the Postmaster-General regarding the cost of the re-adjustment of certain aerial cables in the metropolitan area of Sydney. The reply was in part a denial that any readjustment had taken place; in regard to another phase of the question there was a partial admission; and in reply to yet another a full admission was made. Foreign matter, however, was introduced that had nothing to do with the question raised. I was informed that cables were being laid underground in the district referred to, and it was also admitted that some of the serial cables had been lowered. I wanted to show that, owing to the fault of some one, many miles of serial cables had been so. erected in the metropolitan area of Sydney that they were chafing and wearing out at every pole. The fact that they were suggested imperfect work for which some one was to blame, and so far as I could judge by watching the men at work the re-adjustment cost nearly as much as the re-erection of these cables would have cost. I put a question to the Minister with a view of ascertaining whether public money was being wasted, owing to inefficiency on the part of some official, but the reply simply evaded my question. If we are to have some semblance of correct government, and if honourable members are they have a right to know as to how public money is. being expended, direct replies to honest questions must be given. We need direct replies, rather than what I may call the professional answers to questions which seem to be part and parcel of every Department. Scarcely any question is replied to in a straightforward and honest manner. I complain of the manner in which replies are made to questions put, not only by myself, but by other honourable members.

I believe that a strong defence policy for this country is the correct policy, and I am here to back it up. If , however, we do not do the work well, we are simply wasting money.

This has been done in many cases, and it ought to be done in this. I am not sure that it is a matter of such urgency as the honourable member for Nepean has represented, that the Federal Government should resume this land for a manceuvre area. I happen to know the country very well, having manoeuvred troops over it for a good many years in succession. In my opinion, it is not a very suitable place for manoeuvring purposes. over, as a military man, I am rather opposed to the idea of having any fixed area over which to manceuvre troops. The effect of manoeuvring men over the same area year after year is that officers, such as myself, come to know the country intimately. Then it becomes merely a question of the officers The who are taking part in a tactical scheme in opposing forces trying to get possession of commanding positions. The matter resolves itself into a scramble for these positions. The officers know exactly what is going to happen. I have taken part in many schemes over this area, and, in common with all the other officers, I was perfectly well aware that if we obtained certain positions we should have the enemy beaten. worse thing that happens is that the troops are bitten by mosquitoes? bad; but we could put up with that evil if we were learning anything. have been manoeuvred over a different area each year during the last few years. ference to having any fixed place for I think that when the troops are brought together at Easter, or any other time, the best thing is to have a, march'or trek. It would be very much more instructive to divide the Force into two sections, letting them go into camp 50 miles apart. Then they could march and meet as opposing Forces. The different arms their baggage and paraphernalia, and the march 'would be of some practical use. It would be the sort of work that would have to be done in war time. The men would be gaining practical experience. If we are unable to do what is required in in war-time? To my mind the site of the manceuvre area at Liverpool is not an urgent matter. I should like to know what has become of the motions which appeared upon the business-paper in favour of granting pensions to the officers and men of our Defence Force, and in respect of military pay and allowances. I thought that the Government would have made some move in connection with these matters, but I find that they have done absolutely nothing. Our forces to-day are underpaid, as compared with persons who are emplo5'ed in civil Morevocations.

We have in the Permanent Forces men who must enter it when they are young, and who should remain there. But under existing conditions these men are turned out nothing to look forward to. To urge that we do not want men to make a profession of soldiering is absolutely ridiculous. Our Permanent Forces must make a profession of it, if they are to be successful. But these forces are not receiving the encouragement which they should receive, and, consequently, they cannot become an example to the great force which we propose to raise under our compulsory training system. honourable member for Wilmot appears to be very anxious about the selection of a site for the temporary Naval College, and, in this connection, he referred to an article which was published in the Age the other day.

I have every sympathy with the honourable member for Nepean, at a. certain age, and have who I know has a large number of constituents who are being badly treated in connection with this matter. When I was Minister of Home AffairsI brought this question up to the stage of completion. Unfortunately, the Government of which I was a member were compelled to leave office just at that time, and I have never been able to understand what has since blocked the acquisition of the area. But the statement which has been read by the honourable member for Nepean has explained the position. It shows that the Government of New South Wales have determined not to permit the Commonwealth to acquire the site for military purposes until the whole question of transferred properties has been settled. The Wade Government did not take up that attitude. On the contrary, they assisted me iri every possible way.
