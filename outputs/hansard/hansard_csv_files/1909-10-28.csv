CASE OF MR. QUIRK-TELEPHON E LIST : the honourable member for Kennedy, oh behalf of the honourable member' for Newcastle, asked the following question :1. Whether he will lay upon the Library table all papers in connection with the. case of Mr Quirk, postmaster, of Parramatta. New South Wales? 2. Who was responsible for issuing the forms to postmasters under Regulation 40 during the past twelve months? An interim reply was given, and I now iur.nish specific answers. They are these1. Papers have been laid on the Library table. 2. Forms arc not issued to postmasters under Regulation 40-submittin g to thc jurisdiction of the Deputy Postmaster-General, Any communication addressed to an officer charged under Public Service Regulation 40 is done under the instruction of the Deputy Postmaster-General. On the same day the honourable member for 1. Is it a fact that No. 24 of Telephone Regulations provides for one entry for every telephone connecting with the Exchange to be inserted once free of charge in each issue of the Telephone List? a. Is he aware that subscribers to several country exchanges have their names, & c , inserted in the Sydney Telephone List in addition to appearing in the local country pamphlets ? 3. Is any charge made for these additional entries ? 4. W ill he consider the advisability of entering the whole of the names of subscribers to country exchanges in the Sydney list as is done in Melbourne, and thereby dispense with the country pamphlets? Onljr the first question was answered, and inquiries were promised in respect of the others.^ I have now been supplied w it h the following information:2. Yes. The names of subscribers to twelve country exchanges appear under their respective exchange headings in the metropolitan list. Theexchanges referred to are those having trunk line communication with Sydney. 3. No charge is made for the additional entries. ' 4. Owing to the"" extensive area of the State and consequent inability of more than a few only of the 7,000 odd country exchange subscribers lo communicate with the metropolis, it is not considered desirable to incur the expense of printing one general list for distribution among all subscribers (numbering 25,000 odd), as a large proportion of the contents would be useless to most country subscribers. being carried out by the Department of the Postmaster-General, published to-day, the TO GEELONG telephone line from .

The official report of the honourable member's remarks has since been published. I find that he said thatIn February last a deputation of importers waited upon the then Minister of Trade and Customs, the honourable member for Yarra, and asked him to admit to Australia an explosive made, by black labour, by the De Beers Explosive Company, of South Africa, and which, if admitted, would come into competition with Australian explosives, made by white labour. As I said when the matter, was first mentioned by the honourable member for Cono,. no such permission was given by me, nor was there any need to ask for permission. No deputation of importers waited on me with any request of the kind. The facts are these: About the beginning of last November, it was reported in Queensland that explosives manufactured by black labour,. which could therefore be sold cheaply, were being imported into the State.

13,Mr Tud Or (Yarra) [Z.37],"rO n lastpress, but, although I ' caused inquiries to be made, I could not find that explosives -had come to Australia from South Africa. As a safeguard, however, the following circular was issued by the Department:-Confidential. For guidance of omcers only. Inquiry re Explosives from Cape Explosives Company, said to be "" dumped."" It is alleged that the Cape Explosives Company is sending to Australia explosives at unfairly low prices, and representations have been made -to the effect that the company referred to is """"dumping"" its goods in Australia. The Collector is therefore instructed to have inquiries made as to the truth of the allegations, -and report the result. A statement showing the invoice values of the Cape Explosives Company's explosives, as compared with others imported, should also be forwarded. Early in December, an inquiry was held : in Melbourne, with a view to ascertaining whether any of the goods had come to .Australia, and, if so, at what rates; and tlie result was published in the press, not only in Melbourne, but in Svdney. Further on in his speech, the honourable member for Corio said:Evidently the importers of the South African black labour-made explosive thought it could be kept out, or they would not have asked for < which has works in Glasgow, and other parts -of the world, and whose importations come into -competition with the productions of the Deer Park factory here, has at no time employed -coloured labour in any of its works. quently, the permission given by the honourable member for Yarra was a blow at both an Australian industry and white labour generally. He -said at the time that he had no authority to keep -out this black labour product, but that was after 'he had given permission for its importation. I never gave permission for the impor.tation. When the matter was brought beThe prices do not appear in the press refore me as Minister, I had an inquiry port, but they did appear in the report made, the result of which appears in the which was placed on the Library tableDepartmental file, which, at the request of the honourable member for Corio, was Explosives laid on the Library table. On the 27th the Australian market, the above-named exploMav the honourable member asked the folsives have been ofiered by the combination at lowing question:W ill the Minister of Trade and Customs have -placed in the Library the papers connected with the importation of explosives made by the South African Manufacturing Company? To that I replied-I shall be pleased to have the whole of the information collected by the Department placed -on the table of the Library. Included in the file is a lengthy statement, part of which is confidential, and did not -appear in the press. The information that was supplied to the press was published in the Age, as follows:The report upon which the Minister based his ^decision is the outcome of ' communications with Mr F. M . Dickenson, of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company, with reference to the agreement made between the company and the "" offending"" South African company, the Cape Explosives Works Limited, of Somerset West, Cape Colony, for the supply by the latter of explosives. Mr W. Knox, M.P;, of Messrs; Knox, Schlapp, and Company, who have been appointed agents in the Commonwealth for the company, and Mr J. R. Grimmer, the Cape Explosives Company's representatives from South Africa, were present at an interview which the writer of the report had with Mr Dickenson. It was explained to him that the information of the Cape Explosives Company was "" due to the excessive charges made by Nobel's Company for explosives used by the mining companies in South Africa, and at the present time the Cape Explosives Works, under an agreement, supplies half the quantity of explosives used by the South African mines, the other half being supplied by Nobel's, whose factory is situated at Modder Fonte, the total quantity being over 600,000 cases per annum."" The writer of the report proceeds :In reply to a question as to the respective prices of the explosives sold by Nobel's and enson informed me that the prices paid to Nobel's fbr explosives delivered at the mines at BrokenH ill from the United Kingdom for the year ended 31st July, 1908, were as follows :Per case. -permission to import it. The Nobel Company, Blasting Gelatine ... ... 47/6 Gelignite ... ... ... 34/ . For the period from ist August, 1908, to end of February, 1909,. Nobel's prices are :Per case. ConseBlastingGelatine ... ... 67/6 Gelignite ... ... ... 50/ and an indication was given that at the expiration of twelve months .from ist August, 1908, a further rise of ios. per case might be expected. Up to as recently as September, 1908, the combination quoted the following prices, and for yearly contracts only . . . . but Mr Dickenson states that since the Cape Works Limited decided, to come to much lower figures than those quoted above, and he believes that contracts could now be made with them, extending over a term of five years, at the following prices :Per case. Blasting gelatine, about ... 52/ Gelignite, about ... ... 38/6 The following comparison will show at a glance the respective .cost of tbe two explosives named delivered at the BrokenH ill mines :Nobel's.

'.It appears that the Nobel Company are the largest employers of coloured labour, and pay the lowest wages. When the honourable member for Corio was speaking, 1 interjected that I had not given the permission .alleged; and on the; 21st December the honourable member wrote to me as follows:W ill you please reconsider your decision re admitting the explosives of the Cape Explosives . Company on the following grounds :1. It ""employs black labour very extensively. 2. The Australian Explosives Company of Deer Park imports no explosives or material made by black labour. 3. It employs white m'en only on good wages and fair hours. 4. Its price is already affected by the threatened importations. According to the Hansard report, the honourable member stated that it was in FebruaryI gave permission for the importation; but I do not know whether he really said that; and if he altered the report, it would not be for the first time. In December, two months before he alleged I gave permission-which , by the way, would -not be required-h e wrote to me, asking me to reconsider the matter; and I replied on the following dayIn reply to your note of 21st inst. on the subject of the Cape Explosives Company, I fear the facts at present at my disposal would not justify any decision other than that already .arrived at. There is no law in existence which prohibits, excepting prison-made goods, the importation into Australia of goods the product of black or other cheap labour, and there is no evidence, so far as I ami aware, which brings the particular goods in question within the provisions of the Australian Industries Preservation Act. The honourable member wrote the next day, thanking me for my letter, and addingThe law in existence which prohibits the im portation into Australia of goods the product of cheap or black labour is the Australian Industries Preservation Act 1906, No. 9, section iS a, c, and d, and the fact that the importer's agent sought your consent first shows that they themselves suspected the illegality of their action and that your Department would uphold the .labour rates in the Australian Mr Tudor. If you want evidence that the cheap labour, of the Cape Explosives Company will (section. 18c) "" probably result in an inadequate remuneration for labour in an Australian industry,"" I will see that you have plenty of evidence from, 357 ... 370 the Australian Explosives Company and its em600 ... 1,258 ployes; but the probability of such result is s. d. £ s. d. so obvious and economically certain that 1 anv 1 sure the agents of the Cape Explosives Company were simply astounded at youi decision, in their favour. 2 19 10.1 I gave no decision in their favour, because I was never asked to give a decision. In order, however, to be perfectly sure that the provisions of the AustralianIndustries Preservation Act were not being contravened, I sent the matter on to the Attorney-General .for his opinion, a copy of which I have here. I will not read the whole of it, but in the course of it the Attorney-General saysSection'19 of the Australian Industries Preservation Act enables the Comptroller-Generaf. to take action for the prevention, of dumping: whenever he has received a complaint in writing, and has reason to believe that -goods are being imported into Australia with intent todestroy or injure any Australian industry by their sale or disposal in Australia in unfair competition with any Australian goods. "" Unfair competition"" is to a certain extent defined by sections 17 and 18. By section 17, it is limited to competition with those Australian industries, the preservation of which is advantageous to the Commonwealth, having due regard to the interests of producers, workers, and consumers. By section 18 competition is deemed to be unfair, unless the contrary is proved, in certain cases; amongst others, if the competition would probably result in an inadequate remuneration for labour in the Australian industry, or in creating substantial disorganization in Australian industry, or throwing workers out of employment. In order .to form an opinion as to whether the competition could be considered as unfair within the meaning of these provisions, it would be necessary to inquire into the facts as to the size of the Australian industry, and as to the interests of producers, workers, and consumers. But in order to bring the case within the Act, it is necessary to show, not only that the competition is unfair, but also that the goods are imported with intent to destroy or injure ar» Australian industry by the unfair competition. In the Attorney-General's opinion, there is nothing in the papers to suggest any such intent. On the other hand, the intent seems to be, so far as can be ascertained, to compete with the Nobel Company, and restore the prices of explosives to a normal level. (Signed). R. R. GARRAN, Secretary, Attorney-General's Department. The honourable member for Corio statedThehonorable member for Yarra asks how he could have stopped this importation.. He did"" not consider or refer to that side of the matter when replying to the deputation from the Miners' Association. ' But this is my reply, as shown in the Deindustry. partmental papersa copy of which I have not the slightest 'doubt was among the House on one occasion, and deliberately papers laid on the table of the Library altered his Hansard proof to make it apat the request of the honourable member pear that he said something altogether for CorioThe Minister in reply to the deputation said ber stated that I did not consider or refer that under the Tariff no prohibition ""could be to one aspect of the matter when replying placed on goods being imported into Australia to the deputation from the Miners' Associa^ simply because 'they were the product of black tion, but any honourable member can see labour. It appeared from the statistical classifront the official document that I did refer fication that the principal countries of origin of the explosives which were imported into Austo it. tralia were Great Britain, Sweden, and Gerwhether a political opponent of mine or many. There was an explosive factory at Deer not, except, perhaps, the honourable memPark, and as far as he knew they made most ber for Corio, will do me the credit of of this sort of explosive. He thought it an encouraging sign of the times to find the desire believing that I would have done my utso much in evidence to use goods made by white most, if I possibly could, to prevent'ex labour. He regretted that he could not place plosives made by black labour from conv any prohibition oh goods made by black labour ing in ; but as every honourable member, exoutside the Commonwealth, and he thought they cept again the honourable member for Corio, should do their utmost to see that the explosives were made here. The honourable member for Corio must have read those papers, and in common fairness, before trying to attack me, he ought to have admitted that I did make that reply. I informed the Government Whip of my intention to leply to-day to the honourable member's statements, and I have no doubt that the Whip informed him of the fact, but the honourable member has sneaked"" out, instead of waiting here to hear what I had to say. was that he was perfectly indifferent as left Cape Town, per s.s.

In fact, I doubt whether will be seen that if the first shipment left some of the things which appear in the the Cape on that date, and any permission Hansard report of his speech were stated for their landing here was required-al by. him in the House, because this would though, as I have stated, it was' not renotbe the first time that the honourable quired-that permission would ""riot, have member had doctored his Hansard speech. been given by me, but by my predecessor, able member must not say that of any send word to Cape Town that the Roods member of the House.

20,,"Mr TUDORHe stated, time after time, in his speech, that 1 had given permission for the goods to be landed, when he knew full well that no permission was required. If permission had been required, every other honourable member in the House knows that I should not have granted it. I did not raise this question as a matter of personal explanation, as I could have done any day during the past three weeks, but waited for this opportunity on grievance day, because I desired to give the honourable member as fair and full an opportunity to reply as I had. The honourable member could have replied to me to-day on this motion without asking permission to make a personal ex^ P'lanation, but he tells the Government Whip that it does not matter to himwhat r say. Personally, before I would go out of my way to slander a political opponent as the honourable member has done, I would retire from public life altogether. The honasked to pass yet another before the sesorable member has made misstatements in 'Order to gain a little .political capital. It is disgraceful that an honourable memTjer should make such statements, and then absent himself from the House when, he. knows that a reply is to be made by the man whom he has attempted to misrepresent. I desire to bring under the notice of the Government, and more particularly the Postmaster-General, the fact that for two -or three years there has been a growing -congestion of business in connection with the Post and Telegraph Department, and an inability, owing to the want of an increased staff, to deal with the accumulated work thrust upon it. A little while ago the Postmaster-General informed the House that provision was made on this year's Estimates for a largely increased staff to enable the difficulty to be overcome, and said tliat arrangements ""were being made to carry out a large number of works which had been approved, but remained in abeyance pending the provision of the necessary funds. In New South VVales, and .1 presume that the position is the same throughout the Commonwealth, these works, instead of-being expedited, are still largely at a standstill. .When honourable members make representations in regard to any of them to the Deputy Postmaster General, they receive the stereotyped reply that the works have been approved, but, ow.ing to want of funds, they cannot be taken in hand, and they must wait their turn. I find that practically the whole of these new works are^ing, held up because the Estimates-in-Chief have not yet been passed. One of the causes of the delay is the want of a sufficiently large supervising staff. The Estimates-in-Chief provide for an increased staff, but until they are passed the hands of the Deputy Postmaster-General and his responsible officers are tied. This condition of affairs is detrimental to the efficiency of the Department. The officers are doing their best to carry on under the old conditions, which ought not to obtain. It is unreasonable that they should, but, until the Estimates-in-Chief are passed, and more money is made available, this unsatisfactory position must continue. The Government have asked us this session to pass two or three Supply Bills, and, having regard to tlie way in which business is being transacted, in all probability we shall be sion closes. Such measures do not provide for any substantial enlargement of the existing staffs. In the early stages of the session the Government introduced an Appropriation (Works and Buildings) Bill, which was passed on the' understanding that the works for which it provided would be taken in hand at once; but, owing to the want of a larger supervising staff, a considerable proportion of them are held up. Nearly half the present financial year has gone, and the result of this delay will be that the Department will be asked to increase its staff -to take on new men who 1 must undergo a certain amount of training to fit themselves for their duties-and to carry out these works in six months, or perhaps less. The natural outcome will be that at the end of the financial year a large number of new works, for which provision has been made, will remain untouched, and the votes in respect of them will lapse. We shall have a continuation of. the deplorable state of affairs that has existed for years, which has led to the disorganization of the Department, and given rise to a considerable amount of justifiable dissatisfaction and discontent on the part of the public. Now that the weakness has been discovered and admitted by the Government, the remedy should be applied. The remedy is to be found either, in makingspecial provision for increasing the supervising staff in the next Supply Bill, or in passing the Estimatesin-Chief without further delay. Another point' to be remembered is that it is only",18,Official Offices Telephones I N Hotels Divisions Use Of Rope D Enclosure Cigarette Smoking Miners Accident Fund Newcastl E Naval Brigade Persona L Explana

If that is so, it is not of the Department. VVe should encourage our officers to increase their efficiency by rewarding them reasonably, instead of setting up insuperable barriers against promotion. It is stated, too, that the managers of the General Despatch rooms prefer men who have been trained under them to new men who have not acquired the necessary technical proficiency, and are unfamiliar with the work. This operates against the transfer of able and capable men who desire practical knowledge in order to pass the test. I ami informed by those competent to judge that a man cannot hope to acquire the technical knowledge and experience necessary with less than sixty days' constant work, and that it is practically impossible for him to secure ance, and so forth, the net rental cannot be that knowledge outside unless he is a man of great natural ability, able to devote much of his time to the task. The Department claims that facilities are afforded inasmuch as men are allowed, in their own time, to do sorting work at the head office, with cards supplied for the purpose, but, although. that is something, it is not sufficient to meet all cases. The arrangement imposes unfair and unreasonable conditions on good-.men, though, of course, if this knowledge were absolutely necessary for the work to be done in the future, something might be said in its favour. As a matter of fact; however, a man, after he passes the examination, may have no more direct connection with the work referred to, and I "" see .no reason why the position could not be met by an examination in the special work he -will be called upon to perform. Why should the work of one particular branch be selected as the test for the whole of the other branches? I ask the Postmaster-General to go into the matter carefully, and see whether or not the constant complaints are well-grounded, and, if so, devise some method for the removal of the disabilities. "" [381-I am sorry to have to bring for2 ward a grievance connected 'with the administration of the Old-age Pensions Act. Hitherto, I have always been able to get redress from the officials in any cases of hardship brought under my notice, because, while carrying out The view is held bywhat they consider to be the law, they have been actuated by feelings of humanity. A rase has arisen, however, in which I find it impossible to obtain that justice which is so eminently desirable in a matter of this creditable to ithe administration kind. I am certain that, when the measure was under consideration, it was never intended that in assessing a pension, such' a deduction as that to which I desire to call attention should be made. This is the case of a man and his wife who, though -not legally separated, do not live together, owing, it is said, to the old man being fidgety, or something of that sort. Prior to the separation, the man was receiving a pension of ios. per week, and some months after they had agreed to live apart, the wife applied for a pension. Her application disclosed the fact that she. possessed a house, which at present is let at 8s. per week. A commission of sixpence a week has to be paid to an agent for collecting the rent j and, if we allow for rates, insurmore than 5s. a week. The officials capitalized the value of this house at ,£250, and I may say that the municipal assessment is £ 1 6 a year. The .officials read the Act as meaning that if a man and his wife are living together in a house which does not produce income, allowance is made up to a value of £100, and, exceeding that, sum, the pension is reduced by £ 1 a year for every £ 1 0 . If , however, the couple are separated, and do not live in the house, it is regarded as revenue-producing, and the value allowed is only £ 2 5 per year each, so that in this way the old people lose another £ 5 a year from their pensions. When the Bill was under consideration, none of us had an idea that people could live cheaper in lodgings than in their own house; arid I do not see why such a couple as I have in my mind should be penalized. The circumstances may be such that the old people could not live by themselves in their own house, and if they go to live with relatives and friends, then they must lose a portion of the pension. torian Act, the property was taken possession of by the State. could not say one-tenth as much in condemnation of the Victorian Act as I could.",20,Official Offices Telephones I N Hotels Divisions Use Of Rope D Enclosure Cigarette Smoking Miners Accident Fund Newcastl E Naval Brigade Persona L Explana

26,Mr Mathews,"The TreasurerIn Victoria, there was not an old-age pension, but a charity dole thrown at the old people; it was a system we can regard only with horror, and as a matter of fact it was only a sop to close the mouths of some people with democratic leanings, and was so unreasonable that only 16 per cent, of those eligible received pensions. We, as representatives, told the people of. Australia that the Federal Act was to be a real Old-age Pensions Act, with beneficent and common-sense administration; and, though laymen are prone to err in the interpretation of the law, I am sure it was never intended that there should be such anomalies as that to which I am calling attention. Minister could, of his own volition, put this matter right. It is not for us to say that the old couple should live together, and thus get rid of the difficulty, because we know that incompatibility of temper sometimes keeps very excellent persons apart. is a single man, and really does not understand these cases; but we may be sure that it was never intended that pensioners should be penalized in this way. All who have to do with small suburban properties know that the municipal assessments vary. A very comfortable home can be found for two aged people on a little property, 14 or 15 miles from Melbourne, where land is cheap, for £100. But what a hovel you would get for that price in any of the dearer parts of Melbourne or its suburbs! It is provided that £ 1 per annum shall be deducted from the pension for every £ 1 0 in value over ;£ioo. A cottage that brings in 8s. per week in a suburb of Melbourne is not worth ,£250 as an investment. . Eight shillings per week is a fair return from the property stand-point, but the life of these houses is not great, and a certain amount has to be set apart every year as a sinking fund to meet depreciation. From that point of view, an assessment of £250 in the case to which I have referred is too high. The peculiar feature of the case is that the Act is being administered in a way which encourages people to deceive us, and get rid of their property before applying for pensions. In the questions that are put to applicants, they are asked whether they have got rid of property in order to become entitled to the pension, yet at the same time we try to force them to do the very thing to which we object. with the whole subject. provision in the Act which gives the Minister a certain discretion. tion is given to the Commissioner. will look it up. I wish to emphasize my contention that it is inhuman to penalize old people because they feel that their tempers will not allow them to live together. Parliament, in passing the Act, never intended to penalize them for My own opinion is that the living apart, assuming that they have led, and are leading, moral lives. The remarkable thing is that the Act as it stands puts those who have been formally separated by a decree in a better position than those who are simply living apart from one another. Surely we do not want to niake the difference between them so Unfortunately, the Commissioner wide that they cannot come together again ? We ought not to penalize them in order to bring them together again, but, at the same time, we should not prevent them from being reconciled. With regard to assessing the capital value of properties, it must be remembered that there are valuers and valuers. Some municipalities have valuers who do their duty, and assess properties to the full amount, but' in other municipalities, the assessment is kept well below the full value, for many reasons. In some cases, the councillors are large pro perty holders themselves, and consider that they have been elected to look after the in terests of house owners. They, therefore, desire to keep the municipal taxation down as low as possible, and one way of doing that is to keep the valuations down. Consequently, a man might suffer in one municipality, and gain in another, and the Department ought to have a better method of arriving at the capitalized value than by simply taking the municipal valuations. No Parliament, in imposing a tax upon property, would take the municipal valuations as a basis. Assessing the house in question at £ 1 8 a year, we might capitalize it in twenty years. That would make it ^360. The Department have not done that, but have made the valuation considerably lower, but any house agent or property owner knows that it would not bring £ 1 2 0 if put into the market to-morrow. Capitalizing it at twelve years would bring it out at .£200, yet the Department assess it a t £ 5°2 A difference of ,£50 in the",21,Official Offices Telephones I N Hotels Divisions Use Of Rope D Enclosure Cigarette Smoking Miners Accident Fund Newcastl E Naval Brigade Persona L Explana

The employto extend some consideration to these men, and I do so as one who supported the present Prime Minister when he introduced legislation to impose high duties upon imports, and .assured the Parliament that the workers in local industries would receive a share of that Protection. These men spent money on litigation, believing that Parliament would support them, and 1 urge the Government to do something for them to-day. The making of this concession will not be detrimental to the Government, nor will it be beneficial to the Opposition from a political stand-point. I should not have taken advantage of this opportunity of bringing the claim under the notice of the House had I been able to secure attention for it privately. But I knew that there would be no ""chance of a motion standing in the name of a private member being discussed during the present session. Surely the Government must agree with me that the men have not been treated fairly. If , on consideration, Ministers do not recognise the strength of the claim, I shall feel that they are wanting in a sense of justice. I might bring forward precedents for what I "" am proposing; I might show the Government that they would not in any way be lowering their dignity by granting the request; I might show them that no' harm would be done to any section of the community. But I doubt whether arguments on those lines would change the minds of those who are responsible. I appeal specially to the Minister of Home Affairs, who was in opposition at the time the Act in question was passed, and ask him to use his influence to have a sum.placed on the Supplementary Estimates to meet the expenses of these men.

I believe that the police in New South Wales visit the stations once a month if not oftener. It surely ought not to be necessary to compel old persons to travel to the offices once in three months. [4.20] I also have a small matter in relation"" to the administration of the Old-age Pensions Act to bring under the notice of the Treasurer. Jt seems that some magistrates in country districts are rather severe in their interpretation of the Act. A case that has been brought under my attention is that of a miner who has spent his life in endeavouring to make a living on the mining fields. He has spent many arduous years ir» prospecting, often working for years at a time without much remuneration. This old man was so independent and self reliant that he did not apply for an old age pension when he reached the age of sixty-five. He continued to operate on the old lines with the little strength that remained to him. JBut Nemesis overtook him at last, and he found that he had overtaxed his powers. He was smitten by rheumatism, and was forced to apply for the pension. He had to travel a distance of something like 20 miles to appear before a registrar. Then, for reasons which I will explain, his application was refused. As is well known to some honourable members, in mining life many old people have a peculiar method of doctoring themselves. They do not have recourse to drugs or medicines, but once every few years they think that it is a good thing for them to take a little spirits. Consequently it is not unusual to find such an old man as this the worse for liquor every now and then. Many old miners, after a long spell of .work, will pay up all their debts, and then have a little spree with what is left.

But I do know of cases in which old-age pensioners who have been addicted to drink have become almost total abstainers as a result of receivabout to happen to them. All I claim ing the pension. They have consideredmanly old chaps as they are-that they had no right to draw a Government pension and spend the money on drink. The system which we have inaugurated has actually reformed them and straightened them up. But there are people who go to absolute extremes in respect to the drink question. Sometimes an extreme teetotaller is as bad as a drinker; at any rate, teetotallers often need to exercise more toleration in their judgments. in anything; and when a magistrate refuses a pension to an old man because he has had a glass or two of liquor, I rebel. The administration of the Act should be tempered with a little mercy. A magistrate should say in such a case as I am dealing with, "" If I recommend you for this pension, will you guarantee that you will leave off drinking? Will you keep sober?"" the magistrate recommend the pension, and then, if the old fellow is so idiotic as to ""go on the booze,"" he deserves to lose his pension. But the old man in the case I am referring to is not a ""boozer."" get his pension if he were? the matter from the Christian stand-point, we should give according to a man's needs. The urgency of an applicant's requirements ought to be sufficient ground for his claim. I should like to bring under the notice eliminated from the B ill . assistance.

They are so unused to authority that when they stand before a magistrate they fear that something extraordinary is is that the Act should be administered more sympathetically. Is it not possible for the Treasurer to instruct magistrates to take a lenient view of the claims ot applicants, unless they have been convicted of certain offences? The old man to whom I have alluded is not a chronic drunkard. But it often happens that men living in the bush are prone to deny themselves the necessaries of life, so that they are .not in that splendid bodily vigour which would enable them to speedily throw off I do not believe in extremes the effects of drink. Thus they may be considered drunk upon two or threeglasses of beer, whereas the man about town may be able to imbibe twenty-three glasses without exhibiting any ill effects.. I claim, too, that miners as a. class are deserving of special consideration, inasmuch as they, pay a very large share of taxation-more , indeed, than does any other section of the Let community. In such circumstances ought they to be treated in the shabby manner in which this old man has been treated ?

In our own Act that provision does not appear. But I think experience in New South Wales-and indeed our own experience-ha s shown how very unjust it is to adopt that basis in computing the pension to which an applicant is entitled. A man may have earned a certain sum last year, but since then his health may have entirely broken down. In such circumstances he may not have the remotest chance of earning anything during the ensuing twelve months. tunate during the previous year, it is assumed that he will be equally fortunate the following year. men in all conditions of life proves that no more fallacious basis upon which to determine their earnings could be adopted. Take the case of the Treasurer and of myself. Swan is a Minister of the Crown, and I am a member of Parliament, but next year he may not be a Minister of the Crown, and I may not be a member of Parliament. of a man who, although he is sixty-six years of age, had until recently ^worked without intermission all his life. year prior to that in which he applied to the New South Wales Government for an old-age pension he was fortunate enough to obtain employment under the "" old and slow "" workers' clause in a certain trade, in which his wages amounted to 30s. a week. months. When he applied for an old-age pension he was told that, owine to the amount which he had earned during the previous year, he was not entitled to any pension during the following year. That principle is now being adopted under our own Act, and I protest against it , especially as the Treasurer has power to prevent its adoption if he chooses to exercise it . The right honourable gentleman says that there is nothing to prevent any person who feels aggrieved because his pension has been reduced from appealing to the Commissioner. there is nothing in the Act which justifies the Commissioner in assuming that an applicant for an old-age pension will earn during the current year an amount equal to that which he earned during the previous year. very opposite is most probable. cases a man applies for an old-age pension, not because he has reached sixty-five years of age, but because he realizes the necessity of applying for it . Thank God, there are many able-bodied men in the community who are over sixty-five years of age, but who, under ordinary circumstances, would not dream of applying for a pension. At the same time it is undeniable that the slightest misfortune might compel them to adopt that course. As a man becomes older his chance of getting employment decreases. the honourable member. in his sixty-sixth yearwill earn as much as he did in his sixty-fifth year is Now, experience of ridiculous. I contend that an old-age pensioner ought not to be compelled to appeal to the Commissioner to review the estimate of his income. Rather should his income be assessed upon his earnings. I admit The right honourable member for that you cannot tell what a man will earn. A man earns a certain amount; he goes up for his pension every fortnight; and if after a given time he has earned more, he cannot get his I wish now to cite the case pension, and there is an end of it. But it is wrong to say to a man that, no matter what he earns this year, the Department The will only grant him a .pension according to his earnings in the previous year. Let me state the case of a man who ought to have been entitled to a pension of £ 2 6 , but who received a pension of only , £ 4 . In the previous year, he had earned an amount' which, if it had been earned in the followHis employment lasted seven ing year, would have entitled him to a pension of only , £ 4 ; but during that year, he did not earn a fraction of a penny.

Besides, who is aggrieved, and it is mv duty, quiteto take charge of a semi-official post-office, the practice is to insert in the Gazette and daily' press an advertisement calling for nominations for the position of postmistress. My attention has been called to a. number of these cases, and I find that it is practically impossible for persons who have not been connected with the Department to secure an appointment. It seems that the Department keeps a list of the names and qualifications of postmasters' widows who have been left in impecunious circumstances, and who have acquired a certain amount of Departmental experience in assisting their husbands, and that whenever any positions have to be filled, the widows on this list are given a prior claim over other applicants. particularly about this course of procedure, but, whenever a vacancy is advertised, a number of very capable and qualified women each send in an application, but they have no hope of getting an appointment because of the number of postmasters' widows who are awaiting preferential treatment. up their State representatives, who in turn communicate with the Federal representatives, or the applicants themselves communicate directly with their Federal representatives. ber to his constituents that he should make proper inquiries and the exact position. In each case, however, the time of the applicant and myself has been wasted. call for applications for positions which are really not open to persons other than postmasters' widows. I suggest to the Minister of Home Affairs that the .vacancies should not be advertised, or, if advertised, that there should be a statement that -postmasters' widows will have a preference over other applicants. Sir Public Service Act provides that any vacancies must be advertised. Mr J. H . CATTS tion ought to be disclosed in the advertisement calling for applications, and then persons other than postmasters' widows would not waste their time or request persons to push their applicatigns. A number of these cases have been brought under my notice, and I have gone to a good deal of trouble to ascertain what the position of -the applicants was. I do not object to having to do work of this kind, because I am always willing to do what I can for my constituents,, it being part of my business to attend to their interests. But much inconvenience is caused, and a great deal of time wasted, by asking members of the public to lodge applications for positions to which they are not at all likely to be appointed. I do not think that vacancies should be advertised unless there is some chance of members of the public being appointed to them. Should their advertisement be necessary, to comply with the 55 law, it should be indicated that preference will be given to those already in the service, or, as in this case, to widows of postmasters needing employment. .

CATTS I do not remember them now, and my copy of the statement is amongst my papers in Sydney. I think that we ought to receive replies to communications which affect the interests of our constituents. master-General) [5.29] I desire to make a brief reference to two complaints which I think require some reply or explanation. The first complaint was made by the honourable member for Calare, to the effect that certain public works, such as telephones, telegraphs, and exchanges authorized by .Parliament to be carried out in New South Wales were at a standstill, or were not being properly or expeditiously prosecuted, owing to shortage in staff, and so on. It is a fact that, as the result of years of economy, the staff in New South Wales and other States has been for a long time undermanned. Provision is made on the Estimates of the current year for increasing the staff in New South Wales to the number of over 600, and increasing the staff in the various States, altogether to the number of 1,400. I am advised that whenthese increases have been authorized by Parliament, and made in accordance with the authority of law, the efficiency of the postal, telegraphic, and telephonic services will be greatly increased and placed upon a very satisfactory footing. Among the officers required are men to exercise supervision in the construction of public works, such as overseers, gangers, and linemen. There is a shortage of men of that description in the staffs of most of . the States. Unfortunately, my hands are tied. I cannot make the appointments until the House has authorized them by passing the necessary vote. The honourable member asks why I do not provide for them in the Supply. Bills, but I could not do that., since, the works, so as to absorb the vote within In accordance with the practice of the House, Supply Bills are intended only to deal with services actually authorized by Parliament, and not to provide for the appointment of new officers. with the Estimates, and get the authority? happy to do so, and the Estimates would have been pushed on but for other and more urgent measures that have been engaging the attention of Parliament. I hope that when those measures have been disposed of we shall be able to go on with the Estimates, and obtain the necessary authority. I have, in the meantime, authorized arrangements to be made for the temporary employment of men to exercise supervising functions in some of the States, so as to cause the least possible delay in the commencement and prosecution of these works. Notwithstanding the shortage in the staff, I am not prepared to admit that there has been any serious delay in beginning and carrying on the works authorized by Parliament. I gave instructions that the Deputy Postmaster-General in each of the States should send to the Postmaster-General's office monthly reports showing the progress of these new works, so that we might keep them under observation, and see that the mandate of .Parliament was being carried out. I have in my hands the first of a series of reports from New South Wales, signed by the Deputy Postmaster-General, which passed through the Electrical Engineer's office on the 19th October, and reached me two days ago. In that report it is stated that, in accordance with instructions, action has already been taken in New South Wales to begin' the construction of new telegraphic and telephonic works, and also new exchanges, authorized by the Appropriation (Works and Buildings) Act passed a month or two ago. The endorsement on that report by the Chief Electrical Engineer is as followsAl l action in connection with these new works appears to be well in train. No further action seems necessary hereon. This shows that there is no justification for the complaint of the honourable member for Calare that the works are at a standstill or not being properly prosecuted. Reports from Victoria also show that a commencement has been made here, and that everything is being done to push on with the time limit imposed by the law. I hope tq receive reports from Queensland and the other States in a day or two. I shall make them available to honourable members, and be always prepared to receive suggestions or complaints from any honourable member who thinks that there has been unnecessary delay, or that there are any grounds for drawing the attention of the permanent officers to the state of any particular work. I shall place the preliminary report from New South Wales upon the table for the-",32,Official Offices Telephones I N Hotels Divisions Use Of Rope D Enclosure Cigarette Smoking Miners Accident Fund Newcastl E Naval Brigade Persona L Explana

They will be able to see, on reference to the details, that most of the works are in hand, and that nothing is being neglected. The next matter is the complaint made by the honourable member for Calare, and supported by the honourable member for Cook, with reference to. the examination tests imposed by law for promotion to the higher grades of sorters. This question was brought under my attention whe.i I visited New South Wales two or three months ago. I received a deputation of sorters, who complained that the tests were too severe and too comprehensive, and that they had not proper facilities hours. If they are willing to secure the and -opportunities for prep*ring to pass ihem. I heard their case patiently, had their complaints and evidence noted, and promised to consider and investigate the matter. I was in duty bound to consult' the permanent officers of the Department on so professional or technical a question as that of examinations. I consulted the Deputy Postmaster-General in Sydney, and the Secretary of the Department in Melbourne, and also brought the whole matter fully under the attention of the Public Service Commissioner. Those officers reported, in writing, that the tests had been approved of by the whole of the responsible officers of the Department, that they were not too severe, and that persons expecting to be promoted to the higher grades of sorter could not be allowed to pass a mere partial examination with regard to efficiency in the despatch room, for instance, or any particular corner of the post-office. They must be expected to pass an examination showing their efficiency and ability to do work in any capacity as sorter. A mere partial test regarding the work of any particular room where a certain kind of sorting is done, is not sufficient to justify the promotion of those officers. Mr J. H . CATTS -Why not test them in the work they are called upon to perform ? the despatch room, but is not expected to remain there all his life. He is expected to be competent to do other work before he gets the higher salary. Mr J. H . CATTS -When it is desired to send him to another room, test him in the work of that room. stituted, the Department is divided into grades. The system is based on a gradation of work, but we are now asked to establish an infinite variety of grades and sub-grades, to be determined according to the particular office in which a man happens to be working. The responsible officers of the Department report that that is not a practical division of the work or a scientific method of testing and examining the men. As regards the opportunity for acquiring practice, and preparing for passing the examinations, I am assured that all these men have equal opportunities of getting the necessary practice in the various branches and rooms. The only difficulty of course is that they must do it in their own time. They cannot do it in ofiice necessary practice and acquaintance with the work of the office, they are afforded opportunities of doing so in their own time. As a proof that the tests imposed by law are not too severe or too technical, I have been informed that a number of young men, not actually in the particular office, have been able to pass the very examinations that some of the veterans who are now making these complaints have failed to pass. Mr J. H . CATTS -Hav e they passed without practice in the work? opportunities of obtaining practice such as these veterans have an opportunity of obtaining, by the assistance of diagrams and by getting instruction, and'have qualified for promotion or appointmenta fact of which complaint is now made. surely not going to throw the old hands on the rubbish tip? kind is proposed or suggested, but it is asked now that they should get higher pay without passing the tests. If we dispensed with the tests there would be no inducement to any of the men to increase their efficiency, and the value of their services to the Department. It would be establishing a very bad precedent to abolish the examinations or to reduce them to a mere partial test of efficiency or ability to pass an examination on work done in a particular room. We want them to become generally efficient, to be able to go where they are told, and to do any class of sorting work. I have no bias in the matter. I am acting according to information placed at my disposal by the responsible officers..

A number of smaller items have been referred to by honourable members, and in regard to them. I shall cause the Hansard records to be examined, and detailed answers to be supplied to the honourable members concerned. a small matter to which I feel that I need only draw your attention, Mr Speaker, in order to have it rectified. House was in Committee one day last week a division took place which resulted in a tie, and the question was raised whether one honourable member was inside or outside the chamber. He was put into the "" calf pen"" in the corner on this side. up. place. The honourable member whose vote was questioned was ""playing with the rope, but he was never actually outside the chamber, as some honourable members seemed to think, through the ropes being up. do not think it is a very good thing to have those calf pens in the House, unless they are railed off like pews, so that a member cannot dodge in and out at the sweet will of the Whip of either party. I have seen that done on several occasions. In fact, I . have been a transgressor myself. When the voting has been very close, I have dodged in or out under the rope at the discretion of the Whip, so that either my vote should be counted or I should stand out as a pair for some other honourable member. I should like to see those enclosures done away with altogether, or railed off properly. venient as they are. venient. of causing trouble about them? but one of them very nearly caused trouble the other day.

The result of the division was a tie, and the Chairman of Committees had to give a casting' vote. It meant a big difference to one side of the House or the other whether the particular amendment before the Committee on a new clause proposed in the Defence Bill was carried or rejected. The amendment was carried by the casting vote of the Chairman, but had the honourable memWhile the ber whose vote was challenged been outside instead of inside the chamber, the division would have gone the other way. I think that it is right that your attention should be drawn to the matter, Mr Speaker, and to the abuse likely to arise from the use of these calf pens on each side of the chamber. If their use is to be continued there should be some means adopted for yarding members into them properly. desire to emphasize a little what I said the other day on the subject of cigarette smoking. I mentioned that I could produce a He was half in and half out. I gentleman who is in splendid health, although he has smoked and inhaled the smoke of cigarettes for about fifty-five years. I mentioned at the same time that no man could continue for five years to inhale the smoke of a pipe and live. Any scientific man will agree that a sphygmograph affords the most reliable test of the harmful effects, if any, upon the heart caused by smoking. A scientific gentleman in the Old Country conducted experiments in this matter extending over ten days, and he found by the use of a pulse-registering .machine that in the consumption of the same weight of tobacco in cigarettes, cigars, and the pipe, the smoking of the cigarettes was less harmful than the smoking of the cigars, and-the smoking of the pipe was most harmful. The trouble is that the mildness of cigarette smoking induces, the smoker to take liberties, and frequently inhale the smoke. It was never intended that smoke should be inhaled into the lungs, and its inhalation is undoubtedly injurious. It is probably more harmful to smoke and inhale the smoke of cigarettes than it is merely to smoke a pipe, but there is no doubt that it is much more harmful to smoke and inhale the smoke oi a pipe than to smoke and inhale the smok.e of cigarettes.

111,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [5.46],"1cigarettesfor fifty-five years, and I challenge any one to produce a man who has inhaled the smoke of a pipe for five years and survived. I have some more grievances to ventilate in connection with the administration of the Old-age Pensions Act. I hope that it is not a fact, but it has been intimated to me that the Treasurer has refused to take any action in connection with the questions which are asked of claimants for pensions, because, to use a colloquialism, I have :< kicked up such a row"" about the matter. I should regret it very much if that were so. able member's informant? know that it is not always convenient to mention names. Sir quite inaccurate. hear that. These old people need kind and generous treatment. There are many cases in which claimants for pensions are unable to supply reliable proof of their age. I remember that a previous Treasurer of the Commonwealth, Sir George Turner, speaking of a gentleman who has since joined the majority, and who was high in the Law Department, said that it was almost impossible to secure a record of a birth certificate in Great Britain of half a century ago. People born in Ireland, and in a lesser degree thoseborn in Scotland, have also great difficulty in securing records of their births. partment is confronted with the same trouble. agree that if it is found difficult for residuce no proof of her age. She says that dents of Great Britain to supply proof of their birth, it is natural that the difficulty should be greatly increased in the case of persons who are now 12,000 miles away from their place of birth, and who can only write to a parish priest or minister to look up their baptismal records. There is, I think, a very simple way of meeting the whole difficulty. Where there is any doubt a.bout the age of a claimant for a pension, the local Government Medical Officer might examine him, and if he is of opinion that the claimant is sixty-five years of age or over that age, that should be considered sufficient. In connection with one matter, I have to complain that the Department adheres too closely to the letter of the law. We frequently hear that men and women when they are being married understate their age. Of course the practice-is. to be condemned; but I think it is straining the Act for the Pensions Department to bring such a thing against a claimant for a pension. I wish to mention the case of a gentleman who to mv own knowledge was at one time worth ^20,000. In the course of business and following the debacle of the boom, he was reduced to an 'almost penniless condition. He' has always been a most respectable man, and as he went down with hiscolours flying through no fault of his own, there is no reason why I should not mention his name. I refer to Mr Eckman.' He is now sixty-eight years of age and owns a house which is valued by the municipal valuators at .£125. Though he could at JOHN FORREST -The statement is one time sign his cheque for £""20,000, that is all that remains to him of his forI am very glad to tune, and be is now drawing a miserable pittance of a little over 3s. per week. As he is not one of my constituents, I shall hand the letter I have received in connection with his case to the honourable member who represents the district in which he resides. I feel sure that the Treasurer will look into the case, not because the claimant was once a wealthy man, but because his case is deserving of some little sympathy. I have particulars of another case, of a woman who has lost her husband. She never received any education, and can neither read nor write. I have made an appeal on her behalf through the press, with the result that she will be saved from penury for at least three months. I am prepared as a medical man to certify that fhe appears to be over sixty-five years of age, but she can proshe has never been one to make many friends, and has always preferred to stay at home. As a result, she can produce no one who has known her for twenty years or for ten years. I shall put the particilars before the Treasurer and ask him to look into the case and see. whether something cannot be done for this woman. The old age pensions question is not a. party question ;' and if any remarks I have made in dealing with these cases may appear to have been somewhat severe, I have not intended them to be personally applied to the Minister. I should have spoken just as severely in the circumstances if a Government belonging to the party to which I belong were in power.

116,Dr. Maloney,"The Treasurer willthat the questions to which I have objected were passed by a Labour Government, and I regret that they did not prefer to resign in a body rather than agree to them. I am sure that if they could realize the misery which those questions have entailed upon a number of old people they would never have passed them. Unfortunately, New South Wales legislation has sometimes influenced Commonwealth politics. These questions were taken from the regulations under the New South Wales Act, and may be regarded as lineal descendants of the workhouse system of the Old Land. In comparison, the Victorian system is simplicity itself. Under the Victorian Act a claimant went to an officer of the Court, who read over to him a list of questions. The officer filled in the replies and the claimant was asked only to sign his name or his mark, the officer putting the question signing as a witness. When the paper was returned to the Pensions Department, the case was followed up if necessary by an officer of the Department, who filled in the answers to another list of questions which the claimant was asked to sign, and then came the personal appearance before the Court. I am satisfied that the taxpayers who find the means which the Treasurer dispenses in the form of oldjige pensions desire only that if a claimant is sixty-five years of. age and has resided twenty years in the Commonwealth, he shall, if in receipt of an income of ios. a there is no occasion for his dissent. There week, receive a pension sufficient to bring his income up to £ 1 per week. I hope that the Treasurer will hasten some reform in the administration of the Act, and will make the questions more simple. If the right honourable gentleman will look into the Victorian system, I feel sure he will agree that it is the best he could follow. It is fortunate that an occasional opportunity is given to review the administration of the Government, especially in connection with the Post and Telegraph Department. The Postmaster-General was good enough some time ago to put upon the Estimates a sum of money for the construction of a telegraph line from Peak -Hill to Nullagine, but I have heard nothing further in regard to the proposal. member that I expected a report from Western Australia by every mail. man knows that the line is necessary to the prosperity and even to the existence of the people in the north-west. The present line runs for many hundreds cf miles along a coast which is subject to violent storms, "" willy-willys,"" and hurricanes, which bring down the wire at different points, with the result that telegraphic communication between that part of Western Australia and the outside world is interrupted for weeks at a time. This is the intolerable position of the pioneers who are developing that faroff territory. It is to be regretted that more money is not made available for the development and extension of telegraphs and telephones in Western Australia. There is no part of Australia where the display of a little more energy in' making extensions would be more acceptable to the people, and whether the necessary money is provided out of revenue or from loans, it would be well to expend it There seems to be an idea on the part of some people that the party with which I am associated is opposed to the construction of reproductive works out of loan moneys. That is largely a mistake. pretation of our platform. ber will speak for himself, not for the party. am doing. The honourable member should have a little more patience; he may find is nothing in the platform of the party opposed to the principle of constructing reproductive works out of loan money, and, indeed, it is sound business to do so. A nation or a man who by means of other people's capital creates works which not only pay interest on the borrowed capital, but also leave a substantial profit out of which the loan may be paid off, is doing good work for posterity. Our children will have no cause for complaint if , as a set-off for our debts, we leave them assets of equivalent value. cialistic side of the Labour platform. with Socialism, but with the statement frequently made that the Labour party are opposed to the construction of reproductive works out of loan money.

Members of all parties in the House are responsible, more or less, for the .policy which has so far forbade the Commonwealth from borrowing. Personally I do not regard a continuance of that policy possible-it certainly is not consistent with progress, though it may do for a wheelbarrow state of civilization. Whether the -money for works that are urgently neces-sary in Western Australia is to come from revenue or from loans, I hope that it -will be speedily made available. No part -of the Commonwealth would derive greater 'iienefit from the extension of telephone and telegraph lines than would Western Australia. It is something of a reproach to the -Commonwealth that although it has been in possession of that magnificent instrumentality of Government-the Post and Telegraph Department-for practically nine -years, it has done so little to extend telegraphic communication in Western Australia and in some of the other States. Speaking -subject to correction, I think it will be found -on inquiry that not more than 100 miles -of new telegraph lines have been con1 -structed in YVestern Australia since Federation. The position is certainly serious. ""The State itself has been rapidly developed s by its own people. Railways are being extended into all parts of the interior by the -State Government, private individuals are spending money liberally in the development of their enterprises, but the Commonwealth has permitted a sort of paralysis to creep into its agency of civilization there. The Department is stagnant, -and the people of Western Australia have great reason to complain and strong -grounds for demanding the initiation of a more progressive policy. The Government, having amongst its members the right honourable member for Swan as a representative of Western Australia, ought to have been a little more ^active than it has been in regard to the -transcontinental railway. Reports and plans relating to that line have been in the possession of the Department of Home Affairs for some time, and we have been told by -the Prime Minister himself, I think, that we have as much information as we require to enable us to proceed with the construction of the line. If that is so, the House 'has a right to expect the Government to submit at an early date some concrete, tangible iproposal, with a view to its construction. I [184] am sorry that the Prime Minister should be relying entirely upon the agreement made with South Australia in respect of the Northern Territory to enable him to obtain the consent of that State to the construction of the proposed line from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. Yearsvago, when Western Australia was considering the advisability of entering the Federation, an understanding was arrived at between statesmen representing South Australia and Western Australia that if the latter entered the Federation, South Australia would freely give her consent to the construction of the line through her territory. ment to that effect? been published in Parliamentary papers. The compact so far took the form of a"" treaty that the Parliament of Western Australia passed a Eill consenting to the construction of the line through its territory, and it was on that understanding that that State entered the Federation. From that day to this, however, South Australia has not attempted to carry out her part of the compact, although frequently reminded of her obligation. It is necessary to remind the House that under the Constitution the construction of a railway through a State by the Federal Government is prohibited except with the consent of the State affected. Government construct a railway line for defence purposes through a State? plain language of the Constitution. The present Attorney-General some seven or eight vears ago kindly gave me an opinion on the subject. He then held that, despite this constitutional prohibition, the Commonwealth could build any railway required for the effective defence of the nation. There is certainly a good deal of common sense behind such an interpretation of the law. One of the great objects of Federation was to secure the effective defence of Australia, and consequently any provision in the Constitution which would impede the advancement of that object would, I think, be held to be invalid.

It must surely be advantageous to bring the people of Western Australia into direct and rapid communication with their fellow citizens in these parts. munity of ' feeling which should exist if tion with the East except by sea; because, however easy and comfortable the voyage may be made, there will always be people who dread a sea trip. fore, if that part of Australia which is most eager for the construction of the line is to be a real entity of the nation, we must build the railway, and build it soon. Passing from that subject, I observe that a good deal has been said about the administration of the Old-age Pensions Act. I do not desire to dwell upon what seems to be the unsympathetic treatment of old people. I have received a good many complaints from Western Australia. Some people have considerable difficulty in proving their ages. It would be a good thing if the Commissioner were to adopt the rule which prevails in courts of justice, and, whenever possible, give applicants "" the benefit of the doubt."" As I pointed out on a previous occasion, bush workers do not travel around this country with birth certificates stowed away in their waistcoat pockets. A man who has 1 been up and down Australia for a quarter of a century or more hunting for an elusive job, may experience great difficulty in getting people to certify as to his age. Many bush workers are men whose surnames are not known to friends with whom they have worked for many years. Men who work in shearing sheds and mining camps are frequently known only by their Christian names or by nicknames. Suppose that such a man has lived for twenty-five years in Queensland. Suppose that late in life he comes to Western. Australia and, on attaining the age of sixty-five years, applies for an old-age pension. He is required to find some person who has known him for twenty years. He may have the greatest difficulty in complying with the request, because probablv those with whom he has worked '[184]2 longest in a distant part of the country That may have never known him by his surname. I wish the Treasurer had power to direct the Commissioner to give to such an applicant It would be the best the benefit of the doubt. direct the Commissioner. If I did, I I think it would be. I should be exercising a Ministerial act, and that would put the administration under political control. Treasurer has not power, because I am sure that he would not refuse any old person a pension. He is by instinct tco generous to We can never have that cominflict unnecessary hardships. Where a person has obviously reached the statutory age, a whole State has no communicahe surely ought to be granted a pension, even if he be unable to furnish legal proof of the fact. ThereSitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.45 p.m. When I arrived here to-day, I learned that the honourable member for Maribyrnong, in reply to an interjection, had stated that if the official papers were examined it would be found that the allegation which he made some time ago to the effect that the Maitland miners were a drunken lot was fairly correct. When this matter was brought forward on a prior occasion, I recollect that the honourable member withdrew his allegation and apologized for having made it. Under these circumstances I scarcely expected that he would repeat the statement. I spoke to him this afternoon in regard to the matter, and he then told me that he did not intend to convey the impression which his remarks had created, and as I understand that he intends speaking again this evening, I hope that he will embrace the opportunity of making the position of the Maitland miners absolutely clear. Some time ago I brought under the notice of the Treasurer the lack of seating accommodation for. old-age pensioners at the Plattsburg Post Office. Upon that occasion I was told that ample accommodation existed. Now, I know the Plattsburg Post Office very well. It is an extremely busy one. It contains a small counter-per haps 12 or 14 feet long-bu t no seating accommodation for old people who may be obliged to wait some-time .before they receive their pensions. into the matter I was informed that tbe accommodation was very good.",39,Official Offices Telephones I N Hotels Divisions Use Of Rope D Enclosure Cigarette Smoking Miners Accident Fund Newcastl E Naval Brigade Persona L Explana

Sir JOH N FORREST -Has the honourable member been in the office upon pay day ? every occasion that I returned to my home. all. If old-age pensioners are obliged to wait in that office until their pensions are paid, they should at least be provided with seats. Surely that is not asking much. stand that a promise was made recently that any persons who, under State laws, had been the recipients of pensions, and whose pensions had been reduced upon their transfer to the Commonwealth, but had subsequently been restored to their original amount/would be paid the arrears that had accrued from the beginning of July of the present year. Take the case of an old-age pensioner who was in receipt of a pension of ios. per week under the New South Wales law, and whose pension was by some mischance reduced upon his transfer to the Commonwealth. the end of three months, it were found that a mistake had been made, and his pension was then restored to its original amount, surely he would .be entitled to the arrears which had accumulated. upon the merits of each case. honourable member will send any case of radically wrong, or such a state of affairs that kind along, we will look into it . ciple, if a pension is reduced by the Comearliest possible moment.

For two years past money has been voted for the construction of a. boat harbour and drill shed at that port, but so far nothing has been done. The boats, which were built in Sydney, were completed some six months ago, but the Newcastle corps cannot take them over, because it has no place in which to house them. Some of the omcers of the Newcastle Naval Brigade, have recently been asked lo present themselves for examination, notwithstanding that they have no appliances to enable them to fit themselves for such examination.

194,Mr Mauger,"The report saysThere was a reason for the issue of that order by me. It was represented to me that the police authorities had found that a public telephone on licensed premises was the means of persons excusing themselves for being thereon when they had no right to be, and that it made the administration of the Licensing Act more difficult than it would otherwise be. I had no desire to be a partisan or to discriminate, but I had a desire to do all that I possibly could to help the authorities in administering the law of the land. That is the reason which prompted me to issue the order. I see no ground for receding from that position. orable member's successors have approved of it. houses and public houses. There are some public houses which have accommodation for travellers, and which have no occasion to use any means outside their legitimate business for attracting persons. There are some public houses which it was represented to me would be likely to use telephones for that purpose. It was also represented that no excuse, hindrance or obstacle should be put in the way of the authorities administering the Licensing Act. I think it is only right that I should make this statement, because, whilst I was anxious to uphold my principles I was also anxious that I should do no injustice to any .one, and that there should be a good foundation for any action that I took in administering the Department. desire to draw theattention of the Minister of Home Affairs to a question affecting the compilation of the new rolls in Western that the method of taking the old rolls for an electorate, ascertaining whether any persons had left the district or not, and adding the names of new residents, is not being pursued in that State. My information is to the effect that the old roll has been practically discarded, and that the police are, where possible, leaving forms at houses to be filled up and calling for them subsequently, and that those persons whose names are not collected in that fashion will not find themselves on the new roll. If that method is being pursued at mining camps, it will mean the disfranchisement of many persons.. No matter whether the police make a visit by day or by night, they will find the houses of some miners empty, particularly those occupied by single men, because the occupants will be at work. Eveni f a form left at a miner's house is filled in, it may not be convenient for the occupant to present it to the police officer. My information comes from a private source, but I have no reason to doubt its accuracy. The writer may not be f u l ly informed as to the methods of the police, but he has written what he believes to be irue. If he has furnished correct information nothing but a very imperfect roll can be the result. The proper method to adopt would be for the police to take the old roll, find out who have lef t the district and strike off their names and give forms to the new residents. I have not the slightest objection to that being done. Whilst seeing that all qualified persons are enrolled, we ought to see that the roll does not contain the names of a number of unqualified persons. We should not proceed to an election with stuffed rolls, nor should we endeavour to strike off the name of any qualified person. able member suggests seems to be the easiest way to proceed. it is. present. to hear a reply from the Minister, because the getting of a perfect roll is an important matter. If he can assure me that my information is not correct I shall be very pleased to know that that is the case. Question resolved in the negative. toAustralia.

I know from experience and from inquiry that it is the hardest matter possible to obtain non-commissioned instructional officers, because of the low rates of pay that such officers receive. I am pleased that the Minister of Defence has returned. I was at fault in accusing him of being away addressing meetings. The matter to which I wish to draw his attention is this-and to make the position clear I shall quote from a statement which has been supplied to meSpeaking of the new classification of Military Staff clerks, it says thatIt will be seen that these gentlemen are now graded with ranks from corporal to honorary rank of captain at salaries varying from ^ n o to £400 per annum. I beg to state fhat ahigh percentage of these gentlemen have no military experience whatever, and are dependent upon the warrant and non-commissioned officers of the Instructional Staff for their education in military matters, while a few were formerly gunners in the R.A.A. and sappers in the Royal Australian Engineers. It is difficult to understand why the salaries and ranks allotted above are so much superior to that of the members of the Instructional Staff, warrant, and non-commissioned officers when it is taken into consideration the great amount of study and perseverance it is necessary to undergo in order to become an efficient instructor, which position entails a great amount of clerical work that canand the rank of warrant officer; and herenot be done except by those who have had a thorough military training. It is suggested that the warrant and non-commissioned officers of the Instructional Staff be placed on a similar footing to tliat of the military staff clerks. At the present time warrant and non-commissioned ofiicers of the Instructional Staff have to perform similar duties to those of the military staff clerks, and, in addition, have to study other injustice is that a military clerk cannight and day as opportunity offers, in order to maintain their high standard ""of military knowledge, whereas the military staff clerks are only employed in the office from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.

The difference between the pay of a seniornon-commissioned and a junior commissioned officer is so great that it is not surprising that non-commissioned officers cannot be obtained. If the service is not madeattractive, we shall not get the best men. The Minister has told me privately that hehas had this matter under consideration for some time, and that, as soon as the money is made available, he will make an alteration. This, I am sure, will prove a boon, and a benefit to this branch of the service, and be regarded as one of the best featuresof the new defence scheme. new instructors? tary Staff Clerks, with ,£110 and less,, have the rank of corporal; above ,£110,. and less than .£130, the rank of sergeant;, above £[130, and less than £160, the rank of companv sergeant-major; and, with ,£160 to £ji8o, the rank of regimental quarter-master sergeant.

221,Mr Page,"Yes, to all of them. Miliwhatever corps he is posted. is a most progressive science; indeed, although I have been out of the army for only some twenty-eight years, 1 found when I visited Queenscliff that, despite the fact that I underwent a course of gunnery at Shoeburyness, everything was as foreign to me as if I had never been a gunner. The fuses, both percussion and time, the mountings of the guns, and the guns themselves, are altogether different now. the guns are models of mechanism; in fact, many of them are as delicately made as. a watch, and require skilful and careful treatment. If the work of handling them is to be left to men of twenty-one years of age, it will, I think, be a great mistake. A man is only beginning to have sense at that age; indeed, I regard that as my most sensible period of life, because it was then I decided to come to Australia. If Australia does not know when it has a good citizen, I know when I amin a good country. Although every one may not be so enthusiastic as I am in regard to militarism, I am sure we all desire to see an effective fighting force; and if the Bill can be made more workable in another place, then I shall join in the old Conservative cry of "" Thank God, there is an Upper House! "" The honourable member for Maranoa is able to bring to this subject an experience which I am sure is regarded as a most valuable contribution to this discussion. It is a matter of congratulation, both .to the House and to the country, that the measure has passed so rapidly through its various stages, and that it is now on the eve of leaving one Chamber of the Parliament. A l though, as I said on the second reading, I welcome the principle of the measure, I am bound to say that, in my opinion, it does not provide the machinery to create the effective fighting force that the honourable member for Maranoa desires. I say again that, while the measure prepares a man to be a soldier, it does not make him a soldier. It is better, in a sense, to have no fighting force than to have a fighting force on which we cannot rely. I do not go so far, of course, as to express any regret at the introduction of the"" measure, because I welcome it ; but it must' assuredly be amended. that the measure as it stands is quite ineffective for any purpose for which it is intended. It will neither provide men with sufficient training, nor will it create an organization which permits of the utilizaMilitarism tion of the trainees. In my opinion, it is impossible to get men in any way fit todefend the country with the training proposed; because a recruit requires, at any rate, not much less than forty days' training. On the second reading, I suggested thirty-six days, because the Deakin measure proposed eighteen days the first year, eighteen days the second year, and nine days the third year. My suggestion at that Some of time was that it would be better to have thirty-six days' training the first year and nine days in the second. Better results would be thus obtained, and it would take the trainee from his industrial vocation at a time when he could be more easily spared. However, I do not wish to labour the point, nor, indeed, is it of any real use to do so. The greatest soldier of the Empire, Lord Roberts, who has giver* this question of citizen soldiery especial attention that certainly makes his opinionworthy of consideration, declares that anything less than four months of training, of which one month ought to be continuous incamp, is insufficient. Lord Roberts gives an instance-whic h I have previously quoted -in the fact that the C.I.V's., after having undergone a course of preparatory training, for very much longer than that proposed in the B ill , were quite unfitted to take the field in South Africa, and had to be kept for three months training in camp day afterday before they were regarded as effective. Before the honourable gentleman can really get into f u l l swing with his scheme, I an* sure it will be abundantly demonstrated that the proposed .period of training is quite insufficient. I am also sure that before the first set of trainees-thos e of the ages of from eighteen to twenty-pas s throughand become eligible to go into the reserve or join the Militia, as the case may be,, the necessity will become apparent for an active organization into which they can be drafted, so that there shall be of men between the ages of eighteen and twenty-six at least an active fighting force all thetime available. It is of no use to train a man and then turn him adrift. I pointed out cn the second reading that there ought to be from 50,000 to 100,000 men in this country who have passed through the Militia, and are still within the fightExperience will demonstrate ing age. If there are 23,000 in the Militia, and if on the average they pass through the Militia in two years, and the Militia Forces have been in existence for the past ten or fifteen years, there must be at least 50,000 men between the ages",45,Defence Bill

When his scheme starts, the honourable gentleman will deal not merely with boys of fourteen and take them on up to the age of eighteen, but will have to deal with boys of fourteen, boys of fifteen, boys of sixteen, boys of seventeen, and boys of eighteen at the same time. I do not say that there is a great gulf between a boy of sixteen and a boy of seventeen, but between a boy who is approaching fourteen and another who is nearly eighteen, there is the gulf between a boy and a man. that difference must be regarded, particularly in camp training, and I would impress upon the honourable gentleman that it is in the last degree important that they should not be brigaded or camped together.

I am not clear in my mind as to what the Minister proposes in regard to those who desire an exemption because of religious convictions or conscientious objections to war. In what way -does the honourable gentleman propose to deal with them as regards proposed new -section 125 and the following sections? sent, broadly, is that there will be plenty' of non-combatant duties. that, but I would submit that if a man is Here the to be permitted to be drafted into the noncombatants merely upon his declaration that he has conscientious scruples, a difficult position may arise.

He cannot put them all in the Commissariat, nor in the hospital corps, nor even in the sanitary corps. It has been suggested that those seeking exemption should be deterred by being compelled to pass an examination; but you cannot -compel a person to pass an examination. You can say to him, "" If you do not do your drills this year you must come up next year and do them,"" and you can make him come up, but you cannot make him do the drills. And, certainly, we cannot make him pass an examination. It would, no Every sensible person knows that doubt, be an admirable thing if we could.

232,Mr Hughes,"I see that the sectionstories of men who, in one gaol, have declared themselves to be Roman Catholics on being informed that the majority of the warders or the head warder or the cook were Roman Catholics, and who, when they have been transferred to another gaol, have become Presbyterians. Men may say anything, and I venture to say that a number of persons may try to evade military' service if they find they can do so by saying that the doctrine of their religion forbids them to bear arms. I say very humbly that the doctrine of our religion, as Christians generally, forbids us all to bear arms, if it comes to that. No one who calls himself a real Christian and stands by the Christian religion, as such, can bear arms. How could he do it? Under section 61 of the existing Act,' as we are all Christians, none of us could be brought uncler the compulsory training provisions. That would be an absurdity. I am sure that the Minister of Defence does not propose to permit so wide an exemption as that. I remember very well discussing section 61 of the principal Act when thc measure was going through this House, and I know that what was contemplated was to meet the case of Quakers, Seventh Day Adventists, and persons of that kind, who object to war. But training is not war. It is merely a preparation for war. I direct: the attention of the Minister to section 59 of Part IV. of the principal Act. It readsA ll male inhabitants of Australia (excepting those who are exempt from service in the Defence Force) who have resided therein for six months and are British subjects, and are between taken, and that owing to the manner iiv the ages of sixteen and sixty years shall, in time of war, be liable to serve in the Militia Forces. I submit that the exemption provided for in section 61 refers to the liability imposed under section 59, or it has no meaning at all. If it refers to the liability imposed by section 59, it does not and cannot apply to the training provided for under the proposed new section 125 contained in this Bill. The Minister of Defence will see that we are dealing here not with a liability to bear arms in time of war, but to come up for a certain number of days and be trained. The exemption therefore provided for in section 61 will not relieve a man of the liability imposed under the proposed new section 125, and the succeeding provisions of this Bill. If it does, it destroys absolutely the usefulness of this measure, because it leaves a loophole by which any person may escape the liaMr Hughes. bility to undergo training. I should be the last to compel a man to bear arms whohad conscientious scruples against it, but I say that training is one thing, and bearing, arms quite another. I see no reason why persons with conscientious scruples against bearing arms should not be liable toundergo training. If the Minister takesthe power to make everybody serve, he may then exercise his discretion in regard toclaims to exemption under the circumstancesset forth in section 61 to such an extent as may 'be compatible with the effectiveoperation of this measure. But exemption to a greater extent under the provision for exemption would be fatal to the success of the measure. It should be remembered that section 61 of the principal Act contemplates the exemption, not merely of persons who, because of their religiousdoctrines have conscientious objections to the bearing of arms, but also of thoseclasses of persons who are usually exempted, such as Judges, members Of Parliament, clergymen, and so on, and it clearly applies only to the liability under section' 5y. to serve in the Militia Forces in timeof war. I submit that it cannot and ought not to refer to the liability to undergo thetraining provided for in this Bill. If it can be held to refer to the provisions of this Bill, the Minister of Defence should makesome provision to meet the difficulty. I have just glanced at clause n of this Bill,, ancl the proposed new sections it includes,, and though I have not had an opportunity to look into the matter carefully, it now appears to me that I may have been miswhich part IV . of the principal Act has been repealed and remodelled in this Bill, section 61 of the principal Act will apply to persons called up for training under theproposed new section 125. If that be so, T submit that it might easily render this Bill a nullity. If a man can come uo and' say, "" The doctrines of my religion forbid me to train,"" the Minister will be unableto make him train. He will have no discretion in the matter. Under sub-section 2 of section 61, it is provided thatThe burden of proving exemption from service in the Defence Force shall rest on the person claiming exemption. That does not refer to a claim for exemption on the ground of religion, but to the first part of sub-section 1 of section 61, giving the Governor General power, by regulation, to declare what persons shall be exempt from service in the Defence Force. --section 61 is that persons whom the doctrines of their religion forbid to bear arms .shall be exempt uponsuch conditions as .may be prescribed, and if we say to such persons that they will be exempt from bearing arms, provided they join some noncombatant force, I say that we cannot have too many in the non-combatant forces, and -there must be a discretion vested in the Minister to prevent the number of noncombatants exceeding a certain proportion. The Minister should take power, under this Hill, to limit in any way that is deemed -expedient and wise, the number of persons who may take advantage of section 61. I -do not deny for a moment that there are many in this country who might legitimatelycome under it, but, on the other hand, there are many who might be disposed to take advantage of it to the detriment of the effective working of this B ill. I shall be glad to hear what the Minister may have 10 say on the points I have raised. I hope that, whatever""he does .in this House, he w i ll take care that when the Bill is before another place such an amendment will be inserted as will meet the difficulty to which I have referred. £9.14] I differ from the two honourable .gentlemen who have preceded me, although we are all members of the same party. The age of compulsion provided for in the Bill : is as high as I think it ought to be. If -.any attempt had been made to make it much higher, I should have been prepared to wreck the Billi f that were necessary to prevent it succeeding. When the people of Australia have had a taste of compulsory training, they will better understand what it involves. ' I objected to the proposal when the Bill was in Committee, ancl I am pleased that in the form in which the B ill has been reported the compulsion is to stop at twenty years of age, when, as a rule, young fellows will have very few re-spcnsibilities. Some, of course, may have -widowed mothers to provide for, and their case must excite sympathy. We trust that the proposed allowance will compensate them to some extent for the loss of wages they will suffer. I do not share the hope expressed by the honourable member for Maranoa and the honourable member for West Sydney that the age of compulsory service will be extended. that the Government propose to train .boys, not men, and that the period of compulsory service is to cease where it ought really to The proviso in sub-section 1 of commence. There need be no pretence as to what we require. We do not expect to raise an army such as might be necessary in Europe; the troops that we shall raise will partake more of the character of the Boer forces than of a European army. If we train our young men up to the age of twenty years, and offer them some encouragement, I am sure that thousands will be prepared at the close of their period of compulsory service to join the volunteer forces. We do not pretend to desire to raise and maintain an army of 200,000 or 300,000 men. To my mind we require to raise a force of between 60,000 and 80,000, and provided that more encouragement is forthcoming than has been offered in the past by the Defence Department, we shall find plenty of young men prepared to join the volunteer .forces after reaching the age of twenty. Prior to the introduction of this BillI expressed the opinion that the existing system could be materially improved without resort to the compulsory system, if young men were given reasonable encouragement to train. Our cadet forces have hitherto received no encouragement, and, I believe, it will be better for the youth of Australia to be subjected to a little more discipline and control than they are at present. A great deal has been said about the making of a soldier. I well remember when the six years' term of enlistment first came into operation in England. In my boyhood days men there had to enlist for a period of from twelve to fourteen years, and, after remaining in the army for twenty-one years, they were able to retire on a pension. When the period of enlistment was reduced to six years, many of the leading military authorities said that it was impossible to make a soldier in that time. What they really meant was that it was impossible within that time to turn out such a soldier as they would like to have under them, and whilst we may not be able,, within the time fixed for compulsory service, to turn out a soldiery such as might be necessary in Europe, I am convinced that the training proposed to be given our young men will be advantageous to the manhood and the best interests of the Commonwealth. but comparatively little training didvery well in the American Civil War. rity on that subject, but I have heard many military men declare that what took place in that struggle was not war, but",48,Defence Bill

During the discussion -on the financial agreement, a balance-sheet -was placed before the House by me, based Mr J. H.

The balance-sheet showed that in Consethe first year when the proposed financial agreement comes into operation, there will be a deficit of .£39,000 in the Commonwealth Government's accounts; and that calculation dees not provide for a single item of new policy in the 1 There are too many ""equivaGovernment programme. It is, thereThe Bill provides that there shall fore, evident that the amount of a million and a half, which it is estimated will have to be spent in the year when this B ill comes into operation, must be raised from some source. How is the money to be raised? We hacl an indication from the honourable member for Denison during the debate on the financial agreement. He said, "" We can get ,£3,000,060 from cotton and piece Again, goods."" We have also had the honourable brought in their Bill member for North Sydney talking about the untapped sources of Customs revenue. If we are going to Other honourable members opposite have also indicated that large amounts can be raised by .means of taxes on tea and kerosene. As a matter of fact, we know that the idea in the minds of a number of honourable members opposite-if not of the majority of them-is that huge Customs taxation should be levied upon the working classes of this community. In other words, the' working classes are to be made to pay by means of taxes on the necessaries of life for the defence of Australia. The Government do not intend fo bring the B ill into operation until 1911. Why? Because there is to be a general election within a few months. They know that to bring the Bill into operation at once would mean that they This is a question which would have to find the money for its purposes. That would mean that they would It is stated that have to go to the people and explain where the money was coming from.

When Parliamentarv procedure. Politics apthe Bill was introduced there was a general pears to be a huge game, the object of desire that honourable members should which is to fool the public by leading them consider it as a purely non-party measure, to believe that they are getting something, and consequently quite a number of them and delilierately scheming to prevent them refrained from addressing themselves to getting it. My only hope is that the the motion for its second reading. Their electors of this country will take an inobject was that the Bill should get into creasingly intelligent interest in our poliCommittee, and that untrammelled by party tics, and that they will keep an eye upon and when we consider its class character, we must recognise that it is a measure for wherever I meet them that it will only be considerations we should seek to evolve from it a Democratic defence scheme. But in Committee what did we find? When ever proposals emanated from the Government the divisions upon them were of a non-party character, but the moment that a member of the Opposition submitted an amendment with the object of improving the measure it was immediately regarded from a party stand-point. Now that the Government have absolutely refused to give the Bill the Democratic finish which we endeavoured to impart to it, we are quite at liberty to entirely repudiate it. Bill which provides for the physical training of our youth, the measure will be a success, but as a Bill which will provide an effective defence scheme for Australia, it will prove a huge farce and involve a waste of public money. Since the inception of Federation we have expended about £11,000,000 upon defence, and it is now generally admitted that, to a large extent, that expenditure has been wasted, because it has proved ineffective. Yet, according to the Minister of Defence, when experience has shown that further amendments in this Bill are necessary, we should proceed to improve it. In other words, when a few more million pounds have been squandered-million s raised by duties upon the necessaries of life-w e should endeavour to make the measure a. workable one, very probably after we have brought the idea of a compulsory citizen defence force into dispute. However, the Opposition have done their best to assist in formulating a scheme which would have been effective, and which might have been recommended from every platform throughout Australia. have failed to give effect to those principles measure an effective one. which we think should be the governing principles of the measure. I sincerely trust, in the interest of the economical expenditure of public money, and of an effective defence of Australia, that before the Government are afforded an opportunity to put this scheme into operation in 1911 the electors will have returned the Labour party to power, so that the measure may be recast with a view to making it both just and Democratic. I did not address myself to the motion for the second reading of this BillI propose to say a few words now that we have some idea of the attitude of the Government towards the great question of defence. It is not always advisable for an honourable member to speak upon the second reading of a measure because the reply which is usually urged to his criticism is that its 7 details may best be considered in Committee. But now that the Bill has emerged from Committee, we find that, notwithstanding it was introduced as a non-party measure, it has taken on a party complexion. Whenever amendments were submitted by honourable members upon this side of the House, the Government were adamant in their opposition to them. cepted new clauses and amendments from As a honourable members opposite. Mri. WEBSTER -Yes, upon matters of mere detail. The Minister has accepted amendments of no consequence in order to give colour to the professions of the Government that the measure is a non-party one. last clause of the Bill was introduced by an honourable member opposite the proposal to abolish the canteen system placed the Minister in an awkward position. as it does from the honourable member for Gwydir. at the Minister of Defence charging any member with being unfair, because such accusations constitute his sole stock in trade. I repeat that to the more important amendments which were submitted by honourable members on this side of the House the Government turned an absolutely But we deaf ear. They did not wish to make the If proof of my statement be required, it is to be found in the cur'cumstance that they have departed from the system which has been in vogue in Great Britain ever since that country had a military system to uphold. From time immemorial the cost of the defence of the Mother Country has been exacted from the wealthy land proprietors. Upon them has been cast the duty of contributing the necessary funds for the defence of their own property. But since we have evolved a system of indirect taxationa system by which it is easy to increase the burdens of the people, and to increase it in such a manner that they do not realize either the load which is being placed upon them, or the frequency with which it is increased, Government after Government have shirked",52,Defence Bill

254,Mr Webster,"I am not surprisedthe responsibility of placing the duty of defending the country on the shoulders of men who have property to defend. There is no doubt in my mind that the order of things which prevailed in the British Isles in the fourteenth century was based upon equity to some extent. In other words the workers were called upon to form an army for the defence of the rights of the people and the Constitution. They were not asked to pay money into the general exchequer for the purpose of covering the cost of defence. It was thought sufficient that they should submit their persons to the danger which would be involved in fighting for their liberties, or for what they considered their rights. That was their contribution towards the defence of their country. But under this Bill the Government intend to practically label every boy as a defender of his country. They propose to compel him to learn drill and to go through the different manoeuvres which are explained in the measure. They propose to bind him to this work until he is twenty years of age, and then by some process of transfer to the Militia, voluntary I suppose, he may remain in the forces of the Commonwealth. In that way they are teaching the masses of the people that it is their duty to prepare themselves for the defence ot the country. At the same time they are doing nothing whatever to place the burden of the expenditure on the backs of those who would be most affected if trouble should arise. In this country the best of the land is held by a very few persons compared with our small population. "" A stake in the country "" is that which it is necessary 'to defend. Consequently, I contend that upon the shoulders of land owners should fall the burden of providing the money to carry out this defence scheme, imperfect as it is. Are the Government doing anything in that direction? No. Are they showing any earnestness in this matter ? No. While they are fathering a defence scheme which will practically involve the Commonwealth in the annual expenditure of about ,£2,500,000, they have not made any provision for raising that money, nor have they given to the House any indication or guarantee as to where it is to come from. They do not propose, nor did they allow a proposition to be carried here that the burden should be placed on the backs of the wealthier classes. When honourable members on this side sought to enact that the cost of defence should be raised by in[ ' 8 ] -2 5 come and land taxation, what did we find? The Government practically opposed an amendment which would have placed the Bill on a similar basis to that which has governed the conditions which have pertained in military matters in the British Isles. We on this side only ask that accumulated wealth should bear its fair share of the cost of defence. We contended that it was not only wrong, but absolutely unjust, for the Government to submit' a Bill embodying an annual expenditure of £^2,500,000, without indicating where the money is to come from. The only conclusion we can arrive at is that if they are not quite indifferent, they are not sincere, or that the Bill is only intended as a placard to tide them over the general election. One provision of the Bill is that it shall not come into force until June 1911. To my mind that provision is designed to land the Government safely over the general election. I should have been better pleased if instead of submitting this placard they had come down and said, "" We submit this Defence Bill, but we think that the money necessary to work the scheme should be derived from accumulated wealth, and we therefore propose to levy income and land taxes for the purpose of raising funds."" But did ""the Government do anything of that kind? No. That would have been unpopular with the crowd which they represent. The representatives of Conservative interests in the Parliament, the pure Tories of Australian politics, those who father the schemes which are propounded by the Tory wing of the new Governmental side, are merely doing that which will suit the Tory element at the next election. The Government are not game to do what they should do, nor are their proposals marked by a sense of justice. If they were to come down and propose to levy income and land taxes for the purpose of covering the defence expenditure, what would happen ? They would have arrayed against them the forces of Conservatism, the land owning and banking forces, and the newspapers, which merely echo the sentiments of banking and other institutions. The reason why they postpone the operation of this measure until June, 1911, is, I take it, that they may be assured of office for a term of three years. Their troubles then about the people and the defence of the country !

Honor-should, "" in the presence of such scrutineers as may be present,"" mark, fold and deposit his ballot-paper for him. Clause 23 of the Bill amends that section by including voters who are physically incapacitated. toria where a person asked the presiding officer to assist him, and the scrutineer for one of the candidates told the returning officer that he must mark the paper at the table, but the presiding officer replied that he need not do so. I trust that it will be made' clear to all presiding officers that under the law the scrutineers have a right to see them mark every ballot-paper for voters who are unable to vote without assistance. The object of that provision was to prevent any presiding officer from taking the ballot-paper away and marking it .as he desired without any check or supervision. I notice that a number of amendtnents have been 'circulated. The honourable member for Fawkner proposes that instead of one Commissioner for the purpose of subdividing the various constituencies, there shall be three Commissioners. one Commissioner system has proved a failure. Every time, with one exception, that a single * Commissioner has sent his report to Parliament, it has been adopted without amendment, and on the occasion when the report of the Commissioner was not adopted,' there was a party formed from all parties in the House known as "" the statu quo party,"" and, if I remember aright, the then Leader of the Opposition resigned in order to mark his disapproval of the action of that party. I shall be prepared to listen to the arguments put forward by the honourable member for Fawkner, or by any other honourable member, in support of the proposed alteration, but I have yet to learn that any such amendment is necessary. I think that every one will admit that the Commissioners appointed for each of the States, have given every satisfaction. It has never been hinted that they have been influenced by any but the highest motive* in the discharge of their duty. The honor -able member for Herbert has given notice of a very important amendment, referring to comments by newspapers after the day of nomination. Honourable members will Section 148 of remember that quite recently the honourable member for Fremantle asked the Prime Minister whether we could not insist that articles appearing in newspapers should be able members opposite who have been supported by one newspaper or another may not object to comments by the press, but honourable members on this side, who have had all the daily newspapers against them, There was a case in Vicare in an entirely different position. I shall support the proposal of the honourable member for Herbert, to curtail as far as possible the unfair influence exercised by the newspapers at the present time. I believe that, on the whole, this Bill proposes useful amendments of the existing Act. I am particularly interested in the provisions for voting by post, and I hold that we should not make it easier for electors to vote in that way than it has been in the past. I regret the Minister has hot proposed an amendment of the section limiting the election expenses of candidates. That section should be repealed or made effective. .At present we find that not only candidates, but organizations supporting them, are at liberty to spend almost any amount of money. which the honourable member belongs is the I have yet to learn that the worse of all. a statement which he ought to know is' incorrect after the last election, a resolution was carried by a Labour organization authorizing the secretary to investigate the candidates' expenses, there was a rush of candidates to see what accounts of their expenses had been sent in. If we are to have a limitation of expenses, it should be genuine, and not farcical. under the existing Act"" is too small for my district. gether too high. Dr..

If that kind of thing can be done the existing provision for the limitation of election expenses is a farce. I heard that every motor car in Melbourne was used in the interests of the honourable member for Fawkner at the last election. If the party opposite are to be at liberty to spend .an unlimited amount in contesting elections, we might just as well repeal the provision ,for the limitation of election expenses.
