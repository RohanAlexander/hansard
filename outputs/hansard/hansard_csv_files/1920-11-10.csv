For this reason I have felt compelled to adopt this course to direct public attention to the very serious condition of discontent existing to-day amongst the lower deck ratings of the Australian Navy. We know T that as a result of the efforts of the B r i tish and Australian Navies during the late great war, the British people have been also of the Australian Naval Forces. I find that in Great Britain the Admiralty took immediate steps to remedy the state of affairs existing amongst the lower deck ratings of the British Navy. They brought into being what was known as a Welfare Committee. It was composed of officers of the British Navy. In addition, there was appointed what was known as an Advisory Committee. This Committee is composed of men representing",21,Public Service Holidays Position Of Tempokakt Employees

30,Mr Mahony (Dalley) [ 2 . 4 8 ],"I rethe lower deck ratings. The idea is that the Advisory Committee shall make any representations as to grievances to the Welfare Committee, and then the officers comprising the Welfare Committee either deal with the complaints themselves or pass them on to the Admiralty. In Australia the Government of the day adopted a similar system, and' created Welfare Committees and Advisory Committees. owing to the fact that they have to submit the whole of their grievances to the Welfare Committee, which is composed of officers, they are deprived of the opportunity of getting them remedied, because, if it suits them to do so, the officers refuse to pass the complaints on to the Naval Board and the Minister. they have decided-unanimously to ask the Naval Board and the Minister to receive them direct, without any intervention on the part of Welfare Committee; but it is surprising to learn that the Board and the Minister have refused to receive any one representing the lower deck ratings for the purpose of hearing their grievances. The men, on being informed, in reply to their request, that they could place their grievances before Welfare Committee, which would thereupon forward them to the Naval Board for consideration, said that they did not propose to do so, because they did not believe they could get a fair deal from the officers, and that they preferred to go straight to the Minister or the Naval Board. The Board then stated that they were prepared to receive one or two representatives of the Advisory Committee to show reasons why it . should receive them. I want honourable members to note the absurdity of the position. These men were to be allowed to meet the Board merely to advance reasons why they should be received by it, but they were not to be allowed to put their grievances before it. In this matter the Minister for the Navy( Mr Laird Smith) had an opportunity of making a name for himself by getting away from the old red-tape system, which has been in vogue in British naval affairs for centuries; but with a great deal of regret I have to say that he is merely allowing himself to be a creature in the hands of his officers and the members of the Naval Board, who have utterly failed to realize that as a result of the great world war new ideas prevail to-day. They do not see that they must get away from the old system, which prevented the man on the lower deck from approaching any one except his immediate superior, and would only allow his representations to eventually reach the head of the Department after they had passed through all the various steps of the ladder from that immediate But the men complain that, superior officer upwards. The old ideas have been exploded by the war, and it is surprising to me that an Australian Minister for the Navy should still be prepared to allow them to continue in force in Australia, especially when we know that the British Admiralty have broken away from them. to cut away all the old red-tape which bound down the Service hand and foot. I have with me a reprint from Ashore and Afloat, a journal dealing with nautical and naval matters in Great Britain, which has on it a photograph bearing the following inscription: Lower deck deputation arriving at Whitehall to see the Lords of the Admiralty. Such a deputation is unprecedented -in the history of the Navy. The letterpress contains the following:The Admiralty, for the first time in history, received a deputation representing all lower deck ratings. The deputation attended at Whitehall at the invitation of the Board, and consisted of twenty-one advisory members of the Lower Deck"" Inter-Port Welfare Committee. see? First Sea Lord, received the deputation, and the interview, we are told, lasted two and three-quarter hours. The hero of Jutland, the idol of the British Navy, the .man who had done his part nobly and well, and but for whose efforts the German Navy might be riding triumphant in the North Sea to-day, received these men without any intermediary. The man who did the fighting raised no question of red-tape or dignity. With him it was simply a matter endeavouring to rectify grievances. were dealt with at tbe deputation?",22,Sugar Supplies To The Public

But the main point is that the First Sea Lord received a deputation representative of the lower deck ratings without any intermediary. I have no desire to make a long speech, or to go into details of the matters, about which the men complain'. It is sufficient for me to say that there is tation of these men, listen to their discontent among the lower deck ratings in the Australian Navy, and to point out thai! when similar discontent arose in the British Navy the British Admiralty took the sensible course of allowing the men to go immediately to the First Sea Lord and place their grievances before him. In Australia they are not permitted to take similar action. Surely what is good ' enough for the British Admiralty should be good enough for Australian Admiral's. is good enough for Admiral' Beatty,, surely it should be good enough for our Minister for the Navy( Mr Laird Smith). The men who did the fighting in the last great war realize how important it is that the grievances of the lower naval ratings should be redressed. honourable member desires to follow precedent; but in other cases he wishes to make precedent. politan in my views. I do not believe in tying myself down to precedent. If there be any good precedent in Great Britain, I am prepared to follow it. But I am not so silly as to suggest that I am possessed of all the ability in the world, or of all the truth in the world. Whereever I see anything which is good I am prepared to accept it. It is all very well for the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) to laugh, but he would laugh upon the other side of his face should it be found in the not distant future that our Australian Navy is undermanned and understaffed! owing to discontent in the service. It is a fact that men will not join that service to-day, and' that those who have joined it are deserting it by dozens. One of the reasons why I have brought this matter forward is because of the enormous number of desertions that have taken place from the Australian Navy since the return of the Fleet to home waters. Mr E'ECEY -Hundreds of mem in the service wish to retire-. sire to get out of it because their grievances are not being remedied. Hereis an opportunity for the Minister for the Navy. tobreak away from the old red-tape system. Let him receive a depugrievances, and see if he eannot remedy them. .

If the course which I have outlined was good enough for Earl Beatty to. follow, surely it is good enough for the Minister for the If the practice Navy and the Navasl Board of the Commonwealth. The future of Australia assuredly depends upon the strength of its defence upon the watery and! thenecessity for that defence, may arise maeL sooner than quite a number of us anticipate. At such a time, to whom shall we look?: Shall we not look to the men of the' Australian Navy ?' If that be so,, surely we are not asking toomuch in a democratic country like this when we ask that the Ministershall cut himself free from the old system of red-tape, and listen to the grievances of these men I We all know that the Australian temperament is vastly different from the temperaments of other nations. As a rule, the Australian is an individual whocannot be bullied; or bounced; but if he be handled with a little tact, a great deal may be accomplished. Knowing the Minister as I do, I feel sure that had he allowed himself to get aiway from theamtiquated system of red-tape by receiving thelower naval ratingsof whom I . am speaking, nothing but good would have resulted from his action. I would urge upon the honourable gentleman the need for making a final effort to burst these red-tape bonds, with a view to doing justice to the lower-deck ratings of the Australian Navyam very pleased that my honourable friend",23,Sugar Supplies To The Public

42,Mr West (East Sydney) [3.6],"Ihas brought under the notice of the House Board. I have received a great deal of correspondence on behalf of the lowerdeck ratings of the Australian Navy, and I believe that you, sir-lik e a good many other honourable members-a t one time in your career, had a considerable experience of seafaring life. Those honourable members who are acquainted with that l if e realize the domineering and unChristianlike methods which are adopted in dealing with our seamen; and, as a result, desire, whenever the opportunity occurs, to do something for them. Like my honourable friend, I contend that the Naval defence of Australia must be our first line of defence. The action of the Naval Board is entirely out of sympathy with t i e aspirations of the Australian people. The members of no other service in Australia are subject to the disabilities to which our naval men are subjected. They are not allowed to approach members of Parliament with their grievances, or to express themselves in the same way as are ordinary citizens. If they have any complaints to make against the Board or their officers. object? the Ministerf o r the Navy asking a questo be treated. tion of that sort. Can a sailor come into ought to be no'Naval Board, but a strong m y presence and lay his grievances beMinister, who would decline to be a mere fore me? Surely the Minister is unfit ereature of the permanent service, confor his position if he holds such views as his interjection suggests. If the honnever had a Ministerf o r the Navy who orable gentleman really entertains such has had the courage to ' ' stand u p "" to opinions, he is unfit to be in charge of the Board. the fine men of whom the Australian changes are being made in the Naval reguNavy is composed. I hold that the Auslations every day, anrd the conditions are tralian sailor should -possess equal such as make it a pleasure to the men to privileges w i th every other citizen of the obey and salute their officers, whom they community. Some time ago, the Naval feel to be worthy of the respect shown Board issued regulations under which them. I feel quite sure that the Minister married men were not required to belong for the Navy himself ( Mr Laird Smith), to the sailors' mess on the ship. They if he were one of them, would refuse to were'allowed Is. 8d. a day, because they salute an officer who, in his opinion, was could go home and have, their meals with not watching over the interests of the Sertheir families; but that allowance has been vice. If the honourable gentleman were taken away, and they have now to take with the Labour party still, he would be their meals in the-mess. This alteration one of the first to take the course that I did not include the officers. Week3 ago am taking to-day. In this I am a folI wrote to the Naval Boardi n reference lower of "" Admiral Mahony,"" 'the honorto the matter, but have received no reply, able member for Dalley. and that is not treatment to be meted out to any parliamentary representative. This you hold? autocratic crowd has not the courtesy to file action of the Naval reply ifco letters, and, although I spoke to Ihe Minister about the mai/tar, I got no satisfaction. The members of the Naval Board seem to forget that they are nothing more than members of the Public Service, as is shown by the fact that when they are in harbour they are given a salute of fifteen guns, with a view, no doubt, to waking u p the officers on the ship, and intimating to the men that they must keep their mouths shut when the members are on board. Day after day desertions are taking place, and, in view'of the conditions that prevail, men deserting w ill certainly have my assistance. I should not have the spirit of manhood if I did not assist men suffering under such cruel and unjust treatment. W h y cannot the sailors be allowed to interview me in the same way as soldiers do? Sof a r as I know, there is no regulation preventing soldiers from interviewing me; if there is the soldiers take no notice of it . The sailor, however, is an obedient, disciplined creature; but, obedient as he may be, he cannot be expected to follow tyrannical commands which seem to be actuated by stupidity. I suppose there can be no chance until there fe a change of Government.

Honourable members are laughing, but this is a matter too serious for ridicule. I quite admit that we cannot have a Navy without discipline; at tbe same time, we cannot expect men to be obedient unless their officers are worthy of their respect. The members of the Naval Board have an idea that they are the autocrats of the Navy, and that to their sole control the Navy should be l e f t ; they, evidently think that, beyond paying the necessary taxation, the people should have'no voice in the management of naval matters. The Minister .ought to be strong enough to call the members of the Board together to-morrow, and say to them, "" Gentlemen, you have to carry out the w ill of the people of Australia, who find the money to pay your salaries; you are public servants just as are the employees in any other Department of the Commonwealth."" If that were done, I believe the members of the Board would give loyal obedience, just as they would to any regulation issued by the Government. Until we have on the Ministerial benches determined men, strong in the principles of Democracy we can never have a good Navy. A number of my friends are naval men, and, with my love for the Service, it pains me that the sailors are not allowed to see me when they wish. If one of the men wishes to See me he sends a boy to ring my bell, and I have to go down the street to talk to him.

One day, when he was at the fence speaking to some of the boys, an officer. came up and asked him-, "" W h y are you talking to those boys? "" My friend replied, "" M in d your own business; I am on the King's highway. If the boys speak to me I 'shall reply to them."" that the officer walked away, saying, "" I suppose you are that fellow West."" That illustrates the view held by these petty officers,. because I have had the courage to stand up against Ministers and others in defence of proper treatment of the men, whether they are on ships or in anv other service of the State. able member's time has expired. this afternoon will be the means of remedying evils that actually exist, and badly need remedying. I believe it is in the power of the Minister, if he has the courage, to remove these evils, and make the Navy of Australia one of which we can be proud. Personally, I should have liked longer notice that this motion was to be moved, so that I could make inquiries in order to find out exactly the case from the men's stand-point. I must admit that there is a slight discontent, so far as I know it , in the lower deck, but not the rampant discontent described by. the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony). The point seems to be that the men wish to get to the very head of the Department in order to place their grievances before him. In looking at a matter such as this, I always endeavour to place myself in the position of the head of the Department, the Minister. If one does that, it is brought home to him at once that it would be absolutely impossible for the Minister to administer his portfolio if he interviewed every man and officer of the Royal Australian Navy having a grievance. It could not be done; but I cannot see why representatives of the men could not, for instance, The interview the First Naval Member, A d miral Grant, a very fine officer, who, like will be remembered, I think, Earl Beatty, fought in the Battle of Jutland. I should like to hear what the M i nister has to say to that suggestion.

48,Mr Marks (Wentworth) [3.21],"looked to the Naval Board to settle these difficulties. There has been a good deal of talk on this motion, hut no very concrete case has been made out. I join with honourable members on the other side of the House in asking the Minister to do everything possible to alleviate and wipe out any discontent that exists in the Fleet, by seeing whether some modus operandi cannot be found to enable the men to see the First Naval Member, Admiral Grant, or the Second Naval Member, Captain Hardy. I have great respect for those two gentlemen, because they know their jobs, and are out to make the Australian Fleet as successful a6 possible. If they could see the men, I think all our troubles would be ended; but something like that will have to be done, because I do not want to see even a simmer of discontent. I want to see the men happ)', because we all realize that we must keep up our Fleet, no matter how small it may be for the time being, and we want to see every officer and man on those ships happy. From the absolutely square deals which I have had from the Minister for the Navy in the many cases I have brought before him, I feel sure that he is out to make our Fleet a happy one, and that Admiral Grant and Captain Hardy are out to assist him. Surely the three of them can hit on some avenue through which this difficulty can be got over. Personally, I am dead against the Minister, the political head of the Naval Board, interviewing every man and every officer in the Fleet, because in ninety-nine cases out of 100 the Minister is not a practical seafaring man. The men might get at him and talk him round, but they cannot talk round the First Naval Member or the Second Naval Member. It may be said that the men would be got at by the First or Second Naval Member, but the M i nister is there, and he knows what is going ' on. I am not speaking personally about the present Minister( Mr Laird Smith) ; but if the Minister for the Navy does not know what is going on he has no right to hold the job. From what I know of the many cases I have brought before him, he does know what is going on. In one particular case, he reversed the decision of the Naval Board on a very important matter which I brought before him . It was the first matter I put before him, and my experience gave me. every confidence that he was watching affairs very closely. I know he has a long statement to make this afternoon, and in conjunction with the honourable members who have already spoken on the other side of the House, I urge him now to try to get over the present position, and settle it once and for all by giving an assurance that some means will be found by which the men's grievances, whatever they may be, will be immediately attended to. I have judged it rightly, the position is that the men on the lower deck have appointed an Advisory Committee to represent them and ventilate their grievances; that Committee has requested .an interview with .the members of the Naval Board, and the Naval Board have refused to be in terviewed, telling the men that their representations must be made through the officers, and that some officer must plead their case. We all know that no officer is competent to plead the .case for the lower deck. He does not understand their grievances, or the situation generally, and the men have not sufficient confidence in any officer's ability to plead their case for them. Admira l Grant, or other members of the Board, probably imported men, with old ideas of subserviency and so-called discipline, and a fixed belief instilled into their minds that the lower deck man is only there to fight, ancl is not supposed to have any grievances, have most likely considered it beneath their dignity that the men should he permitted to enter their presence. It is time we had a Minister who would say to the Naval Board, "" It is your business to meet and interview the Advisory Committee of the lower deck, and to see that there is no discontent among the men."" I am flooded with letters from lads who want to get out of the Navy. deserting wholesale. complaining about their treatment. It is absurd that in Australia, in the twentieth century, the men should be denied the opportunity of approaching either the Minister or the Naval Board. They do not want to approach them as individuals. tion.",26,Sugar Supplies To The Public

I have seen enough as a member of the Australian Imperial Force to satisfy me on that point. Imperial Force was governed by the King's Regulations, which were obsolete,, having been framed' at least 100 years before. .There is a spirit of subserviency running right through the King's Regulations, and under fern the man in the ranks has no rights whatever. We desire that the Australian Navy shall be efficient, hut we shall never get efficiency unless we have contentment. It is impossible to-day to induceboys tojoin the Australian Navy. One of the causes, of this is that the Navy isseething: with discontent. These men, acting in; a. proper manner, appointeda committee from thelower deck,, and they asked, the Naval Board to receive them, and to listen to their grievances. No fairer request could have been made; and I hope that the Minister; whois new to his position, will be firm enough to insist that the Naval Board, shall meet the representatives of the men, listen to their grievances, and take every reasonable step to insure that we shall have' in the service a contented body of men. It is, to say the least, most peculiar that the men on the lower deck of the Australian Navy are not permitted', to place their grievances directly before the Naval. BoardI have before me a, copy of Ashore and Afloat,, in which there appears a picture of a body of men of the lower deck ratings marching to Whitehall to place their views before the Admiralty.

He is a big man in every sense of the word. He was present at the Battle of Jutland, fighting side by side with Lord Beatty. Let me tell honourable members what was put up to me, and what we had to do. This was the Naval Board's reply to the request by the men for an interviewThe Naval Board, after due consideration, decided that the Board could not meet the Advisory Committee, as a Board, but were prepared to agree that one or two members of the Naval Board should meet the representatives of the Advisory Committee. -""Who are the members of the Naval Board? one. whole of the letter here, and 1 shall give it to honourable members. Percy Grant, I Temind tbe House, occupies precisely tbe same' position as the First Sea Lord of the Admiralty. men of the British Navy, to whom the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Page) has referred, did not see the political heads of the Department at all. They made no attempt to do that. They saw the First Sea Lord. Grant, as one member of the Naval Board, is prepared to do that. For the information of honourable members. I shall read the whole of the letter to which I have already referredTheNaval Board, after due consideration, decided that the. Board could not meet the Advisory Committee, as a Board, but were prepared to agree that one or two members of the Naval Board should meet members of the Advisory Committee. It was intended, if this meeting took place, to reaBsure the Advisory Committee on the points they raised, and to inform them of the action the Board proposed to take to insure that all the papers, presented at this year's Welfare Committee, Bhould reach the Naval Board and be duly considered by that Board. No w what was the arrangement made? I went so f a r as to say that when the A d visory Committee and the Welfare Committee met we would provide the services' of a shorthand writer to take a record of the proceedings, transcribe it , and sub-, mit it to me as a member of the Naval Board, over which I preside. If the men interviewed the BoardI would be obliged, if necessary, to see every officer and every man in the Australian Navy. Even now I am working day and night. Very few honourable members realize what it means to supervise tbe expenditure of £3,250,000 provided on this year's Estimates for the Navy. ' The other day I bad submitted to me a statement from a company in which I have been interested for the last twenty-five years, intimating that they propose to increase their capital by £3,000,000. The affairs of the company are controlled by a Board of twelve, directors, whereas I have to administer the whole of the Department and supervise its expenditure.. In view of these facts I ask any reasonable person how could I possibly, in addition to my ordinary duties, interview ' all Admira l Sir Percy Grant is the officers and men of the Australian Navy. A t times I have to turn away my personal friends, among them. I have the my constituents, because, owing to tlie pressure of iny official duties, I cannot A d m i r a l Sir possibly see them. SinceI have been the administrative head of ' tbe Department I have not been one day absent The -from the Navy Office, except on one holiday, and even then I took matter to my private residence for perusal. Under these conditions I could not possibly give personal attention to the grievances of the lower ratings. Admiral What are the men asking for? Let us see what is behind this request. I was delighted to hear the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Page) say he did not believe in political influence in Naval administration. W h y should any men on the lower deck, because they happento know the Minister, or a member of Parliament, be able to see him, and perhaps go over the beads of superior officers who have not any political influence? While I am Minister, no man in tbe lower ratings, or officer either for that matter, is going to do that. I desire that every man shall get a fair. deal. Let me tell honourable members what was done by the Naval BoardThe Naval Board considered the situation, and decided that the Commodore Superintendent should interview the chairman of the Advisory Committee and ascertain and report personally to the Board the reasons for the attitude taken up by that Commit-",29,Sugar Supplies To The Public
73,Mr Mahoht,"Read on, please.",30,Sugar Supplies To The Public
74,,"Mr LAIRDSMITHtee. This was done, and the Commodore reported the reasons put forward by -the Committee, which were as follows:(1) They were not satisfied that all the papers regarding the representation' made at last year's Conference were seen by the Naval Board or the Minister for the Navy. (2) They considered that it was dmpossible for a naval officer to clearly state the case for the lower deck, and they were of the opinion that their case would be more effective if dealt with direct with the Naval Board and tlie Minister than through an intermediary. (3) They desired to see the Minister for the Navy(a) to insure the Minister being placed in' possession of first-hand knowledge of finanevery claim received, and how each cial questions raised; (6) to insure that the full facts as stated in the papers are brought to the notice of the Minister and the Naval Board; (e) in order that urgent attention may he given to questions of an urgent nature, particularly the questions regarding pay. It was considered that much time would be wasted in putting these questions through the Welfare Committee. (4) They considered that the press should be present at their interview with the Minister. I ask any honourable member who has had shall now read the present Treasurer ( Sir Ministerial experience how it would be Joseph Cook) must take a share of the possible for me to consent to that? would be impossible for me to carry out my duties. The statement continuesA Navy Order was published on 5th follow:August, directing that the election of representatives should take place forthwith, and outlining the manner in which representatives of the various branches were to be selected. In pursuance of this Navy Order, the men's representatives were assembled in August for at the time tlie increase was granted. The inpreliminary discussion. They then returned creases include increases in pay to ranks and to their respective ships and establishments,, ratings generally, increase in various allowin order to get in touch with the men they ances for extra duty and qualifications, and inrepresented.

Meanwhile the trol of the Navy Department I have Welfare Committee of five officers was selected, and the first sitting of the Committee, when the worked at all times with the best interests welfare and Advisory Committee should meet, of the men 'at heart. I have always been was arranged to take place ori 14th October. Before this date arrived, however, the Adhope to remain one. It is cruel, therevisory Committee informed the Commodore fore, for any honourable member to make Superintendent that they did not propose to statements such as have been made this meet the Welfare Committee, but requested permission to meet direct the Naval Board and the Minister for the Navy. They also asked that the press should be present at all the meetings, quoting the "" Jerram"" Committee. That was a Committee which dealt solely w it h finance. There was not a Minister present at its deliberations. The statement 'has been made in this House that, when the Board met last year, and the men's case came before it for consideration, that was the end of it . I hold in my hand a printed document which was circulated throughout the Navy. It sets for th particulars of how each case was dealt with by the Board; it indicates the reception which matter was finalized. No less than f if t y items were approved of, all of which were of great importance. In the time at m y disposal I have been unable to secure information concerning the exact amount involved; but the Third Naval Member, who is responsible for the matter of expenditure, has stated that I would be justified in saying that thousands of pounds have been spent, since the Welfare Committee first met, in improving accommodation for tlie men, and in making their conditions generally better. Again, here are facts which speak for themselves; and I wish to say that in relation to the document which I credit for the increases granted during I say you could. the period of his control of the Navy Department. The amounts involved per annum in general increases to ranks and ratings of the Royal Australian Navy from the dates shown are' as From 1st January, 1918, f105,000; from 1st April, 1919, £103,000 and £18,000 (additional), total, £121,000; grand total, £226,000.

All applications in this respect axe carefully examined, and if it is shown that any man is getting less than that to which he is entitled-less Committee considers fair and reasonable -his grievance will be remedied. Extension of time The Advisory Committee is ""composed of twenty-four, and not of twenty-three, persons. There is also a committee of officers. This body first meets to consider a specific matter. Then the Advisory Committee sits and sets for th in writing its views on the matter under consideration. The two bodies subsequently sit j o in t l y ; and so the question at issue is discussed between the members of the Advisory Committee and of the Welfare Committee. The business is finally embodied in a report, and thus comes before tbe Naval Board. Owing to my various duties I am unable to preside at every meeting of the Board. I may mention that I d i d not attend one meeting at which the matter of the AmeliaJ . was under discussion. My reason for absenting myself was that that vessel was owned by a gentleman in my constituency. The Board had a free hand to act, and it did so. The Board very much regrets that it became necessary to dissolve the Advisory Committee. This necessity arose for the reason that the Committee was holding everything up. I quote the following circular: Tie Board, in dissolving tbe Advisory Committee, directed that the snips' companies of all ships and establishments should be informed that the work of the Welfare Committee this year would be seriously handicapped because Mr Laird Smith. of the attitude taken up by the men's accredited representatives in declining to meet the Welfare Committe and discuss the requests put forward. The Board further gave instructions that the Welfare Committee were to proceed at once to consider the requests relating to general questions; and, with the object of specially expediting consideration of questions relating to pay and allowances, it was arranged 1918. 1919. that the Advisory Committee's recommendaPer Per tions of this nature should be referred direct diem. diem, to a separate Pay Committee sitting in Mels. d. s. d. bourne. The two Committees were authorized ..

If tee. The Welfare Committee was instructed to direccommence sitting on 27th October, 1920. The Pay Committee held its first meeting in E.M.A. Naval DepSt, Williamstown, on 29th October. There is a Committee now sitting I am pleased to see that evidence has been given, and it will be considered by the Board just the same as if it were submitted by the Advisory Committee. Admiral Grant and CaptainHardy have than the never refused to meet the men to find out why they will hot meet the Welfare Comimittee, and they are always prepared to granted. consider grievances submitted through the right channel.

I am not going to deceive the men, and I have informed them that if the Advisory Committee will meet the Welfare Committee, a disinterested shorthand writer will be in attendance at the meeting to record the proceedings, and thus place me in possession of the facts. If that course is adopted I have agreed to carefully peruse the notes, and I feel sure that when this proposal is submitted to the members of the rank and file they will readily see that I am desirous of giving them a fair deal.",31,Sugar Supplies To The Public

113,Mr Makin (Hindmarsh) [4.21],"Ieighteen associated private hanks of Australia, namely, the Australian Bank of Commerce; the Bank of Adelaide; the Bank of Australasia;, the Bank of New South ""Wales;. the Bank of New Zealand; the Bank of Queensland; the Bank of Victoria; the Commercial Bank of Australia; the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney; the Commercial Bank of Tasmania; the English, Scottish, and Australian Bank; the London Bank of Australia; the National Bank of Australasia ; the National' Bank of New Zealand; the Queensland National Bank; the Royal Bank of. Australia; the Union Bank of Australia; and the Western Australian Bank, have a total paid-up capital of £25,442,390,. on which, in the last financial year, they paid dividends totalling £2,617,826, and earned also undivided, profits totalling £941,985, their aggregate profits for the year being £3,559,811, or 13.9 per cent. on. their paid-up capital. in those banks received only the same interest on their capital as ordinary depositors receive, namely, 3-J per cent., the total profits of the banks would have been only £890,4S4. Therefore, had the Commonwealth Bank been in supreme control of our finances, and had it possessed a banking monopoly, the community would have made a saving of £2,669,327. That is what could have been saved if the financial magnates and banking institutions of this country had been given only the consideration of ordinary citizens; instead of being allowed the special privilege of operating in public finance, and making huge profits. Leaving that phase of the question, I come now to deal with loans. I find that a very considerable saving might also have been made if the Commonwealth Bank had bsen intrusted with the flotation of the whole of our loans. According to. the Budget, the total loans floated by the Commonwealth amount to £219,800,000. I asked the Treasurer recently for a statement of the average percentage of cost for the flotation of loans, and after making all calculations necessary, I find that by the flotation of loans through the medium of the average cost has been 5s. 9d. per cent, of the loans floated. In order that honourable members may have some idea of the way we are imposed upon Mr Makin. by Imperial financiers when floating loans on behalf of the Commonwealth, I refer, them, to the Commonwealth YeastBook for 1918. In trying to discover a basis for a calculation as to the charge made for the flotation of loans for Australia on the London money market, I found that I could only institutea comparison by a reference to the cost of floating two loans, amounting to £12,000,000, on behalf of certain States of the Commonwealth. The flotation expenses of these loans amounted altogether to £466,429,. which represents £3 16s. per cent., as against 5s. 9d.. per cent, in the case of loans floated by the Commonwealth Bank. It 23 clear from the figures that if the total loans floated for Australia,, amounting to £219,800,000,. had been floated by private institutions,, at the same cost for flotation, as that charged for the State loans to which I have just Had the shareholders referred, the Commonwealth would have been involved in an extra expense of £7,720,475. Earlier in the debate, the Treasiirer ( Sir Joseph Cook) appeared! to desire to know in what way the Commonwealth Bank had been, of special advantage to the people, and .1 direct his attention to this particular instanceknow that it has been of inestimable advantage to the people. the right honourable gentleman's opinion of the Commonwealth Bank is decidedly different to-day from that which he held at the time it was established. Treasurer found it very difficult to say a good word for the Commonwealth Bank in 1912, when it was established. orable member that if we were beginning; the matter again to-day, I should make the same criticism. sistent with the admission which the right honourable gentleman has just made.

138,Mr Makin,"a find' that in 1901recognise how essential it is to evolve some means whereby the country may be relieved of those burdens which give no direct return to the community. honourable member has written all this to Mr Theodore and to Mr John Storey. to do not require information on this subject. They are well informed as to the. necessity for the institution of a National Bank of exchange and reserve, so that we may have a complete monopoly of that which to-day is controlling the people. nothing of the kind, and they are borrowing for their lives. terms upon which some State loans have heen, and are being, floated. I think that there is a great wrong done to the people when there is any exemption from taxation in respect to the charge for the flotation of loans. In this regard I might point out that when people of financial resources had the opportunity of investing in a loan hearing 5 per cent, interest subject to taxation, or 4$ per cent, interest private, made profits during the war. free of taxation, they rushed the 4£ per cent, stock, recognising that it would relieve them of snaring in the burden of taxation that must be imposed to meet the accruing interest on these loans, which is mounting higher from year to year. find that, in regard to our sixth war loan, subscribers to the 4^ per cent, bonds free of income tax applied for £36,325,130, while those who preferred 5 per cent, bonds subject to the payment of income tax applied for £6,526,830. I understand that the amount of taxation represented by the exemption of the 4 i per cent, interest payable on bonds is .75 per cent., and as the amount subscribed to our loan issues at 4-J per cent, is £143,269,337, the total loss of revenue suswhich is mounting up as the result of the tained by making this exemption is no less than £1,074,520 per annum. Thus it can clearly be seen that the notation of loans at a lower rate of interest free from taxation is not a, sound principle to adopt, irrespective of the party that may have instituted it . in New South Wales was made free of taxation. Government of New South Wales is pre-, pared to exempt the interest earned on its latest loan does not alter the merits of the principle, which, on the figures I have just given, must stand condemned. The large financial corporation and insurance societies who have invested in our 4£ per cent, loans are able to evade their obligation to subscribe to the revenue of this country by making use of this side door, which enables those who accept a lower rate of interest on their war bonds to escape the liability to pay income taxation. When the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Tudor) was speaking, the Treasurer interjected that the Commonwealth Bank had, during the war, made greater profits I do not approve of the than other banks had made, possibly seeking in some way to condone the offence of the private banks in having made such profits during the currency of the war. bers had been attacking the private banks for making profits, and I merely desired to show that all banks, Government and right honourable gentleman interjected in that way, unless his purpose was to condone the action of the private banks in making profits during the war. I debate honourable members have been trying to set the Commonwealth Bank against private banks. It is a very reprehensible practice. put the Commonwealth Bank in the position it should occupy, and secure the people against financial ruin, headlong into which the accruing interest on loans, application of injudicious methods of raising money for the purpose of carrying on the affairs of this country, is plunging them. Although the Commonwealth Bank has reserved profits amounting to £2,363,500, representing the advance made from 1912, there is a decided difference between the profits made by it and those made by private banks. Its profits belong to the people; they are a financial resource from which the nation",37,Commonwealth Bank Bill Second Reading

Reformi n this direction can be brought about without any injustice being done. The party to which I belong do not stand for repudiation of any r i g h t f u l or moral obligations to which the country has committed itself, and, personally, I would not repudiate any obligation which it is rightly our due to recognise and acknowledge. A t all times I shall endeavour to pay 20s: in the £ 1 to those persons who are justly entitled to make a claim either upon myself or upon any organization in which I have a controlling influence at the time it is made. Nevertheless I hold that, instead of the persons who are interested in private banks and financial institutions being able to make 13.9 per cent, on their investments, as the result of advantages bestowed by the nation at large, they should be placed on the same footing as other persons in the community who desire to deposit money in a bank, by being paid the same rate of interest, viz., 3^ per cent. This would mean a direct saving to the nation, and instead of finance controlling the people, the people would control finance. To the position as I find it deed applicableThen an herald cried aloud, "" To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages, That at what time ye hear the sound of I know that the people the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall clown and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the King hath set up."" The Commonwealth and other Governments to-day are commanding the people I believe that there to f a l l down and worship the golden idol of wealth by placing at its disposal undue advantages from those things D o e s the right honorwhich the people produce. It is about time we swept from the temple of the nation the money-changers who have brought such corrupt influences into the affairs of the nation, and instituted an economic system which has brought the people to a lower social standard than they have previously reached.

I propose to address a few words to the Country party in respect to wheat scrip. The holder of wheat scrip who goes to the bank with his scrip will possibly find that the bank is willing to discount it at 5 per cent. But is there any reason why he should not get it discounted at the very minimum of cost""? There is a very low margin, indeed, quite applicable to the operations of private credit, and it certainly is not 5 per cent. W h y should not the primary producer receive the f u l l advantage of that which he produces, instead of being required to pay an exorbitant rate of in terest to private money lenders? for less than 5 per cent. asked the Treasurer a question in regard to this matter, I was assured by h i m that most of the money advanced by the banks",38,Commonwealth Bank Bill Second Reading

When I walked into the Chamber ju3t now, honourable members upon the Ministerial side of the House were murmuring that the statements made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr to issue legal tender, and no provision in Makin) were "" rubbish "" and "" rot."" I then remembered that some of the daily newspapers in commenting upon the statements of the Treasurer the other day affirmed that -they were , marked .by 1 childish ignorance.

In these circumstances I may well be pardoned for making a slight contribution to tbe mass of ignorance This Bill has been introduced by the Treasurer, and it purports to achieve a very simple object, namely, the transfer of the control of our noteissue to the Commonwealth Bank. I have read the measure carefully-it is not often that I read the Bills which are submitted for our consideration-bu t I have read this Bill. To my mind it contains two or three distinct propositions. The first of these concerns the functions of the various Sta-te Governments. The Treasurer, in the course of his speech upon: the motion for the second reading of the Bill, scarcely made any reference to the meaI s the honourable member sure at all. Certainly he made no reference whatever to a very important portion of it-the portion which lays it I am referring to the down that no private banking institution shall give circulation to any currency issued by any State Government. Amongst other things it sets out that(a) A bank shall not issue, or circulate tlie payment of money issued by a State and payable to bearer on demand ; and (6) A note or instrument for the payment of money issued by a State and payable to bearer on demand shall not be a legal tender. I submit that the States have no pow-jr to issue any currency which can be regarded a3 legal tender. That function is exclusively reserved to the Commonwealth under our Constitution. Nothing that the States can do can empower them this Bill can deprive them of any of the rights which they enjoy under our constitution. Paragraph a of proposed new section 60B, which I have just quoted, provides that a bank shall not issue or circulate any note for the payment of money issued by a State, and payable to bearer on demand. That is a roundabout way of imposing restrictions upon the activities of the States. I refer to it specially because it is a demonstration of what a Government can do when it has made up its mind to carry out any particular measure. It is a demonstration that what the Commonwealth Government cannot do directly, or by the processes of the Court-in other words, what it cannot do by the direct use of its instrumentalities, it may do by roundabout methods, or by imposing its authority upon subsidiary institutions in this country. Under this Bill, it seeks to compel the private financial institutions of the Commonwealth to act upon its behalf, and to dp what the Government itself has no power to do. The Commonwealth Government cannot prevent a State Government, from issuing currency upon its own behalf. The Commonwealthhas BO power dtrectly to prevent the States from doing what they wish to do in regard to the issue of currency of -their own, either from the State Treasuries or through the",39,Joseph Cook Nonsense The To Day The Words Of Holy W R I T Are I N

167,Mr Anstey,"Yes, butPxr.ludingSir Australasia, and the English, Scottish, and Australian Banks? English banks' which carry on the bulk of their operations in Australia. There is no sound reason why the proposal should have been withdrawn. It means leaving the reserves of the country absolutely at"" tlie mercy of the private corporations, except so far as they are prepared to use their judgment and exercise a little reason. I repeat that with the clause omitted the Treasury will be left absolutely at the mercy of the banking corporations of Australia. Sir reason why the clause was omitted; it was that such a clause does not find its appropriate place in a transfer measure such as this. but that reason was found out late in the day. When the B ill was introduced it was thought an appropriate one, and only subsequent facts awakened the Treasurer to the contrary. T have said all I have to say about the B ill . Sir one after a l l ! one in its way. The three points are that the BiU takes power to restrict the States in their operations, it demonstrates what the Commonwealth has power to do when it likes, and, at the bidding of the private corporations of the country, the note issue is handed over to a Board of private in dividuals to administer. The Treasurer had very little to say on the B ill , presenting it as merely a machinery proposition and then going on to wider questions. He first of all referred to the American reserve system, and told us that the reserve banks have to hold 40 per cent, of gold. That is true, but not all the truth . The National Reserve Act of America lays it down not only that there shall be a reserve of 40 per cent of gold, but that "" lawful moneys "" shall be regarded as gold in reserve. What is "" l a w f u l moneys"" in America? There is silver, or the silver certificate only redeemable in silver; there is the 20-dollar gold piece, represented by a gold certificate, and then,there comes the greenback, which is still not redeemable in gold. If any one wishes to redeem notes he has to go to the bank, and take a car-load of silver or certificates, a note. The only institution where redemption is possible is the United StatesI include the three of America Treasury, and there you can get gold only if it is available. The private banking corporations in America have established a system under which they do not merely issue notes at the national reserve institution, but is3ue credits, and their main instruments are the cheque issues themselves. The Treasurer quoted Sir Edward Holden, an English banker connected with Parr's Bank. That gentleman, some ten years ago, lectured before bankers at Liverpool on what banking is, and said that that loans are given on the books, and credit is issued by the instrumentality of cheques. Transfer credit is currency, and currency is money, and notes are merely a fractional item of the total currency of the country. A t the commencement of the war the Australian banks held £36,000,000 in gold, and £5,000,000 in Government notes. Last June their gold reserve was only £21,000,000, and the Government notes amounted to £34,000,000. There wa £24,000,000 held in tlie Treasurv, It is a very important s of which something like £15,000,000 came out of circulation. The banks themselves have space for an additional £16,000,000, and on that they have £90,000,000 additional credit. Before the war £800,000,000 worth of cheques passed through the great clearing houses apart from cheques elsewhere, and probably at the end of this year £2,000,000,000 worth of cheques will pass. The private corporations are deriving their interest and their profits, not from gold-no t from anything they have themselves to lendbut because they have had the monopoly privilege of issuing the circulating medium of the country. It has been said, not only by Sir Edward Holden and other high banking authorities, but also by Paul Warburg, the American banker, that the day has long passed when note issues were anything more than a fractional item of the currency of the country. The Treasurer himself, when replying to somebody who spoke in New South Wales, said, "" This gentleman forgets that the inflation of the note issue, so called, is infinitesimal compared with the inflation of credit itself."" If that is so, what are",42,Joseph Cook Nonsense The To Day The Words Of Holy W R I T Are I N

There is nothing to prevent it . L e t the Treasurer advance me, first of all, the £10,000 which it is necessary to put uo as a security before any one can establish a banking corporation or an insurance company in Australia. Once they get a start, that is what it amounts to. Not theorists,, but practical bankers admit it . Schuster, the leading man in the Smith and Union Bank, eays "" the theory of banking is one thing, the practice is quite another. Modern currency is largely a cheque issue."" That only shows what we have to pay for the immense inflation of credit in Australia. If it. does not mean that, what did the Treasurer mean when he spoke of the inflation of credit, first the note issue, and secondly, the inflation of advances which are based upon-what ? What are the deposits based on.? D i d not the Treasurer say the other day that the security for our issues of credit was the actual production of the country? When a farmer raises his crop, or a manufacturer turns out the products of his factory, or when a man seeks an advance, for which he offers his own property to the bank as security, an advance is made upon the crop, or the manufactured products, or the property, or the deeds that represent the property, as the case may be, or an advance is made upon bills which represent commodities in transit. banking institutions themselves write up the deposits. Argus said "" deposits are created every time' an advance is made, by the simple process of writing them up in a book."" That is the fundamental of modern banking. That is the point we have reached tinder the modern system. able member says is all right as far as it goes; but he omits the fact that all the ciedits written up are based upon gold. absolutely no relation to a gold basis today. It is quite true that everything has a relation to something else. If you put a pinch of tea into a pail of water, the water has some relation to the pinch of tea, however little you put in , but the basis is constantly melting away and dwindling. Present conditions are like an inverted pyramid: the inversion is growing greater, and. the point of support is growing smaller. Before the war the banks' reserves of gold were much larger.

We must adopt the methods by which the private banks enabled people to contribute to the war loans. the '£40,000,000 loan was being raised in 1918, a man could go to any of the banks, and, by means of his own security, offering his house of the value of , say, £500, or £500 worth of bonds, which he took up in the previous' loan, obtain from the bank credit for 90 per cent, of his proposed contribution to the new loan, although no more money was put into the bank, and the bank obtained no more supplies of notes. A credit of 90 per cent, of his new contribution was written up by the banks to the taxpayer, and was handsd over to the Commonwealth Government, to be paid for at 5 or 6 per cent, for all eternity.

Under tbe conditions of modern society, this system of advance is entirely distinct from the old method, whereby the Jew or other primitive banker had his gold supplies, or his own primitive notes which represented his gold, and lent out his own actual commodity, for the use of which he charged 5 or 10 per cent. peared. worker on the soil, the farmer, the manufacturer, whosoever has a home-all are the actual suppliers of capital-has go to the private banking corporation and pay annual interest for a circulated currency that represents in essence but the property and security which he himself puts in.

W h y An examination of the should the particular individuals who compose the private bankingr corporationsforhave the power to exploit the people of the country, by means of this monopolisticprivilege? Those men can finance every that institution to which they like to put their hands. What did they do in 1893 in Victoria, when they closed their banks and appropriated the deposits, while at the same time some of them could hold £200,000, £300,000, and even £400,000 in the corporations which they controlled ? a currency of They closed their doors, and ruined, and drove to destitution, misery, dejection, and suicide the people whose _property When they had appropriated.

Some of these men, who wrote off their indebtedness to the communitv in general, and the indebtedness of the institutions which they controlled-som e of them, or their progeny, are amongst the most wealthy in the community to-day. They tell the people that they obtained their money by their own energy and talents, whereas in t r u th they got it only by the maladministration ,and misappropriation of the money of other people.

That is known to be an absolute fact, and tbe power to do that is a power which no few men should have over This vast capitalistic structure, these immense private banking corporations, are controlled by a comparatively few men, not more than 100 in number. Who are these men? They are the men who, on the one hand, control all the metalliferous resources of the country. Turning to the English banks, we find that the men associated with one group control the entire outgoings and incomings of commodities. They control the wool, the wheat-the entire exports and imports of the country. Turn to another group of banks, and you find the men associated with them control tbe tobacco and sugar monopolies of the country. Nearly all the products of the country are in their hands, and whatsoever is not in their hands is subject to their -will. security desires a £10,000 credit in New These are the real tyrants of the country. more powerful even than Governmentsand we are but mere figures strutting on the political stage. There is always some one to look after their interests. When we examine the new industries that are being developed, we find that, whether they relate to metals on the one hand, or to wool on the other, the same littl e group of men controls them. Thus, while we have the outward and visible semblance of a Democracy, Australia is more and more tending to a vast economic despotism. The position of Australia was never more parlous than it is to-day. Our responsibilities are increasing. A vast tide of indebtedness sweeps upon us, growing larger and larger, and the weight of in terest is becoming heavier. The honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) spoke of those who desire to contract the currency. It is true that there are men who would like credits to be contracted. Where do we raise our revenue? Largely through the Customs Department. means of duties imposed on the inflowing goods we raise enormous revenues, with which we have to meet a large proportion of our obligations at home and abroad. If , as the result of restricted credits the market drops, and our imports are enormously reduced, there must be a corresponding decrease in our Customs revenue. Y e t these financial institutions can, and do, restrict credit. What, after all, do we mean by the restriction of credit? Take the case of a man with ample security. He has an enterprise tlie savings of the people. worth thousands of pounds. His business is excellent, and the value of his properties unquestionable. In a free community one woiild expect such a man to be able to get credit from the fiduciary institutions. But' the banks control all 6uch persons. They can advance credit to men of straw-to men with littl e securitywhile, on the other hand, they can drive a man with unquestionable securities out of the market and. ruin him by refusing him the credit necessary to carry on his operations. We read to-day that the banking corporations are taking it upon themselves to refuse the applications of those who wantcredit abroad. They refuse foreign credit for local money.

224,Mr Anstey,"Quite so. I shall getthey had overseas a surplus of practically £50,000,000 at the eud of June last. Between June and September our importations were relatively small. they amounted in value to about £12,000,000, and that may be taken as the monthly average for the quarter ending September last. Sir JOSEPH Cooic -Our exports bad been paid for nearly two years before,, and delivery was merely being taken of them at the time. ports. Is the Treasurer referring to exports from Australia, or to exports from the Old Country? The banks assert that the importations into. Australia have been enormous, and that the exports for the most part now taking place were paid for long ago; but the fact remains that the imports for the three months ending September last averaged only something like £12;.000,O0O per month, or a total of £36,000,000, so that they must still have a very considerable credit in London.. I do not say that the banks are not justified in the attitude they are taking up, but they ought to give us the actual facts. honourable member i& trying to establish is that the banks have, lying idle in, London, something like £30,0,00,000, and are not prepared to use it in order to make more money. is for me to make my own statement, in my own way. I ' know very weli that the hanks take care to use whatever money they have, no matter, where it may be. I am not even saying that the banks, in refusing credits, are not doing what is right for the protection of Australian interests,, as well as their own; but I do say it not a fact that if a country is flooded that when they are asked for an explanation they should state the actual facts. The actual fact is that they are feeling the pressure of the obligations which they have to meet on behalf of the Commonwealth and State Governments. They do not know how to meet them. It is these obligations that are mopping up their surplus of credits in London. It is not the immensity of our imports, or the fact that a large proportion of the produce we are now exporting was paid for long ago, that is responsible for the attitude of the [258] banks. The fact is that the expenditure of the States and the Commonwealth obr ligationswhich the banks, have to meet .in In July, London are so immense that they are anxiousto grasp all they can, and to get into London all the surplus credits .ia order to fulfil what is. undoubtedly a very proper function-. My complaint is, however, that the real facts are not given to the people of Australia. The honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) has referred to the expansion and contraction of currency.. It is quite true that, at the present moment, many financial institutions are trying to contract the currency. It was stated the other day in a New York newspaper that the contraction of credit there had immensely reduced prices, since it had compelled many persons to flood the markets with their goods. The particular industrial enterprises concerned were unable to get -any credit, no matter what security they had to offer. They could not secure the circulating medium {rem the banks, and were compelled, therefore, to throw their commodities on the market. Such a situation is disastrous to any country, and a sudden and immense drop in prices would be disastrous to Australia. Reference has been made to the inflation of the currency. I agree with the Treasurer. Private institutions, not the Government of the country, control the expansion or contraction of credit and the note issue. And then we are told that, because of bhe effect of this enormous increase in currency and this inflation of credit, the only way to save the country and to get things cheaply is to have no money at all! I am not going to argue that. I am not going to discuss the effects of contraction or inflation of currency. But is with a particular commodity, it is supposed to become cheap to the people? Isi t not a fact that prices fall in an inverse ratio to the inflation of currency, so that by enormously increasing the output of the particular commodity it becomes cheaper? If this be true, why is it that at this particular hour, with this enormous inflation of our currency, money has never been so dear in our lifetime? If these theories be'correct, and if there is so much money about that people do not know what to do with it,",48,Joseph Cook I T Is Only A Littl E

As a matter of fact, it has nothing whatever to do with the case. you compare notes with potatoes. Does not the same argument apply ? It is not a question of commodity. The argument now appears to be that when a thing depreciates, it gets dearer. That is the first time. I have heard that. The Treasuirer should reconcile his arguments. You cannot circulate more gold or notes than the people of a country want. This is one of the reasons why I have always objected to such an enormous increase in our note issue. I have always held that there was no need to over-issue our currency by £30,000,000, because a note issue is only justified by the country's need for counter change and wage payments. I have already explained, wag to enable dialogue. the Government to carry on the public works of the States. notes have simply circulated through the House divided. ordinary trade channels and gone back into the reservoirs of the private banks.

I am not saying that. I am saying that what you want behind the note issue is value-it does not matter whether it is wheat or bonds, so long as it is good value.

245,Sir Joseph Cook (Parramatta,"and the Bank to the extent indicated in the amendment. do not like the proposal of the Government to hand over the Commonwealth note issue to a board of directors. would prefer to see control in the hands of a public servant-a n official in a posiof one person being given control of our tion similar to that of the manager of a bank. I question the wisdom of placing our note issue under other than individual control. When the Commonwealth Bank was established, numbers of honourable members opposite expressed the view that its management should be undertaken by a board of directors. Labour party strongly objected. Its members held that individuals upon a board were more prone to look after the interests of themselves and their friends than to regard national interests. Boards of directors are merely ornamental. They have no real control over the welfare of the great institutions of thiB country. By way of example, I mention four leading concerns, namely, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the Bank of New South Wales, the Australian Mutual Provident Society, and Burns, Philp, and Company. The Australian Mutual Provident Society has .a board of directors, hut the board does not control the society. The man at the helm, -and solely responsible, has been Mr Teece. I have had occasion to consult the manager of the Bank of New South Wales, and I am sure that the actual guidance and control of that institution has resided in the person of Mr Russell French. No honourable member will deny that the moving spirit in the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the man who rules, is Mr Knox. In tbe firm of Burns, Philp, and Company the syth. 'He was the strong man, who would allow nobody else to interfere in the management. I recall that there was a former senator who occupied a seat on the board of management of all four of those institutions which I have quoted; but such a small part did he take in their control and management that he was able to absent himself in England for-twelve months, and no one of those concerns was the worse off. What effect could he have had upon their management and control even when he was attending the board meetings? Boards of directors are really a source of danger, because they are apt to bring to bear upon the affairs of their institution purely personal interests and influence. Strong individual management is required to resist and counteract I their sometimes sinister intent. I hope the Government will accept the principle note issue. 'Two outside persons are proposed to be appointed to the board. Their natural inclination, I fear, will be to regard the interests of their friends rather than the national welfare. Moreover, there will be no real work for them to do. I cannot understand the acquiescence of the the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) in the creation of this proposed board, in view of the following remarks which he made when speaking upon the Commonwealth Bank Billi n this chamber, in November, 1011:No institution has been more admirably managed than the Bank of New South Wales. But it is the policy of the general manager to which effect is given there. Is it not notorious that boards of directors fill no more useful purpose than to endorse the proposals of the general manager? Would it be possible for a dozen men to run a bank? No. There never was a successful business institution run by more than one man. Surely the Commonwealth Bank is of more importance than the Note Issue Department is likely to be. There must be some motive underlying this proposal, and probably the Government are anxious to establish a Note Issue Department and carry out their own ideas before there is a change of Government. The honourable member for Botirke( Mr Anstey) referred to a provision which has been deleted, and I believe the Government had some reason for including it in the Bill which at present is not apparent. A l though honourable members do not appear to he taking very great interest in this measure, it must he admitted that there is no more important question to the Commonwealth than that of finance. It is gratifying to learn that some of our younger members are directly interesting themselves in financial questions, and that I am not the only honourable member in this Chamber preparfid to deal with such important problems in a business-like way.

My reason for this amendment has already been explained to honourable mem(Parramattabers. This is a matter which affects f u n I m o v e damental questions connected with banking, and as we are dealing with merely a machinery B ill , I think that the principles of banking should be l e f t over to be dealt with in a general banking measure. When such a measure will be introduced I do not know, but I am of opinion that it should be dealt with very soon, as there are many things connected with our banking system requiring rectification to bring it up to date. That is one reason, but there is another. This provision was originally inserted in the B ill in order to protect the Treasury from the demands which might .otherwise be made by the banks for the return of the £10,000,000 in gold which they handed over to us at the beginning of the war. We do' not want to deplete our present stock of gold standing against our notes. As the banks have come forward, and have said that they will not make that demand, it is unnecessary for us to protect ourselves in the (Parramattaway proposed by this clause. We are alI moveready protected by the agreement with the banks, and that will do quite as well as the clause inserted in the B ill . be as effective as this clause? fear whatever about it . As, therefore, the only reason for inserting this clause in the (ParramattaB ill has been met, I propose to omit this question of banking principle, leaving it over for consideration when a general Amendment agreed to.

326,Mr Tudor,"I am not saying thafeare to legislate intelligently, it is i m perative that we should know precisely the legislation which we are asked to amend. These statutory rules might well have been attached to the B ill in the form of a schedule. A t the present time it is absolutely impossible for any honourable member who has not had a legal training to understand the alterations which it is proposed to make in the existing law. the Minister himself does not understand them . 1 sible for honourable members to have in the form of a schedule to the B ill the amendments which have been made in the principal Act? f u l to those who will be affected by the Bill. last clause of the measure provides that the Governor General may make regulations not inconsistent w i th this Act. I defy any honourable member, with the exception, perhaps, of the Minister, who hag studied the effect of these regulations, to understand the position. For instance, .Statutory Rule No. 165 covers four pages of closely-printed matter, and contains definitions which may or may not be inconsistent with those which are set for th in this B ill . It deals, amongst other things, with aliens registration c/Ecers, obligation on aliens to register, obligation on alien master or member of crew of vessel to register, manner of effecting registration, issue of certificate af registration, obligation on aliens to notify change of abode, register of aliens to be kept by hotel keepers, aliens exempt from regulations, aliens to produce cer1 tificates of registration on demand, aliens or persons believed to be aliens to answer questions, arrest, and onus of proof. Statutory Rule 176 covers two pages, and deals w i th the obligation on aliens to notify change of abode. It cancels regulation 9, and substitutes a new regulation in lieu thereof. It also amends -regulation 10 by substituting for subparagraph 1 a new sub-paragraph. wants all these alterations embodied in a schedule to the Bill? laughs, and thinks that it would be a difficult thing to do. of how honourable members complained of the schedule which was attached to the Nationality B ill . the ImperialA c t in the form of a schedule to that B ill , we were merely repeating what had already been embodied in the B ill itself. Statutory Rule 216A of 1916 has been amended by the addition of a new sub-paragraph to paragraph 10, I will guarantee that by an amendment of paragraph 11, and by an addition to paragraph 4. In Statutory Rule 281B, forms A and B have been cancelled, and new forms have been inserted in lieu thereof. These alterations cover four pages of printed matter. In the Statutory Rules of 1917 the regulations were again altered, and on page 29?> It would be very useof those rules I find the following: WAB PRECAUTIONS (ALIENS The REGISTRATION) REGULATIONS (a). The following table indicates the regulations under the above heading which have been made or affected during the year 1917, and the number of the respective Statutory Rules making or affecting these regulations.

""Will it be necessary for such persons to report at each capital city,, or will registration at the first port of call cover the period of their visit to Australia? Of course, the position was different when we were at war; but tomorrow we celebrate the third anniversary of the Armistice. I should further like to know whether it will be necessary to have a special staff of alien registration officers at various towns and cities of the Commonwealth, and, if so, what is the estimated cost of putting the measure into operation. In the case of the Nationality Bill, we slavishly followed the legislation of Great Britain, and I should like to know whether a similar measure to that before us, with provisions as stringent, has been passed by the British Parliament. Are the German commercial travellers, who are now entering Great Britain, compelled to register? We all know that we are perpetrating a farce in passing this Bill.

May I say that it is canting humbug ? will make available for honourable members a copy of the British Act. I see that a clause of the Bill makes the master of a ship responsible, though I have no ' doubt a captain would protest that the war is now over. Then, if the master of a ship is misled by passengers or crew, is he still to be held responsible I We cannot expect that persons who endeavour to enter this country against the law will be very truthful in the information they give regarding themselves. In my opinion, the Bill will not keep out of the country any one who desires to come in. It will be remembered that, by a self-denying ordinance, the importation of opium was prohibited; but we cannot deceive ourselves into believing that no opium has entered the country since that law was passed. The law made opium more expensive, and the present Bill may only have the effect of making it more expensive for aliens to come to Australia. It is sometimes impossible for captains to know what is the real nationality of the members of a crew. Many of us who fought, not only during the consideration of the Navigation Bill, but prior to that, against black labour on German commercial travellers the mail boats, said that we should have white men, preferably Britishers, in the crews; but many of those who are opposed to us to-day were anxious to have cheap labour, irrespective of where it came from. It was purely an economic question. We are legislating now entirely in the dark, until we know the effect of the regulations I have quoted, how far-reaching they are, and what portions of them are operative to-day.

Ib seems to me that the Government in in troducing the B ill have followed the lines of least resistance, and have not made any attempt to put it before honourable members in such a way as to make its purpose perfectly clear. It is stated in this clause that"" War Precautions (Aliens Registration) Regulations "" means the regulations made by Statutory Rules 1916, No. 165, as amended by the following statutory rules :A number of Statutory Rules are then set out. regulations and Statutory Rules, and I to which I desire some enlightenment. honestly admit that in trying to go In this clause it is stated thatthrough them.

If it is desirable that some of those regulations should be continued by way of legislation, let us achieve our object without any reference to an Act which in the past has caused a good deal of shame on the part of many Australians because of the actions that have been taken under it .

This Parliament has reached the dizzy limit by the inclusion of this particular clause, and I .suggest that the 'Government would facilitate business if they used a code, say, Bentley's Code, ABC , 5th Edition, and put all their Bills in code. This would simplify matters considerably, because each member could then be supplied .with a code book. It would be just as ridiculous to do that as it is to bring down Bills in this manner. vantage to have the Bills in code, because we could decipher the code. course, that somebody did not steal an honourable member's decoding book. It is the height of folly to refer to a number of Statutory Rules in this way, for, after all, they are the essence of the Bill, are incorporated in it were passed before and we should know something about them. I was interested to learn from the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Groom), assisting the Minister in charge of the Bill( Mr Poynton), that this measure is based on Imperial legislation, and that it is one of a set of Bills that has to be passed throughout the British Empire in order that this particular class of legislation shall be uniform in character. isters to adjourn for half-an-hour to decide whether this is Imperial legislation or not, because his colleague said that it was Imperial in its nature. Ministers to fight this matter between themselves, and come to some agreement. member is ' referring to the Nationality Bill. isters for the future to arrive at some definite' conclusion before they come into the House. As a matter of fact, the Minister in charge of the Bill knows that quite a number of the regulations that are incorporated in it are Imperial in their origin. He knows, also, that Canada is adopting practically the same legislation. Dated on the British Act. drastic than this Bill. some of the teeth have 'been pulled out of this measure. The Bill is most unsatisfactory in every respect, and I am going to vote against the clause. I would not like the clause to 'be passed without protesting against the -action of the Government in incorporating in it some remnants of regulations passed under the War Precautions Act. We have been told repeatedly that the War Precautions Act will soon expire; but it ' appears that the Government are trying to incorporate in the present measure regulations promulgated under that Act. I confess that, with a considerable amount of other work on hand, I have not had an opportunity of studying the Bill until tonight. Some of the Statutory Rules that I became a member of this House, and have, therefore, not been brought under my notice; but I object to these regulations being referred to by their numbers iu the definition clause, because honourable members can have no idea of their immediate or ultimate effect on the Bill we are asked to pass. If it is necessary for the purpose of this measure to include these regulations, they could have been adopted as clauses, each one being dealt with on its merits. Personally, I object to the whole of them, because they have I advise the Minbeen surrounded with an atmosphere of distrust, created by the tyrannical WarPrecautions Act. We were told this afternoon that we might want a Police Force here soon. If we pass much more legislation of this character, the peoplewill hardly know whether they are obeying the law OT not, and consequently we may require a substantial Police Force to insure obedience to our laws. It is set forth also that "" officer "" means a member of the police force, or an officer of Customs, or of the Department administering the Act. That infers that any officer in the Home and Territories Department may be appointed to act as a policeman for the purpose of this Statute. It is also provided that a prescribed officer, or "" any person,"" may be authorized by the Minister to exercise the powers conferred on officers.

I object to anybody being compelled to register, and I see no justification for making tbe time within which the Act must be complied with the short space of three months. Half the natural-born Australian population will not know within three months of the passing of the B ill that it has become law; and is it fair to expect the alien population of the country to know of the existence of the Act , and to register under it , in that time? I object to the penalties proposed for non-registration. I see no reason for requiring the registration of aliens. already registered. They will not have to register under the Act. persons who claim to be British subjects, and not aliens. Possibly they have made a mistake, but they will have to suffer the indignity that will be cast upon them by the passing of this clause. I venture to say that Ned Kelly would not be asked to suffer one-half the indignities that some of these aliens are to be subjected to. est commercial thieves in Australia have not been asked to undergo a term of imprisonment of six months, or to pay a penalty.of £ 100, for deliberate robbery. ter) -The matter of the penalty is not now before the Committee. any more of your valuable time.

I have moved among a number of people of alien birth , who are livin g in the outlying parts of Australia, and they are not too conversant with the r e gulations which now apply to them. It would he quite easy for many of them to lose sight of a provision of an Act which calls upon them to register each child within one month after it has reached the age of sixteen. I wish that the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) had proposed an extension of the period within which aliens may register, from one month to three months. They certainly should have a longer period than one month. Under the B ill as it stands ""many of these people will d r if t into trouble through ignorance.

447,"Bill Presented By Sir Joseph Cook,","6378 posedThat the House do now adjourn. Mr J. H. CATTS (Cook) [10.58] Although the hour is late, I feel it my duty to raise a matter of urgent public importance in regard to the basic wage payable to the public servants of the Commonwealth. In October, 1919, the New South Wales Government adopted a basic wage of £ 3 17s. per week. Government, at the time of the then new basic wage in New South Wales, was called on by Labour members particularly, and by a deputation introduced to the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) by the Leader of the Labour party ( Mr not even paying the previous basic wage Tudor), to at least adopt that basic wage as the minimum adult rate for the Commonwealth. The reply of the Prime Minister was that he would appoint a Royal Commission, and that the matter would be dealt with in the policy speech -The scandalously low wages of £3 On the 31st October last year we had that policy speech at Bendigo, in which Mr Hughes saidThe Government is appointing a Royal Commission to inquire into the cost of living in relation to the minimum or basic wage. The Commission w ill be f u l l y clothed w it h . power to ascertain what is a fair basic wage, and how much the purchasing power of the sovereign has depreciated during the war, and the best moans, when once so adjusted, of automatically adjusting itself to the rise and f a l l of the sovereign. The Government w ill , at the earliest date possible, create effective machinery to give effect to these principles, and the recommendations of the Commission. A. few days afterwards, when the Prime Minister was approached further in the matter, the following statement by him was reported in the press:Mr Hughes said he had announced in this policy speech that he intended to appoint a Commission to inquire into the minimum basic wage. On Monday last he received names from the labour industrial unions, and as soon as employers appointed representatives this Commission would commence its inquiries. The wage fixed would apply to public servants as well as to other persons. Adjournment. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Adjournment. Mr Lazarus asked if it would be possible to give a measure of relief immediately, and Mr Hughes replied that he was afraid it would not. He did not think the Commission would take long. The Government would have power to enforce the decision as far as its own servants were concerned. "" My answer is,"" concluded Mr Hughes, "" I am offering you, in common with every other worker in Australia, a promise of speedy and effective relief."" There has since then been a doubt created by the Prime Minister himself as to the value and effectiveness of that Commission, and this brought a reply from Mr Piddington, the chairman of the Commission, in which he sought to re-estabThe lish some kind of public confidence in that body. Twelve months have elapsed, and now the basic wage in New South Wales, laid down by the Board of Trade, is £4 5s. per week; yet the Commonwealth is of £3 17s. In every Department there are sweated employees; in the Defence Department, in the Postal Department in its various branches, and wherever the Commonwealth employ men, there is a hue and cry that sweating is rampant. 7s. 6d. and £3 10s. are being paid to married men of competence, and with long years of service. One case known to me is typical of a large number. It is that of a Mr R. A. Hunter, who resides in Newtown. He is a competent man, whom I have known for many years, and he has had ten years' service. He has a family of seven children, and were it not that he happened to have a house of his own before he entered the Commonwealth employ, it would be absolutely impossible for him to maintain his family in the most frugal manner on what he has been receiving, namely, £3 10s. per week. Mr J. H . CATTS I forget his exaet position; but he is in one of the Postal branches. He has qualified himself by examination for positions in the Customs Service, and has diplomas as meat inspector and veterinary inspector. AlthoughI have done my level best to help him. my efforts have not been attended with success, and I understand that this week, after his long service, he has abandoned his position to",69,Poynton In Sub Clause 2 Agreed To
