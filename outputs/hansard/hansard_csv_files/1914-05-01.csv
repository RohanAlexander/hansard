I ask the Assistant Minister of Horne Affairs whether he can give f u l l particulars of the cost of the previous surveys made by Messrs.

[10.35] -When the debate was adjourned last night, I was speaking of banking, which is the fundamental essence of finance, and finance is a Government function. For years we have allowed p r i vate corporations to possess the instruments of credit and exchange, and those who control those instruments control the world. A Government bank should be an impersonal institution, knowing not the individual, and recognising only security. The foundation of monopolies, their essence and basis, is the private banking corporation. I know that in America we used to finance them. We used to discount their promissory notes and securities, and when they got into us, we had to give more to get out, until , finally, we had sometimes to take a busiI s there no reply to ness over.

33,Mr Kingo ' Malley,"T h a t isof the world on money that she owes the world. That is why England is the banker of the world, aud yet the capital of all England is not equal to that of the State of Sew York. I s not that extraordinary? Let ine assure honourable members that it is not capital and wealth, but banking organization, that has made England the banker of the world, and if Australia desires to ever become a financial country, or a great exchange country, she must organize her finance. Organized credit is the most potent force in the world, and without organized credit you can have no financial, industrial, or commercial progress. Here, in this im-' mense sparsely-settled country of Australia, that can absorb huge funds, that is entering into stupendous enterprises, in volving mighty financial risks, interest can never fall so low or remain at such uniform rates as it does with the Bank of Erance. On the 19th May, 1S92, the interest rate on discount for the Bank of France was 2 i per cent. It remained unchanged for nearly three years, when it was reduced on the 14th March, 1895, to 2 per cent. The rate of interest during the SouthA f r i c an war rose to 4£ per cent., but on the 25th May, 1900, it was reduced to 3 per cent., and remained unchanged for nearly seven years, until the approach of the great American financial crisis, when it was raised again to 4 per cent., but was immediately reduced to 2£ per cent., at which it remained for some years. During that crisis in America, when hundreds of thousands of people lost all they possessed, when America had more capital than ever in its history, but no method of mobilizing that capital, in France the interest rate remained level. The great financial equilibriator was always there, and there was no trouble. the Bank of England? Bank of England was not very much different from the Bank of France. You can go into the Bank of France and rediscount a bill as low as $S; you can borrow inoney on an anchor, or an elephant in A f r i c a , or a bob-cat in the Rocky Mountains, if guaranteed. that as an .illustration of the worldwide ramifications of the Bank of France. monwealth Bank has got such a good start the note issue ought to be transferred to the bank. Of course, at first we wanted to see how the bank would move. Are my honourable friends on the Treasury bench aware that for years in Australia we have had an unregistered financial combine, a fact which all our great Australian newspapers completely ignore or politically obscure? This great unregistered illegal boodle combine has no definite position under the law; it is not a trust; there are no elected directors, and there is. no registered list of shareholders; nevertheless it. is here, and lives and breathes; it is an honourable understanding combination. There is a community of selfish financial interests, a chain of secret financial control, which is gradually centralizing in the hands of a few powerful financial manipulators, the instruments of exchange and of Australian credit. We are all in it . There is no list of direct or indirect capital centralized in the boodle combine, but the funds of all the great financial corporations of Australia are always at the service of the favoured few, and can be utilized in financial operations for the benefit of the privileged classes. In otheB words, these corporations possess deposits and reserve accounts amounting to many million pounds sterling, and with their interlocking and interlacing financial operations they control the money and credit of all the smaller financial institutions. Thus the accumulated wealth of Australia, to a certain extent, is now centralized in this invisible boodle combine, witb its command over such a stupendous amount of liquid funds, and a directing influence over its dependents.

52,Mr King O'malley,"St. Paul,not have such debentures on sale all over the world, because there is always a market for money here at 3$ per cent, or 4 per cent.; but we have not the courage to take advantage of the opportunity. The public and private debt of the Commonwealth to-day is about £650,000,000, on which the people are called to pay interest, and, with our small population, and only a small portion of that population producing, the bill is terrific. Our national debt, including municipalities and the States, is £317,000,000, and the private debt £333,000,000, coming up to about the total I have mentioned. I suppose that when we take into consideration the lawyers' fees, cost of transfer, and so forth, the interest averages from 5 per cent, to 6 per cent -, and this means that the people of the Commonwealth are annually paying £39,000,000 for the use of this money. We ought to appoint a Finance Committee from this House to go into the whole question, and see whether it is not possible to come to some business arrangement. As to Australian agriculture, I have no hesitation in saying from my own experience-and experience is the unerring test of all human undertakings-that , if the Commonwealth Bank were properly organized, we could advance overdrafts for five years to the farmers on their securities. Mr P. P. ABBOTT.'-If we could, evolve a scheme by which the cash reserves might be placed at the disposal of the farmers, and not leave them dependent on the good will of private individuals, it would be a good thing. I desire. I hold that we could give overdrafts on five years' rural credits, leaving the farmer to pay off when he chose. present bank charge? dealing with that matter. There are other urgent reforms to which we might give our earnest attention. All Governments should help to create a national soil reserve as well as a national bank reserve. There ought to be a soil survey of each State, showing exactly for what agricultural use lands in each section of the State are best fitted, and arrangements made for the publication and distribution amongst all Australian farmers of the truth about fertilizers, so that the stupendous waste and injury, through the patent-medicine method of "" complete fertilizers,"" may be prevented. orable member not carry out these reforms when he was in power.? my time to organize the Department of Home Affairs. In each district there ought to be a permanent agricultural demonstrator, an expert whose whole time should be spent in showing producers on their own farms-no t at colleges-ho w to produce better and bigger crops per acre, while increasing the fertility of the soil. Country schools should be turned into institutions to prepare farm boys and girls for systematic work on the farms, and to create in them deeper love for life in the. country. We ought to encourage tihes study of co-operative and other modern, methods of securing better and more profitable markets, and of distributing agricultural products. We require better and: more liberal methods of rural credits and' financing. How can we keep a man on> the land if, as soon as he has a bad season,, he receives a letter telling him that hi& banker wishes to see him ? Not long ago, when in Tasmania, I met a man riding along on his horse, and I observed that he was bad.

I said, "" I will redeem you."" cent.; he was paying the bank 1 per cent. been at election time! not, because I then had three years to run. Another most desirable reform would be the improvement of country towns, so as to make them better and more attractive places of residence. I should now like to refer to what is known as the "" costing system."" This is no new thing to me, because I was trained in it in the little city of New York. I had much difficulty in inaugurating the system at the Department of Home Affairs, but, of course, we know that it takes a long time to get a "" move on "" in a Government office.

61,Mr King O'malley,"No, it wasDepartment ought to have a complete costing system, which is the bedrock basis of modern business efficiency, -economy, and intelligence. There is a vast difference between the costing system -and an accounting system. The latter analyses records, whereas a costing system examines and analyses the real work -of a Department, and reduces every item in the for m of a standard unit. In the construction of public works a costing system shows at a glance the cost of material, labour, and supervision. system that the responsible Minister of a Department can guard against losses, and experiment with cost reduction. Another point to be borne in mind is that a costing system is the only basis of comparison between day labour and the contract system. be established in this country an absolutely scientific system of routine interDepartment or inter-bureau business, so thab the resources of all Departments could be available for -each without any waste of time or energy. with this there should be a system of inventory, so t h a t all these resources would be known to officers of all the Departments and to the public. often happens that one Department does riot know what another has. was Minister of Home AffairsI did not know all that was going on in other Departments, aud I do not suppose that Other Ministers knew much about what was going on in my Department. going on in tlie honourable member's own Department of which he knew nothing. that. I was just getting into my stride, like a Carbine, when I got the royal order of the boot. A Department frequently goes outside for services and information that it may have almost at its own door, and yet not be aware of it . Inefficiency in routine and inventory is mostly responsible for the endless delays that take place. again, tliere sliould be efficient publicity iu all Departments of government. We ought to have a Department of efficiency and economy, whose business it would be to deal with all matters, and where the mechanism of administration would be standardized. tralia are shareholders in the Commonwealth, and are entitled to know how the enterprise is being operated; but the present yearly balance-sheet is of no use to them. ' I hold that we should have a bi-monthly schedule. The Governmeut sliould have the courage to create an advisory committee of business men to help us to make a study of efficiency and economy in Government administration. Let us have, say, twenty men gathered from all parts of the Commonwealth-me n who have made a life study of one or otlier of the manifold forms of administrative efficiencyI t is only by such a scientific to act without pay, as our advisers, on behalf of the people; to help us to run our offices on an efficient basis. Let us have them as experts representing all the broad general divisions of industry, trade, and commerce, and let us have a due proportion of theoretical students as well as men of practical affairs. We There should also should have both. The man of theory evolves ideas, and the practical man puts them into concrete form. Let us have such a Committee to thoroughly overhaul our systems every year-to study their needs and to give us tlie Combined benefit of their advice in making them more efficient and economical. I am a believer in collective energy, in union work. No man knows all things. No It man can do all things, and the mere putting of a man into an official position When I does not enable him to know everything related to it . No one man has all the brains on earth. Recognising that, the Labour party meets in caucus, and there every member of the party has a say.

A f t e r the honourable member for Darwin's brilliant oration, f u l l of practical wisdom, and brightened by flashes of humour, my effort may fall somewhat flat, but I hope that it w ill not prove stale and unprofitable. The advice which he has given us is advice which, I think, must strike home Then, to every one. We, as a Parliament, are tired, I venture to say, of the constant stress of party warfare-of the subordination of all the great interests of this count r y to the petty exigencies of party warfare-and the speech just concluded by the honourable member for Darwin must The people of Aushave some effect in crystallizing that thought which, I am sure, runs through all our minds.

64,Mr Arthur (Bendigo) [11.15],"is apt to come very quickly to conclusions that are generally unflattering to the "" f e l l o w on the other side."" clusion that I have drawn in my short experience in this House is that political experience is by no means the measure of political wisdom. the interests of the country to mere party exigencies is one justification for that conclusion, and we have only to look at those who have sat in Parliament from twenty to thirty years to examine what they have done in the past, and to consider what they promised to do, to feel that that conclusion is amply proved. Minister we have one who has, during his career, stood practically for every principle that, might be characterized as politically wise. We might, indeed, regard him as a composite photograph of all the political principles that have ever obtained in Australia-as a composite photograph in which none of the fixed lines of political principle remain, but only the lines of party warfare and the blur of opportunity. inatized as the illegitimate offspring of a political syndicate certain measures that the Labour party brought forward. arn sure that any magistrate called upon to deal with the Prime Minister would fasten upon him the paternity of every bastard political principle that saw the light in liis own State prior to Federation, and which has since seen the light in the Commonwealth Parliament. on this side admire the ability of the Prime Minister, but we regret him as a lost leader of the people. him those words of Browningi n which he said, with regard to another lost leaderJust for a handful of silver he left us, Just for a riband to stick in his coat. And so we leave the Prime Minister with a name which has become anathema to the people from whom he sprang, and who guided his first steps to political greatness. I wish now to say a few words in regard to the Attorney-General, without forgetting the many words which have already been addressed to him. The honourable gentleman is f u l l , pressed down, and running over, with political wisdom. The unfortunate part of the matter is that he never translates that political wisdom into political action. Perhaps that may be regarded as a merciful intervention of Providence, because, though his.political wisdom may be altogether admirable, his political One conaction in the past has been simply damnable. For that reason, I regard his inability to translate his political wisdom into political action as a dispensation of The subordination of Providence.

The honourable member for Wannon made an interjection which was immediately followed by a chorus of In the Prime interjections from the opposite side of the Chamber which interfered with the honourable member who was addressing the Chair. ber for West Sydney very aptly characterized the actions of the Attorney-General while they were being animadverted upon by the honourable member for Batman.

The attitude of the Attorney General, in short, is simply one of attitudinizing. It is recognised to-day that I there are certain questions the solutionof which this country urgently demandsWhy are not those questions resolved',why are not those demands satisfied in the direction in which the people have clearly stated them? The Attorney-General has expressed in no unmeasured terms We the need for an amendment of tlie Constitution to meet the requirements of the people. W h y is not that work undertaken We apply to to-day? Simply because party strategy in this House subordinates everything to itself. That is tlie main reason, and practically the only reason. member ber for Wannon w ill , I hope, remember the admonition which Mr Speaker has already administered to him. I am endeavouring to show him how two blades of political grass may grow in his mind where perhaps even one is not growing now. It is this particular problem which, the Attorney-General has so definitely recognised that I desire to deal with to-day.

But we can blame those persons who see the political light, and yet are engaged all the time in deceiving the people by telling them that there is no need for amending the Constitution, and who, when they have an opportunity to secure an amendment of it, which a large majority of honourable members would support, allow that opportunity to pass. The conditions of this country have altogether changed since our Constitution was adopted. The Constitution itself in 1900 was not in accord with the needs of the people. It was based upon the American Constitution, which was framed late in the eighteenth century to meet the exigencies of a community which was narrow in its outlook, simple in its structure, and altogether destitute of the complexities of modern civilization. All those ramifications, interactions, complexities, and functions which to-day operate in the United States were attempted to be met by a Constitution which was framed to meet the needs of a simple people. Even when framed, that instrument of government was framed not to meet the interests of the simple people of that community, but to meet the interests of its privileged classes. To-day the people of the United States are declaring that it is necessary to get away from that Constitution which is strangling the nation. President Wilson has said of it that the United States Constiextent that was necessary or to the extent tution is like a jacket, which, when you attempt to button it in the front, bursts at the back. That is the Constitution which we adopted in its essence to meet the needs of this community. Now the needs of this community have since grown to such an extent that that straitjacket is bursting in every seam, and if we do not adopt some wise amendment of it, the position will become intolerable, and this young Federation will be strangled in the early days of its existence. The position may be summed up in the words used by an American writer, Mr Arthur. in speaking of the American Constitution, when he saidOur newer Democracy demands not that the people sliall for ever conform to a rigid, hard, unchanging Constitution, but that the Constitution shall change to conform to the needs of the people. The Constitution of the United States is the political wisdom of a dead America. Our Constitution, I venture to say, is the political wisdom of a dead Australia if it is to be allowed to remain in its present condition. How was that grievous straitened condition modified in the United States? It was modified in a way in which our Constitution is not being modified to-day. If the United States had been destitute of men on its Supreme Court Bench who-as has been said-combine d tlie lawyer's rigour with the statesman's breadth of view; if that safety valve had not existed the United States Constitution would have been a dead and shattered thing many years before this, butin the United States men like John Marshall, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and others, saw the need for the letting out, so to speak, of the garment which was constricting and strangling the development of the young nation. Marshall set himself deliberately to breathe into that dead Constitution the breath of life of interpretation. He was the first to lay down lines along which the United States could expand under its Constitution. He broke away from the legal rigour of the Constitution; he informed it with the breadth of view of the statesman, brought statesmanship on to the judicial bench, and made the Constitution a thing which could expand, although, owing to the rigidity of its frame, it could not possibly expand to the that is now regarded as desirable. There are only two methods of achieving this. a comparison with our High Court? either by interpretation by the Supreme Court, which, as the honourable member suggests, corresponds to our High Court in Australia, or by a direct amendment. I hope to show that the first method, which was, to a large extent, effective in the United States, has failed in Australia, and that the only possible way open to use here is a direct amendment of the Constitution. There has been",17,Governor General S Speech Address In Repl Y

70,Mr Arthur,"It can only be doneoperative in Australia what is known in the TJnited States as "" the nullifying interpretation of the Constitution by the Supreme Court."" That is the term by which it is well known and generally condemned in America. What is said about any attempt to amend the Constitution? be called an argument, is that the sacred ark of the Constitution must not be touched by evil hands, and that we must preserve the Federal principle at all hazards. during the last campaign against the referenda. The powers of the States, we were told, must not be curtailed. Their privileges must not be checked in any way. But what is the position to-day in that regard so f a r as concerns the preservation of the rights of the States? When it suits a political party-and that is where I condemn the actions of parties in this particular regard-the y do not hesitate to lay the most violent hands upon the sacred ark of the Constitution. Because to-day, owing to the exigencies of party Avarfare, the Senate happens to be composed mainly of members belonging to the Labour party, the Constitution, in the eyes of honourable members opposite, is no longer sacred. It can be touched in the most violent manner. Not only the Attorney-General, but many members of the serried phalanx behind him,Avent round the country on the last occasion urging upon the people the vieAv that this state of things meant Unification-that it meant the destruction of the rights of the States. Yet in his monumental Avork on the subject, Sir John Quick refers to the States House, which has always been regarded hitherto as the part or Avork of the States in the Constitution, in these eloquent words, "" By the Senate the Commonwealth is buttressed by the States. B y the Senate the States become inwrought into the Constitution."" If that is so, why do we find the Attorney-General and others saying that the Senate must either be destroyed ov its operations curtailed and its functions largely nullified? General has not said that, I hope. ral and others have said it , and I propose to quote, not only Avhat he has 3aid, but Avhat the Prime Minister himself has said. T understand that the Prime Minister Ihimself has stated that a step in the direction of curtailing the poAvers of the Senate must be taken by reducing the tenure of office of senators from six to three years. myself to that view. I quoted it as one of the things that had been put forward. The general argument, if it can Avhat the Prime Minister said as one of the possible means of modifying the in fluence of the Senate. The attitude of the Attorney-General is even worse in'the eyes of those who believe in preserving That was the chief argument the position of the Senatei n the Constitution. He says-and it is marvellous that such a suggestion should come from him -that any measure that is passed twice by this House and rejected twice by the Senate should become law automatically without the Senate's assent. That is a suggestion based on the lines of the British Parliament Act , recently passed to curtail the power of the House of Lords. This is how the Attorney-General would protect the States House. It would be a violation of the very essence of the Constitution as a Pederal instrument. Another"" remedy "" suggested by him is that when the Senate rejects a measure sent up by this House the Senate shall be disregarded, the B ill put to the people voting as a whole, and carried if a simple majority of the people vote in favour of it. By that means he would give the goby altogether to the position of the States in the Constitution. It would be Unification with a vengeance. The term "" U n i fication "" Avas used as a bugbear to frighten the people of the States into voting against the referenda recently put before them by the Labor Party. The people were told that we were Unificationists, and that our proposals ought to be rejected in order to preserve the sanctity of the Federal Constitution. But when the people recognise that these suggestions from the present Government to cripple the poAvers of the Senate constitute a real attack upon the equal representation of the Statesi n this Parliament, they will be able to estimate at their true value the utterances of those honourable members who on the previous COOK -The Attorneyoccasion put forward the argument that our proposed. amendments of the ConT h e Attorney-Genestitution should be rejected because they constituted an attack upon the rights of the States.

I was saying that through this principle of interpretation there seems to be very little hope for the widening of the Constitution, and apparently no hope when we regard the decisions of the High Court in the past. There is still less hope-and this is the point I wish chiefly to make in my address to-day-whe n we regard the latest decision of the Privy Councili n the Colonial Sugar Refining Company's case. T should like to have heard the Attorney General deal with that particular matter in his address. The honourable gentleman might have informed the Housei n a most emphatic way, as, in fact, he did inform a meeting of the Liberal Speakers' Union, as to the effect of the decision of the Privy Council in that case upon the interpretation of the Constitution of Australia. In a very instructive address he said that it not only did not widen the scope of the Constitution, but involved an intolerable narrowing and restriction of it. The honourable gentleman said that he particularly disagreed with the decision of the Privy Councili n that regard, but, unfortunately, his disagreement does not affect the matter. I am sure that honourable members would have welcomed a statement from the Attorney-General as to the serious effects upon the Constitutional law of Australia which he recognises must follow from that particular decision.

I wish to draw the attention of the House briefly to some of the decisions-and this is the main point I wish to make-and the principle which lies at the root of those decisions.

The Attorney-General says that they are necessary, are of vital importance, and must be carried out. Y e t the honourable gentleman will not propose them. We agree as to their necessity, and would welcome such an alleviation of the conditions in Australia, even thougn we could not get all that we desire in respect of the other proposed amendments. the party on the other side should not miss. They have a practically unanimous House to appeal to ; they admit that the people of Australia want these amendments, and yet these great questions are kept back by the B ill prohibiting preference to unionists in Government employ and the Bill for the restoration of the postal vote. The Government refuse to go on with these important measures, the necessity for which they recognise, because they desire to secure the particular party advantage, if it should be a party advantage, for which they hope from pressing the other measures to which T have referred. is the position of the party opposite, as we gather it from the speeches of the Prime Minister and General"" Not now, O Lord, not now."" With regard to these decisions and the principles underlying them we have, first of all, the decision in respect of trade and commerce in the railway servants case in New South Wales.

I want to impress on the House that that is the root of the demarcation liue which exists between the majority of the High Court, who gave this decision, and the minority at that time. That is the line which affected the decision in the State Railway case, in which the State railway servants were not allowed to come within the Act, although the Act said they could, because that would be an interference the trade of the States, which was assumed to have been left to the Commonwealth. decision in the Harvester An Excise was placed on manufactured was not to be paid if proof were given that certain conditions obtained. thrown out was because of the principle I have indicated, namely, that it must have been intended to leave these matters of internal management and, therefore, you must read down the power as to Excise and other matters, so as to prevent it from interfering with the internal trade of the States. principle was adopted in dealing with the Seamen's case. power was given to the Commonwealth to deal with navigation, and the Seamen's Compensation Act was ruled out by the High Court, and restricted to trade only, because another would mean an interference with the internal trade of the States, and it was assumed that-that was to be in the power of the Commonwealth. cision of the High Court has that for its basis. The statement was made by the honourable member for Werriwa the other day. in his assumption of all wisMr Arthur. and dom, that paragraph xx. of section That 51 of the Constitution, dealing witli Where foreign corporations and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth, enabled the Comis that the son monwealth to deal with trusts and combines, and that there was no necessity for an amendment in respect to trusts and combines. But the High? Court, in that case, applied the principle which I have already mentioned. The Court said that that power did not, and could not, relate to the regulation of the business of corporations, that it could not forbid them to enter into contracts, that once a corporation was' lawfully started the Court That is the principle to be could not forbid them from entering into business relations of any kind whatever. The Court held that the Commonwealth could not make laws to create these corporations, that it could only make laws to regulate them as corporations in the nature of bringing them into existence or as in the ordinary company law; but that Commonwealth it could not affect them in any respect with regard to the contracts they might enter with into with other people. That was the express 'ground of the Court's decision in the case of Huddart Parker v. Moorehead, That was the reason of the which ruled out the particular sections of Excise case. the Australian Industries Preservation harvesters Act with regard to corporations carrying in a certain way, and it on business in one State only. The honorahle member for Werriwa, apparently of manufacture in his knowledge of so many other things, The reason why that Act was left that particular field of knowledge uncovered. It is not necessary, I think, for me to go through all these cases to indicate that principle. The principle is to the States, clear and unmistakable, and, so f a r from the principle of interpretation adopted in Australia widening the Constitution, as it did in the TJnited States of America, it The same has succeeded in narrowing the Constitution in many respects indeed. I have no It was thought that need to dwell long on another provision of the Constitution in respect of which that principle of interpretation has had, perhaps, fuller sway than it has had in reInter-State spect of any other provision, and that is interpretation paragraph xxxv. of section 51, dealing with industrial matters. That is a provision which is of greater import to thi0 community than, I think, any other, and Almost every deI w ill show honourable members how that is so. The paragraph readsConciliation and arbitration for the preven tion and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State.. The attention of honourable members has been drawn to that power ad nauseam, and I , perhaps, should apologise for bringone State, and it is to the eternal credit of ing it before them again, but I want to use it to point the moral of my address. The principle of non-interference with the States which is read into the Constitution by the H i gh Court, is that which has doue all the mischief. This principle of industrial unrest is one which is going, if it is not dealt with in some effective way, to disrupt this country, as it will disruj>t every other country in the world. content is simply a manifestation that the people of the world are not going to stand the conditions which keep them down. I am not an anarchist or a red revolutionist, but one cannot misread the signs of the times in this respect. that this state of affairs w ill go on for Batman is well acquainted, has occupied ever as it is, who are content to sit on the Constitution as it is, and to resist every attempt of the people to gain better conditions through political action, are sitting upon a keg of gunpowder, which will soon elevate them into regions where political problems w ill trouble them no more. We must take hold of this position of industrial unrest,'and in Australia we have done so to a great extent, perhaps more than any other country has done. If we do not remedy that, it will destroy us. saw that there was unrest in other parts of the world besides Australia, and that industrial trouble could not always be confined to one State. few cases that it is so confined. They saw that the industrial organizations were federating all over the Continent. Acknowledging that the State Legislatures could not deal effectively with disputes extending beyond the borders of a State, they determined to give the Commonwealth Parliament power to deal with such disputes. said that the High Court has gone much too far in interpreting the provision of the Constitution which deals with this matter. than many expected it to go, but its interpretation is one for which we should he glad, and not sorry. that it has widened the meaning of the provision, but it has given it an interpretation wider than the conception which many persons entertained of that meaning. vision was meant to apply only to industrial troubles, such as a shipping dispute, extending beyond the borders of the late Mr Justice O'Connor that he refused to be bound by the narrow views presented to him, and that the majority of the H i gh Court gave the wider interpretation that has been adopted. But what happens when industrial disputes are brought forward for hearing? A f t e r a case has been fought for months, and, in one instance for a year, before the Arbitration Court, the employers go to The principle of industrial disthe High Court, and say that there is no industrial dispute for the Arbitration Court to deal w it h ; that tlie Arbitration Court has interfered in connection with a dispute with which the Constitution does not empower the Commonwealth to deal. The Tramways case, Those who think with which the honourable member for the attention of the Arbitration Court for a very long period, blocking business, and thus increasing industrial discontent by preventing workers not concerned in the case from obtaining an immediate peaceable settlement of the troubles which they desire to be adjudicated upon. A f t e r that case had been before the Arbitration Court for a year, and an award had been given, two of the companies concerned took out a writ of Prohibition. The attempt to The framers of the Constitution get the case before the Court began towards the end of 1911, and in South Australia and in Queensland, where the unrest was most acute, no settlement has It is in very yet been arrived at, questions still being before the High Court. It is argued that the control of tramways is a purely local matter, and that any dispute between tramway employees and their employers cannot come before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, because it cannot be a dispute extending beyond the borders of a State. But Australia It has been might be thrown into confusion by such a dispute, and her citizens affected most seriously by the industrial warfare whif'-i it caused. Take a case affecting the It certainly has gone further building industry. It is said that the builders of the various States have no communication, competition, or interI do not say action, and that a dispute in the building industry cannot be a dispute extending beyond the borders of a State.

As a result, employers are now harassed who need not be harassed. In stead of representative employers being brought before the Arbitration Courti n any case, all the employers affected are brought before it , at great trouble and expense. In New Zealand, in one case, 1,700 employers were cited, and I believe that some 800 employers have been cited here in connection with a mining dispute. The decision of the H i gh Court makes our arbitration law unworkable. If the widest interpretation is not given to the term "" dispute,"" we shall have large bodies of men unregulated and uncontrolled, and, if we do not take them into our care, our ugly brother, Syndicalism, will do so. If those engaged in the in If amendments were necessary before, as dustries of this country are prevented by a narrow interpretation from bringing their disputes into the Arbitration Court, they must be a law unto themselves, and endeavour to gain by Syndical action what they cannot gain otherwise. great majority of workers are desirous, as was the Prime Minister when a worker, to improve their conditions by political action. There is no restriction of the franchise here as in other countries, and our workers are clear-headed, and, despite the opinion of the honourable inember for Werriwa, have clear-headed leaders. They wish to use the political weapon; but our opponents are trying hard to keep it away from them. If the peaceful brother is not allowed to help them, the ugly brother must be called in . He will be called in if Parliament does not take in hand this important matter of constitutional amendment, so that the Commonwealth may have fuller control of industrial matters. this matter only as a member of that party which, according to some of those opposite, has a monopoly of political ignorance; I speak in the words of tlie Attorney-General, who says that it is vital and necessary that the Commonwealth should have super-eminent control in industrial matters. I invite him, therefore, and his Government, if they have the pluck, to bring forward their proposed Constitutional measures. .We cannot but Mr Arthur. In the Boot support them, because Constitutional amendment is on our platform. But this measure for the relief of Australia is being blocked by a B ill to prohibit preference to unionists in Government emfixing of the ployment ! The great and serious measure which stands in the way of reform is one saying that preference shall not be given to 2,000 men who are strong enough, and sufficiently well organized, to insist on it ! That is the important question which the present Government put in the forefron t of their programme, and which they use to prevent this great reform, which the most considerable* members of the Government, as well as the Attorney General, insist upon as being necessary, and the absence of which is ruinous to Australia. TheH i g h Court has gone a certain length in this regard, but the Privy Council has gone much further. I wish members to understand the importance of the Privy Council's decision, because it is vital to this whole question. we thought, and the Attorney-General thought, they are ten times more necessary since the Privy Council has spoken in that way. A great point of interpretation in the Supreme Court of the The United States of America, and a principle which has been adopted to a lesser extent in the H i g h Court of Australia, is what is called ""the doctrine of implied powers."" That is to say, we will imply powers which are necessary to the carrying out of other powers. That has been wholly, cut away by the decision of the Privy Council, and I wish to point out to members some important respects in w h i ^ that decision curtails the powers of this Parliament. In that judgment of tbe Privy Council we have both the method of interpretation and the decision itself given. The method of interpretation is the more important part, because it bind« our own High Court. The principle of interpretation is that, in the view of the I do not speak in Privy Council, the Constitution of Australia and the powers of this Parliament under that Constitution are merely gifts from the States, merely so many benefits which the States have conferred upon the Parliament of Australia, merely delegated powers. The Attorney-General stated to the Liberal union that he totally disagreed from the view of the Privy Council, and I am glad the honourable member has the courage to disagree. That decision means that not only is the principle which the High Court laid down affirmed, but it is strengthened and made ten times more strict. Its effect is that we have to interpret the Constitution with the States in view all the time. We have not to take the gifts as we have received them, but must assume what was intended when those gifts were handed over by the States. When we are interpreting the powers of this Parliament, we must always be thinking of what is implied, and what the States meant to give us. That is the principle which the minority of the H i gh Court has constantly set its face against, but which the Privy Council has adopted. pose to alter the principle of interpretation. The principle of interpretation, as a method of alleviating the rigidity of the Constitution, is destroyed now, and the only other method is that of amendment of the Constitution. That is the whole point of my remarks. disguise. orable member that all these restrictive interpretations are blessings in disguise. interpretation be that adopted by the High Court? ten word as it is, and the States have all that is left. thinking of what was in the minds of the States when they gave us these powers. If we take the view that the States have allotted us so much and no more, and we are bound by the interpretation to consider what is impliedly meant by the States, we have those powers cut down as the High Court has already cut theni, and as the Privy Council has further reduced them. The decision in that particular case was that the Royal Commissions Acts of this Parliament were ultra I'irKx, and of no effect, and, when we know the reason for which those Acts are ruled out, we see that there is established a principle which we shall have to abolish by amendment. Commissions Acts were passed in order to enable this Parliament to inquire into various matters in regard to which information was necessary so that wise legislation could be enacted. should not be cut away, but rather should be extended. W it h the honourable member for Darwin and others I agree that an extension of that principle would be the best way of managing the business of this House. Our methods undoubtedly are unbusinesslike and antiquated, and to divide the House into Committees, ^which would have power to inquire what we might do and what we ought to do, and submit a report to the whole House, would be the most effective manner of conducting our affairs. If we should want to introduce a reform of that kind, this decision of the Privy Council may have the effect of saying that we cannot. Committees would not have power to make compulsory inquiries, answers to whicb could be enforced by imprisonment or One cannot profine, because of the principles laid down by the decision in this particular case. Suppose this House wished to legislate on a particular matter upon which no legislation had yet been passed, and appointed a Committee to inquire, with powers to enforce attendance at its meetings, and enforce answers to questions-tli e interI t may be a blessing in pretations of the Privy Council make it doubtful whether that could be done. I agree with the honThere is no doubt that inquiry is at the root of legislation. We cannot legislate wisely unless we know, and yet the Privy Council has laid down the principle that the compulsory powers of the Royal Commissions Acts are invalid unless the inquiry L e t us take the writis in regard to the exercise of some power we have already exercised. We are not We must not always be to have Royal Commissions with compulsory powers to examine into what we should do, as, for instance, into the Agri cultural Bureau. I u order to discover how best to legislate so as to make two blades of grass grow where one grew before, it is necessary that we should have inquiries as to the best means of proceeding, and yet tliis decision would prevent a Royal Commission with compulsory powers inquiring into such a matter, and it throws a very dubious light on the validity of the Agricultural Bureau itself. The decision of the P r i v y Council renders invalid the powers an Agricultural Bureau would need to enforce answers to The Royal its inquiries.

92,Mr Arthur,"B y the Act the Comhas been to create an enormous organization of employers, w i th a f u n d of £50,000,000, for the purpose of fighting the employees. They had no need, perhaps, to learn from us in the matter; they probably learnt it from other examples; hut they have learned the value of combination. The result is that employers, manufacturers, and dealers of all kinds, having combined, exercise preference to unionists as applied to themselves ancl their fellows, though they condemn it in other people. Preference to unionists applies to them, and it equally applies to the workers. _ It must necessarily do -so; because without it there can be no effective organization. The non-unionist, Tvhether employer or employee, is the disruptive factor which breaks up, or tends to break up, organizations, and render them weak and ineffective. whether of employers or employees, must, somehow, have the principle of preference applied to it in order to insure success. tions amongst the men have created or strengthened organizations amongst the employers. Organization is used by the employers, not only to fight the men, but also to fight the general community as well; and that is how we get the trusts. In one sense, I do not for one moment blame the employers, for their organizations are intended to benefit them, just as organizations are intended to benefit the employees. blame the employers for fighting for their own interests, or for forming trusts and combines, which, in themselves, are not to be unreservedly condemned. ployers' organizations apply the same principle as do Labour organizations and lawyers' organizations. MrW . H . IBVINE point. But the lawyers do not ask the law to protect them. the men are based on the same principle as those of the employers, namely, self interest. They must defend themselves, and to that end they must organize themselves in order to be effective, just as the Attorney-General and myself are organized for the protection of our professional interests. The legal organization is one of which I approve. Of contrary opinion to the honourable member for Melbourne, I do not regard it as illegal or unlawful . but just as well within the law as any organization of working men. The trust or combine, which is the expression of the effective organization of employers and great traders, is based on preference to unionists. MrW . H . IBVINE But not legal preference. the practical principle of preference to unionists; there w ill be plenty of time to talk about the other aspect of the question when that wretched B ill to prohibit preference is before us. MrW . H . IRVINE -Then the honourable member is talking on general philosophic principles? principle of preference is vital and necessary, and that it. is only when the trust or combine has grown so great and powerEvery organization, therefore, f u l , with the aid of preference, as to be able to exploit the people that it ought to be condemned. That is why the Attorney-General thought it was necessary to As I have said, organizaamend the Constitution; so that we might be able to deal with predatory trusts and combines. General says he is going to deal with trusts and combines so as to knock away the only prop under the platform of the Labour party. son that the Attorney-General has? Does We cannot he propose to take the step in the interests of Australia, or merely as a party move in support of a Prime Minister who always subordinates public to party conThe emsiderations ? would not have a prop to stand on if this were taken away. U p to a certain being the case, we invite the Government now to bring their proposals forward, and promise that we shall support them; the Government are welcome to knock all such proposals away if. they regard them as necessary to the party warfare. As to legal preference, it may be pointed out that the organizations of the men and the combines of tlie employers are related and inter-act. The operation of the restrictive trust increases the cost of living, and this in turn increases the industrial unrest: and the two act and re-act one on the other.

The two methods of organization are parallel and one; and we require the regulation of the trust, just as we require the regulation of the organizations of the employees. MrW . H .

That is why we ask for legal preference to unionists. We cannot hope to get men to enter industrial organizations if others, who hold aloof a.ud do not contribute, are to obtain the benefits. Men will not organize and pay for benefits which are enjoyed by skulkers; and, therefore, there must be legal preference or open warfare. non-unionist question has been the cause of more strikes than any otlier; and are we to leave this matter unregulated -leavee the men to fight it out like rats iu a pit-o r are we going 'to regulate it by law ? more unrest since the regulation started than there was before. ber has made that statement previously, and it does not require an answer. But something more than legal preference is necessary. As I have nointed out, there are, ' unfortunately, numbers of men who are willing to enjoy benefits without paying for them; and I hold that there ought to be Government preference. The Government believes in regulation by law, and in preference to unionists for the purpose of bringing men into organizations and encouraging them to resort to the law rather than to force. Why, therefore, should the Government I not adopt the same course which it enforces through its Courts on the ordinary employer ? We have heard much about ' ' spoils to the victors ' ' and ""TammanyH a l l "" ; but the Attorney General ought to be ashamed of himself for making such a statement as he did H.

It is the truth of the statement Lhat has I shall' reach that irritated the honourable member so much. ment that has irritated me, but the fact that a man like the Attorney General, placed high on the icy pinnacles of political principle, should make such a statement about honest men. If combines are to be regulated, if they are willing to obey the law and not to fight against it , then they should have the same privilege as the employees who submit to regulation, and should also be given preference to unionists by COOK -Quite the conlaw. I propose, in conclusion, to deal with the question of the double dissoluW e desire to regution. Applying the words used by the Chief Justicei n another matter, I have no hesitation in saying that the use of the section of the Constitution in question, as proposed by tlie Government, would be nothing less than a fraud upon the Constitution.

To say that a provision introThe duced to enable deadlocks to be overcome : is to be used as an instrument of party warfare-and members of the Government have said that it is to be so used-is a fraud upon the Constitution.

From the history of the matter, it is apparent that when the people's will has been declared by the election of members to the House of Representatives, and this, the people's House, has deliberately passed a measure expressing the people's will, and the people's will so declared has been persistently blocked by a Chamber not elected upon a population basis, these provisions are in tended to come into force. Those are the circumstances with which action 57 of the Constitution is really intended to deal. people have asked is passed by this House, and improperly blocked by the Chamber of review-the House which is not the popular House, but the States' House-the object is to give the people another opportunity of saying which House is to prevail.

That is the whole history In the first place, I and scope of provisions of this kind. The disagreement has to be on a particular measure, yet here the Government are pushing forward two measures which are confessedly unimportant. This House has to pass them, and if the other House rejects them again, that is to bring about a double dissoluI was simply contion, although the Government have confessed that these are not the measures upon which they are going to the country if a dissolution is obtained.

Their procedure, therefore, is utterly wrong. It is a complete misuse of the dead-lock sections of the Constitution. The Government are not using these provisions to remove a deadlock that has occurred on some vital question; they are rather using them.to create a dead-lock for narty purposes of their own. That is why I say they are committing a fraud upon the ConstituThe object of the tion and upon the people. That this is so is plain from the so-called test Bills themselves. Supposing one of them is again rejected by the Senate-and according to my honourable friends opposite one is quite sufficient to bring the dead-lock provisions of the Constitution into operation-and supposing also that the Senate comes back very little altered, these provisions, so far as the double dissolution is concerned, will not have brought about the unlocking of the dead-lock.

I shall conclude by reading a characterization of that great jurist, and by applying it to the Attorney-General. It was said of Lord Halsburyi n a recent English utteranceHo is one of the few indisputable Tories that are left to remind us of that incredible breed. He stands for everything that is in possession, nnd is the enemy of every one wbo is dispossessed. Sir Frederick Banbury himself is not a more uncompromising foe of Democracy. He would not even let them have trams across the bridges in order to get to tbeir work lest such concessions sliould breed in them a perilous hunger for more luxuries and liberties. When lie led thc Die-Hards he talked of his "" solemn duty to God and his country,"" and no one doubted the sincerity of his utterance, for he is not given to talking humbug. He does really believe that God and his country belong to his own class, and that Parliament is a sacred institution only so long as it is in possession of that class, and makes laws to preserve its privileges against the heathen without. It w ill be admitted by most persons that so f a r as work from a national point of view is concerned this Parliament w ill be barren. There is no one responsible for the position in which the Parliament of the Conunonwealth has been plaeed but the Prime Minister and his colleagues. Wheni n the course of events it was decided that the honourable gentleman should have a majorit y in this House, and the right to form a Government, he readily accepted the task, knowing at the time that he would meet his opponents on equal terms in this House. He knew that if he in tended to carry any legislation in the in terests of the Commonwealth he must select measures which were not of a party character. "" Why did not the last Government do so ? "" My answer is, ""Because they received the mandate of an overwhelming majorit y of the electors to carry out their platform, majority of the votes of the people at the last election were cast against the party supporting the present Government."" if the Government were desirous of doing anything in the interests of the country, they would have selected measures which would meet w i th the approval of both sides in this House. But what position and incorrigibly Tory. did the Prime Minister take up? Immediately he formed his Ministry he decided to cut right across the principles of the party on this side. He decided to in troduce legislation which had for its object, not the welfare of the Commonwealth, but the welfare of the political party with which he is associated. A t the last election no preference to unionists was one of his battle cries, and he also said that his party, if returned, would put an end to day labour in the construction of public works. The Government introduced .measures, one of which was in tended to take away from the Conciliation aud Arbitration Court the. option to grant preference to unionists. Another measure was intended to provide for electoral reform. Honourable members opposite said that they were pledged to electoral reform. They had talked so much about the Labour party depriving the people of their votes by the abolition of the jiostalvoting provisions of the Electoral Act that, having accepted a commission to for m a Government, the Prime' Minister felt bound to introduce these measures, whatever might be his chance of passing them. In the circumstances the responsibility for the delays that have taken place, and the unnecessary expense which has been entailed upon the Commonwealth by this Parliament sitting month after month, and, possibly, for many months more, unable to do anything at all, rests upon the other side alone, because they failed to realize that they should have introduced measures which they would have some chance of passing, instead of measures in which they threw down the gauntlet to this side, hoping that, when we took up the fight, they would have something on which they might appeal to the country. The Prime Minister, during the reI am asked by interjection, cent recess, declared from time to time that the Government were going to the people at the earliest possible moment. It -is strange that if the Government intended to deal with any legislation at all they whilst the overwhelming should have relegated to the scrap heap the measures submitted to this Parliament last session. They say that it is of no use to bring on these measures, since That being so, I say that, they have no hope of passing them, and they claim that the only remedy for the present condition is an immediate appeal to the electors. Let me put the position as stated in the words of the Prim«",32,Governor General S Speech Address In Repl Y
149,Mr Charlton (Hunter ) [2.29],"Minister himself. Speaking on the 16th March of this year, the honourable gentleman is reported in the Sydney Morning Herald to have saidWe could, I dare say, keep doing as we did last session, when, by means of some stratagems to whicli we had to resort, by means of searchaction of the Government in remaining ing the Standing Orders, and finding an application for them not usual before, we managed to keep afloat. But there is no honour or usefulness in a position like ttat, and I have made work in the interests of the country. up my mind that I cannot retain the responsible position 1 hold w-day unless the people give us an accession of strength. Who has ever heard before of a case where the head of a Government coolly admitted that he carried on business in the previous session by resorting to a stratagem, by practically the straining of the Standing Orders, by placing the Standing Orders in operation in such a way as to bar the right of lionorable members on this side to deal with a censure motion ? a thing which has never before been heard of in the history of a Parliament. The Prime Minister confesses that he had to resort to a stratagem which, amongst other things, resulted in a member on this side being excluded from the Chamber. he confesses that that is tlie position he was placed in last session, I think it is high time that the Government, instead of bringing in more legislation which will occupy this Parliament, not for a month or two, but t ill Christmas, or perhaps a little later, should, if they intend to give effect to their programme, appeal to the people. The honourable gentleman, who admits to the public that he is tryin g fco get to the country, says thafc it is of no use to introduce legislation here. Yet, in fco be outlined many measures of considerable importance to be dealt with before he thinks of going to the people at a l l . he is not so anxious to get to the public as he would make them believe. realizes now that he took a wrong step at the initiation of his Government. He knows that he endeavoured to cut across the principles of a party which stands on .an equal footing with his own party in tliis House, and which has an overwhelming majority against him in the other House. stances, it was impossible for him to carry on the government of the country, and when he realized the position in which he had landed himself, he resorted to a stratagem, as he called it , for the purpose Mr Charlton. of retaining his place on the Treasury bench, and then he tells the people that he wants a double dissolution, in order to get away from a difficult position. My firm belief is that the cry of a double dissolution is a cloak to cover up the on the Treasury bench, when they know that they are practically unable to do any They know tliere is no substance in their claim for a double dissolution. They do not really believe that they w ill get a double dissolution, but they do know that, as long as the Prime Minister can dangle fchis cry before the eyes of the people, doing nothing all the while, he can justify his action. The honourable gentleman justified his retention of office in another way in the same speech. He went on to say that although the Ministry had been That is unable to do anything by way of legislation, it had done something by regulation, one of which was the appointment of permanent electoral officers who would give all their time to the work. He thought that the expense would be little If more . than under fche former system. If this Government came in to restore sound and economical administration, I fail to understand why they should plunge the country into additional expenditure by appointing seventy Divisional Returning Officers. If a i l to understand why the Government appointed a Commission to inquire into certain electoral matters, with a view to advising this House as to what is best to be done in fche interests of the country, and, while the Commission was sitting, decided upon making certhe opening speech, he causes tain alterations without the advantage of a report. I go further, and begin to question whether there is any u t i l it y in appointing Commissions at all. In a It plainly shows thafc speech yesterday, an honourable member said that the Government made certain He charges in regard to the administration of the Electoral Department which had not been proved, and the honourable member for Wakefield, who is a member of the Electoral Commission, interjected to this effect: "" Y o u are talking too soon. W a it a while u n t i l you see the report that is going to be sent in with regard to these He found that, in these circummatters."" that, whatever the Government may do in this respect, the Electoral Commission will back it up in its report.

If that is so, is the Electoral Commission to find out what has taken place, and then report to the We know the posiHouse. Why should the Government put the country to the expense of appointing Divisional Returning Officers and clerical Important stateassistants, and providing offices in which fco conduct their business? What work is there in an electorate to constantly occupy the attention of a Divisional Returning Officer and a clerical assistant? As a rule, the Commonwealth elections occur every three years. As far as we know, what the increased cost is estimated at cost works out. Considering that the Prime Minister came into office to restore sound and economical administration, it We have had an is worthwhile to look into this phase of at salaries varying from £60 to £200. That would average £150 per annum, or £10,500 altogether. These officers w ill look for offices in the centres of the divisions, where rents w ill be f a i r l y dear, probably averaging about 30s. a week, making altogether another £5,460 per annum for rent. Therefore these appointments w ill cost the country altogether £37,660 per annum. Under the old system, the Returning Officers got about £26 per annum, and there being seventy of them, cost the country £1,820.

(As the North Coast line from Dungog to Turco was constructed partly by day labour and partly by contract, it could not, of course, be included in this comparison.) The books of the Department show that, within the period named, there have been constructed under the contract system 404J miles of railway at a cost of £1,744,400, or an average per mile of £4,80fl. Under the day-labour system there have been constructed 765 miles of line at an aggregate cost of £2,540,897, or an average of £3,321 per mile. In the case of the contract lines the total cost exceeded the estimates by the sum of £229,880 (equal to 15 per cent.), whereas on thc day-labour lines the total cost worked out at £282 less than the total estimates.

The Honorary Minister will have an opportunity to reply, and, if he shows me to be wrong, I shall, of course, admit the fact. I come now to another matter which is even stronger, and to which, therefore, I desire the Honorary Minister to give special attention. The honourable gentleman stated that, up to the date of the commencing of this debate, he knew nothing about another offer having been made. tliere may be no mistake I had better quote the exact words used. While the Honorary Minister was speaking the honourable member for Grey asked him "" Was there any other offer in,"" and received the reply, "" There was no .other offer before me."" Later on the honourable member for Grey said, according to HansardTlic plea, of course, for having this .work done without tenders was want of time. I may say that I am credibly informed that there was another tender, and I should like to know whether the Prime Minister knows anything of the matter is so. I am told that Mr Timms made an offer to do this work; and I ask the honourable gentleman to find out whether that is a fact. It is said that Mr Timms put in an offer, and was prepared to enter into negotiations. I do not say that the matter went to the Minister, but 1 venture to say that support of my statement w ill be found in tbe Department. We have it , therefore, t h a t the first in t i m a t i o n w l i i c h t h is House received of a second offer h a v in g been made was t h a t g i v e n by the honourable member for G r e y , who b r o u g h t it under the notice of the H o n o r a r y Minister. The Minister then made f u r t h e r in q u i r y , f o u n d t h a t there was an a d d it i o n a l of f e r, and w r o t e to Mr Deane to ascertain the facts. The A g e , of 23rd u l t i m o , states t h a t As a result of these inquiries Mr Kelly has ascertained that on 24th January the then engineer-in-chief ( Mr Deane) received the following telegram from > Mr Joseph Timms:"" Understand you contemplate letting earth work on heavier portion East-West railway. If correct, would be glad to submit offer, as I have a very large plant available, complete in every detail, including locos., steam navvies, waggons and horses, value nearly £60,000. Could have equipment on road to Port Augusta within 24 hours' notice. We undertake to complete dam 50-mile peg within eight weeks of acceptance. Would be pleased to hear from you."" A following letter, written on the same date and to the same effect, was received. Mr Deane replied on 28th January, acknowledging receipt of the telegram and letter, and adding that it was probable that tenders would shortly be called. On Tuesday last Mr Kelly wrote the follow"" Y o u w ill remember that at the time my approval was sought on your recommendation of 5th February last for the allotment of work between 92 and 106 miles from Port Augusta to Mr Teesdale Smith, I was informed by you that Mr. Teesdale Smith had the requisite plant immediately available to carry out his contract, and was therefore in a better position than any other contractor to do the work. Since the meeting of the HouseI ask honourable members to note that I have become aware of Mr Joseph Timms' letter and telegram to you, both dated 24th January last, and your reply to him of 28th idem. I would be glad if you would explain (1) Howi t is that the above offers were not submitted to me when Mr Teesdale Smith's offer was recommended to me for acceptance; and (2) why the correspondence in question, which had a material bearing upon the so. issues, was never sent to thc head ofiice for Ministerial consideration."" Mr Deane, in his reply to the Minister, saidThe fact that Mr Timms had made an offer on 24th January entirely slipped my memory, and I did not identify it with any particular section of the work. I was very much engaged with other matters at this time, and when Mr Teesdale Smith's offer arrived. . . . HadI remembered the fact of Mr Timms having communicated, the papers would certainly have been called for, but I should not bave considered it possible that those two men, who were frequently calling one another partners, and actually did so at the powellising inquiry, would be acting independently of one another, and not .to say antagonistically. I do not know why the, Timms correspondence was not produced to be considered with the Teesdale Smith offer. The actual practice of the office is to send papers connected with the works and contracts after dealing therewith ( if not done before) to Mr Hobler. Mr. Hobler was away on leave, .and they should have gone to Mr Gwynneth in his absence. . When Mr Teesdale Smith and Captain Saunders came over on 6th February, I sent for Mr Gwynneth, and we discussed the matter with Messrs. Smith and Saundersi n my conference room, and it might be supposed that Mr. Gwynneth would have beeii posted up with everything bearing on the subject. W it h regard to (2) :",41,Economy Effected

If he can clear himself of that charge, nobody wil l be more pleased than myself.

There can be no doubt that the Government must answer to the people of Australia for letting contracts without ing tenders, and also answer to the people of Western Australia in particular, and to the people of the Commonwealth generally, for cancelling the powellised sleeper contract. that they will have quite sufficient on their hands in those two questions to keep them busy when they face the electors. During this debate the Beef Trust has been frequently honourable members have gone so far as to say that it already exists in Those statements from this side of the House, because the honourable stated positively yesterday that he believed the trust existed in Australia, although he claimed that it did not work any injury to the people.

How can we expect to maintain the size of our herds? and that is where the people are going to suffer, because the Beef Trust are in a position to pay a much higher rate for stock by going around to the pastoralists individually get The result is that they are buying stock and exporting meat, and it is becoming scarce.

The honourable member for New England did good service to the consumers of meat in this country by showing that the pastoralists I venture to predict are becoming wealthy men because of the high prices they are obtaining for stock; whilst the poorer people, who have to work hard for a daily wage to keep their homes together, are called upon to pay referred to, and some considerably more for meat than they previously had to pay.

In view of your decision, sir, I will merely say fchafc, so far as the Western Australian market is concerned, the action of the State Government has had the effect of steadying matters, and of reducing the price previously prevailing by 2d. per lb. all round. State Government prices are I d . per lb. at least below those ruling in private L e t the honourable shops. If the honourable member for New England would look up the prices I have asked honorruling in the Sydney market in his own State he will find that they are going up every day, and thafcfcheyare so high that I point out that many people in Sydney and its suburbs have to deny themselves the luxury of meat. The butchers of Sydney will tell Meat the honourable member that there is not now the same sale for meat as there was previously because of the high prices obtaining. I am able to say, further, that when I was in the country a few months ago, during the last State elections, I met a pastoralist who was good enough to the quality was have a chat with me. He told me that fchat very day one of Mr Kidman's agents had waited upon him, and that he was in the district prepared to buy all pastoralists' stock for £ 9 5s. per head, and they were asking the right, by paying f 1, to purchase every calf that might be born, at the age of four years. That should show the peoplja of Australia that I direct the Kidman, Armour, and Swift and Company are prepared to buy from the pastoralists all the meat they raise, to export as much as they can, and leave the people here to suffer. I understood the A t torney-General to say that the difficulty could be dealt with, and to say something about putting an exporfc dufcy on meat. I ask honourable members on the other side how many of them are prepared to follow the Attorney-General's lead, and I ask the honourable put an export duty on meat? v I am rather surbers are not prepared to do so, I ask the Attorney-General to say how the Beef Trust) is to be dealt with unless we have I stopped the honoradditional powers given to this Parliament under the Constitution. All this goes to show thafc fche Government and I have nofc the the Attorney-General are playing with this question. They know that this Parliament does not possess the power to deal with these trusts, and that we require additional powers under the Constitution. The Attorney-General, during a recent discussion of the matter, and in reply to an interjection by the right honourable member for Swan, said that the States could not deal with these matters.
