3,Mr Johnson,"I wish to call the atfor in the Australian Tariff. The Chamber of Commerce has already presented a memorial to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, pointing out the "" injustice, hardship, and enormous losses"" which exporters would suffer by the Tariff coming into operation without notice, and urging Lord Elgin to ask the Commonwealth Government to postpone its operation for three months. Mr Churchill announced in the House of Commons last evening that Sir William Lyne, the Commonwealth Treasurer, had stated that he was unable to defer the collection of the new duties. When he heard this statement, Mr Harold Cox (who for many years acted as secretary to the Cobden Club), shouted excitedly, "" W ill the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce take this lying down?"" The chairman of the Birmingham chamber declares that in some cases the new duties are prohibitive, and he intends to confer with other chambers throughout Great. Britain as to what -action should be taken. Has the honourable gentleman read that cablegram, and, if so, does he still hope to deceive British manufacturers as to the sincerity of his expressions of a desire to give them substantial trade preferences? Sir WILLIAM LYNE the cablegram, but I do not know why the members of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce should be disturbed about the new Tariff, seeing that, according to the honourable member, Customs duties must be paid by the people of the country in which they are levied, not by those who export goods to that country. many statements, true and untrue, regarding the Tariff, I have read that manufacturers in other parts of the world say that if the rates of duty remain unchanged they will have to come here to manufacture. complain of, seeing that they can get here the raw material to manufacture what they require. gram from the Minister of Mines' and Railways in Western Australia to the effect that, under the new Tariff-, duty amounting to .£1,093 ^ °dhas been charged upon 1 wheels and'axles landed at' Fremantle by his Department, whereas the duty under the old Tariff would have ' been only ^ 1 0 9 14s. and Customs inquire into the matter? and I shall inform the honourable member of the result of my inquiry. of opinion' that the tax upon magazines is a well-meant but mistaken emotional inspiration of the Minister, that the advertisements contained in them are not local and cannot come into competition with local advertising, and that there is no tax on the raw material of genius and talent, even if imported, will the Minister of Trade and Customs, without delay, remove this tax, and allow the public free enjoyment of imported literature? n--jt put my legal' knowledge against that of the honourable gentleman, but he-must know that it is not within my power to remove this duty; that it can be removed only by Parliament.

This shows my regret for a statement which may have that in 542 cases the recommendations of the done them harm.

These figures represent different ratesnot items. Items frequently consist of two or more different rates, and in some instances some of the rates recommended by the Commission under an item have been varied and in others followed. I think it necessary to explain that the reports referred to above are not the reports of the Tariff Commission, but those of the protectionist section of that Commission. Similar paragraphs have appeared in the press from time to time, and to show that the public is misled by them, I wish to read an extract from a letter 111 regard to the kerosene duty appearing in this morning's Argus, in which the writer saysIn the first place, you state that the Tariff Commission recommended that kerosene should be admitted free, but this is not so, as the Royal Commission progress report No. 30, item 84 (see special report No. 28), clearly states:-""We recommend that-kerosene in bulk be admitted free, but that packages containing less than 10 gallons shall be dutiable at 3d. per gallon.""

WIRE NETTING: Minister, upon noticeWill he be willing to import shipments of wire netting direct (similar to the action of a South Australian Premier) in the event of prices on wire netting being increased by local manufacturers ;. or will he endeavour to obtain from Australian manufacturers of wire netting a guarantee that prices will not be raised if the tariff proposed on that article is agreed to. had time to consult my colleagues in reference to this matter, but, in any case, it appears to me that if the honourable member's request were complied with, numerous similar applications would be made in regard to other items upon the Tariff, and that it would therefore be practically im'possible for the Government to take action in the matter.

After a close examination of the Tariff now before us, I have come to the conclusion that many anomalies are also to be found in it. Those -responsible for its introduction appear to have given very little care and attention to its preparation, and it will be the duty of the Committee to see that the anomalies with which it bristles-and many of which are similar to those which existed under the old Tariff-ar e removed I am not in accord with the view expressed by the leader of the Opposition that he recognised that the last general election resulted in a victory for protection so far as the representation of the people in this House was concerned-",16,Cancelle D Ma Ii Contract Guarantee Bombardier Lang

I am ready to admit that the majority of honourable members returned to this House at the last general election are protectionists, but the issue at that election did not relate to the question of free-trade or protection. The leader of the Opposition himself travelled from one end of Australia to the other and invited free-traders and protectionists to join forces in a fight against Socialism. Many protectionists and free-traders responded to that call, and, therefore, whilst I admit that there is a majority in favour of protection in this House, I do not agree with the leader of the Opposition that the last general election was a victory for protection. . In many of the States the fiscal issue was not raised. nearly all the anti-Socialists who were returned are protectionists? appeal by the leader of the Opposition that the protectionists and free-traders should combine . to fight the issue of Socialism. ber for East Sydney abandoned the policy of free-trade for a myth. relating to the Tariff to bring under the attention of the Committee that I do not wish to be led into a lengthy discussion regarding the last general election.

The evidence submitted to the Commission clearly proved that, in most cases, manufacturers were doing well. Many industries to which these high rates of duty relate are in a flourishing condition, and that being so, there can be no justification for passing a Tariff that will impose'very serious burdens on the primary industries of Australia and the great mass of the community. It will be for those who favour this Tariff to prove that under the old rates production has diminished, trade has decreased, employment has fallen off, and wages have been reduced, and that, therefore, the higher duties are necessary. Although the Free-trade Party in this House is in a minority, I trust that they will be able to secure the co-operation of many protectionists in an effort to materially reduce a number of the proposed duties. A perusal of the reports of both sections of the Tariff Commission will, I trust, lead to such a combination. ber think that we shall find ourselves in a minority when we endeavour to secure a reduction of the duties on the necessaries of life? that honourable members of the Labour PartyI have so many matters who claim that they are more closely identified with the people than are the Opposition, will fight with us in an effort to reduce the duties on food, clothing, and many other commodities used by the masses of the people, and that in this effort we.shall be assisted by honourable membersbelonging to other parties in the House To those responsible for this Tariff, I . would was it raised in say that the latest Commonwealth, statistics I hope to prove bedo not bear out the contentions that under Many of those off, and wages have been reduced.

It seems to me that the Tariff has been framed for the especial benefit of the manufacturers who failed when before the Tariff Commission to just i fy their demand for. higher duties. Some time ago. we heard frequently of the strangled industries in and around Melbourne. factories were addressed during the luncheon hour by honourable members of this House, who assured us that various industries were in a very serious condition.

I absolutely disagree with the conclusions and recommendations arrived at by the Chairman of the ,Tariff Commission and his protectionist colleagues in connection with these matters. The reports of the free-trade section of the Commission speak for themselves,. It is honourable member's protectionist colleagues on the Commission say ? ently tickled the ear of the Minister and his colleagues, because in hundreds of instances they have followed the recommendations made by that section of the Commission. The Acting Prime Minister, when speaking in this House on Wednesday, dismissed the reports of the free-trade wing of the Commission with the statement that We all show an aptihe "" recognised that such reports were in existence."" Before we have dealt finally with the Tariff, he will regret that he has not read them. They are based, not on mere statements contained in circulars issued by manufacturers, but on sworn facts. When the proposed Tariff is fairly and honestly considered in detail, I believe the Acting Prime Minister will find great difficulty in combating the conclusions arrived at by the free-trade members of the Commission. The Tariff fence which the Meetings of workers at various Acting Prime Minister is endeavouring to erect is so high that many honourable members will "" j i b "" at it. may apply whatever term he chooses to the proposed T a r if f ; but I am satisfied that several rails will have to be taken out of the fence before even the protectionist members of the House are able to surmount it. In the course of our investigations, we found that a large number of the complaints as to the operation of the old Tariff came from one State. It strikes me as rather remarkable that the applicants for higher duties were mostly from Victoria, where a protective policy had been in operation for very many years. It might be thought that, if the' One effect Of protection is to establish manufactures, and, as has often been said, to so encourage infant' industries as to, in time, enable them to rely on their own strength, there would not be complaints from a State where high protection had been enjoyed for so long. But we are prehistory of the world has proved time after time., namely, that, once protective duties are imposed, they seldom, if ever, can be removed.

When under the -Commonwealth there arose Inter-State competition, the Victorian industries, instead -of being in that strong stable position which we have been led to believe would -be the result of protection, were the subject of the largest number of complaints. Another fact is that very few consumers .gave evidence before the Tariff Commission. sidering that the consumers are much the larger body-are , in fact, the bulk of the people of the Commonwealth. gave evidence, did they not? it is to be regretted that the other side of rebelling and are at this moment fighting die picture was not presented more against the power of the trusts as strongly strongly.

57,Mr Austin Chapman,"I think that isclrawback which is common to every protective Tariff, namely, that, when there; is an attempt to give protection to one industry, another industry may be very seriously hit. When we protect one industry, we find, it may be, that we have taxed the raw material of five or six other industries; and this is to the allegation of dumping, the Commisa matter which has to be very seriously considered when we are dealing with the' Tariff in detail. We must take care that what may be the raw materials of several industries are not taxed for the benefit of one industry, but. that they are admitted freely in order that as many people as possible may be employed in production. Some time ago there was a great agitation in regard to what is described as "" dumping "" ; and it was contended that the pracby the admissions of the manufacturers:, tice is very disadvantageous to Australian manufacturers. But, although many manufacturers were examined before the Commission, not one was able to cite a single case in which dumping had occurred in any part of'Australia. It would be thought that after the clamour the representatives of the very men who gave evidence, there would have been proof of at least one instance. asked ? may be seen from the evidence, the question arose; but not a single instance of dumping in connection with importations was proved. That, I think, is very signifiwoollen mills-whe n it was up to standard cant -rwa s preferred by them to the imported ber explain why the Commission did not take some evidence from the users or con-' sumers of goods? come before the Commission. everybody's business is nobody's .business. a couple of years, and notices were inserted in the press of the various capitals inviting people to give evidence. The manufacturers all presented themselves with their cut-and-dried cases-the y were the interested people, who had something to gain from higher duties-bu t the great conto listen to such an important speech. suming public of Australia, to which we all belong, were not represented. As the honourable member for Perth has said, what is everybody's business is nobody's business; and the result was that little or no evidence was given on behalf of the. public. As I said before the honourable' member for Grey entered the Chamber, I felt that omission very keenly. But, of course, the Commission could not summon people to give evidence; and if they did not present themselves, we could not help it, though in common with, I am sure, all honourable members, we regret the fact. Assion found that there had been followed in Australia a well-known rule of trade. Australian manufacturers admitted that, iiv the course of tTade, large shipments are sent to other countries at a cheaper ratethan that at which they would be sold in the country of origin, or at a cheaper rate than would be charged for small parcels. That has been the practice to a considerable extent in the Commonwealth, as shown themselves; but there was not a tittle of evidence to show that dumping had occurred in connection with importations intoAustralia. Much has been heard about prejudice against Australian goods, and there is no doubt that in years gone by such prejudice existed. In many instances, however, the Commission found that the prejudice was well founded, owing to the quality and character of the goods manufactured in Australia. We also found that when Australian goods, were up to standard, from the point of. view of quality and price, they were in many instances preferred to imported goods. For example, we were assured by tailors that the produce of Australian article. In other words, no real prejudiceexists against Australian manufactures so-' long as they conform to the standard of imported manufactures in respect of quality and price. It was asserted again and again by witnesses who appeared before theCommission that, owing to the rate of wages paid to employees in Australia, and to-, the hours worked by them, local manufacturers were under a great disability ascompared with their oversea competitors. thing that there are ho honourable memberspresent upon the other side of the Chamber Acting Prime Minister, in his statement to the Committee the other evening, merely recognised that reports had been forwarded to the Government by the free-trade section.",20,Chapman Th E People Sented With Only Another Example Of What The

138,Mr Fuller,"I do not know howsense of their position, that result is, at any lay out his money, but may obtain stock rate, a good one. The balance-sheets of the Ballarat Woollen Mills showed a very satisfactory state of affairs. ger was confronted by one of the Commission with one of his own balance-sheets; and it was shown that, with a capital of .£30,000, a dividend of 15 per cent, had been paid for several years. which can pay such a dividend cannot be described as struggling or in a strangled condition. In New South Wales the Commonwealth Tariff gave the manufacturers a duty of 15 per cent., but we were informed by Mr Vicars that the impost had effected scarcely any changethat under the old system of free-trade he was doing just .as well. A South Australian manufacturer said that he did not regard the progress made in South Australia as due to the Commonwealth duty, but to better methods of business, which they had been compelled to adopt, with satisfactory results. In Tasmania the reduction of duty under the Commonwealth Tariff was from 20 per <:ent. to 15 per cent., and it was admitted that the industry had profited under the lower duty. As Mr Hogarth himself said, using similar expressions to those used by Mr Grainger, the lower Tariff had given the manufacturers a shake-up, and. on-the whole had done them good. That was the result of. the competition which they had to face, causing them, as it did, to adopt better methods of business. According to the honourable member for Bendigo, and the manufacturers who gave evidence, the disabilities under which the latter were alleged to be suffering were unfavorable conditions regarding the buying of raw material, the great initial outlay of capital on buildings and plant, higher wages and shorter hours, local prejudice, and excessive and unfair oversea competition. the grounds on which higher duties were claimed, and now let us see how the manufacturers succeeded in substantiating them. In regard to the alleged unfavorable conditions regarding the buying of raw material, it was conclusively proved that the Australian manufacturer is in a better position than his competitor in England. Postmaster-General agrees with me as to that, because it is so seldom that we do agree. The manufacturer here can practically buy wool all the year round; sales are always going on, so that he need not as he requires it. In addition he has the advantage of saving freight, insurance, and chasers of wool have to pay. There was no direct evidence as to the relative cost of land and buildings in Australia and in England; but it is more than probable that An industry the cost here is not higher than at Home. In fact, the site for a .factory in England would, in all probability, cost very much more than in Australia. pend on the situation. that, in a congested country like England -and there are many considerations in choosing the site of a woollen factory-the cost would be the greater. the honourable member mean?

These were which the honourable member and I must agree to differ. I contend that, in all probability, the cost of a site in England is greater than it would be in Australia. I come now to the question of the wages paid in the industry. If honourable members will refer to the Statistical Register of -New South'Wales they will see that it contains a table showing the rate of wages paid in the industry in that State as comI am glad that the pared with the rate of wages paid in Victoria.

Accordingly, the Comptroller-General Christie, of the Customs Department, to take steps to obtain these. In his report this officer explained that the mills and others were "" on the qui vive re samples required,"" and as an instance of the difficulties encountered in this connection wrote :"" A retail firm doing an extensive business in the city endeavoured, at my request, to get samples of the goods required from each of the mills, but the latter being aware that the firm only dealt in imported woollens, informed them that it wpuld be of no use sending samples, as they were so f u l l up of orders that they could riot supply any fresh orders, for. some considerable time to come."" However, with the assistance of a lady expert, the'samples were eventually obtained. The only difficulty about procuring the samples of imOf the ported flannels was that the season for importation was practically over when the order was circulated for the officers to take samples at the various shipping sheds.

Those instructions conclusively showed that no endeavour was made to select the best samples of imported flannels: It was pointed out by' Mr Vicars and Mr Blackm'an that a large quantity of very inferior flannel was being sent from Victoria into New South Wales.

According to the Victorian Year-Book of 1903, the Victorian woollen mills used154,388 lbs. cotton in 1899, 78.332 lbs. cotton 1 in 1900, 250,184 lbs. cotton in 1901, 273,335 lbs. cotton in 1902, 368,749 lbs. cotton in 1903. Those figures are an evidence that adulteration has been largely practised in Victoria, by the use of cotton in the manufacture of so-called woollen goods. trust, therefore, that the Government will endeavour to procure the adoption of the recommendation which I have just read, and honourable members seem to endorse, and that all three of our recommendation's in regard to woollen manufactures will be adopted. woollen industry is the blanket trade. We have been told by writers in the press and by public speakers that the blanket-making industry is being ruined because of the immense importation of blankets, but that statement is not borne out by the following statistics, showing the importations of blankets and blanketing into Australia. These importations, in 1899, were valued at ,£111,624; in 1900, at .£134-233; in 1901, at .£122,399 ; in 1902, at .£114,503 ; in 1903, £70,946 ; in 1904, at £57,720; in 1905, at ^57>899; and in 1906,at £,53»5°&As a matter of fact, there has been a great decrease in importations. When I stated some time ago that the woollen mills were not able to fulfil their orders, that statement was received with incredulity; but this is what the free-trade members of the Tariff Commission have to say on the subjectThe difference between the imports of woollens in 1899 and 1905-tw o fairly typical years -is equal to an increase of 34 per cent., and this, in view of the increased prosperity of recent years, cannot be regarded as in any way abnormal. That the Australian woollen manufacturer has enjoyed a large share of this prosperity is notorious. In addition to the evidence of witnesses, we learn, from official and. other reliable sources, that for some time back the majority of the woollen mills has been fully employed, many of them running overtime, while their customers are unable to obtain delivery of their orders. In substantiation of that statement, the evidence of Mr Hogarth, a Tasmanian manufacturer, of Mr Ripley, an importer, who gave evidence in Sydney, of Mr Vicars, a Sydney manufacturer, of Mr Thomson, and of Mr Max Hirsch is cited. 1 Hirsch know about the matter? not fersona grata to the honourable member for Maribyrnong, and if the Committee will not attach importance to his statements, I ask it to consider the statements of manufacturers like Mr Hogarth and Mr Vicars. higher duty, and said that he would extend his premises if he got it. will extend his premises. I hope that in view of what I have said, honourable members will agree with the free-trade members of the CommissionThat Australian manufacturers are not in an unfavorable position in connection with the buyA very important part of the ing of their raw materials. On the contrary,* they are in a much better position in utilizing Australian wool than their oversea competitors can possibly be. That the outlay of capital on factory buildings and site is not greater in Australia tban in Great Britain, but the expense of equipping with machinery is possibly 30 per cent, greater, equal, approximately, to about 2 per cent, on the value of the annual output. In"" my opinion, the value of the site is greater in Great Britain than in Australia. The greater expense of equipment here is largely due to the high protective duties on machinery, another evidence that in trying to protect one industry we cannot avoid handicapping another. Another conclusion which I hope will be accepted isThat the disability in respect 'of shorter hours of labour and higher wages works out on an extreme estimate at not more than 10 per cent, on the value of the product. In my opinion, the estimate might very well be put at less than 10 per cent.; but to be on the safe side, we have given an extreme estimate.

The conditions under which we believe that the woollen manufacture would progress rapidly towards that importance which it ought to occupy, were summarized in three recommendations, the first of which I have read, and the second and third beingSpecialization by the manufacturers in respect to such goods as their local conditions and raw materials are best adapted for. A settled fiscal policy which would leave this industry untrammelled by duties supposed to benefit it or others. The free-trade members of the Commission are satisfied, after the fullest investigation of the subject, that what is required to make the woollen industry prosperous and progressive is not higher duties. Unfortunately, it is only too common a thing in Australia, when an industry is not making headway, to immediately appeal to the Government to assist it by means of a bounty or a protective duty, the hundred-and-one reasons for which the industry is at a standstill being lost sight of, or put on one side.

The statement that the Denton Hat Mills Company is unable to fulfil orders has been directly challenged by him, and I hope that the honourable member for Brisbane will prove his assertion. I propose now to refer to the item of varnishes. The wages cost in the manufacture of varnishes-and we have to remember that nine-tenths of our imports of varnish . come from Great Britain-is less than 20 per cent., while the proposed duty is 2s. per gallon, or 30 per cent.,, whichever will return the higher duty. It is well known that not much-labour is employed in this industry. The degree of labour involved is, probably, smaller than is that associated with any industry' of Thus we corresponding dimensions. Employment in the trade increased under the old Tariff,, so that there is no necessity for raising the duty. Protectionists may well fall into line with free-traders who declare that a duty so far in excess of the actual wages cost might well be lowered. I think it ought to be reduced at least to the wages cost. Then we find that an increased duty has been imposed on candles. A very fult report upon the candle-making industry has been submitted by the Tariff Commission. The total labour cost in the finishing; moulding, and packing of candles for market, exclusive of making stearine, amounts; to not more than 8 per cent, of the value of the finished product. stearine is the principal, item. If we exclude it very little is left. cost in the manufacture of candles from 1 difference. high direct protection in the shape of freights and landing charges.

I am sure we all hope that our great timber forests will be developed, but -we have to remember that the timber in many of the forests of New South Wales and Queensland is almost inaccessible, -while in some cases our forests do not comprise the timber that is necessary for certain industries caused Queensland maple to be substituted for other timbers. timber. It has been said that Queensland pine is unsuitable for butter-boxes. It is perfectly true that its appearance is not ""so pleasing as is that of the New Zealand -pine, and that it is somewhat heavier; but I do not think it is unsuitable. I was present when, before a number of experts -and I claim to know something about butter myselfa Queensland pine butterbox was opened, and it was found that butter which had been packed in it for six months was in a condition equal to that .of butter packed in New Zealand pine boxes. supply the demand for pine for butter boxes. to that point. The dairying industry today is exporting millions of pounds weight of butter, and its successdepends upon its export trade. The result of the new Tariff on New Zealand pine has been to increase by 2id. the cost of every butterhox made of that timber. A butter-box will hold 56J lbs of butter, and, since tens of thousands of boxes are annually used, the additional cost to the dairy farmer must be a very big-item. with what the mail steam-ship companies have been trying to take from them. on the one hand have imposed a duty 'which will take thousands of pounds out of the pockets of our farmers, they are en deavouring, on the other hand; to arrange a mail contract that will enable, their.dairy 'produce to be carried cheaply and quickly to the old. land.

From inquiries which I made when in Queensland, I am satisfied that some time must elapse before that State will be-capable of supplying the demand for pine for butter-box making. We have to remember that the dairying industry is by no means stagnant. No industry in Australia has gone ahead so rapidly as has the dairying industry in New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland. It is the most progressive in the Commonwealth, and we should be careful not to handicap it. Australia's remoteness from the markets of the old world, as compared with the position of other countries now sending butter to England, places our dairy farmers at a serious disadvantage. But instead of facilitating them in every way, we are imposing increased duties on the timber required for their butter-boxes, on the wire-netting necessary to protect their holdings, on the salt used in the manufacture of their butter, on the timber and iron with which they build their homes, and on most of the necessaries .of life. Whilst the Government are subjecting our dairy farmers to all these disadvantages, . they are absolutely unable by means of a duty to increase by the smallest fraction the price which they obtain for their produce.

In Queensland, engineers said that there was not a large enough outlet in mines and sugar mills to keep them going; they were aware that a lot of mining machinery had been idle for some time, and that the mining industry was very depressed. In the Report of the Chief Inspector of Factories for Victoria, 1904, page 27, relating to the iron-moulding trade, it is stated"" Unfortunately, however, owing to the mining, industry being for some time at a very low ebb, trade has been very slack, and I found that a large number of men were unemployed."" a the same officer's report for the year 1905,, g 5J appear the following remarks by ine so much so that some of the shops have been working two shifts to keep up with their mines throughout this, district have been verysuccessful during 1905, thereby being able In Queensland, evidence on this to the State of Queensland.

The position stood out in bold contrast to the prosperous years experienced immediately prior to Federation, when there was a succession of good seasons. Immediately after the Commonwealth was instituted, however, there was one of the most disastrous droughts which ever overtook Australia, and that was one of the causes for the great falling off in the demand for mining machinery. Another cause, -the effects of which were felt most keenly, particularly in Victoria, was InterState trade, which is specially referred to in another report, so that I need not deal with it a.t the present stage. As to the use of second-hand machinery, I am sure all honourable members connected with mining will bear out the finding of the Commission as followsIn the development of mining properties during some five or ten years prior to Federation, -a very large quantity of machinery was pro.cured, mainly in the Commonwealth, which, while suitable for surface propositions and the treatment of free milling ore, was discarded when other methods had to be employed, or the mines reached greater depths. there was a good deal of imported machinery purchased for working several -Western Australian properties which was' never used. In this way, a large, quantity of good machinery was either ""scrapped"" or sold and removed for working other claims, for which it was suited, and, consequently, met the demand which otherwise would have been supplied by . new machinery from Australian makers. There are, therefore, a variety of factors which account for the depression which exists in the mining machinery industry. that when honourable members carefully consider the position, they will agree with -the free-trade section of the Commission that the depression in the industry is due, not to the operation of the old Tariff, but to the nine different causes enumerated in pur .report There :is no, comparison between the mining and engineering industries, from the stand-point of their value to Australia. In the case of mining machinery, the duty levied under the old Tariff was higher than the' average of the State Tariffs in operation prior to Federation. That there is a big future before the mining industry 'of Western Australia is conceded by every I think that is so. The try in Queensland, too. make special reference in this connection to It -is common knowledge Western Australia. We know that to profitably develop the mines of those Statesi t is essential that up-to-date machinery-shall be employed. A large quantity of this machinery cannot be made in Australia. It is subject to patent rights which render that impossible. If opportunities are to be afforded the mining companies to develop their properties at considerable depths, and with low-grade ore, we must permit them to obtain, as freely as possible, the most up to-date machinery available. Many of them have almost reached the stage when it is -difficult to carry on. operations at a profit, and unless we* allow them to obtain their machinery at the lowest possible price there is no doubt that many of their workmen will be thrown out of employment. does not suggest that the dividends might be a little smaller? proved that the old Tariff did not operate to the injury of the mining machinery trade. As a matter of fact, several Australian engineering works have been fully employed. It has also been demonstrated that since the first Commonwealth Tariff became In. addition, law, there has been a.great reduction in the imports of mining machinery. Reference to official statistics clearly establishes this fact -' tain poor mines can only be made remunerative by the use of up-to-date machinery ? provedThat, owing to the limited, irregular, and special demands of the mining industry, no plants in Australia are capable of producing all I venture to . think of the machinery required for present-day mining. . . The demand in Australia for certain classes of mining machinery is. so limited that it ; would not pay any company to lay down a plant for its manufacture.

In' the course of the investigations of the Tariff Commission its members discovered many anomalies which both sections desired to get rid of. In this connection a very extensive .report has been compiled, and I feel that the members of the Commission are under a deep obligation to that excellent officer, Mr Smart, for the assistance which he and his subordinates rendered us. I venture to say that a number of anomalies will be discovered in connection with the present Tariff. Already one has been brought to light in the newspapers. It has reference to the cap industry. In speaking of the duty levied upon caps, Mr W. Lewis, the proprietor of the well-known Federal Cap Factory in Melbourne, saysIn my opinion the present Tariff, if allowed to stand, will mean the ruination of the cap manufacturing industry in Australia. caps under ""apparel,"" which is a fair thing. After all, they are simply tweed made up into a different form. will place the manufacturers at a disadvantage of) 5 per cent. tweed? the duty? Is it intended to compel them to purchase the locally-manufactured article ? chase it? should not purchase it, if it suits them to do so. cheapest article no doubt? in connection with all industries that the raw material should be admitted at a lower fate than the manufactured article. Mr Lewis continuesA brief examination of the new Tariff w ill, convince -you of tliis. woollen piece goods, which comprise our jaw material, were dutiable at 15 per cent., while 1 the rate charged on the manufactured article, caps, was 30 per cent. The effect of the new Tariff has been to raise the duty on our raw material, woollen piece goods, to 30 per cent, on the British and 35 per cent, on the foreign article. As against this, the duty on the manufactured article is unchanged, and still remainsat 30 per cent, on British goods, with an extra 5 per cent, on those of foreign manufacture I Now, manufactured caps are almost exclusively imported from Great Britain, but, on the other hand, we are compelled to go to Germany, Belgium, or France for our raw material, which, in consequence, bears the higher rate of 35 per cent. This means, in a nutshell, that whilewe have to pay 35 per cent, on the raw material,, the manufactured article can be imported bjr paying 30 per cent. they have to go to Germany?

The free-trade members of the Tariff Commission, however, pursued a different line of conduct, and pointed out a manner in which a substantial preference could be given to the old country without injuring the manufacturers here, even on a protectionist basis. tection in the recommendations of the free trade section of the Tariff Commission. the honourable gentleman differ to such a degree that it is hardly worthwhile answering his interjection. and the honourable gentleman's are wrong. nothing. If argument alone would carry the day, trie honourable gentleman would have no chance against any one of the free trade members of the Commission but, of course, he can beat us in the making of rash and injudicious statements which will not bear cross-examination. We found in regard to preferential trade thatIn nearly every instance the witness clearly indicated that no preference should be given by Australia to Great Britain until the duty had' been fixed at such a rate as to secure to Australian manufacturers the Commonwealth market with a substantial margin of security, even against the competition of British manufacturers. A witness examined in connection with the manufacture of springs expressed himself as in favour of preferential duties, but this was His evidence when pressed by one of tlie Commissioners to indicate precisely the nature of the preference which he desiredDo you want, in the first instance, a duty which will secure to Australian manufacturers the trade in the manufacture of springs-that is, against every one else?-Yes. I presume that when you have achieved that object by means of a duty, you will put on an ornamental coping in the shape of a few per cent, more against the foreigner?-Yes. Is it not the case that most of the so called preferential duties in this Tariff are intended to largely prohibit the importation of British goods, the extra 5 per cent, on foreign importations being merely an ornamental coping? Most of the importations of mining machinery and woollens come from Great Britain, and those interested in the manufacture of such goods in Australia a report in which he has emphasized what they regard as their handicap-highe r cost of raw material, shorter hours. of labour, and so forth. After a careful investigation of all the representations made to us, we found that, as a rule, 12 per cent, would cover the alleged disadvantages of the Australian manufacturer. Tariff injure British manufacturers, seeing that the duties are still higher against foreign manufacturers? manufactures are so high as to practically prevent their importation into Australia, and the extra 5 per cent, against the foreigner is merely ornamental, and, furthermore, is imposed on many items in regard to which there is no foreign importation. The, duties on mining machinery, textiles, and woollens are so high as to practically prohibit British importations, and it is from Great Britain that in the past such goods have chiefly come. The additional rate of 5 per cent, against the foreigner is a mere make-believe preference to the British manufacturer. I have already pointed out that the Chairman of the Tariff Commission has announced his intention not to vote for any reduction of duty, even on British goods, whose importation is prejudicial to Australian manufacture, and, as I have said, any importation must be prejudicial to some extent to the local manufacturers of goods of the kinds imported. The duties on British goods are such as will prevent them from competing against local manufacturers in this market. But I shall show the position which the Prime Minister and the Treasurer put before the British people when in England in connection with the Imperial Conference. It will be found, by referring to page 249 of the Report of the Proceedings of that Conference, that the Prime Minister made use of these wordsThe imports of wheat and flour into the United Kingdom amount to 41^ millions sterling an-; nually, and of this quantity Australia sends only £4,300,000. Of other grains, principally oats, barley, and maize, the imports of the United Kingdom are valued at 29 million sterling, to which Australia contributes an insignificant ,£9,000. . . . If we secure only one-fifth of this trade, employment would be found for a large number of farming hands, and if our export of wheat only reached the figure of ^'8,500,000, or twice the past year's total, and other.grains £5,000,000, as they might very well be expected to reach under a slight preference, this would mean the additional employment in the Commonwealth of 200,000",38,Chapman Th E People Sented With Only Another Example Of What The

The Prime Minister spoke of our people being purchasers of British goods. How will that be possible with duties of 30 and 40 per cent, on such goods? been obtained. of the report, the Prime Minister is made to sayNow, as regards the modes of preference to British goods, it is obvious that the Commonwealth may proceed either to lower existing duties in favour of Great Britain, or to increase these duties to the foreigner. .Not a word about increasing duties against Great Britain, which is what has been done. those existing when reciprocity was effected. Minister referred to the duties in existence at the time he was speaking. The report continues.This latter course has been followed in Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa, and probably in no perceptible degree influences the amount of duties collected. The immediate object of preference in our case would be to exclude foreign goods, and to favour. British goods. . . . It is natural, then, that the extent of the preentered into a preferential arrangement ference should be such as to be calculated to accomplish the first of these objects, that is, the cessation of importation of foreign goods, and an increase of present duties, would seem to be the best means to achieve this end. There is not a word there about increasing the duties on British goods. continuesI am assured by an authority that a substantial preference to the goods of Great Britain in our markets would result in an increase of British trade with Australia to the extent of perhaps 50 per cent. This would be the effect of substantial preferences, and substantial preferences are contemplated by the third resolution of the Conference of 1902. We can imagine what a howl would come from those interested in the woollen and other industries who have been clamouring for more protection if the present rates were reduced to give a real preference to British manufacturers, and the result were to increase the importation of British goods by 50 per cent. is that trade which is now done with the foreigner would be transferred to the Britisher. Prime Minister is reported to have said furtherThe Customs Tariff which we shall submit will be framed on the same principle I have been enunciating here. Our first consideration will be that of the circumstances of Australia and its demands. He would have been nearer the mark if he had said that the only consideration would be the demand, not of Australia, but of Australian manufacturers. This Tariff, is merely a pandering to the demands of the manufacturers of Melbourne, Sydney, and other large centres, in obedience to the dictates of a section of the Victorian press. So long as Parliament meets in Melbourne, the Ministry of the day will be influenced by the press of the capital, and the sooner money is placed on the Estimates to prepare for our removal to the Seat of Government in New South Wales, the better it will be for our legislation. The Prime Minister continuedThe next (consideration) will be the possibility of giving a preference, and, therefore, entering into closer commercial relations with the mother country and our sister dominions. The Tariff contains .a sham preference to Great Britain, but I see nothing in it providing for our entering into closer commercial relations with our sister dominions. with South Africa, which is not affected by this Tariff. in existence when the Prime Minister-made the remarks which I have quoted. The Treasurer is reported oni page 336 of the The report document from which I am quoting to have stated that it was ridiculous to suppose that a duty of 2s. a quarter on wheat would, raise the price of bread; but Mr Asquith and Mr Lloyd George, who ought to know something about the position of the people of England, did not agree with him. The English people do not seem to have forgotten the state of affairs which existed when Sir Robert Peel took action to remedy the starving condition of the masses of that country. They did not believe the honourable gentleman. evidence in support of that statement. He said, furthermore, "" that a duty of 3d. a bushel would encourage the colonies to put 15,000,000 or 20,000,000 acre.? under wheat, and find employment for at least 200,000 more men, Britons, I hope.""",39,Chapman Th E People Sented With Only Another Example Of What The

The Minister has introduced a Tariff in the interests of the big manufacturers in Australia, and yet, whilst in England, he declared that the thousands of immigrants whom the Government hoped to attract to Australia would consume not local manufactures, but the products of Great Britain, and thus increase employment in the old country.

312,Mr Foster (New England) [3.12].,"While I disagree with many of the statements to which he has given utterance, I may say at once that I am pleased with tlie attitude of the Opposition, and trust that we shall receive their assistance in our efforts to frame a Tariff that will be a credit to Australia, and will stand for a very long time. Unlike the honourable member, I am here fo fight for a purely protective Tariff. AlthoughI am not an expert, I fail to understand why, having regard to the arduous work performed so well by an able Commission, it should be said that the Tariff has not been properly considered. mended by the Commission is not that which the Government have introduced. port of the protectionist section of the Commission. The Tariff is high in places; but who could expect a perfect Tariff, when so many items have to be considered? I do not suppose that any representative House would accept absolutely the recommendations of a Commission. The members of the Commission undoubtedly did their best; but it is unfair to accuse those who drew up the Tariff now before us of having done so without due consideration. I was much struck by the emphasis which the honourable member for Illawarra laid on the importance of the mining industry. Mining, taken as a whole, seems to me practically a gamble. There is more money put into mining, not only in Australia, but in every other part of the world, than into any other form of gambling. affect the gambling element, but it affects the workers. this solicitude' for the worker. It is truly astonishing how careful honourable members opposite appear to be on behalf of the worker; but when there arises any test question as between the worker and the man who desires to sweat him. the sympathy for the worker is all on this side. I have had many years' experience of mining; :ind I should consider any company very weak-kneed that would be afraid to launch out on a speculation because of duties on mining machinery. Furthermore, the mining industry is not confined to gold or preless selfish.. In the early days of minim? in cious metals; and the Tariff is an attempt to develop mining generally. Australia can produce almost any mineral, especially iron and tin, and, though the mining companies may feel the effect of the Tariff a little, the duties will assist other branches of mining, by causing the local production of machinery made from raw materials raised in Australia. We have been told that the last general election was not fought on the fiscal question. That, however, could not be said of my own contest, because the gentleman who opposed me went very solidly for free-trade, as he had done as a member of this House. Personally, I stood for protection as well as for labour. ber's opponent not an anti-Socialist?

The farmers and miners, and the people generally, are willing to sacrifice a trifle to avoid such a calathe possibilities of his country, especially in' mity. The man who says'that protection will cost us nothing-that we are to have absolute cheapness straight off-is , in my opinion, not telling the whole truth. I do not look on protection as a final reform, but merely as a means whereby we may make Australia a country worth living in. I have heard a great deal about dumping to-day. Of course everybody is aware that in America there is a monstrous and abnormal growth in the form of trusts and combines. I know that members of the Opposition are always ready to assure us that these trusts are the result of protection. I admit that they have utilized protection to their own advantage just as they have utilized the weakness of the people, the poverty of the workers, and all the methods known to bad finance to their own aggrandizement. trade to-day seem to be quite willing to place our industries at the mercy of these trusts. Having read up this question some years ago, I recall the fact that in the early days of American history, Lord Brougham advocated the wholesale dumping of goods into America with a view to crushing its infant industries. As honourable members are aware, these enormous trusts would not hesitate to send millions of pounds worth of goods into this country .for the purpose of killing our industries if they were satisfied that they could subsequently recoup themselves by making larger profits. can find plenty of instances of dumping if we cafe to look for them. No doubt honourable members upon the Opposition side of the House are just as familiar with them as I am. aware of any such instances. member's purpose very much better to inwhen we recollect that at any time there terject that protection is the cause of trusts. may be an outbreak of war, and that we I wish to say, especially to the honourable may be called upon to stand to our defences, member, that I do not desire to see trusts I think we must recognise the need which, of any kind established in Australia. do not wish to see the people robbed, even to render the country self-supporting.

That rely in defending a protective policy. is why I stand for the protection of the agree with others that before Australia can employees and of the public from robbery* accomplish very much in the nature of either by the manufacturer or the middleman. Another objection urged to a protective policy is that if we close pur portsto foreign production, no ships will come here to take away our wool and meat. I have not a very exalted opinion of the Australian who has not a greater faith in view of the wonderful resources which we possess. I do not think much of the knowledge and foresight of the man who does not believe that in the future Australia will be able to export her products. What is to prevent her doing so if we adopt a reasonable protective Tariff. Its operation will undoubtedly give our manufacturers a larger turn-over, and a better chance to install more efficient machinery. What then is to prevent Australia from becoming an exporting country? It is not my intention to deal at length with any of the details of the Tariff. I do not believe in a revenue Tariff, neither do I believe in tax-, ing such articles as tea and kerosene, which we cannot produce locally. Nor would I impose a heavy tax upon magazines. Those who stand up for freetax upon wheat in the old country makes that commodity cheaper there, w ill not a duty upon kerosene cause that article to be sold cheaper here? duce kerosene in Australia, but it seems rather hard that we should tax that article straight away. I should prefer to foster the industry by means of a bonus. I.think that we can well afford to forego any special'tax upon kerosene. I am credibly informed that there is a firm in our midst which imports kerosene in bulk, and which tins it , and I do not see why the StandardWe Oil Trust should not do the same thing. J hope that members of the Opposition will not take my replies too severely to heart, ljecause I recognise .that they are just as earnest in their convictions as I am in mine.

If those two countries were engaged in an armed conflict, what a magnificent self-supporting position America would occupy. I can quite imagine that, whilst one fleet of vessels was being destroyed, she would be building another fleet. But in what position should we find ourselves in such an emergency ? next providing an effective means of defence. I recognise that if we are to build up a nation, Australia cannot continue to grow only wool and wheat, and to carry on our minor industries. We must go in for manufacturing, and therebv bring about a dense population"".

I was informed that the Commanding Officer investigated the case, and informed Bombardier Lang that he had no cause of complaint. I was also told thatBr. Lang was . . . . General Gordon to enable him to state his case, and to give him f u l l opportunity to make any statement he desired, with the result that he withdrew his complaint, and expressed himself satisfied. In reply to my inquiries Bombardier Lang informs me thatThe statement that I withdrew the complaint is altogether a misapplication of words. When I was before General Gordon, after his return from the Maitland camp, some days after I had been released, he made a long rambling statement, the meaning of which I took to be that if I let the matter drop I could get anything that I chose to go in for, but if I forced the matter I need not expect a bed of roses while I remained in the Artillery. ment. Minister of Defence to thoroughly inquire into it. It is a matter of mere justice. We have heard a great deal lately about proper military control and discipline, and while I agree that discipline is necessary, we should have as much at the top as at the bottom. The Governor General in Council having issued certain regulations giving the right to the least influential man in the forces to complain to his State Commandant, it was scandalous to keep Bombardier Lang under arrest for seven days for having made such a complaint. ^ I r . KING O'MALLEY -It was an outrage upon justice. the Minister will cause a thorough investigation to be made into the whole case. The humblest soldier in the forces has a right to receive fair treatment, and if he suffers injustice, the House should interfere. Some time ago, I asked the Acting Prime Minister to lay on the table a copy of the agreement entered into between the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and certain . immigrants from Europe, and a paper was laid upon the table which purported to be such a copy;' but, subsequently, the Minister said that a mistake; had been made, and that it was not a correct copy. ' I now ask him when he will carry out his promise, and place a certified copy on the table ? is stated in this morning's papers that the Premier of New South Wales has declared that no force was used in connection with the seizure of wire-netting in Sydney, which has caused such consternation through-, out Australia and probably all over the paraded before world, the public having been led to believe that force was used.

Therefore, let the honourable member bring his case before me, and if , when I have dealt with it, he thinks that I have unduly favoured any person, he will have a real ground of complaint. He has already discussed the matter in private-with me, and knows that no definite decision has yet been arrived at. Irstead of exhausting the Minister's authority, he has brought the matter before the House. the honourable member thinks I ought to have done, he would then have been justified in taking that step. [83] member's offer. thiee weeks ago I brought under the notice of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who was then Postmaster-General, several matters relating to the Launceston Post Office,, and to the postal service generally in Tasmania. The honourable gentleman assuted me that he was thinking of sending an officer to Tasmania' to inquire into the working of the Department there; but I are still very unsatisfactory. An honourable member who visited Tasmania some time ago had to wait at the Launceston post office for twenty minutes before he could purchase a stamp. This state of affairs has beei; going on for some time, and I should like to know whether the present Postmaster-General will see that improvements are effected as speedily as possible in connection with the Launceston post-office, and indeed in the service generally throughout Tasmania. The Acting Prime Minister yesterday replied to a question that I put to him with regard to the grant cf ^1,000 made to the executive of the Exhibition of Women's Work. He then stated that, so far as he was aware, only ,£15 had been paid over. Iq view of the fact that this grant was made by the Ministry without the authority of Parliament, and, so far as the papers O'MALLEY -The honourable disclose, nuite spontaneously, I should like to know whether the Acting Prime Minister will be prepared to cancel the unexpended balance and place the item on the Estimates in order that the opinion of the Parliament may be obtained. There has never been any urgency in regard to the matter. On the admission of the Acting Prime Minister himself, it appears that the grant was made, not to encourage any special effort on the part of the women of Australia, but to defray the cost of bringing exhibits' from Europe. of carrying exhibits from the continent to London. They will be carried from London to Australia free of charge. the exhibition are so influential that they should have had no difficulty in providing for HadI refused to do what freights without appealing surreptitiously to the Government for'so large a grant It is only due to the Parliament that the Acting Prime Minister should cancel the",47,Manian Postal Service Women S
