The offence of threatening to punishable by appropriate penalties which take commit some other offence is not normally into account their grave nature.

I have indicated that we support it. In certainly create some difficulty. There is one fact we adopted the Convention when we were in further matter in relation to threats. The maxigovernment. But I have raised the matters which mum penalties for offences in sub-clauses (1), I think are of some concern. I referred to clause 8 (2) and (3) of clause 8 range from 7 years to life and the excessive penalty for threats as against imprisonment but the penalty for a threatening the penalty for committing an offence. As I have offence is an undifferentiated 14 years. A person indicated, we are not at all satisfied that, when gets life or down to 7 years' imprisonment the onus of proof falls on the accused person depending on the gravity of the offence but in the under clause 9, he not only would have to say case of a threat there is a blanket undifferenthat he did not know but also would have to tiated penalty of 14 years which means that a prove that he had no reason to suspect. That is person who threatens to commit a violent attack wider than the Convention permits.. is in theory likely to be subject to a term of imprisonment twice as long as that for a person There is one other matter that relates to the anwho actually commits an offence. I just draw this cillary extradition legislation. I am assured, and I to the attention of the Attorney-General because know it is valid, that extradition could be sought there appears to be some inconsistency in the ostensibly on the basis of a crime when it might penalties which are meted out to those who are be a political exercise. In other words, somebody deemed to be guilty of a threat and those who might suggest that extradition procedures should are convicted of an offence. take place because he would like to have a person extradited but in reality that might occur because of political activities.
