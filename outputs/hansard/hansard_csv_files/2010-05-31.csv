156,"As We Have Heard, The Coalition Will Discon","The SPEAKER-Order! It being 10 pm,Monday, 31 May 2010 ----Dunkley Electorate: Crime Prevention touch on some very important issues for the Dunkley community around law and order, personal safety and security. These issues have been key priorities for the community I have represented for a number of years now. Together we have been able to achieve some gains in this area and show the way forward for what we need to do in the future. The installation of CCTV technology in Main Street, Mornington, has been a particularly positive influence and has helped combat antisocial behaviour and small-scale criminality. We are pleased to see that crime statistics in those areas have diminished accordingly. What is most frustrating, however, is that it has been nearly 30 months since the Howard government provided just short of a quarter of a million dollars to Frankston City Council to implement the next stage of the CCTV strategy that we developed together for the main city in the community that I represent. Thankfully, CCTV technology is in place and has been operating for some time-and operating very successfully-at the taxi rank which services the nightclub area in Frankston. But it has been operating on one of the council’s own poles. What is not happening, what is not operating and what is still sitting in boxes waiting to be installed is another half dozen CCTV cameras, which are destined to be deployed around the railway precinct and the bus interchange area. Our impediment to installing and having this technology available to support law enforcement and public safety initiatives in Frankston is the fact that Jemena will not allow the council to use the poles. Here you have an organisation that is happy to appear to be a public utility when that suits them, happy to benefit from pricing declarations issued by the government, but, when the time comes for that organisation to be part of a community effort to respond to a key priority, where are they? They decline the use of these poles for the CCTV cameras. They say that the council can use them now but they need to have some unlimited liability relating to the deployment on the poles. It really undermines our collective community effort. We have a non-operational police vehicle for the Frankston area, with the support of Honda; we have trader watch pads initiatives to combat theft of boats; we have had some progress with CCTV in Frankston; a great activity in Mornington, as I have touched on; and calls for more of that work in Mount Eliza, Seaford and on the foreshore in Frankston. I call on Jemena to be a genuine part of the community and help to see these cameras get up. Jemena needs to either get out of the way or find a way forward to get these cameras deployed. We also need to tackle the fact that Frankston seems to get associated with any act of criminality that goes through Frankston court, and is covered by court reports, relating to the south-east of Melbourne. Let us rename the Frankston court the ‘Southern Metropolitan Court Complex’ so that, if some charges are being pursued through the courts in a facility that just happens to be in the city that I represent, people outside do not think the cause of that criminality also came from the city. It is a simple change that we need to make now. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE",153,Adjournment

158,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (4.00 Pm),"Today, in the few minutes available to me, I want toMiddle East constituents, David Forde. David Forde is a real community activist. He is a member of the Lions Club, Amnesty International, the RSL and a lot of other clubs. The report he brought to my attention is put out by the Australian People for Health, Education and Development Abroad, known as APHEDA. The report involved 14 people going to the Middle East in March 2010, including Evan Moorhead, the state member for Waterford, just to the south of me, and Wendy Turner, who I also know well. This report came as a result of the tour visiting Lebanon, Jordan, Israel and, more importantly, the occupied Palestinian territories-the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza. I rise to speak about this report also in the context of a very recent news report brought to my attention about up to 16 people being killed and more than 30 people injured when troops stormed the freedom flotilla that was making its way towards Gaza early on Monday, according to the Israeli army radio. This event was obviously staged to bring attention to what has been going on in Gaza, as sometimes occurs when people are under pressure-maybe like standing in front of tanks in Tiananmen Square-an event which unfortunately resulted in 16 people being killed and more than 30 people being injured. Back to this APHEDA report: the group toured a lot of the Palestinian areas I just mentioned, particularly the West Bank and East Jerusalem. As many people would know, since 2002, there has been a 700-kilometre long, nine-metre high wall, in some parts fortified and electrified, being constructed throughout the West Bank and East Jerusalem. This is obviously not a situation which is going to result in a harmonious community. Certainly the people from one part of Palestine to another and having to go down a road which is an Israeli-only road. They talked about how even people in the delegation who had a name which might have been Palestinian were particularly singled out, even if they had Australian passports. They were singled out simply because their name sounded Palestinian. One part of the report states that the group witnessed the Palestinian town of Qalqilya, which is almost entirely enclosed by the barrier, with the only entry and exit point controlled by the Israeli military. Very often, as reported to the group, this access point was closed and they witnessed the sheer poverty imposed on the people of the town through economic starvation. This is obviously a major concern. (Time expired) Budget derwent the most significant reform since its inception in 1948. These well-thought-out reforms were developed by the then health minister, Tony Abbott, and were designed to redirect the discounts which had been going to the pharmacists from the pharmaceutical manufacturers. The reforms were projected to save more than $580 million over the first four years, growing to $3 billion over the next 10 years. Two years into the reform process, three independent analyses projected that the savings will be in excess of $6 billion over 10 years. The government’s own recent analysis of the conservative parameters also showed that the savings could range from $3 billion to $5.8 billion. The bottom line is that the full impact of the reforms two years into the 10-year process is unknown but is well in excess of anything the government could have imagined.

160,Mr Farmer (Macarthur) (4.06 Pm),"In 2007 the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme unThe Rudd government has negotiated a memorandum of understanding with one sector of a large industry reportedly holding a policy gun to the sector’s head and has made an agreement on policy initiatives with wide-ranging ramifications for the entire industry. The industry sector included in the agreement has negotiated a policy which looks after its interests while having a damaging impact on other sectors not included in the MOU discussions. The MOU and the policy itself are flawed and dangerous. With the export of jobs overseas impacting access to quality, affordable medicines, the procedure undertaken by the government to reach the MOU is unfair, questionable and anything about consultative. In a nutshell, very poor public policy has resulted. This flawed policy and the procedural fairness of the policy development need to be examined closely and not just passed unchallenged by the Senate. The necessity to balance the government’s budget should be secondary to good public policy. The Senate should refer the legislation to the Senate committee so that this unusual, unfair procedure for public policy development can be scrutinised. This will allow parties not consulted on the MOU to provide input to avoid the unintended major problems that will result as a consequence of lack of consultation with the parties impacted by the MOU. This is just another example of the ineptitude of the Rudd government, its highly irregular approach to public policy development and the disdain with which it holds our leading export industries. It is a desperate attempt to balance a badly managed budget. Franklin Electorate: GP Superclinic Ms COLLINS (Franklin) (4.09 pm)-I rise this afternoon to talk about the GP superclinic at Clarence in my electorate. I was fortunate on Saturday to announce the successful tenderer for the major construction of the GP superclinic, VOS Construction and Joinery. I want to put on record my congratulations to them for winning that contract. VOS are expected to go on site the next few weeks. In February this year I, together with the Parliamentary Secretary for Health, Mark Butler, commissioned the preliminary works and we are now in a major construction phase of this $5.5 million GP superclinic. It is an election commitment that we are delivering on in Clarence in my electorate. The state government is also building an integrated care centre with the GP superclinic, representing a total of $18 million of investment in this clinic in my electorate. We have been talking to local communities and having public consultations about the types of services that may be available at this clinic. There will be walk-up services-they will take any patient that walks through. We are talking about having some minor burns and cuts facility at the GP superclinic, because the local community has said that that is what is required. But what is a bit disconcerting is some of the commentary around the GP superclinic and this investment in our local community. In particular I am a bit disappointed in one of the media reports about the GP superclinic in our local Mercury. The editorial today talks about the GP superclinics and whether there is any value in them. I want to put on the record what Dr Emil Djakic, President of the Australian General Practice Network-who is in fact a Tasmanian-told ABC radio: It is absolutely critical that the Australian government continue to work towards reorientating away from a very hospital-focused health care system and funding to re-empowering general practice. That is what our GP superclinics are about. In this year’s budget we announced further funding for GP superclinics but also funding for existing GP practices to invest in new technoloMAIN COMMITTEE gies and to upgrade their buildings and their services for local communities. I think it is really important that we understand where these GP superclinics and general practice fit into the larger scheme of things. This government have been investing in health reform and we have been talking about the health system as a whole. The GP superclinics have not been done in isolation; they are part of an integrated system. They are about local care in local communities to take the pressure off our major hospitals. Certainly in my electorate it is going to be very warmly welcomed by those constituents that I have been talking to in recent days. That is why we are building this investment and why we are funding more in this budget. But it is a shame that the Liberal opposition, if elected, plans to discontinue this further investment in the GP superclinics and the further investment in GP practices. (Time expired) Gilmore Electorate: Road Funding Keneally directed her RTA to no longer make any mention of projections to extend the F6 highway that runs from Sydney to Wollongong. She is not interested in maintaining infrastructure in the Illawarra to keep up with population growth. Last week, also, the federal minister for roads, Anthony Albanese, came on local radio and confirmed his government was not interested in contributing to the upgrade of the Princes Highway in the Illawarra and South Coast and will not be chipping in any money. As far as this highway is concerned, the New South Wales Labor government has admitted it has run out of money to support South Coast residents, and the federal Labor government has come out and confirmed it is equally uncaring about South Coast residents. Both Labor governments have turned their backs on South Coast residents. To add insult to injury, Labor has selected a candidate for Gilmore who does not even live in the electorate. This should hardly be a surprise when you have a look at the track record of Labor candidates being parachuted into Illawarra seats in recent times. A few weeks ago on the ABC, Andy Gillespie, local trade union identity, was railing against the parachuting of Lylea McMahon into the state seat of Shellharbour. Throsby is having a candidate parachuted in to replace outgoing member Jennie George. So it begs the question: if they don’t care about their own party members and what they might have to say, how much do they care about the people they are purporting to represent? The real story behind the debate over the Princes Highway is not about finding the money-both the federal and state Labor governments have hauled out billions to fund their pet projects as it suited them; the real story is all about Labor’s hidden agenda. It is about lipservice and growing power, the lack of sincerity and a lack of commitment to the people of the Illawarra. They have been taken for granted for so long and it is becoming glaringly obvious that they will continue to be. We always seem to end up at the bottom of the food chain as far as Labor governments go, so it was with some surprise that Anthony Albanese could come on local radio last week and spruik that the coalition was not funding the Princes Highway. It has probably escaped him that his government and the New South Wales Labor government have committed billions to roadworks within Sydney and northwards, while at the same time snubbing the Illawarra and South Coast. It has escaped him that it is he who is in government and that as a federal roads minister he is the best placed person to approve funding for the Princes Highway and the upgrade of the F6. Instead he chooses to carp about the coalition, using spin and distorting and manipulating the facts. MAIN COMMITTEE",155,Apheda Who Toured This Area Talked About The Experience Of Palestinians Trying To Go From
161,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (4.12 Pm),"Last week New South Wales Premier KristinaThe fact is that, during our term in government, we delivered $68 million in additional funding to the upgrade of the Princes Highway on the South Coast, and the Leader of the Opposition recently committed another $20 million, if elected to government. The state opposition has also committed and reaffirmed its commitment, time and time again, of an extra $200 million for remedial work along the Princes Highway, from Wollongong to the Victorian border. But, even in the face of the facts, Labor continues to twist the truth and drag its heels in providing funding of any substance to the Illawarra. It is not only roads that are chronically underfunded; it is hospitals, schools, police, community service-and the list and waste goes on. Mr Albanese’s statement on 2ST last week was a pathetic and nasty attempt at raw politics, absent of any commitment towards the Illawarra and in denial of the situation with local party members. It is a case of constant blunders and blah, blah, blah. Parramatta Electorate: Mosques Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (4.15 pm)-On SaturdayI attended the opening of the Parramatta Mosque. There are over 5,000 people of Islamic religion in the Parramatta electorate and some 50,000 in surrounding electorates and yet we have not had a mosque in Parramatta until earlier this year. For some seven years people have been praying at the town hall and every Friday some 700 to 800 people would come from surrounding offices of Sydney’s second CBD to the town hall for Friday prayers. It was well and truly a multicultural gathering of people from Africa, Asia and the Middle East. The sessions were conducted in English. The same group of people who had organised that Friday prayers for so long at the town hall have now managed to open the first mosque in Parramatta. While attending that opening I was reminded that just last month the state government listed two Australian mosques on the State Heritage Register. One was the Auburn Gallipoli Mosque, just down the road in Auburn, not only because of its unique architecture but also for its connection to our Turkish community, which, in 2008, celebrated its 40th anniversary of settlement in Australia. Also of great interest was the mosque in Broken Hill, which was built in 1887. This of course was not the first mosque. Credit goes to Moree for its mosque, built in 1882. Quite a few mosques were around in the 1880s. In fact Broken Hill had two, but the one in the north is still standing. It was built like the other mosques of the time of the cameleers, who built the overland telegraph. There is probably no major development in inland Australia from that time in our history that was not made possible by the people who came to Australia from Afghanistan, Turkey and that part of the world that is now known as Pakistan. That particular mosque is intrinsically tied to the experiences and contributions made by people from another world over a century ago. I had the privilege of meeting some of the descendants of those cameleers, seventh generation Australians, who are extremely proud of the contribution of their ancestors. The Parramatta Mosque, unlike the Auburn Gallipoli Mosque, will probably never be known for its architecture. It is situated in a fairly ordinary looking high-rise building but I hope it will be known for the support it will provide to people of the Islamic faith who work and live around Parramatta. Those of us with Muslim staff know of the importance of the Friday prayer room. In recent years the Islamic community in and around Parramatta, people who reflect the multicultural diversity of the region-people whose families come from, among others, Pakistan, Indonesia, Bangladesh, parts of China and Europe, India, Afghanistan, Iraq, Malaysia, Turkey, Lebanon and Egypt-came together to raise $1 million to contribute to the purchase of the MAIN COMMITTEE building. A substantial loan still remains. My Muslim community joins other communities which have managed to raise funds to build places of worship-the Buddhist temple in Granville, the Hindu temple in Roseville and the Sikh temple just to the north. I congratulate Neil Kadomi and his team who worked so hard to make this mosque a reality and I wish them all the best. Cane Toads mon sense and leadership being shown by federal and state governments in addressing the issue of cane toads. This foreign species was introduced to Queensland in 1935 to control the cane beetle. Kimberley Toad Busters is a community group, with 3,500 members, receiving meagre funding from the governments of Western Australia and the Commonwealth. Donations are also made by the public and volunteers themselves. Between February and August 2009, 22,046 toads were collected and euthanised, using carbon dioxide. In that time this group volunteered 16,268 hours. It is now 2010 and the federal government has effectively given up the fight and is concentrating on saving the wild life from the cane toads, using methods such as relocating quolls to cane-toad-free coastal islands rather than removing the actual toads. In the face of this defeatist attitude, Kimberley Toad Busters, led by Lee Scott-Virtue, continue their valuable work on the ground, removing cane toads from the environment as well as gathering important research data. The inability of the state and federal governments to agree on a standard method for euthanasing cane toads is hampering the efforts of the Kimberley Toad Busters. Carbon dioxide euthanasia, developed over five years in the Northern Territory, is the most humane method of euthanasing cane toads, suitable for large volumes of cane toads on overnight toad busts. Cane toads become immediately anaesthetised when exposed to 100 per cent carbon dioxide. Cane toads are kept exposed to carbon dioxide for a minimum of four hours to ensure they have all died, whilst remaining anaesthetised. This method has now been brought to a halt by the Department of Environment and Conservation based on laboratory observations of the euthanasing of just two cane toads. Since early 2009 Kimberley Toad Busters have been trying to obtain a Regulation 4 Authority for entry into state and national parks to catch and euthanase cane toads. However, entry has been denied because one of the requirements of entry is the use of the Department of the Environment and Conservation’s approved methods of euthanasia. In 2009 Kimberley Toad Busters were advised by the conservation department to consider carbon dioxide as an anaesthetic and then to use a secondary technique such as blunt trauma to ensure an effective humane kill. Blunt trauma, pithing or decapitation, which are all secondary techniques, are not supported as a suitable method for euthanasia, given that volunteers find these methods quite abhorrent. The volunteer group is made up of both quite elderly and very young volunteers. Toad busting is an activity that has brought many members of the communities together from all walks of life. Now we have the national parks protecting-(Time expired) Dobell Electorate: Employment on the Central Coast and the unemployment problems that my area has historically had.

163,Mr Craig Thomson (Dobell) (4.21 Pm),"I am speaking today about unemploymentto keep unemployment on the Central Coast down to around 6.3 per cent. That is with a global downturn in growth whereas in 1992, when the last downturn occurred, there was global growth-there was a recession in only Australia and some other countries around the world. If we had reached the same levels of unemployment on the Central Coast as we did 1992, that would have seen a further 11,000 people out of work. Those people have been able to be maintained in work on the Central Coast. This is largely because of the government’s stimulus package. I want to talk about two aspects of that in particular. Firstly, I want to talk about the schoolbuilding program. Over 106 schools have had new buildings constructed out of the schoolbuilding program on the Central Coast, from libraries to classrooms through to halls. Over 5,000 local staff have been employed on those 106 buildings. Bovis Lend Lease, the contractor, has told us that 98 per cent of those employed on these building sites have come from the Central Coast. That is one of the major reasons we have been able to keep unemployment lower than in previous recessions. We have not only created jobs by putting in this money but created these jobs locally. Without that, over 5,000 people would be looking outside the area for work who are not looking outside the area at the moment. The Central Coast has one of the highest levels of people with trade qualifications, many of whom have to go to Sydney or Newcastle for work. They have been able to find work on the Central Coast. It is not just those with a trade; it is those who are looking to go into trades or are part way through a trade qualification. I recently met Rob, an apprentice who has been working at Tacoma School. He was in the third year of his apprenticeship. He had been out of work for six months but then got a job through this program. So that program has kept jobs on the Central Coast. The second aspect I want to talk about is Kickstart. We have seen over 335 new apprenticeships brought on, compared with 210 in the previous year. It is something that this government is very proud of and, as you would have seen from the budget, we will be extending it. The idea of getting people trained in trades is very important to the youth of the Central Coast. It is a shame that the opposition have said, in their budget reply, that they will be cutting it. This government is about jobs; the opposition are about opposing issues. Flinders Electorate: Infrastructure provements in the towns of Koo Wee Rup and Lang Lang. These two magnificent towns are within my electorate of Flinders. They are at the top of and to the north-east of Western Port. The local residents are tremendous people. I am fortunate to have worked with many of them on projects such as the new community centre in Koo Wee Rup, the new memorial in Koo Wee Rup, the rural transaction centre, the medical centre and doctors for Lang Lang. These are all important things. There are five points to the plan I want to set out. The first is in relation to gas for Lang Lang. That has been achieved. I am happy to say we have ticked that off. That was something we worked towards and achieved. It is a positive outcome for local residents. The second relates to a truck bypass for Koo Wee Rup. Anybody who knows the town of Koo Wee Rup knows that the heart of the town needs a bypass. It is clogged with up to 1,500 trucks a day. I have stood in the centre of town and seen the trucks not just block traffic but MAIN COMMITTEE",159,Apheda Who Toured This Area Talked About The Experience Of Palestinians Trying To Go From

The town’s ambience, quality of life and economic health will benefit from not having its centre clogged by trucks. We have at the moment a draft plan with a draft preferred route, but we have not got agreement on that from the state. They have now deferred for three or four years funding for that bypass. That is something which, along with my state counterpart Ken Smith, we will fight to have brought forward by the state. The third element is reticulated natural gas for Koo Wee Rup. This has been successful in Lang Lang. This is another clear goal, objective and outcome we want to achieve. In a town as big as Koo Wee Rup it has been an extraordinary oversight in history that there has been no reticulated natural gas. The fourth element of the plan relates to Kooweerup Secondary College. The school council president, Graeme Broderick, told a local newspaper last week that the school has been neglected by the state government and needs considerable support to bring it up to scratch. The fifth point I want to raise is again in relation to the town of Lang Lang. It is very clear that Lang Lang itself, with up to 600 sand trucks and other trucks a day, also needs a bypass. We will work towards this project. (Time expired) Newcastle Electorate: Lambton Family Medical Centre Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (4.27 pm)-I rise to update the House with some good news on the Lambton Family Medical Centre, which I have raised in the House before. The centre was closed at very short notice-24 hours. The patients and staff were not formally notified. The records were transferred and there was a loss of doctors and loss of continuity of care. The good news though is that tomorrow the Lambton Family Medical Centre will be reopening. Patients were very active and vocal after the closure. They gave the very strong message to Primary Health Care, which had been the manager/owner of the original practice, that they were not pleased with the unannounced closure, with the insensitivity shown to the needs of many older patients who frequent the Lambton medical centre, with the inability of patients to access their records and with being asked for photo ID and payment. Some of the older patients have never had a licence and do not have a passport. The handling of these processes by Primary Health Care was insensitive and of course distressed many people. The work of GP Access, my staff and I, the local media and hundreds of constituents who turned up on the streets outside that centre has brought about a better outcome. But this event does raise some very important issues for all governments to consider. The Rudd government has responded to some of those. The first is the notification of closures. The second is the management of patient records. The third relates to the commercial arrangements that people enter into that restrain trade. To restrain trade when there is already a shortage of GPs seems to me to be unconscionable. The fourth relates to litigation. I urge Primary Health Care Australia again, as I have done personally, to drop any legal action and allow the Lambton Family Medical Centre and its previous doctors to continue in practice without the threat of legal action hanging over anyone’s head. Primary Health Care is a major deliverer of GP services in this nation; it can and should, at its Charlestown Centre, now focus on delivering good patient care from that centre and desist from legal action around the Lambton Family Medical Centre. MAIN COMMITTEE I would also like to say that some of the peak bodies that I wrote to have responded and there is now a draft code of conduct that goes to some of those issues. I urge the profession to make sure that draft code of practice and conduct is strongly enforced and always values patient centred care. I would like to say a big thank you to the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and Nicola Roxon, the health minister, who shared great interest in this situation. Our e-records announced in the budget-and I urge the opposition to consider passing that legislation-give patients control over their records, something which is sorely needed. The other infrastructure grants, nurse practitioner grants and diabetes plans announced in the budget are all aimed at assisting the local GP to survive in a very competitive world. I thank everyone involved and send my best wishes to the Lambton Family Medical Centre on its reopening tomorrow. (Time expired) 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded. Cognate bills: Second Reading Debate resumed from 27 May, on motion by Mr Swan: That this bill be now read a second time. 2010-2011 and related bills last week I noted that this budget actually projected a $40 billion deficit on top of the $53 billion deficit from the previous year. That works out to about $4½ thousand debt for every man, woman and child in Australia and contrasts quite markedly with the former Howard coalition government, where we actually left $45 billion in the kitty, which was nearly $2½ thousand dollars in favour of every man, woman and child. There is quite a strong contrast between the finances of this government compared with the previous. It is interesting that the Labor government has not put the NBN, the National Broadband Network, on the balance sheet, instead saying that this is a commercial project. However, the government will have to take out loans for it. These will be loans that the taxpayer will have to pay back. Labor is cheating the Australian public and bending the truth about what money will be spent, so we have that on top of the other debts as well. This is a government that cuts corners and lies to sell itself as an economic conservative. This government takes the taxpayer as a fool. It is time everyone saw through the Prime Minster, Mr Rudd, and learned the truth about his plans for their money. The Howard government in contrast had a broadband program in place, an OPEL contract that would have seen high-speed broadband delivered to homes all around Australia and certainly in a much better way for rural people. Unfortunately, the Rudd Labor government scrapped this program, took the money and offered this half-baked wasteful legislation instead. Let us start with the promises that this government could not follow through with and that they broke very carelessly.

It is an incredible fallacy to make employers, employees and families believe that they would have more childcare centres but then rip them off undeniably and only give them 38. In fact a country town called Keith in my electorate is struggling currently because the only childcare centre facility shut down a week ago. Where is the government’s promise on child care? How can a town like Keith be left with no childcare facility whatsoever when Labor stood up and promised to build more than 226 childcare centres? The Keith childcare centre was given a month’s notice, so the government has known about this for five or six weeks now and has not found a solution. It is interesting to note that, when the ABC childcare centre problem came up, there was a guarantee by the government; but, this being the seat of Barker, in the township of Keith, there is no solution. There was also a promise to build a trades training centre in each of the 2,650 high schools in Australia. There are currently only 12 trades training centres in operation nationwide. How is this ‘investing in our students’? How is this making sure that Australia becomes a skilled workforce in the future? It is not. The government also promised that every student in years 9 to 12 would have a new computer. Of course, when they came into government they changed that and said every second student would have access to a computer. Many parents and students were sucked in by this promise. For many families, buying a computer is out of reach. So in comes the Rudd government promising that students would have computers. The prospect was exciting and there is no doubt that people voted on the basis of that promise. But it was a blatant lie. The Prime Minister pulled people in and then broke his promise. In my electorate of Barker that promise has been nowhere near fulfilled. Under the newly constituted rules there should be nearly 6,000 new computers in schools in the electorate of Barker but there are actually fewer than 600. That is a great improvement-not! Prime Minister Rudd also promised that he would invest in our schools. Labor said that they would ‘build a revolution’. Julia Gillard, the Minister for Education, has had to do the most embarrassing thing for her credibility and call an investigation into the whole debacle. They have wasted billions in taxpayer dollars and there has been a lack of consultation. They have barged in and told the schools what the Labor government thinks they need most. I have a project in my electorate that showcases the waste and mismanagement which the government calls Building the Education Revolution. Down in the south-east of my electorate, in the town of Millicent, is St Anthony’s Catholic school, a great little Catholic school. I was there a week ago. They had a BER project built-a $2 million gymnasium. But the government did not think it necessary to consult the public as you would normally do. In fact, the government legislated so that the local and state government planning powers were not used. The problem with that gymnasium is that it towers over the front of someone’s house. When the residents open their front door they see a great big building looming over them instead of the decent view that they used to have. Who would want to buy that house now? How will the owners recoup their losses on their investment? They may not be able to sell the house because of the lack of a view. This project is under investigation as part of the task force the government has set up to investigate rorting and taxpayer funded blowouts. A government school in Naracoorte, South Australia, had to use contractors from Adelaide, some 350 kilometres away, to build their school hall because they were not allowed to use local contractors. They built their MAIN COMMITTEE hall at 2½ times the cost per square metre of the hall at the private school down the road, which was built using local contractors and avoiding the state government bureaucracy and rip-offs. I have listened to Labor member after Labor member talk about BER and about GP superclinics. I think we have two GP superclinics that are actually in operation in Australia. The government have promised more, but what hope do we have of that promise being fulfilled? I have heard members talk about their own electorates, as they should, and where their projects are up to. But I have also heard excuse after excuse about how great the funding is. They say they trust their project and that it will be outstanding-once it is built, once it is finished! Is it due to start soon at all? What an embarrassment for these members! Mr Rudd made some very heroic statements regarding the budget. He claims that he will have a surplus in three years. The way he proposes to do this is with his superprofits mining tax. This tax uses Rudd logic. He honestly believes that he can introduce a cigarette tax and it will reduce smoking, but then he announces this great big new tax worth at least $9 billion a year and says that mining will increase not decrease. This is breathtaking. He says that the mining giants need to pay their way. What about the small local businesses like the one I have in my electorate, Mulgundawa Salt? This business has been around for 140 years. It employs 18 staff and has invested quite a bit of money recently in upgrading technology and machinery. It is a small and environmentally friendly operation. It does not dig holes in the ground. It uses groundwater to crystallise the salt from the water. If this operation was based in Victoria it would not be classified as a mine, but in South Australia it is and in Queensland it is and Mulgundawa Salt will be in great danger of going under if this tax is brought to fruition. This tax is poorly thought through, rushed and there has been insufficient consultation with industry. I think it is really interesting to note that when they talked about the offshore PRT, the petroleum resources tax, they said people had an idea that the sky would fall in, but it took two years. There were two years of consultation from the time the thought was introduced to when the legislation came through and a lot of things were changed, so to have the Treasurer today in question time quote speeches from 1984, talking about a situation that was quite different from when the legislation came in in 1986, is stretching the truth. I believe that Labor has had to come clean to the Australian public a number of times lately. The Home Insulation Program has failed miserably and four people have unfortunately died as a result, 146 homes have burnt down and there are possibly 100,000 houses around Australia that are electrified. Just this week the Prime Minister refused to meet with the installers that were rallying at Parliament House. He hid in his office, hid from his mistakes, hid from the damage he has done to the families and to the businesses. Is this the sort of person we want leading our country? I was contacted by many concerned residents in Barker about the government Green Loans Program. There were blowouts in the number of assessors that were trained nationwide yet in rural areas such as Barker there are not enough assessors. There were hold-ups on the assessments and householders were waiting for their assessments, but the department ended up with a massive backlog. There are assessors that are owed money by the government and assessors that are now unemployed. It is a total mess. We have all these failed programs, all these wasted taxpayer dollars, the reckless spending, the lack of basic consultation and the inability to roll out programs smoothly and successfully. MAIN COMMITTEE The government’s list of failures is truly amazing. It is time that the taxpayer started to take notice of what Labor are doing with their money, held them accountable for their mistakes and demanded better answers. This budget, with its holes, hidden slush funds and figures that do not add up, is a total disgrace. What has been presented to the Australian public is a misleading budget that is built with rotting boards. It will collapse under the slightest bit of pressure. There is no way that the government will be able to achieve a surplus with a budget that is built on hopes and dreams. I was not expecting much from this budget, but I must say even I was surprised at the fib of a budget that was presented to the Australian people. Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (4.43 pm)-I rise to speak in support of the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 and related legislation which supports the Rudd government’s 2010-11 federal budget, the third budget this government has now handed down. This year’s federal budget is a thorough exercise in responsible economic management. When you take a look at some of the worse-case scenarios that were being projected in the darkest days of the global financial crisis, what this budget will do for our economy is remarkable and very reassuring. With this budget it is projected that Australia will return to surplus in 2012-13, three years ahead of schedule and ahead of every major advanced economy. Many of our trading partners and international colleagues across the waters will take decades to pay back their debt. It is very sobering. Net debt in Australia is now expected to peak earlier and lower, at just 6.1 per cent of GDP, half the level expected one year ago and less than one-tenth of the average across the major advanced economies. In fact, it is the lowest debt of all advanced economies. The budget deficit of $40.8 billion is almost $6 billion less than the forecast of the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, MYEFO, and more than $16 billion less than expected one year ago. In this budget we have seen all spending offset over the forward estimates, and real payments growth has been held to below two per cent, meeting our strict fiscal rules. We have extended this fiscal strategy to continue building surpluses and achieve a rapid reduction in net debt. We will maintain the two per cent cap on real spending growth on average until the surplus reaches one per cent of GDP. With this budget, we will also further strengthen the economy, help families and secure and sustain real future growth. We can convert the successes we have already had during the global financial crisis into a stronger, more secure economy for working families and for all Australians. Our strict spending limits help to ensure that we get back to black within three years, three years earlier than originally expected. Our tax reforms will broaden and strengthen the economy, ensuring all sectors grow in a sustainable way which benefits all Australians, evening out the boom and bust cycles which we have seen so badly handled by governments in the past. The proceeds will be invested into superannuation savings and national savings, as well as individual savings; into new infrastructure, particularly in mining communities; and into tax cuts that will create jobs and help small business grow and thrive. This will add 0.7 per cent to long-run GDP and boost wages by 1.1 per cent. The success of the stimulus programs and our responsible approach to the economy will also deliver a $7.3 billion boost for health and hospitals. We have hankered after health reform in this nation for far too long. One would have thought that, with the global financial MAIN COMMITTEE crisis and the recession-which we avoided, fortunately-it would have been off the radar and off the agenda. I am delighted and very proud that we will deliver on health reform. We will also deliver $661 million for skills and training, and do not ever underestimate that. In past recessions and downturns in the economy, the people who have borne the brunt of that have usually been our youth, the younger generations. We have seen them ill-equipped, untrained, rejected from workplaces and placed on those long unemployment queues. This time, though, so much has been invested into skills, training, apprenticeship support and scholarships and funded places at universities. I said to a group of high school students just the other day I would have hated to have had to stand in front of them ashamed and guilty that they were abandoned because of a recession. Not under this government. They have been front and centre. We have invested in them and I know that investment will be returned to Australia’s economy, into our sound social existence and contribute to the harmonious society that we all value. This budget also invests $652 million into renewable energy. In my electorate we track that, every cent, very closely. It has been a tremendous boost to our economy and to developing opportunities for the future to have been able to take advantage of the Rudd government’s investment into renewable and clean energy. I will not go on about the Clean Energy Innovation Centre national headquarters in Newcastle or the Australian Solar Institute national headquarters in Newcastle-I have done that over and over again. We will also in this budget deliver a $6.6 billion boost for infrastructure. It is important to note some of that will be as a result of the resources superprofits tax. My electorate is the biggest coal export port in the world by volume. We, the Rudd government, have already invested over $1½ billion into the rail track in my region. We know that the mining sector has invested $7 billion, but government cannot keep bearing that cost as well unless we find some tax reform measures to do that. We will also deliver a third round of personal tax cuts and a standard tax deduction for work expenses, assisting people with tax returns. We will deliver those last tax cuts, as well as some tax cuts for small business and less red tape. The tax cuts will allow an investment into better superannuation, with tax breaks on interest and a boost in national savings. In the budget we have been able to devote more money to protecting our troops and our borders. Of course the tax on resources superprofits, just like in the petroleum sector, will assist us to do those things. By securing further economic prosperity with initiatives such as the tax reform measures, everyone will benefit. In my electorate of Newcastle, there is always a little bit of a cargo cult mentality: people want to see a big item for them in the budget. Well this budget is a big item for all Australians: better health services, paid parental leave in 2011, national quality standards in child care, tax breaks on savings and small business, increased superannuation savings, a standard tax deduction and more flexibility for pension payments et cetera. All those reforms are aimed at sustaining a quality of life that I think all Australians do anticipate will continue in spite of an ageing population and in spite of a global downturn. The Rudd government has also promised that this budget will focus on improving health services in the community, as I have said. I would like to see the implementation of those new measures that will strengthen patient access, strengthen access to records, strengthen existing MAIN COMMITTEE training for GPs and nurses and allow GPs to invest in infrastructure improvements and to employ practice nurses in their surgeries. This year’s budget also delivered genuine support for general practice all around the country. The diabetes plan in particular favours a GP who will manage someone with diabetes for the long term, who is going to look at their holistic health needs-not the drop-in, drop-out clinics that we too often see. The money for more superclinics is also welcome, and I have already been approached by GPs in the Thornton area of my electorate-which has a very fast-growing population-who would like very much to be part of applying for a superclinic in that region. So the 2010-11 budget was a great win, particularly for health care. I know that will be welcomed by my local constituents. It is also, though, a great win for small business across the country, which will reap the rewards of the tax cuts and incentives that are there. To be able to automatically get a tax return and write off equipment under $5,000 will be an incentive for investment for the future sustainability of small businesses. It is also a great win for the 8.4 million Australians who will benefit from increasing the super guarantee to 12 per cent. However, to see all these benefits flow onto the people of Australia we do need something that sometimes seems unattainable here, and that is for the opposition to see sense. We need those on the other side of the House and, in particular, their leader, Tony Abbott, to see sense in the debate surrounding the resource super profit tax. All of these budget initiatives, every one of them, is an investment into the sustainability of our future economy, and they all greatly rely on the successful carriage of the RSPT through the Senate. This worries me, because we have seen in the past-with the CPRS, for instance-how ready and willing this opposition is to block the passage of such important legislation. These big measures and big policies do deserve-and I think the public would like to seesome bipartisan support. But already we see the opposition waging a scare-mongering campaign and, unfortunately, they are backed to the hilt by the mining industry in this regard. We hear the same old arguments, ‘The sky is falling, we are all doomed’-the same arguments we saw with the CPRS, which they would not support once their leadership changed. According to the doomsayers, the proposed tax will scare away the mining industry, and in doing so ruin our economy. Well, tell that to the people of Newcastle and the Hunter. Mr Baldwin, the member for Paterson, tried to assert that in question time the other day, only to be caught out very badly because the Newcastle Herald, which is circulated from the Central Coast right up through the Hunter Valley and throughout Newcastle, came out in support of the resource tax, understanding it as we do because we see before our very eyes the magnitude of mining investment; we see those returns. We have always been the ones, too, who experienced the busts in those cycles. We are delighted to see this time a way to sustain booms to make sure they are investment into the future economy. Many key stakeholders feared that the profits based tax introduced in the 1980s on the petroleum industry would ruin that industry. Having had the great privilege of going to Barrow Island and seeing the Gorgon project in progress, I know that that is not the case, and the RSPT will not be any different. The tax has been specifically designed by the government to grow the mining industry and boost investment and jobs. It will see the people of Newcastle, whom I represent, and the rest of Australia get a fairer share of the resources they ownresources that are finite; once they are gone, they are gone for ever. Mining companies will MAIN COMMITTEE still earn healthy profits net of tax. Investment in marginal but viable projects will be more likely to go ahead, as they will attract a lighter RSPT than the current uniform imposition. When it comes down to it, Australians own our natural resources and they deserve a fair share of the superprofits mining companies make during the booms. Before the last mining boom, the Australian people were receiving about a dollar in every $3 of mining profits through royalties and charges. But, at the end of that boom, the return to the public purse had declined to just $1 out of every $7. There was also very little contribution to skills, something that saw our economy prejudiced greatly. The government wants to restore the Australian people’s share of mining profits closer to where it was in the early 2000s. The company and small business tax cuts that will be funded by the RSPT will allow more sectors of our local economy to gain a direct benefit from the boom. The mining industry itself will benefit, with the proceeds of the tax being used to set up a new $5.6 billion infrastructure fund to tackle capacity constraints. We have watched our local coal terminals expand-and they certainly are expanding; we call the one on Kooragang Island near Newcastle ‘Legoland’-it has been an amazing spectacle to see such growth in the industry. As I have said, it has seen commercial investment of $7 billion and it is not stopping. Just as the NCIG coal terminal has been completed, the plans for another one are underway. Just as Port Waratah Coal Services have finished three terminals, T4 is also in the planning stages. The RSPT will help to keep mining exports flowing out of the Port of Newcastle and it will sustain jobs. In the long run, this tax will lead to more investment, more activity and production, and more employment. It is of vital importance that this tax goes ahead to secure our nation’s future and to sustain our economic wealth-wealth that belongs to all Australians. There has been some suggestion that investment will depart from Australia. We know that that is not true. I have had the great privilege to visit Mongolia, and it is a country that I support in their endeavours to strengthen their independence, to prosper democracy and to prosper an economy that assists its people. But when you see that you have to travel for many hours through the Gobi Desert in four-wheel drive vehicles with no roads, no rail, no port, no infrastructure in sight, temperatures that get down to minus-50 degrees and up to plus-50 degrees, and coal and resources that are 2½ kilometres deep in the landscape, you know that this tax is not going to distract people from investing in Australian mining and its wealth of mineral resources. SoI am pleased to see that many commentators have come through supporting our tax in the media and in particular supporting the growth in superannuation that it will bring about. It has only been through the responsible economic management of the Rudd government and the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, that we have been experienced a miraculous economic performance. The primary injections of the economic stimulus plan, coupled with the targeted expenditure of the 2009-10 federal budget have guided us and will continue to guide us through the worse of the downturn. Nowhere has this responsible economic management been demonstrated more than in my own electorate of Newcastle. Just last week, the Hunter Valley Research Foundation released figures showing that the Hunter region is experiencing a record number of workers in jobs. During April, over 313,600 people went to work in the region. This broke the previous record of workforce participation, which was set only the month previously. So it is plain for everybody to see that in my community the local economy is in good MAIN COMMITTEE shape. In fact, our official unemployment rate has dropped to just 4.3 per cent, down from five per cent the month before. It is significantly lower than the state average of 5.8 per cent. Just in case you are thinking that mining is the biggest contributor there, the biggest employment group in the electorate of Newcastle is now professionals. It is quite interesting to see the diversification of our economy and how much that has been assisted by the Rudd government’s investment particularly in innovation. It is interesting to note that the strongest jobs growth occurred, as I said, in education and health industries, which again points to the diversification of our economy. This strong performance has been in no small part due to our government, and I am very grateful for that. Since taking office, we have seen over $1.37 billion invested in the electorate, and that does not include the benefits that will flow from the $1.6 billion Hunter Expressway. Economic stimulus spending alone accounted for around $150 million, supporting infrastructure projects that went directly back into the local economy, supporting local jobs and funding local projects. Just last week, I visited a restaurant in my electorate, Scratchleys on the Wharf, to meet a young apprentice, Steve, who is employed under the Kickstart apprentice program. Steve was just one of the almost 500 young Novocastrians employed under the Kickstart program since it began last year to combat the global financial crisis. As I said earlier, our youth have not been betrayed by this government. The Kickstart program in particular is aimed at people aged 19 years and under. As a result of that program we did not see any dip in the take-up of apprenticeships in this group. So successful has the program been in Newcastle and across the country that we have now extended the intake period to November this year and tripled the bonus for employers taking on apprentices to almost $5,000. Across the country, tens of thousands of young Australians will continue to benefit from this amazing program. It was lovely to be with the Deputy Prime Minister as she opened a local BER project-a school hall. We met an apprentice there, Jacob, who had previously been unemployed-a young surf-lifesaver, but unemployed-who took up an apprenticeship because of the BER. It was also lovely to meet a young woman, Alana, who was working as a community consultant with the BER program. Alana had come back from overseas because work had dried up there, and she was able to get a full-time job in the BER program in my electorate. So we have been investing in the skills of this country to sustain our economic success, and young people have been some of the beneficiaries. So that is another big tick for the Rudd government’s responsible economic management. I would just like to repeat that this year’s federal budget is an example of responsible economic management and the timely and effective handling of the global financial crisis by the Rudd government. We are the only country to have avoided recession. We have the secondlowest unemployment of all advanced economies. We have the lowest debt of all advanced economies. We will be back in the black in three years, three years earlier than anticipated and before any other advanced economy. So this budget is a tribute to the Rudd government. It represents the investment in the future economy of this nation. It sustains growth and it sustains quality of life for all Australians. Newcastle has particularly benefited-most deservedly, I have to say. I recommend this budget to the House. of fact, in the days leading up to the budget, I said in my electorate of Calare that this was a MAIN COMMITTEE",162,Appropriation Bill No 2 2010 2011 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2010 2011
167,Mr John Cobb (Calare) (5.02 Pm),"I rise to speak on the budget of 2010. As a matterwonderful opportunity for the Rudd Labor government to show not just the electorate of Calare but rural and regional Australia that it actually does care about the consequences of its actions in that region, that it actually did care about what happened regarding health, water, infrastructure and transport, outside of the big cities. Let’s face it, the very first actions of this government was the finance minister-within weeks of taking office-slashing $649 billion, from memory, of programs from the then budget of 2007-08. It is interesting to note that, out of $649 billion that he slashed, some $420 million came out of regional Australia. That is something like three-quarters of all the money he took, and it came out of regional Australia. In their very first budget, the Rudd government reneged on the Bells Line of Road engineering study. They talked about the inland rail, but it certainly was not there the other day. They withdrew, in the last budget, a billion dollars from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. I mentioned that in our part of the world the budget was a good time for the Rudd government to make good on their hospital and health promises. The hospital problems were all, if memory serves me correctly, supposed to be sorted out and fixed up by June-not June as in next month, but June last year. I reminded them just prior to the budget that it had been announced that Bathurst was losing its private hospital, which would have a huge effect on the whole central west, and that Forbes and Parkes had been promised new hospitals. There were great opportunities for the Rudd government to show they were serious about hospitals, they were serious about health and they were serious about rural and regional Australia. Urban water is also an issue in our part of the world as well as health, but I think what I probably spat the dummy over was what has happening with regard to cancer centres of excellence. The whole area from Lithgow, just west of the Blue Mountains, all the way out to Cobar and Broken Hill was totally ignored and told they could not have a cancer centre of excellence but the town of Gosford and the region around it could. Forgive me if I am wrong-and I am not wrong-but when the Prime Minister announced the cancer centres of excellence program and guidelines he conceded that, in certain instances of cancer detection, country people were three times more likely to die within five years of being diagnosed than the people in big cities. Yet he and the Minister for Health and Ageing saw fit to give Gosford a centre of excellence in preference to one in western New South Wales when Gosford is a big city under the Rudd government’s own guidelines. I do not suppose that had anything to do with the fact that the seat of Robertson is the third most marginal that Labor holds in Australia. Heaven forbid that that should be an issue in this program! And no-one would think it strange, I am sure, that people from Lithgow and all the way out to Cobar have got to cross the mountains or travel for up to 10 hours to get to a cancer centre of excellence, over and above the sorts of things that Orange, Bathurst and Dubbo can provide. People in Gosford are almost within a taxi ride of Newcastle and Sydney, are they not? Far be it from me to deny the people of Gosford-but prefer them in terms of need to all the people out there? Anyway, it seems obvious that that is something a Prime Minister could have fixed up, not to mention the need for a 24-hour helicopter service for emergencies. I did ask for that prior to the budget, given that areas like Wollongong, 12 minutes flying time away but with less calls than Orange, already had one. No politics there either, I am sure! So we had had expectations, for more reasons than one. MAIN COMMITTEE When the budget actually came out, the Labor Party, strange to say-surprise, surprisehad paid little attention to regional Australia and even less attention to these opportunities in Calare. The residents of regional Australia were not only ignored, they were punished. How were they punished? The Prime Minister came up with the great big new tax on mining. It is going to hurt regional Australia. Unfortunately for the Prime Minister, people in regional Australia realise this more than anybody else. In my electorate of Calare we happen to be lucky in not being able to be a magnificent agricultural area but we do have very serious mines. In the current or ‘old’ electorate of Calare we have Cobar and in the new electorate we will have Lithgow, as well as Cadia at Orange, Parkes and other smaller mines. Mining is the only thing that has kept us strong through the eight to 10 years of drought. Portions of the media label the mining sector as ‘the goose that laid the golden egg’. I think this analogy is simplified and quirky, but it points in the direction of many, many more serious issues. The Minerals Council estimates that there are 4½ jobs supported by every direct employee of the mining industry. However, I think it is impossible to calculate how far that influence extends, in the same way that in regional Australia it is impossible to calculate just how far the influence of the agricultural sector extends on jobs and income. These two sectors keep our people together. One has been totally ignored, if not denigrated; the other the government intends to punish in a big way. There are thousands of direct and indirect jobs. It does not matter whether it is a corner shop or a coffee shop-whatever it might be-the wages of mining have a huge effect on our ability not just to have a lifestyle but to have a good one; not just to have a job but to have a good one. I do not see that we have any less right to that than people in the cities. It is just that our people live with these issues. Our people know that this tax is a tax on them directly; this is not some fanciful figment of the imagination for the Prime Minister to rave on about in a theoretical way. To us, this is life-this is jobs, this is our future. I cannot believe that anybody could go into a tax like this. One can only assume they are either stupid or they simply did no research into how far it would go. This hurts small business. The number of small businesses in Cobar, in Parkes, in Orange, in Bathurst and in Lithgow attached to the mining industry are just incredible. As the leader of the coalition said the other day, if the exploration side of this was so good, why isn’t every other business in Australia putting its hand up for a similar tax? This is a budget which can only cause grief to the best industry we have got out there in regional Australia and totally ignores the other big industry out there in regional Australia. Once again, it ignores it, and I will say more about that little later. It also ignores the need for greater investment in regional infrastructure-roads and rail. The only mention of my part of the state was that they are going to put a few sleepers under the Parkes-Broken Hill line. That is all well and good, but I would not put that as any great infrastructure; I would put that down as normal maintenance. Otherwise there is not going to be much heading across to Perth, Darwin or Adelaide. The minister for road transport and everything else he is the minister for might puff his chest out-he actually mentioned that in parliament the other day. If it did not do it, there would not be any trains running, so I do not really see that a huge win for anybody except a few people cutting sleepers. These days they are not even doing that. Something we committed to as part of AusLink in 2007 was a $10 million bypass for the town of Orange. Currently it does not matter what it is-semitrailer or whatever it might be; a MAIN COMMITTEE house on the back of a semitrailer-pretty much everything has to go down the main street of Orange. It is a pretty ridiculous situation. We committed $10 million to pay the majority of what the council needs to finish the northern bypass. As a result of us committing to that, the then opposition under the now Prime Minister committed to the same thing. That was a great commitment and I was very pleased to hear it, especially as they won government at that time. The only problem is that, after three budgets, they still not have put a cent up for Orange City Council to do that. That is no small thing. On the Mitchell Highway and the entrance to the Golden Highway and heading both out to Parkes, Forbes and Cowra, it is no small thing for the amount of heavy traffic that passes through a lot of people all the time. Once again, when it comes to road funding, the federal government is as bad as the New South Wales Labor government. They are only interested in metropolitan Australia. They do not want to spend a cent towards putting a decent road across the Blue Mountains. They are not even interested in funding the engineering study we committed to in 2007. Also, despite the government’s protestations of, ‘Yes, we’re going to keep it going,’ the inland rail has been forgotten. There is no mention of it in this budget. I guess we really should not be surprised. As I mentioned, there is a need for urban water, as well as what Senator Wong is doing to Australia’s irrigation industry. There was no mention of urban water anywhere in the budget or, if there was, there was certainly no mention of it anywhere outside of Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane. As I started off by saying: this budget was a great big opportunity for the Rudd government to show that it is a government for all Australians. I can almost hear the words of the Prime Minister when he took office in November 2007: he was here for everybody. We are waiting for him to be here because, if there is one thing that this budget did, it did not give funding to anything west of the Blue Mountains in New South Wales. In terms of agriculture and rural Australia, the government, in its very first budget, knocked $60 million out of CSIRO. Most of that was taken out of agriculture. The government cut $40 million from the last budget by getting rid of Land and Water Australia. That was another $40 million out of R&D. Also in the last budget they removed 130 jobs from AQIS. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry talks about R&D as though he is its messiah, but he has never been known to do anything other than take money from it. Obviously, he has a real problem with anything to do with productivity. In fact, going on the terms of reference of the Productivity Commission’s inquiry that is looking into government funding towards the levy, whereby the government matches all our rural industries dollar for dollar, it is quite obvious that the minister does not like providing funding unless it is towards something to do with climate change or the common good. Productivity gains have occurred in Australia because we are the best innovators around and because of R&D. We have a trade advantage overseas because of our biosecurity measures. Our beef can compete with American beef on their shelves because our beef has a longer shelf life, despite it having travelled from here to there. This is because our R&D is so good. We need to be aware that the Productivity Commission is currently looking at the levy. The inquiry is obviously designed to cut down the government’s commitment to match rural industries dollar for dollar. That is a disgrace and a shame. This will rebound on our industries forever if the minister for agriculture goes ahead with it. The Productivity Commission inquiry into drought basically said, ‘Get rid of drought.’ Okay, there is a little trial in Western MAIN COMMITTEE Australia but that is not a drought program; it is just an efficiency program. That is well and good, but to call it a drought program is an insult to agriculture. When you have a look at the facts, the government ignored water. What Senator Wong is doing to water and what the government is doing to mining and agriculture in our country mean that this is not a government with any great concern or any great moral values when it comes to anybody who lives outside the major cities. The major cities are going to be the ones who suffer when we have to once again pay back a huge debt. Last time we were in government it took us 10 years to pay back $96 billion. Heaven knows what we will have to pay back this time. I hope Australia can put a halt to this situation before we get back to debt levels which will once again take us a decade to pay back. Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (5.19 pm)-I am pleased to speak this evening in support of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 and the cognate budget appropriation bills, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2010-2011 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011, which support the 2010 federal government budget. What a contrast between the economic environment in which this budget was delivered in 2010 and that in which the previous budget of 2009 was delivered. We went from our economy being in a vulnerable position, with a budget forged in the most challenging of global economic circumstances since the Great Depression, to a budget formulated in a position of economic strength. These circumstances are the result of a fiscal policy reflective of a government directed by the highest standards of responsible economic management, a government willing to put forward tangible social and economic programs that not only helped us avoid a recession in the immediate term but delivered on-the-ground projects to prepare our nation and our community for the future. When I spoke to the previous budget of 2009, I did so in the knowledge that it was the Rudd government that would be responsible for ensuring that the people of my electorate of Calwell would continue to play an active part in the economic life of this nation. I did so knowing that it was the federal Labor government’s economic and social policies that would serve to protect my constituents from the full brunt of what even the former Howard government Treasurer, Peter Costello, described as an ‘economic tsunami’. What allowed this economic tsunami to circumvent Australia were the measures undertaken by the Rudd Labor government’s economic stimulus plan which, through a nation-building package, delivered huge investments to communities across Australia. I am very proud to see that these huge investments, particularly in my electorate of Calwell, strengthened our local economy, helped families across the board and will serve to help us secure much-needed growth into the future. The constituents of my seat of Calwell were amongst the highest recipients of federal government funding, with over $142 million for over 170 projects having been delivered. The amount of social and economic capital reflects the federal government’s commitment to communities across Australia, a perfect example of which is my electorate of Calwell. There is no doubt these investments have helped avoid what would have been a huge rise in unemployment and the closure of many small businesses which ultimately form the backbone of our economy in both the local and national context. Instead of a contraction in our national economy we have in fact seen economic growth of 1.4 per cent. While other advanced economies have gone backwards, Australia is moving forwards. Through measures in this budget, the government will seek to halve peak debt and get the budget back into surplus in three years time. That is three years earlier than previous projections. MAIN COMMITTEE With the unemployment rate on its way down, this budget is important because it delivers much-needed tax concessions for working people, for seniors and for small business owners. Following the budget announcements, many of my constituents approached me and made phone calls to my office. While they acknowledged the ongoing investment in our local community, they also wanted to know how measures in the budget translated for them on the ground, in their homes, in their neighbourhoods and in their communities. I will go first to the tax cuts that were announced. Those tax cuts alone mean that, at the end of the day when the third round of tax cuts takes effect, people will no doubt have more money in their pockets to spend, to save, to invest or to put towards things which are important to them and to their family budgets. So, with necessary infrastructure investments needed for the sustainability of our modern economy having been provided, workers have also now been provided with added support that is much needed, particularly by lower income earners and those who will even benefit from relatively modest increases in the money they earn. There are certainly many low-income earners in my electorate of Calwell and I know that this measure, in particular, is very important to the way in which they manage their daily life and expenses. I am also conscious of those who in the name of economic flexibility-and I refer to the former Howard government-had ignored matters for far too long. These are the underemployed in our community, which the previous government only remembered when it came to stripping away their rights at work. These are workers who are most vulnerable to economic fluctuations. Thanks to the 2010 federal budget these workers will be able to earn up to $16,000 and not have to pay income tax, which is up from $11,000 in the 2007-08 federal budget. Along with other initiatives this will have a direct impact. Who are these people that will benefit? They are the working mums who often have to work part-time. I mention working mums because the reality is that they are ultimately the ones who, in juggling home and work, often miss out. It is our role as a socially progressive government to address this reality, and this budget seeks to do just that. In supporting workers in my electorate of Calwell, whose jobs were protected by the timely action taken by the government to avoid what would have otherwise been a crippling recession, the Rudd Labor government is also supporting the 10,290 small businesses in Calwell who will enjoy the tax breaks. That is much needed support for small business owners who form the backbone of the economy that drives growth and prosperity in my electorate of Calwell and also across Australia. When we are looking towards an economy that will be in surplus three years ahead of time, when we are looking towards providing Australians with an economic recovery that will be sustainable into the future, this government has given businesses, such as the 10,290 small businesses in my electorate, much needed tax relief in addition to a cash flow boost and a strong incentive to continue to invest in productive assets. As the opposition, of course, likes to whip around its scare campaign against the resource super profits tax it is denying the 10,290 small businesses in my electorate as well as some 720,000 small businesses across Australia their much deserved and much needed tax breaks. The coalition fails to understand that government has a responsibility to ensure that the economic opportunities from our resources boom benefit all Australians. As mining companies and their executives take advantage of our resources we need to ensure that, through sustainMAIN COMMITTEE able management of our resource wealth, communities across Australia receive their fair share of the economic pie. The flow-on effects of this important government policy will give employees a stronger and fairer superannuation guarantee of 12 per cent of their salaries and wages, which will strengthen the economic environment in which 8.4 million Australians will one day retire to. In giving something back to workers in small business this budget also looks to our senior citizens who are an integral part of our community. The tax changes will increase the income threshold for eligible senior Australians both for singles and for each member of a couple. In doing so the government acknowledges the contributions that our senior Australians have made throughout their working lives to make Australia what it is today and does so while recognising their continued input into the economic life of communities across Australia. It is important to recognise that these announcements are able to be delivered only as a result of the decisive action taken by the federal government. It is action which kept our economy strong during the global recession. We are able to deliver to working Australians precisely because the government’s fiscal policy provided the basis from which workers were able to retain their jobs and precisely because circumstances allowed small businesses to continue operating and to therefore continue employing people. Expanding on this and in light of our productive capacity and sustainable growth I very much welcome the announcements of the new Skills for Sustainable Growth strategy. In improving the quality and accessibility of training, Calwell job seekers will receive language, literacy and numeracy support to address the barriers to sustainable employment and local workplace productivity. Under this program eligible job seekers will receive up to 800 hours of free accredited training and, in a diverse electorate such as mine, this will be of particular benefit to our young and newest Australians as well as to our Indigenous Australians, who have long been affected by the scourge of unemployment. At a time when Australia will be cheering the Socceroos’ endeavours in the 2010 FIFA World Cup, I am pleased to say that our local junior athletes, as a result of the 2010 budget, will receive assistance in achieving their sporting dreams, as announced by the Minister for Sport, under the Australian Sports Commission’s Local Sporting Champions grant program. The up to $18,000 available for youth sports stars wanting to compete in state and national events provides our community in Calwell with 24 individual grants and two team grants. Put simply, the chance to tap into this funding program has been doubled for our junior sports stars, which I know will help provide these young athletes with much-needed support in what can often be the most exciting and challenging times of their sporting careers. It will also provide support to parents-and I know this from having spoken to young people in the program’s administration last year-because parents are often very much burdened by the costs related to running their kids around to training and so on. None of us, I am sure the chamber would agree, would want to see our budding superathletes of the future miss these opportunities because their families could not afford to sustain their training. With regard to the continuation of the government’s strong commitment to innovation, I would like to draw on some reflections I have made in the past in this chamber. As Chair of the House Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Innovation-and of course, importantly, as the member for Calwell, which has a very large manufacturing base-I work closely with the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, and we assist by examining, MAIN COMMITTEE reporting and making recommendations regarding areas of policy that affect these industries. As such I would like to take this opportunity to commend the minister for his continued efforts, which are aimed at ensuring that strong and viable science, research and manufacturing industries remain an integral part of our national economy and our social framework. The textile, clothing and footwear industry employs over 45,000 Australians across the country, generating exports that are worth $1.6 billion, as well as contributing $2.8 billion each year alone to our national economy. The employment patterns within this industry, particularly in regional economies, ensure that entire communities across Australia are strongly supported by the development of these industries. My electorate is one such community that would obviously benefit greatly from the government’s commitments. That is why the initiatives and programs introduced by the Rudd Labor government are crucial to promoting capital investment and innovation aimed at ensuring that Australian made products continue to be a driving force for our local, regional and national economy. Through an additional $5 million, which brings the total level of funding for the government’s Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Capability Program to $35 million over five years, more companies will be able to access this program. Importantly, by reducing the total eligible expenditure of projects from $1 million to $500,000, it addresses the issue identified whereby companies were finding it difficult to get funding support for smaller projects. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my full support for the budget’s inclusion of a commitment to increasing the level of our development and humanitarian assistance to the tune of half a billion dollars. This increase is important because it recognises that, as we move beyond the current global economic environment, we do so in the company of the world’s most vulnerable. In Australia in particular we are all aware that we have managed to avoid the sorts of economic pitfalls that have befallen other countries. I think we have a moral obligation to assist them and do our bit at a level that is reflective of our wealth, so I welcome that measure. In closing, I want to say that the delivery of this budget was made possible not only because among the major advanced global economies Australia was the only country to avoid recession, not only because we were able to produce the second lowest unemployment and not only because we maintained the lowest debt and deficit but also because we did so while maintaining our AAA credit rating. Importantly, we did so while also maintaining our rights at work; the Rudd Labor government did not use the working rights of Australian people as a scapegoat for the upheavals in the global economy. And, importantly, we do so with record investment in long-term infrastructure projects for Australia’s long-neglected roads, rail and ports. Through the Roads to Recovery program, the Hume City Council, in my electorate, will receive an extra $894,331 to assist with the maintenance and upgrading of local roads. This is in addition to the additional $89 million allocated to the ongoing Western Ring Road upgrade project, which I know will relieve a lot of the traffic congestion associated with the area immediately adjacent to my electorate. The budget before us is good for our economy, it is good for working Australians and their families, it is certainly very good for pensioners and senior Australians, it is good for businesses and it is good for the long-term social and economic viability of communities right across Australia and, in particular, my electorate of Calwell. It is on this basis that I welcome the government’s announcements and commend the bills to the House. MAIN COMMITTEE Firstly, responsible management of the economy has seen Australia weather the global financial crisis better than most other comparable economies-a fact almost totally ignored by those opposite. The savings and policies identified in this budget are targeted to get the budget back into surplus in 2012, three years ahead of schedule. The second message is that the proceeds from the resource super profits tax will go straight back into building a stronger, broader economy by cutting business taxes, especially for small business, boosting retirement savings and investing in vital economic infrastructure. Let us just remind ourselves about how Australia has travelled in these difficult economic times. I sometimes think that we in Australia appear somewhat isolated from the impact the world economic crisis has had, and continues to have, throughout the world, most particularly in the USA and Europe. It is not because Australia is economically isolated from the rest of the world-indeed, to the contrary. The reason Australia has performed so strongly compared to many other comparable economies is largely because the Rudd Labor government acted so decisively to stimulate our economy as private capital evaporated. The stimulus strategy sought to inject spending and investment into the economy as retail spending and private infrastructure investment began to decline significantly. The stimulus worked and kept our economy out of recession. Significantly, in partnership with Australia’s employers, employees and unions, it kept Australians in work. But do not just take my word on this, immensely proud though I am of the government’s record with the stimulus matters that we introduced. The OECD’s latest economic forecasts are a timely reminder that our decisive action during the global recession has put our economy in a position of strength, from which we can reform the tax system and boost competition in the mortgage market for the benefit of families, workers and small business. The OECD has revised upwards its growth forecast for Australia and now expects GDP to grow by 3.2 per cent in 2010 and 3.6 per cent in 2011, one of the strongest growth outlooks of all OECD economies and well above the growth forecast for the OECD area as a whole. I know it might sound a little bland to listen to those figures, but they are comparably very impressive. I congratulate this government and our community on being able to achieve these forecasts. On the employment front, the OECD expects Australia’s unemployment rate to fall by 4.8 per cent by the end of 2011, dramatically lower than the eight per cent unemployment rate expected for the OECD area as a whole. The OECD also welcomed the government’s disciplined budget, stating: … in view of the stronger economy and fiscal restraint, the Government now expects to balance its budget by 2012-13, three years earlier than previously anticipated. The national accounts for the March quarter will be out soon-on Wednesday of this week, I believe. It was this same release last year that revealed Australia had avoided a technical recession, one of only two advanced economies in the world to do so. This achievement sparked a revival in confidence which underpinned a recovery in private demand which would see Australia go on to record growth of 1.4 per cent in 2009 in year average terms and become the envy of the developed world. So what of the resource super profits tax announced in the budget and now the source of so much shrill commentary by the big end of the mining industry? A whole host of dire scenarios is being presented by the big mining companies, ranging from allegations that they will be the MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Appropriation Bill No 2 2010 2011 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2010 2011
168,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (5.36 Pm),"The message of the budget was twofold.most heavily taxed of all mining concerns in the world to being forced to put projects on hold, the loss of thousands of jobs, and declining returns to shareholders and superannuation recipients. Of course, any evidence that is contrary to these dire predictions is dismissed as untruths. Surely, there could not be a lot of self-interest at play here-surely not! A local example surfaced in my own daily newspaper today when the editorial writer for the day had this to say in reaction to some negative comments from a mining company and an opposition media release about the RSPT. He said: I must admit I was initially sold on the whole ‘they take the resources which belong to all of us’ argument, but have soured on it following the reaction from local industry players. Well, blow me down! Because some industry players do not like the prospect of increased taxes, the government’s rationale for the tax and the Treasury modelled benefits from it do not seem to carry the same weight. Why is this? Laurie Oakes, on 29 May in the Hobart Mercury, put it incisively when he wrote: The mining industry campaign is certainly over the top, and difficult to counter. When mining companies devalue their own shares by forecasting dire consequences from the tax, people tend to believe them. In other words, they talked their own share prices down by this ridiculous scaremongering campaign that they have unleashed. I think Ross Gittins’s piece in the Sydney Morning Herald of 26 May, headed ‘Let’s mine bright ideas and stop being shrinking violets’, goes some way to identifying what the real issue is with regard to the RSPT and the big mining companies’ misinformation campaign against it. Mr Gittins, no favourite or favourer of the Rudd government, argues that the traditional Australian cringe factor lies at the heart of their attack and the hope that Australians and the government will accept this. If the RSPT goes ahead, they argue, they will cancel their projects and take their money somewhere else. Mr Gittins says: Oh dear, don’t desert us. Please! Know what theirthat is, the big mining companiesproblem is? Australia, being one of the world’s leading mining nations, is a world leader in designing taxes that increase the public’s take without discouraging mining activity or otherwise damaging the economy. He goes on: The resource super-profits tax is a state-of-the-art tax, designed by our leading economists not to do all the bad things it’s being accused of. It’s a close relative of an earlier Australian invention, the resource rent tax, developed by Professor Ross Garnaut and others … Mr Gittins further goes on: The big international mining companies are fighting it partly because they fear that, once its success has been demonstrated, it will be copied by other countries. And they’re fighting it by trying to press our cringe button: if no one else is doing it, it must be a dumb thing to do. As Ross Gittins goes on to show, in so many areas Australia has led the world. And that was no dumb thing to do. Last week saw some of Australia’s foremost economic authorities endorsing the resource super profits tax and destroying key planks of the scare campaign being run against this imMAIN COMMITTEE portant reform. Remember, it is a reform-a reform of the tax system that is long needed. Even the mining industry recognises this. Twenty leading economists published an open letter. They are quite happy to have their names in the newspaper publicly endorsing this scheme, this tax proposal. They described it as a more efficient and equitable system of sharing the value of exploration and mining rights. Mr Katter interjectingin the House by speaking now. I know he will listen to what I have to say. He regards me, I hope, as a considerate person. He will consider what I have got to say and take it on its merits. The 20 economists, who include former ACCC chief Professor Alan Fels, made it clear: There is no reason to expect a net contraction in mining over the longer term as a result of replacing royalties with the proposed resource rent tax. This is because a tax on economic rent of non-renewable resources is a more efficient way of raising revenue than taxing mining production (royalties). It makes sense. But it does not seem that those opposite are prepared to use sense in their arguments. Last week we also saw thoroughly debunked the myth that the RSPT would push up consumer prices. When asked about that particular part of the scare campaign, another of the 20 economists, Professor John Quiggan, said: I think that’s about the least defensible. The reason that there are super profits to be taxed is because of high world prices for these minerals that are set on world markets. So there’s no reason at all to think that the tax is going to affect the world price of these minerals, and therefore that that’s going to feed in any way into Australian consumer prices. This was the point made by Treasury Secretary Dr Ken Henry, whom those opposite want to vilify, at Senate estimates last week, when he said that a profits based tax would not impact on consumer prices, although cutting the company tax would have a beneficial impact for consumers. Of course this has not been recognised by the big mining companies, who will benefit from the lower company tax rate. By the way, I would like to add that those opposite, in their non-tax plan, will penalise the mining companies because they will not support a decline or a reduction in the company tax rate. Indeed, Treasury figures based on modelling from independent firm KPMG Econtech show the impact of the government’s tax plan on prices as followsto accept a question from the member for Kalgoorlie? for Kalgoorlie. As I was saying, the Treasury figures, based on modelling from independent firm KPMG Econtech, show the impact of the government’s tax plan on prices as follows: food, lower by 0.9 per cent; clothing and footwear, lower by 1.3 per cent; housing, lower by 1.1 per cent; transportation-member for Kalgoorlie-lower by 1.7 per cent; and communications, lower by 1.4 per cent. of Treasury but also of KPMG Econtech, the independent modellers. But that would not mean anything to those opposite.

173,Mr Sidebottom,"I do not need to substantiate it. That is from the modelling not justmining companies and that is enough. Of course it is; it always is when you have a scare campaign running. Under the government’s tax proposals, the average worker-listen to this!-will be an extra $450 a year better off. Under the opposition’s tax plan, if that is how you can describe it, there will be no mining tax, no company tax cut and a 1.7 per cent tax increase for large companies. That would leave the same worker about $100 a year worse off. Tut-tut! Further, Labor’s tax plan will eventually boost GDP or economic output by 0.7 per cent whilst the Abbott plan would reduce GDP by 0.2 per cent. And there is more. I will throw some kitchen knives in for you as well. Investment is modelled to increase by 2.1 per cent under the government’s plan but fall by 0.55 per cent under Abbott’s. In addition, inflation will be affected. Consumer prices will be 1.1 per cent lower with the government’s taxation mix but 0.25 per cent higher with the coalition’s. Finally, average real after-tax wages are predicted to rise by 1.1 per cent under the government’s plan but would fall by 0.25 per cent under the Abbott-Hockey-Robb plan. Of course, we do not hear this in this debate from those opposite. They cannot defend their so-called tax proposal, particularly the 1.7 per cent tax on large businesses to pay for their uncosted paid parental leave scheme. Early last week the Treasurer delivered a ministerial statement to the parliament discussing, amongst other things, the truth behind some of the myths peddled by some in the mining industry, how we will invest the proceeds of the RSPT and the posturing we have seen from some industry figures since the announcement of this vital economic reform. There has been much comment from mining companies in recent weeks about the supposed retrospectivity of the RSPT. These claims are clearly misleading, as the RSPT will apply to mining profits from 1 July 2012. It does not apply to past profits. It would help a more informed public debate if companies clearly distinguished between retrospective taxation, which this proposal is not, and taxation of existing projects, which is their actual complaint. Let’s make two points specifically related to this. The first is that complaints that the RSPT should not apply to existing projects are really an argument that governments should never change tax rates. That is not a sustainable proposition for any government any time but it is especially unsustainable when the tax share of the mining profits has fallen, regardless of what measure you use, so dramatically in recent years. As Macquarie Bank economist and interest-rate strategist Rory Robertson said last week: … only the most naive investor could have imagined that the final prices the mining sector receives from world markets for publicly-owned resources could increase by multiples over a decade and yet governments effectively would keep selling those same resources to mining companies at the same old low prices. Indeed, as Robertson points out, every city-based household knows that its local government rate payments will trend higher over time even if the home was bought many years earlier. Similarly, owners of rural property know that the government rates and rents are linked directly to the latest assessed value of the property and that if that value doubles then payments to the government will tend to rise in proportion. The second point is that the report of the tax review recommended that existing projects be included, and for very good public policy reasons. To exclude existing projects would of course create significant distortion of investment, as prospective projects and existing projects would be on an uneven tax playing field. I quote from Mr Robertson: MAIN COMMITTEE Mining companies have also made the argument that the RSPT should be differentiated by commodity. They argue that different commodities have different revenue, cost and therefore profit profiles. Some require more investment to extract, some less. Mining companies have used this to argue that the RSPT should apply at different rates for different commodities. But this analysis fails to grasp perhaps the most important design element of the RSPT. The fact is that, by design, an RSPT already differentiates by commodity. As a profits based tax the RSPT already takes account of the different revenue, cost and profit profiles of the different commodities. It also contains very generous treatment of investment. It therefore takes account of the different investment levels needed to develop different economies. The government is using the proceeds of the RSPT to provide a much needed cut in the company tax rate from 30 per cent to 28 per cent for all Australian companies, with a head start for small business. This is a really important economic reform for Australia because it will help us stay competitive at a time when the company tax rates are falling in other countries, particularly in our region. It will also help boost growth and real wages over the long run. Independent modelling shows that together with the RSPT, the cut in the company rate will boost GDP by 0.7 per cent and lift investment by 2.1 per cent. By contrast, an alternative plan to lift the company tax rate by 1.7 per cent on taxable company incomes over $5 million a year will actually reduce GDP by 0.2 per cent and cut investment by 0.5 per cent according to the Treasury and that means according to the so called tax plan of the opposition. don, he said that the opposition are indulging in scare tactics. IfI was the Labor member, I would be scared because if you think that you are going to convince the miners of Australia that you are going to hit the mining industry with a 40 per cent tax and that is not going to affect their jobs then you truly believe that the abominable snowman comes from Baduri. I have seen some incredible thought processes convincing themselves that this is going to be good and trying to convince the Australian nation that this is going to be good. Let it be understood that the average Australian understands that the governments of Australia-of both political persuasions-completely destroyed manufacturing in this country. They went to a free trade regime when no other country on earth went to a free trade regime or even anything even remotely resembling a free trade regime. But they insisted upon going to a free trade regime as some sort of example setting for the rest of the world. We were going to be the wunderkind of the world. The previous speaker, the member for Braddon, quoted all of these economists. I call them slithering suits out of Sydney. We see them pontificating every night on the television and in the newspapers. We have to judge them upon their merits. They have lauded the government for introducing free-trade policies. Let us have a look at manufacturing. There are three great divisions of the Australian economy, the productive side of the Australian economy: manufacturing, agriculture and mining. Let us look at manufacturing. I emphasise that all of the economists and all of the so-called people that are in the field of money in Sydney and Melbourne said this was going to be wonderful for us. The ORANI model was produced by the Productivity Commission. I cannot remember the exact figures, but they ran something like this: if we removed motor vehicle tariffs then there would be a 20 per cent intrusion over 10 years. There was a 50 per cent inMAIN COMMITTEE",179,Appropriation Bill No 2 2010 2011 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2010 2011
174,Mr Katter (Kennedy) (5.56 Pm),"With all due respect to the worthy member for Bradtrusion over five years. Mrs Orani, the wife of one of them, should sue for defamation as a result of her name being used on such a report. There were people who stood up in this place and said how wonderful it would be for us. The whole reason for this free trade was that it was going to cut the price of a motor car. IfI remember correctly the price of a motor car then was about $16,000 and within 10 years it had doubled in price. It had not gone down in price; it had doubled in price. Mr Deputy Speaker Schultz, you were in the processing of agricultural product. In actual fact in agriculture the processing element has been historically bigger than the actual farming element in agricultural production. We pleaded with the government not to deregulate the wool industry, and one side of this parliament said, ‘We have to accept it because it is market realities,’ and the other side said, ‘It’s a good thing in the long run.’ John Maynard Keynes, the greatest economist probably of all times, said, ‘In the long run we will all be dead.’ So we sank down to the second lowest manufacturing sector of any country in the OECD with the exception of Turkey-hardly a great economic model to follow. Manufacturing was destroyed in this country. We saw motor vehicle manufacture fall from pre free trade where 72 per cent of the vehicles driven in Australia-prior to Mr Keating’s wonderful free trade initiatives-were Australian made. Now only 12 per cent of Australia’s motor vehicles are Australian made. When all of us were young people, our fridges, stoves, airconditioners and television sets were made in Australia. None of those things are now made in Australia. Manufacturing in this country effectively, as a generalisation, ceased to exist completely. We listened to these people telling us how wonderful the brave new world will be for us and we realise now that those decisions were disastrous in the wool industry. When the industry was regulated, the price doubled over the next three years; when it was deregulated, it halved over the next three years. There cannot be a more definitive statement. In 1990 when Mr Keating, in his wisdom, deregulated that industry, 10 per cent of this nation’s income came from wool. It was bigger than coal. That is in 1990. That is not exactly ancient history. Most of the people in the parliament were here in the early 1990s. We have wiped out manufacturing so we can move on to agriculture now. I have just mentioned the wool industry. I remind the chamber again that seven years ago Australia became a net importer of pork. I think everyone in this House would have eaten pork somewhere in the last week. Four years ago-it may have been three-we became a net importer of fruit and vegetables and last year we became a net importer of seafood. It does not matter what set of statistics you want to look at, whether it is in nine to 25 years time, this nation will be a net importer of food. Let me say to you, this nation will not be able to feed itself. That is the implication of those figures. Manufacturing has ceased to exist, agriculture is going down the chute at 100 miles an hour. Let me again be very specific. Wool numbers are down 60 per cent. Cattle numbers are down around 20 per cent. In the sugar industry we close two mills every five years. That is three. The wheat industry is very much dependent upon seasonal climatic conditions, so I will not use that as an example and in dairying-which quite amazes me because I would not have thought that people would just stop drinking milk-but of course the manufacturing side of the industry has pulled it down about 15 per cent as well. There are your giant four agricultural industries. They are on desolation row. You have no manufacturing. Your agriculture is vanishing. What do you have left? You have mining. MAIN COMMITTEE I come into this place not like other people. I am one of the few who had copper dust-not coal dust, but copper dust-under my fingernails. I worked as a labourer at Mount Isa Mines and I was briefly a union rep there. I worked my own mines-I found them, I developed them myself and I produced copper from them. Prior to coming into parliament I was in the process of floating by own mining company. I know the mining industry intimately. I was Northern Development Minister and then Mines and Energy Minister in the Queensland government. Nobody in this country knows mining better than I do. Whether my kids were fed or not depended on whether I made the right decisions in mining. In the mining industry, nine out of every 10 prospects will lose money-big money-so you have got to make enough profit on the 10th prospect. All of these great slithering suits from Melbourne and Sydney and all the very foolish people in the Labor Party are telling us how wonderful this mining tax is for us. I will give members of the Labor Party a word of advice: do not tie yourself to a sinking ship. To identify yourself with this cause is to simply chain yourself to the Titanic. Let me explain. The profits on the 10th mine have to cover the losses on the other nine. If there are not going to be any ‘super profits’ on the 10th mine then you will not have enough profits to cover the losses on the other nine prospects. So people will not mine in this country. They will go to a country where they can make super profits on that 10th mine. I should not have to tell anyone in this place that the metals market is a roller coaster. In 2006 the price for zinc was $4,000 a tonne but last year it was $1,000 a tonne. You had to be able to make enough profit in 2006 to carry you when the roller coaster goes down to $1,000 a tonne. But you would not be able to do that because the upswing of the roller coaster is truncated by the stats. If you cannot see that, there will be a terrible political price. I actually think the government has done a very good job with the economy to date. I think the opposition are very misguided in criticising the government for spending money at the outbreak of the financial crisis. It is a great shame to see all of that good work destroyed by advice from Treasury that is simply flawed. Obviously, the man has not spoken. If you think there is no problem, why would the head of BHP-a person who has never really picked fights; he is not a confrontational person-suddenly become very confrontational? Why would Mike Davis, the head of Xstrata, take time off to talk about Australia when he is addressing the European Chamber of Commerce? Why would Mr Albanese, the head of Rio Tinto, take time off to talk about Australia when he is addressing the American Chamber of Commerce? Clearly, these people are not happy with this decision-to the point that they do not care about antagonising the government. They have nothing to lose in this country, so they might as well go for broke. The political implications of this for the ALP will be diabolical. I wrote an article for the Financial Review some years ago-I think I was still in the National Party at that stage, but I might have just left-saying that the National Party in Queensland was going to pay a diabolical price for their failure to stand up to the powers that be in a number of areas. I said on the day before the state election that they were going to suffer a massive loss, and they suffered the worse loss in Queensland political history bar one. SoI warn the current government in the same way. This is not to be nasty or threatening. They must simply understand that, in mining, nine out of 10 mines are going to lose money big. Therefore, you have to make a great profit from the 10th mine to cover the others. You have to make enough money on the upswing of the roller coaster to cover the downswing of the roller coaster. MAIN COMMITTEE Let me move on. Every mining company is going to bring in every one of their employees and contractors in and tell them: ‘We’ve been hit with a 40 per cent tax, fellas. If you think that is not going to affect job opportunities for yourself and for your kids, you don’t deserve to have a job in mining.’ That is what the bosses are going to say to them. When the bosses told them the IR legislation was going to be good for them, they did not believe the bosses; they believed the Labor Party. But this time they will believe the bosses, not the Labor Party. It is not like the old days, when the miners were great supporters of the Labor Party-far from it. The people working in mining today are far more sophisticated than the miners of the past. They have far more sophisticated attitudes. We saw that in electorates like Dawson, in North Queensland, when interest rate increases were threatening. With the Labor opposition under the leadership of Mark Latham, those people swung very strongly against the ALP in that election-and the member for Dawson had a very handsome majority of about 14 per cent. Just as they swung over to Labor over interest rates, when the IR legislation came in they swung violently back the other way-and Labor now holds Dawson with a four per cent majority. Anyone who thinks there will not be an effect in the mining areas is kidding themselves. Do you want me to name how many seats in New South Wales are partially mining seats and also marginal? The other factor is that we have not had a lot of competition on the world stage. America and Europe have completely mined out their mines-the easy stuff, and even the hard stuff, has been taken away. America is mining coal at a depth of two kilometres. We would not dream of doing that in Australia. I say this to illustrate that the easy stuff in America and in Europe has gone. They are sophisticated economies that have heavily mined their land in the past. The countries that have not been mined are Brazil, the two Mongolias, all those other countries to the west of the two Mongolias, Kazakhstan and Russia. Brazil has traditionally had very unstable government. Mongolia has no infrastructure and virtually no government and is very remote. Russia, of course, was communist. Russia is no longer communist; it is a happy hunting ground. It is very much larger in area than Australia. Because it is a bigger country, there will be much more minerals there. You could almost put it in terms of tonnes of minerals per square kilometre. Brazil is a much bigger country than Australia. Even if you take out the super-wet belt of the Amazon, it is still a much bigger country than Australiaand it has not been touched. The two Mongolias and Kazakhstan are also much bigger than Australia. So we will now have dramatic competition from countries that are much bigger than us and will have much greater mineral wealth than we have. So, on top of everything else, there are alternatives to mining in Australia. Next year or the year after, BHP will mine more coal in Indonesia than it does in Australia-the leading coal exporting country on earth. For those who are unfamiliar with mining, there is a thing called transfer pricing. I always thought Mitsubishi was the classic example of this. They sold silicon to themselves in Japan for $55 a tonne and the Queensland government bought it back as optical fibre. It does not cost a lot of money to transform the almost pure silicon, which we were exporting, into optical fibre, but we were paying $2 million a tonne for it. That is a simple example of transfer pricing. If you think that, when we bring this tax in, they ain’t gonna go to transfer pricing, you would believe in the tooth fairy! People have the hypocrisy to say, ‘Oh, we’re standing aside and letting all this money go overseas.’ I pleaded and shouted in this place for something to be done, and I had a defamaMAIN COMMITTEE tion action brought against me because of my efforts to try and stop the takeover of our mining companies by foreigners. But the governments of Australia-the ALP government and the Liberal-National Party government-sat on their hands and watched as the six giant mining companies of Australia were flogged off to overseas companies. This was to help the stock market-the great sacred God of modern society. Governments sat there and watched BHP, the great Australian, flogged off. They sat there and watched Western Mining Corporation flogged off. They sat there and watched CRA flogged off. They sat there and watched Mount Isa Mines flogged off. They sat there and watched Normandy Mining flogged off. They did nothing. In not one single case did they do a thing. Now that all the profits are flowing overseas-and very great profits, indeed-they are going to try and close the gate after the horse has bolted. Coming from the cattle industry, I know that that is a pretty useless thing to do, Mr Deputy speaker, let me tell you. The governments of Australia, with their enlightened policies on manufacturing, have destroyed the manufacturing industries of Australia. People hate politicians, but that was not true when I was a young bloke. I felt great awe and reverence for some of the men of Australian politics-men like Sir John ‘Black Jack’ McEwen. Ask anyone in the street what they think of Mr Howard. Ask anyone in the street what they think of Mr Keating. I deeply regret to say this, because I personally like the current Prime Minister(Time expired) Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (6.16 pm)-I rise today to speak in support of the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2010-2011 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 that underpin the Labor government’s 2010-2011 budget. It is a budget that continues the Labor tradition of prudent economic management and necessary economic reform of unlocking productivity and locking in fairness, of making bigpicture reform without fear or favour and of responding flexibly to prevailing economic conditions while remaining steadfast in the pursuit of our shared national interest. There is no better indication of the government’s commitment to these values and of its adherence to these qualities than in the 2010-2011 budget and in the relationship between this budget and its predecessor. Last year the government responded to the most profound economic crisis since the Great Depression by embarking on an economic stimulus package that would both fuel and cushion the Australian economy. This action achieved its twin purposes. It underwrote the strength of the Australian economy, which grew 1.4 per cent in a period when the other advanced economies taken together contracted by 3.2 per cent. It did so by creating long-term improvements in our schools, on our roads and in our local communities through the Building the Education Revolution program, the Commonwealth-local government partnership of the community infrastructure program and black spot funding. It prevented the long and lasting damage that would have occurred without the government’s nation building stimulus, it prevented the recession that would have occurred without the government’s action and it kept hundreds of small and medium businesses alive that would have gone to the wall without the support of government stimulus. In the last few weeks, I have visited Harmony Primary School, Spearwood Alternative School, Palmyra Primary School and Beaconsfield Primary School. In each case, I have met with staff, parents and P&C representatives who are looking forward to having the use of extensive new facilities in the next few months. In many cases, this much needed additional caMAIN COMMITTEE pacity and amenity represents the first significant capital works to have occurred at schools in my electorate in 20 years or more. For some schools, the new facilities will provide their first all-weather assembly space. I am also aware of primary schools that are having their buildings equipped to cater for their involvement in the fantastic Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden Program. The Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program has achieved a similarly successful provision of short-term emergency economic stimulus in the form of long-lasting community improvements. Under this program, the City of Fremantle installed solar panels on the roof of its community leisure centre. The City of Cockburn undertook extensive work to improve access and facilities at Bibra Lake-a beautiful and ecologically vital wetland in the heart of my electorate. The City of Melville put forward a range of projects, including waterwise improvements to the irrigation system used for the public golf course. The town of East Fremantle made improvements to disability access at community sports facilities and also undertook heritage restoration work. Mr Deputy Speaker, when you consider the varied nature and benefits of all these projects-renewable energy, disability access, heritage conservation and improvements to environmental protection and public open-space amenity-and you then multiply this across Australia’s 700 or so local governments, you begin to see how the federal government’s action has reached into every corner of this country to support economic activity, to save jobs and to create much needed improvements to public infrastructure. When I recently attended the opening of the refurbished Locke Park rotunda in the town of East Fremantle, the contractor who had undertaken the heritage restoration work told me that without the funding to local government projects he would have been forced to lay off five or six employees. I have heard the same thing many times in the last 12 months from workers and business owners alike. It is crystal clear that the government’s decision to make good the collapse in private demand that followed the global financial meltdown has had a direct and dramatic effect in the Fremantle electorate, especially in the south and south-east where unemployment has been comparatively high. It is through this response, in cooperation with a go-ahead private sector and the resilience and optimism of the Australian people, that Australia now has the second lowest unemployment rate of all the major advanced economies. It is through this decisive response that unemployment, which was forecast to peak at 8.5 per cent, instead peaked at 5.8 per cent and is projected to return to less than five per cent. That is a remarkable achievement. It means that some 220,000 Australians were kept in work. It means that the personal heartache and financial trauma that would have occurred in Australian households in the absence of government stimulus was avoided. That achievement, the maintenance of economic growth and employment strength in the Australian economy and the prevention of widespread economic harm to the Australian community, should not be overlooked or underestimated. Through the steps taken by this Labor government in partnership with state and local governments across Australia, with the goodwill and enterprise of Australian business and with the optimism and hard work of the Australian people, we have done remarkably well in remarkably difficult circumstances. Now, a year later, the 2010-11 budget moves to address the short-term deficits that were necessary to keep the Australian economy going forward at a time when most other advanced MAIN COMMITTEE economies were going under. It charts our passage back to surplus in three years, which is three years earlier than originally forecast. In that way, this budget builds on the achievements and meets the responsibilities of the government’s 2009-10 budget. The responsibility is to contract spending growth and to match any new spending with new savings, and we have done that. The way forward is to continue to address this government’s agenda for positive change when it comes to the 21st century challenges in health, productivity and energy policy. Among those forward-looking changes, I am happy to highlight the following: the introduction of Australia’s first Paid Parental Leave scheme; the introduction of a resource super profits tax, which will ensure all Australians benefit fairly from the development of resources that belong to all of us, in the form of a tax scheme that will assist smaller companies and exploration projects; an unprecedented national health and hospitals reform package; a new instalment in the distinctly Labor project of providing adequate superannuation savings; and a further $650 million in renewable energy development as part of our $5.1 billion Clean Energy Initiative. These are all big picture initiatives that build from Australia’s world-leading position of economic stability and address the national and global challenges that we face in the decades to come. The resource super profits tax is simply intended to restore balance and fairness to the arrangements that govern the use and development of commodities that belong to all of us and that we ought to manage as assets held at least partly in trust for the generations to come. The public share of resource industry profits has fallen from $1 in three to something like $1 in seven within a decade. That is simply not a fair balance between providing an incentive and a reward for resources companies on the one hand and ensuring that all Australians now and in the future benefit from our shared inheritance on the other. I note the proposed mining tax is supported by 20 leading economists and academics in a statement released on 26 May that says, inter alia: … the current public criticism of the proposed tax has been dominated by misinformation. Mining is different to other industries in that it uses and depletes natural resources. Some return on those resources should flow to the Australian public. The proposed mining tax is also supported by the former head of the Minerals Council of Australia, David Buckingham, who has stated: Given these profits are made principally from the exclusive right to exploit a non-renewable resource owned by the Australian people, such tax rates are far from unreasonable. Mr Buckingham also pointed out the scare campaigns of the past on the petroleum resource rent tax and native title legislation. On those occasions also there were threats of lost jobs, projects, exports and national income. It was claimed that those proposals would ruin our economy. Of course, as he noted, nothing of the sort happened. Mining and petroleum industries went on to grow and prosper. It is pertinent to note that the Minerals Council itself submitted in November 2008 that there should be a shift away from state based royalty charges to a national profits based tax. Australia’s natural resources are our common wealth and they are not inexhaustible. It is therefore entirely fair and appropriate that all Australians benefit from the exploitation of these natural resources, and that is why the government will apply the proceeds of the superprofits tax to build infrastructure in places that desperately need it, including in resource rich states like my home state of WA, and to support an increase in compulsory superannuation. MAIN COMMITTEE In my electorate of Fremantle the measures this budget contains in relation to health and superannuation are very welcome. The provision of $950 million to increase the capacity of emergency departments and to support the new standard requiring that patients presenting to emergency be admitted, referred, treated or discharged within four hours will improve the critical service provided by the emergency department at Fremantle Hospital. This is in addition to the $417 million to improve after-hours access to GP and primary care services and the $523 million for the training and support of Australian nurses. I also welcome the $19.2 million investment that the government is making to upskill more than 4,000 aged-care workers nationwide, and I know this already includes funds to train 23 new aged-care workers in my electorate of Fremantle. As part of the government’s general commitment to productivity improvements and carbon emission reduction, this budget makes a further investment of $1 billion in rail freight infrastructure. Rail freight continues to be underutilised in Australia, despite the fact that it offers very significant environmental, safety and amenity benefits in comparison to road transport. As a former community lawyer, I wholeheartedly welcome the provision of an additional $25,000 for the Fremantle Community Legal Centre. This funding is a small but important part of the largest injection of Commonwealth funding for legal assistance services in more than a decade. From1 July additional funding in this area over four years includes: $92.3 million for legal aid, $34.9 million for Indigenous legal services and $26.8 million for community legal service programs. Having had the experience of providing assistance to people who cannot afford private representation and having had the experience of seeing the kinds of very difficult legal and personal issues that people have to confront and resolve-especially people who are disenfranchised, or newly migrated, or experiencing family breakdown or economically disadvantaged-I know that this additional capacity will make an enormous difference. On this issue, I would also like to draw attention to the government’s new Access to Justice web portal, which is designed to enable people to find legal information and legal advice services in their local area. This forms part of the government’s Strategic Framework for Access to Justice and is an innovative 21st century component of the Commonwealth’s $1.2 billion for legal assistance services over the next four years. I am glad that this budget with its strong emphasis on the domestic bottom line and on domestic capacity building nevertheless continues this government’s trajectory towards a higher level of international aid. The commitment in 2010-11 is for $4.3 billion, which is consistent with our path towards 0.5 per cent of gross national income by 2015-16. In the medium term I hope that Australia and other countries can reach the UN-endorsed contribution level of 0.7 per cent of GNI. I commend the Parliamentary Secretary for International Development Assistance for his work in this area, which naturally has been in keeping with the incredibly high standard of service that he has given to this parliament and to this country for many years. I encourage all members to see the address that the parliamentary secretary, the member for Fraser, gave at the Australian National University last week on our engagement with Africa. The parliamentary secretary highlighted that Australia’s increased assistance ‘is about contributing more effectively to achieving the Millennium Development Goals and being a good international citizen in a world that is becoming ever smaller and more complex’. MAIN COMMITTEE Before leaving the subject of foreign aid, my attention has been drawn to a speech made by the member for Melbourne Ports during this debate on the appropriation bills in which the member was critical of the $12.7 million Australia gives to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, the agency responsible for the Palestinian refugees. The member stated, inter alia, ‘We need to look more closely at the endemic waste, corruption and misappropriation of funds that has plagued UNRWA and this kind of funding over the years.’ The member made similar claims in his speech last year on the appropriation bills, to which I responded in a letter directly to the relevant minister and copied to the member. However, given that the claims have again been made from a parliamentary platform and are now being circulated on the internet, I feel it is necessary to make a brief response in kind. My own interest in this matter arises from my experience of having worked directly for UNRWA in Gaza for 2½ years and from a desire to protect the work and reputation of a respected and long standing organisation and its staff, who are good and committed people of integrity working in exceedingly difficult and dangerous conditions. sight includes a biennial audit by the United Nations Board of Auditors, which is an outside and independently constituted organisation. UNRWA is also subject to regular reviews and inspections by the donor community, including the European Commission, the United States General Accounting Office and the State Department and the UK Department for International Development. I note that the US, EU and the UK remain three of the largest donors to the agency and continue to provide strong support for it. As I stated in my letter last year: Australia can have no reason to doubt UNRWA’s long-standing commitment to and ready participation in the auditing of its finances and practices in response to the legitimate desires of donors to scrutinise how their funds are being used. The Agency is a moderating and neutral force. If UNRWA can’t pay salaries, if it has to lay off staff, or to close schools and health clinics, the alternative to the population in Gaza will be the services offered by the local authority. It is surprising that people who are concerned about Hamas don’t seem to realise that if it weren’t for UNRWA schools, all children in Gaza would be attending Hamas-run schools. Ultimately, UNRWA is not the problem and it is not the solution. The solution lies in the political sphere. In the meantime, one of the-if not the-most effective ways of providing badly needed humanitarian assistance-food, cash, jobs-and human development assistance-education, health care, relief and social services, infrastructure and protection-is by supporting UNRWA. Australia’s generous contributions to UNRWA are extremely important, and I am assured that the Australian government maintains its full support and commitment to UNRWA. Labor went to the last election promising to maintain a strong Australian economy and promising to position this country for the future. At the last election, we promised to address the policy neglect of the previous government in areas like education, housing infrastructure and health. We promised to withdraw our troops from Iraq, to apologise to the stolen generations and to introduce national numeracy and literacy standards for the benefit of the schoolkids of this generation and of those that follow. But, above all, we promised that our reform agenda would be built on the foundation of a strong economy, because a strong economy is essential to jobs, is essential to opportunities for young Australians and is essential to our capacity at all levels to protect, nourish and expand our common wealth. MAIN COMMITTEE That is Labor’s essential credo: to maintain and improve the things we all share; to maintain and improve public education, universal health care, fair working conditions, a strong safety net, superannuation and the environment. Those things belong to all of us. They are the bedrock of Australian society, of everyday Australian life and of Australian values-fairness, opportunity, cooperation, innovation and tolerance. Managing a strong economy puts families and individuals in a position to best pursue a productive and fulfilling life according to their own interests and on their own terms and it puts government in a position to safeguard and enhance the public goods that we all share. In recognising the balanced achievements of this government, it is nevertheless important to remember that the opposition said it could not be done. The opposition said our abolition of Work Choices would damage the economy and cause unemployment to skyrocket. The now opposition leader said paid parental leave would be implemented over his dead body. The shadow Treasurer said that returning the budget to surplus in four years would be a good effort and something this government would be incapable of achieving. The truth is that we have delivered world-leading economic performance at the same time as we have delivered a return to fairness in the workplace. Those opposite said it could not be done-and we have done it. The truth is that we have delivered one of the strongest economies in the OECD, with the first pension reform in more than a decade and while making a huge investment in renewable energy development. We have managed an economy with the lowest government debt of all the major developed economies. In this budget, we have set the course for necessary tax reform, with 12 per cent compulsory superannuation, reduced company taxation, better treatment of small business asset write-offs and changes to support lower-income Australians with an increase in the lowincome tax offset to $1,500 and a decrease in the tax that applies to interest on savings. We have delivered one of the very few OECD economies to avoid recession, with an agreed deal on national health and hospitals reform, landmark funding support for after-hour services, nurse training and the personal and systemic efficiencies inherent in a voluntary system of electronic health records. All of these things have been achieved against a background of events that no-one predicted at the end of 2007. These achievements-the world-leading economic management and the forward-looking reforms-have occurred against the background of a global financial crisis in 2008-09 that literally wrecked a number of major developed economies. Right now, the shock waves of that crisis continue to threaten the European economies. This instability only underlines the need for the prudent economic management that is a feature of this budget. In the tradition of Labor governments, this government has undertaken the hard task of changing things for the better, even though change is always the toughest political road. It was the Hawke-Keating Labor government that introduced compulsory superannuation, and now we have set the course for an increase in compulsory superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent. It was the Hawke-Keating government that introduced the family assistance package in 1987, and now we are proud to introduce Australia’s first comprehensive paid parental leave scheme. It was the Hawke-Keating government that established Medicare as the national universal health care system, building on the Whitlam government’s revolutionary Medibank initiative, and now we have put in place a national health and hospitals framework that acknowledges and tackles the demographic changes ahead. That is our story. It is a good MAIN COMMITTEE story and I am happy to tell it. I commend the Treasurer, his staff and his department for this balanced, responsible and forward-looking budget and for the incredible achievements of the last 18 months. second statements come on-and I suggest I will have to finish my speech tomorrow-so it will not be easy for me to cover the issues in the appropriation bills that I need to cover, including mental health cuts. I will speak on budget portfolio statement 2010-11 budget related paper No. 1.11 and the issue of mental health on page 313. As we go through these pages, commencing at page 313, we find significant reason for regional Australia to be enormously concerned about the intentions of the minister and the government, particularly in relation to the cuts in mental health services and the transfer of funding out of one pot and into another. This will have a disproportionate impact on regional Australians. I recognise that the minister has had to back down on her decision about when these health cuts will take effect. These cuts have now been deferred for nine months, so perhaps the minister can take a look at this. The minister has decided to defer the starting date for these cuts. I would like to discuss how mental health works in regional Australia and why I think the minister has erred in her attempt to assist on mental health. In fact, what she has done has made things excessively worse. I am not talking about very small regional communities that do not have access to a whole host of allied health services and social workers and psychologists. I am talking about large inland cities. I come from a large inland city, Wagga Wagga, and I might start my explanation of my concerns by explaining just how the process works in mental health when you are in a large regional inland city. When a client presents themselves to a community health team and they are initially assessed, if they are not considered a priority-that is, they are not considered to be at risk of harm-then the client will be referred out to a social worker or to a psychologist through the division of general practice or a doctor’s surgery. The mental health team will always refer clientscordance with standing order 192. The debate is adjourned, and the resumption will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed on a future day. Parkes Electorate: Central West Drought Action Group area in my electorate who have formed an organisation known as the Central West Drought Action Group. These are farmers from the Mendooran, Dunedoo and Mudgee part of New South Wales. Last week they got the news from Minister Burke that their application for an exceptional circumstances declaration was denied on the recommendation of the NRAC. On behalf of those farmers, I would like to ask the minister to reconsider and to personally intervene. TonightI have sent the minister a letter cosigned by the shadow minister for agriculture, the Hon. John Cobb, pointing out that I believe that these farmers were not given due consideration.

One of the sectors that I acknowledged on the morning was those people who volunteer their time to serve on local school councils. Outside the school communities they serve, and sometimes even from within the school communities, these people receive little recognition for their efforts. Schools today are under enormous pressure to meet budgetary constraints while simultaneously providing students with the best educational outcomes and best student services possible. We also expect schools not only to educate children but to care for and help raise them. School council members play a crucial role in the provision of services at schools. Not only are they there to provide feedback and advice to the principal on a range of relevant school issues, but they are always first to roll up their sleeves and participate in working bees; work in school canteens; help organise sports events and community open days; monitor road crossings; and transport children to and from school outings, sports events and the like-the list goes on, and I could use many other examples. As a regular visitor to schools in my electorate, I see for myself the immense contribution that school council members make in ensuring that children get the best possible experience in school life and the best possible education outcomes. This government has made lifting the education standards of the nation a priority policy area of government. The delivery of additional resources and implementation of government policies will be enhanced because of the added value in every school from school council members and school volunteers. (Time expired) Mitchell Electorate: The Hills Swimming and Life Saving Club The Hills Swimming and Life Saving Club in my electorate of Mitchell. The club was formed in early 1967 with the name ‘The Hills Amateur Swimming Club’. The word ‘amateur’ was, of course, compulsory in those days. In 1998 it was changed to ‘The Hills Swimming Club’, and then, in 2006, to ‘The Hills Swimming and Life Saving Club. It is based centrally in Baulkham Hills and run by a fantastic committee of volunteers. It used to be the biggest swimming club in New South Wales, with over 700 members in the seventies.

Blair Electorate: Queensland Times the only daily newspaper in the electorate of Blair, on its new era with the launch of its newlook premises on 28 May 2010. Queensland Premier Anna Bligh joined civic, political and community leaders at the opening of the new QT Centre at West Ipswich. For most of its existence the QT has been based at Ellenborough Street, Ipswich in the CBD. The Queensland Times has a long and proud history as a provincial newspaper in the Queensland community. QT general manager Steve Portas said, ‘A paper like the QT is owned by its community’ and that is absolutely correct. Stuart Sherwin, the editor, was there with many other past editors. Its origins can be traced back to the Ipswich Herald on 4 July 1859. Ever since then it has diligently, ferociously and fearlessly reported the news, sometimes penetrating the Ipswich community in a way that politicians do not always appreciate. Important events such as the commencement of the railway line from Ipswich in 1864, the Box Flat mine disaster in 1972, the 1893 and 1974 floods were all covered by the Queensland Times. Queensland Times campaigned extensively for the separation of Queensland from New South Wales and also agitated strongly that Ipswich should be the capital of Queensland. A ‘terrible’ event happened when Brisbane was selected as the capital many years ago. (Time expired) La Trobe Electorate: Lavinia Martin meet inspiring members of my local community. Last year I met eight-year-old Lavinia Martin who described to me her struggle with type 1 diabetes, otherwise known as juvenile diabetes. I was deeply moved by her story. Type1 diabetes is unpreventable. It is often diagnosed in childhood or young adulthood, although the disease affects adults too. It affects one in 148 people. Lavinia is a fantastic ambassador for type 1 diabetes and together we organised an inaugural Teddy Bears Picnic and we raised nearly $8,000 for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation in Australia. It was a fantastic day. Children with their teddy bears laughed their way through the afternoon enjoying train rides, competitions and kicking the footy with Western Bulldog star recruit Sam Reid all in the name of that fantastic cause. As I said, we raised $8,000. I would like to thank Jo Martin and Julie Levin who combined forces to organise the event and many thanks to Berwick Nissan and Benno’s Cafe Restaurant for being the major sponsors and also the wider community of Berwick. My next goal is to push for a commitment from both the government and the opposition for $40 million to go towards a national clinical trial network in Australia.

It is a day when we as a nation encourage all our friends, neighbours, work colleagues and people around us to quit the habit of smoking. I feel very passionate about this subject because I used to smoke a packet and a half a day and today it is exactly six years since I quit. I am very proud to be celebrating those six years of being smoke-free. The member for Braddon informed me a minute ago that he gave up on 26 June 1986, 24 years ago. I congratulate him for being smoke-free. Like most smokers, I started when I was very young, a teenager as I assume the member for Braddon did as well. We all know that approximately eight out of 10 new smokers are either children or adolescents. We all remember going to the cinema and seeing the healthy and athletic images of the Marlboro man and we all wanted to emulate him. I am sure we all remember that very vividly and we remember other people smoking as well. When we think back, boy how wrong were we? Apart from that everyone lived in a society where most people smoked so I decided it was a good idea and took it up at a young age. But then we did not know what the devastating facts and the effects of smoking were and that over 20,000 people die every year from smoking directly, 350 people die each and every week. These days every smoker knows the facts, but because the addiction is so powerful all of the information in the world is not always enough to make you stop smoking. (Time expired) Foetal Alcohol Syndrome problems involved with foetal alcohol syndrome and the permanent damage to unborn children that results from the abuse of alcohol during pregnancy. Yesterday the Sunday Times reported that the number of mothers who are presenting at King Edward Memorial Hospital in Perth with drug addictions and with babies who are also addicted to drugs has increased substantially. It is an absolute tragedy because this involves permanent damage to unborn children. I have often said that I think there should be more adoption in this country, particularly in cases where children are in circumstances of such great adversity. WhatI worry about now is that by the time a child is born often the damage is done. I think we need to have a debate in this country about what more can be done and our concepts of early intervention when we are faced with these sorts of problems in the future. This is something which we need to be aware of and we need to try to address in our schools, but we also need to look at other ways in which we can tackle this major problem. Live Animal Exports Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (6.51 pm)-Around 80 per cent of Australia’s live sheep exports-approximately four million sheep-are shipped out of the port of Fremantle in my electorate each year. I receive up to 20 emails, letters and phone calls a week from constituents who are concerned about the trade on animal welfare grounds and because of the lost economic opportunities to create local jobs and increased income from processing the animals in WA and exporting the meat to the ever-expanding overseas sheepmeat market.

183,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (6.49 Pm),"Previously I have spoken in the parliament about thedemand for phasing out the live export trade in Fremantle has been such that last week on 26 May the City of Fremantle Council passed a resolution calling on the state and federal governments to bring stakeholders together to work towards a plan for the medium-term transition from live export to onshore processing. In the meantime, I think everyone would agree that, while the live animal export trade exists, it is essential that we have enforced minimum animal welfare standards. Unfortunately the Western Australian Barnett government has failed dismally in this regard. A six-person animal welfare unit established by the previous state Labor government three years ago has been slashed to just one officer, expected to monitor all livestock matters in a state of 2.5 million square kilometres. If we as a community cannot have confidence that minimum animal welfare standards are being adhered to, it makes the case for transition to the meat export trade even stronger and more urgent. I present a petition initiated by the Handle with Care coalition of animal welfare organisations, led by the World Society for the Protection of Animals, or WSPA, calling on the government to end the export of live animals for slaughter. The document presented by the member will be forwarded to the Petitions Committee for its consideration and will be accepted subject to confirmation by the committee that it conforms with standing orders. Landsborough Highway appointment upon discovering that this Rudd Labor government has completely ignored the Landsborough Highway. It is a national highway that runs through the Labor seat of Flynn and connects Kennedy and the seat of Maranoa. This Rudd Labor government has provided no funding for any major upgrades for the Landsborough Highway since coming to government three years ago. The forward estimates in the budget show that it is not intending to spend any money on this highway for at least five years, should it be re-elected. The Landsborough Highway runs for 1,000 kilometres, from Morven in southern Queensland up to Cloncurry. It forms part of a long route between Brisbane and Darwin. It is that vital link for the agricultural livestock industry. It is a vital link for the defence forces, transporting from northern Australia to southern Australia. It is a popular route for tourists and grey nomads. It will also play a key role in the development of the Galilee coal basin, the project that will support up to 5,000 jobs-that is, of course, if the project does not get stalled by this Rudd Labor government’s super profits tax. This is a road which will continue to play a vital role in transporting goods across the great expanse of Central Queensland and it is in desperate need of an upgrade. I drove the highway recently with my LNP colleague the Leader of the Nationals, Warren Truss. We crossed a bridge over the Barcoo River which is literally sagging, but it seems it is not a priority for this Rudd Labor government.

187,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (6.55 Pm),"I would like to begin by acknowledging the work of2001 in my electorate of Gilmore following the tragic death of a 15-year-old boy in a bus accident near Sussex Inlet on the South Coast of New South Wales. I stand in this House today experiencing a sense of deja vu which takes me back to August 2001 when my former colleague and friend Kay Elson, the then member for Forde, put up a private member’s business issue to this chamber calling for seatbelts to be fitted to all new school buses. She said: ‘If we do not, we will be having this same debate in five, 10 or 20 years. I just hate to think of whose sons, daughters and grandchildren will have to pay the ultimate price in the meantime.’ Regrettably, we are facing the same debate, and since then more than 24 families have paid the ultimate price and have lost loved ones in fatal bus accidents, including three school bus victims. Many hundreds more families are paying a lesser price, but are still suffering from the long-term effects of trauma and injuries sustained by the survivors of over 75 serious accidents involving 38 school buses. In the past the federal government left it to the states and territories to determine where route buses without seatbelts can be used. The New South Wales government took the National Risk Guidelines for School Bus Routes for endorsement to the Australian Transport Council meeting on 18 November 2005, supposedly to achieve uniform national standards for bus safety. In an act of gross hypocrisy by federal, state and territory ministers, these guidelines were made voluntary, and even if states and territories use them there is no required action, such as installing seatbelts, even on the most hazardous bus routes. This farce was just a stalling tactic, as in some states there have been no safety improvements. New South Wales, which took the proposal to the Australian Transport Council, have done nothing in four years since the guidelines were endorsed, and have not even released their classification of high-risk school bus routes, which were determined in January 2008. Following vigorous lobbying of both federal and state governments, the Howard government provided a funding subsidy of $40 million in 2007 under the Seatbelts for Kids program, to assist coach companies to fund the installation of seatbelts in school buses. We all felt relieved that this problem was going to be addressed. However, less than $2 million has been spent ever since the funding was made available. Only 79 school buses across Australia have been specially fitted with seatbelts. A few weeks ago in Perth 23 pupils were injured in an urban bus crash. The next day more pupils were reported injured in a school bus crash near Ipswich in Queensland. On 11 May two school buses collided in the Blue Mountains, in a 40 kilometre an hour zone. Even at that speed 40 pupils were injured. These are just some of the accidents reported. The incidence of school bus crashes has been amply demonstrated and accepted by governments at every level, yet governments are dragging their feet. It was hoped that a voluntary program supported by funding would be an adequate incentive to hasten fittings, but this is proving not to be the case. The Royal Australian College of Surgeons trauma committee, in response to the Australian Transport Council’s discussion document on bus safety said: Although we agree with the research that a serious casualty crash has a low probability of occurring, the probabilities should one occur of serious injury and mortality are extremely high. We would therefore predict a devastating bus crash as one of the most likely mass casualty events that could occur in Australia. MAIN COMMITTEE Evidence of the value of seatbelts reducing the incidence of injury has been amply demonstrated since Australia introduced the compulsory wearing of seatbelts in 1972. Can the minister explain why federally he enforces strict safety standards for coaches, as in Australian Design Rule 68/00, but allows state and territory governments to use any bus on any road without the same Australian Design Rule 68/00 safety standards? Is Minister Albanese aware that many buses used for country school bus runs and charter hire are still of the same fatally flawed design as those involved in the Kempsey and Grafton bus disasters in 1989 in which 55 people were killed? DOTARS claim that an Australian Design Rule cannot define where a bus can operate-that it is a state and territory government responsibility. Yet ADR 68/00 presently has an exemption for route service buses, therefore the exemption can be amended to mandate ADR 68/00 safety requirements for non-urban bus travel. This was the original intention, as per the regulation impact statement for ADR 68/00, ‘Occupant protection in buses’, which says: The proposed regulation is to provide improved occupant protection in buses and coaches other than city route buses by the fitting of three point seat belts to all passenger seats. This states the intention, but a poorly worded exemption has allowed state and territory governments to continue using unsafe buses with seats lower than one metre in height to be defined as ‘urban route service buses’ which are therefore allowed to operate anywhere, even on highly dangerous non-urban roads. I call on Minister Albanese to change the exemption so that the route service buses cannot operate outside urban and city areas without ADR 68/00 safety compliance. The transport minister can do more but refuses to, even though parents continue to lobby for his intervention to legislate changes to existing Australian Design Rule 68/00, which currently provides seatbelt safety legislation for coaches. ADR 68/00 coach compliance in 1995 has resulted in a fantastic safety record: no seatbelted coach passenger has died since. Hundreds of rural school buses travel on the same roads and highways as coaches, so why hasn’t the minister done anything about rectifying this anomaly where coach passengers have seatbelt protection but bus passengers do not? This is not just about school buses; any ordinary bus can travel on high speed Australian roads carrying passengers without seatbelt protection simply because the bus has low back seats-that is, less than one metre in height. This unsafe bus travel has caused many deaths and serious injuries to bus passengers in just the past eight years. The minister is aware of this and has done nothing to rectify these unsafe practices. A 1995 Federal Office of Road Safety report, Analysis of improving occupant protection in existing buses, conducted an analysis of bus crashes between 1987 and 1994, with estimates of injury reduction. They examined 18 non-urban bus accidents and overwhelmingly determined that fatalities, serious and minor injuries would have been reduced by almost half: 45 deaths instead of 95. Buses manufactured for urban use are being used for non-urban bus travel. This is highly dangerous and it is unacceptable that the minister can allow this unsafe practice to continue. As the percentage of non-urban school bus travel is approximately 15 per cent of total school bus travel, a threeto five-year compliance deadline is easily achievable and must be set with federal, state and territory government assistance. The cost to fix seatbelts has been exaggerated in government reports by including metropolitan urban buses. Upgrading non-urban rural buses to Australian Design Rule 68/00 safety standards is cost effective. MAIN COMMITTEE I call on the minister to amend Australian Design Rule 68/00 so that the only exemption is for route service buses operating on urban roads, by removing the current exemption for any bus with a seat height of less than one metre and by amending it to read, ‘All buses operating on non-urban roads and highways must meet the requirements in this rule, ensuring that lapsash seatbelt protection and all safety features within Design Rule 68/00 presently afforded to coach passengers apply to any bus travelling on any high-speed road, highway or dirt road’; and by calling on the state and territory governments to support mandating bus seatbelts. Further, I call on the government to legislate the amendments to ADR 68/00 by January 2011 and to ensure compliance with the amendments by school buses and all affected routes by 2020, beginning with all new and replacement buses. This gives ample lead time. I also ask that the federal transport minister place lap-sash seatbelts for non-urban bus travel on the agenda at each and every Australian Transport Council meeting until there is certification that all buses used on non-urban roads meet the safety standards within Australian Design Rule 68/00. It is clear from the snail’s pace of uptake that a voluntary code on this issue is not going to work; therefore, the only practical and responsible course of action is to mandate the installation of seatbelts on school buses, coupled with the withdrawal of funding assistance, by January 2020. I again thank the BUS Action Group for taking the time to travel all the way from Ulladulla to be here in the House tonight. Thank you, ladies. Ms SAFFIN (Page) (7.05 pm)-Firstly, I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Gilmore on bringing this matter before the House and giving it an airing. I do not have sufficient information or details about the operation of some of the technical aspects of the motion, particularly the Australian design rule that the honourable member talked about in the scheme, to commit, but I can certainly commit to the intent of her private member’s motion. I welcome the honourable member’s visitors from the bus action group who are in this place to hear this discussion tonight. You are most welcome. The honourable member for Gilmore said that governments have left it to the state and territory governments. I researched this issue today, but that is another area where I would need some particular information because I am not clear on who has the actual power. I think it is with the state and territory governments, but I will turn to that later when I mention some of the other actions that the states have done, particularly Western Australia, which I found in my research. I am not sure what legislative power, either formally or coercively, exists in this area. I am mindful when we discuss such issues to go gently in my speeches, but I realise that such issues also demand strong action to try to correct some areas. Families who have lost loved ones in bus and car accidents do listen to and read what we say in this place and it is never my intention at all to add inadvertently to anyone’s grief when we are talking about fatalities, particularly of children. I will try to stick to the facts in speaking about road safety, including for buses, which is what we are looking at tonight. My licence is endorsed for driving small buses up to a certain size as long as it is not for a commercial use. I used to drive them a lot with children, babies, a lot of women and some men. I was thinking of it recently because I was asked to do it again when people needed to get from A to B and they did not have transport. They knew I had that endorsement. When I used to do it it was a tremendous responsibility to have the safety of those people in my MAIN COMMITTEE hands, particularly the children. I have enormous respect for bus drivers who do this day in and day out, particularly driving over some of the roads in my area of country New South Wales which can be even more challenging. I am mindful of that. When I was asked recently to do it I did say yes because it looked like they would not be able to get from A to B-it transpired that I did not have to-but I was a bit apprehensive about it. I was thinking of the responsibility. I know some of the roads from having travelled in New South Wales. I remember once visiting a place where the school bus driver, a local woman, used to stop the bus because the bridge was unsafe. She got the kids to walk across the bridge before she drove across the bridge and put the kids back in the bus and continued on. We helped get the money to fix that bridge. It was so clear that that had to happen. I have campaigned on issues of safety over the years. One issue I particularly took up was the speed zones going past schools. I had a big fight, particularly with the Roads and Traffic Authority in that area. I fought tooth and nail. I know there are a lot of people who have fought on that particularly issue in different parts of New South Wales at different times. I first got involved in it when Wal Murray was the minister for roads at state level. As the honourable member for Gilmore said tonight, things go slowly, and too slowly when we are talking about the safety of kids. All of these areas have taken time trying to get the states and territories on board. I still think 40 kilometres per hour is too fast past schools, but I am not sure I will get it any lower. Mrs Gash-We just want seatbelts. ing. I had a look at some of the research before I came up here and looked particularly at children in buses. I do not have the information that the honourable member for Gilmore has, but I found that the issue of safety with children around schools is still primarily in the area of pedestrian safety. It does not mean that things do not happen in buses, because they clearly do. Road trauma is a major public health problem facing this country. We know that. Last year 1,509 people died on our roads-1,509 people too many-and 33,000 people were seriously injured. It is particularly heart breaking when it affects young people. Research and work around road safety in Australia has been going on for some 40 years. Despite the terrible rate of accidents we have, it has actually halved over that period, even with all the cars and buses we have on the road. That is due to tougher laws, better policing, improved driver training, better road design, extensive education campaigns, new vehicle technologies and, yes, seatbelts. Like a lot of members in this place, I was around when seatbelts were not the law. We used to drive without them and never thought about it. When they came in they clearly showed a correlation in the prevention of preventing deaths and serious injury. Decisions as to which type of bus is most suited for a particular service is regulated by state and territory governments. They have responsibility for the service regulation and the road rules. The fitting of seatbelts also rests with state and territory governments. In 2005 the Australian Transport Council approved the voluntary national guidelines for risk assessment of school bus routes that the honourable member raised tonight. That is what the state and territory governments use for assessing school bus routes. They are currently progressing their own arrangements. The honourable member wants that speeded up.

188,Ms Saffin,"I know, we do want seatbelts. That took years. We will have to keep lobbyIn my research I found a report from the Sunday Times from 11 February 2010-I am not sure if you saw it; this was in Western Australia. It said: EACH of the State’s school buses has now been fitted with seatbelts, Education Minister Liz Constable announced today. … … … “Western Australia is the first State in the nation to make seatbelts mandatory for buses used to transport public school students. I did not think it was mandated in any state or territory. I must admit that when I found that I was a little bit surprised. It probably gives some hope. I looked at South Australia and read some information. I do not have anything on New South Wales, but I do know it is not mandatory in our state. I know that but I do not have the details. The government of South Australia announced in 2006 that it would fit seatbelts to all new school buses-I am not sure about old school buses-and that private operators would be required to tender. This is similar to what happens in Queensland. The program introduced by the previous government, which the honourable member was a member of-was announced in September 2007. That program has prevailed and the government is supporting the program. (Time expired) the people of Ryan, as I have done in this place over the last nine years. I look forward to the honour of continuing to do so as the Independent member for the electorate of Ryan, following the election in the months ahead. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to my colleague Joanna Gash, the member for Gilmore, who has moved this motion concerning seatbelts in buses. It is an important motion. I speak to it on behalf of all those mums and dads, grandparents and, indeed, all the families and people of Ryan in three contexts. I speak on their behalf by saying that we should do something about seatbelts in buses, firstly, in the context of a father. I am the father of a 3½ year-old. My little 3½ year-old Ryan Andrew Johnson is the most precious thing to me on this planet. Of course, like all dads and, indeed, all parents, I think we would do anything for our children. We would lay down our lives for our children. That is the power of parental love. It is certainly so in my case. SoI speak first of all as a father. I speak to this motion secondly as a citizen of this country. Of course, in coming into this place, we wear a particular hat as members of the federal parliament representing the views and perspectives of our constituents, but we are still citizens of our country. The Prime Minister of this country is a member of the Australian Labor Party but, as I am a citizen and a taxpayer of this country, he is also my Prime Minister. SoI also speak to this motion as a citizen. I speak to this motion thirdly as a member of the parliament and as the people’s representative in Ryan. They are the three headings that I would like to address the motion of my colleague in the parliament the member for Gilmore and to very strongly commend it. I would also like to acknowledge and pay tribute to the supporters and friends in her electorate who have been waging this campaign for, as I understand it, many years. Seatbelts in buses is a very important thing to fight for. As I said, I am a father first of all. To me, having a child wearing a seatbelt on a bus makes eminent sense. It is clearly something that can add to the safety of my child and, indeed, to MAIN COMMITTEE",200,Private Members Business
189,Mr Johnson (Ryan) (7.15 Pm),"I am pleased to speak in the parliament on behalf of that of any child who is sitting on a bus. It makes sense that a child wearing a seatbelt on a school bus or on any bus for that matter is more likely to have their life preserved in the terrible situation of an accident or, at the very least, if they are injured, to be not so terribly injured as they might well be without wearing a seatbelt. We should all pay attention to this factor. The second context in which I speak to this motion is as a citizen of this country. Seatbelts in buses is one of the good things that I would like to see implemented throughout the country. My electorate of Ryan includes the western suburbs of Brisbane. It is essentially a metropolitan seat. However, it stretches to the far west of the city of Brisbane, which, for anyone who knows the western suburbs of Brisbane and the Ryan electorate, includes many dirt roads and schools that are far away from the city. It is a good 90 minutes drive from the centre of town to the very far flung corners of the Ryan electorate where there are schools and where there are school buses picking up kids and taking them to their homes. As a citizen of this country, I think it is an admirable thing to install seatbelts in the buses in metropolitan Brisbane as well as in the rural towns of our great country. The third context in which I speak is as a member of the parliament. I think these kinds of motions, these kinds of worthy issues, are there for all of us to come together on and to speak as one on in promoting these kinds of causes. These causes should not be political. These causes should not be partisan. These causes save lives. These are the kinds of causes that enhance the quality of our representation and the quality of our body politic. I want to end my remarks in this short presentation by paying tribute again to the member for Gilmore. She is one of the finest members of this parliament. In so doing, however, I also want to pay tribute to one of our former colleagues, Kay Elson, the former member for Forde. In a speech in this parliament on 20 August 2001, she initiated a motion to have seatbelts in buses in Queensland. I would like to end my remarks by paying tribute to her and saying that we will continue to pursue the cause of seatbelts in buses, because it makes eminent good sense. (Time expired) for Gilmore concerning seatbelts on buses. In so doing, I say ‘Good evening’ to our guests from the BUS Action Group from Ulladulla. The member for Ryan was quite right. On 20 August 2001 I stood in this place to support the then member for Forde on a motion with very similar sentiments to those outlined by the member for Gilmore. I do congratulate her on her motion and on the substance of the motion itself. I am really wondering what happened in that decade because, when I look at a number of the so-called state road safety websites, I am very surprised by how little comment there is supporting seatbelts on our buses, particularly those used to transport our schoolchildren. That is a great pity. I fully appreciate the argument of the industry when they say that this is a major cost factor, but new buses come with new standards and new requirements. Governments, both state and federal, are always raising the bar on the safety and technical requirements of these buses, so it should not be news that we would mandate that these buses contain seatbelts. One of the other issues is that, if you cannot allow more students on a bus than can be seated, that is going to have serious cost imposts. I appreciate the argument, but it must of course lead to questions not just of general safety but of sheer comfort for students on buses.

I know that I may get different responses today, but I do wonder whether they would actually change much in substance. One of the things they talked about was that the buses were uncomfortable-three and four to a seat. They even went on to say-and I think this brings out some of the issues here, not just for comfort but for safety as well-‘If we went to school from grade 1 to grade 12 on the bus, we would sit in uncomfortable positions of three to a seat for two hours a day, five days a week, 40 weeks a year for 12 years.’ This equals, according to their survey, 200 full days-that is, 24 hours-sitting cramped in a bus seat over a student’s school life. So they are uncomfortable and they feel unsafe because of the lack of comfort in the bus. WhatI found interesting, though, is that when they were surveyed back in 2001-and I am sorry this is so old-the one thing they split fifty-fifty on was whether they should have seatbelts. They were really concerned that they were uncomfortable and they were worried about behaviour on the bus. Behaviour, I would add, may be affected by whether they are wearing a seatbelt, quite frankly, because if they are wearing one they are at least fixed hopefully in a sculptured seat designed for them. That is a very important safety issue as well. But they were really concerned about behaviour more than anything. That does raise the whole issue of school buses, not just for seatbelts. I do support the advocacy of mandatory regulations for seatbelts. dance with standing order 41. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The member for Braddon will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. Second Reading Debate resumed from 22 February, on motion by Mr Kerr: That this bill be now read a second time. Commission Bill 2010 establishes the independent Parliamentary (Judicial Misbehaviour or Incapacity) Commission. The commission is designed to assist the parliament in the exercise of its constitutional responsibility if instances of alleged misbehaviour by or incapacity of any justice are referred to it by either this House or the Senate. The bill should be read together with the proposed standing order ‘Address for removal of federal justice’ published in my name in the Notice Paper. If the bill becomes an act it will be incumbent on the House and the Senate to adopt such procedures to ensure that the processes in this bill are not triggered for trivial reasons or without procedural fairness. Because the time for this debate is limited I will not repeat remarks I made when introducing the bill to the House on 22 February 2010. I would request that that speech be referred to as explaining this bill for the purposes of its interpretation as if it were incorporated in this second reading debate. Judicial independence is an essential bulwark against all excess of power. Yet, as the Chief Justice of the High Court has recently affirmed, the authority of the law and the legitimacy of the judiciary depend upon public confidence.

192,Mr Kerr (Denison) (7.25 Pm),"The Parliamentary (Judicial Misbehaviour or Incapacity)respond to instances of alleged serious wrongdoing by or incapacity of federal judges and magistrates we gamble with that confidence. The drafters of our Constitution protected the independence of each justice appointed under chapter 3 by guaranteeing them secure tenure-originally for life, now to the age of 70while authorising their removal for cause for proved misbehaviour or incapacity. Professor Blackshield observes that section 72 ‘has a double purpose: to ensure that no-one but parliament can remove a judge from office, but also to ensure that parliament can’. The exercise of that power requires the concurrence of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Sadly the Murphy affair more than 30 years ago demonstrated how singularly ill-equipped our parliamentary procedures were to discharge that weighty responsibility. We have made no improvements since then. For those who question why we must act when serious allegations against federal judicial office holders are rare and when no immediate allegation against a judge is in prospect there are two answers. The first is that the time to ensure the balance is right. In ensuring both fairness and rigour, when nothing controversial is on the horizon, we can be dispassionate and uninfluenced by partisan considerations. The second is that the number of federal justices appointed under chapter 3 has grown exponentially. Human nature being as it is, as the number of federal justices now exceeds those of many states, instances requiring the attention of the parliament will almost certainly arise. We should be ready for that and armed with a fair and just mechanisms that are known in advance both to the parliament and to the judge before any issue of controversy explodes. It is quite implausible that either the House or the Senate could deal with serious allegations against a justice without the assistance of a preliminary investigation of a body of the kind proposed by this measure. Parliament should not risk being again left to adopt ad hoc responses shaped in the heat of crisis. I refer members who desire a more comprehensive account of the rationale for this bill to an excellent paper by Tom Browne prepared as part of the Australian National Internships Program. That paper appends a comprehensive literature review. I thank the shadow Attorney-General, Senator George Brandis SC, who has worked with me to refine this legislation. It has been improved by his input. I understand he will sponsor the amended bill in the Senate after its passage through this place and has obtained the support of the opposition party to that end. It is sensible that a measure such as this will emerge as the product of the work of private members and senators who are also senior members of the bar rather than as a bill sponsored by the government. It makes it clear, if there was any suspicion, that this is not pursued by the executive to chasten the courts. I also express appreciation to my colleagues in the caucus who voted to allow me to introduce this bill as a private member. I thank the Attorney-General for making available to me the expertise of his department and the drafting skills of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel respectively to suggest and draft amendments to the bill to better ensure its consistency with other legislation. I thank the Clerk of the House and his officers for their assistance with the first draft of the bill. I thank the Greens and the Independents I have discussed this bill with for their acceptance of the necessity for it. I thank the Leader of the House and the Whips for recognising the importance of allowing time for this debate and its resolution. MAIN COMMITTEE Finally, I foreshadow that on the third reading I will be moving the agreed amendments standing in my name. An explanation of those amendments is included in the supplementary explanatory memorandum. I seek leave to table the supplementary explanatory memorandum and the ANIP paper that I referred to. Leave granted. tends to support this measure. Reference to my colleague in the other place, the shadow Attorney, was well taken and I thank the member for Denison for his cooperation with the opposition in the consideration of this matter. I listened very carefully to his remarks and it seemed to me the most important observation of his that it was a sensible measure that should emerge as the product of the work of private members and senators who are also senior members of the bar rather than a bill sponsored by the government and to make it clear if there was any suspicion that it was not pursued by the executive to chase in the courts. This is an unusual measure in that context but I think that well explains why the bill is coming forward in the way in which it is. The purpose is to fill a long standing gap in the constitutional provisions concerning the removal of judges for proven misbehaviour or incapacity under section 72(ii) of the Constitution. It has never been the case that there is a mechanism for establishing the veracity of allegations that might result in the conclusion of misbehaviour or incapacity. This bill is designed to fill that gap. It will establish a body to be known as the Parliamentary Judicial Misbehaviour or Incapacity Commission to hear serious complaints and make recommendations to the parliament, in other words to ensure that the relevant section of the Constitution is adhered to but on the basis of having the parliament having before it information which will enable it to come to a sensible conclusion. It was the case some time ago involving Mr Justice Murphy in the early 1980s that highlighted the need. I can well recall the consideration as to how the Senate was to obtain advice to assist it in reaching conclusions in relation to the allegations that were being made. Of course, our federal judiciary has expanded significantly in recent years. There are a large number of federal court judges, from the High Court to the Federal Court, the magistracy and the Family Court. There will probably be a military division shortly as well. When you look at the very large number of people involved it is surprising in a sense that these issues rarely arise. PerhapsI should say it is not surprising, because I think it reflects very highly on the quality of our judiciary. I can say as a former Attorney that matters of this sort were not raised with me about members of the judiciary when I was in that office. There is a matter that the member for Denison and I are familiar with but I do not think it went to incapacity or misbehaviour. I could vouch for the fact that we do have a situation in which it is rare that issues of this sort should arise, but I think the point has been made that if it is to arise it is better that a method has been already established rather than the parliament has to turn its mind afresh to establishing the question of how it is going to obtain the evidence. In other words, it will give clear guidance to assist the parliament in how to determine whether alleged misconduct is proven and therefore warrants the removal of a judicial officer. It is that absence of a known and transparent process that had the potential to undermine confidence both in the parliament and the judiciary if we had not addressed it.

The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Debate resumed, on motion by Mr Neville: That this House: (1) acknowledges the: (a) unquestionable bravery of 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (6RAR) at the Battle of Long Tan in Vietnam on 18 August 1966 and the singular heroism of units in the face of overwhelming enemy numbers, especially that of D Company; and (b) well deserved upgrade of a number of decorations: (i) Major Harry Smith (from Military Cross to Star of Gallantry, ie, Distinguished Service Order equivalent); (ii) Lieutenant Dave Sabben and Lieutenant Geoff Kendall (from Mentioned in Despatches to Medal for Gallantry, ie, Military Cross equivalent); and (c) strength of D Company 6RAR (as at 18 August 1966) which has the right to wear the former Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm Unit Citation Emblem; (2) deplores the loss of documentation which has deprived 12 other Australian combatants from receiving appropriate recognition; (3) calls on the Australian Government to convene a further inquiry to assess and document by eye witness reports, cross examination and other sources, the known courageous action of combatants on that day with particular reference to the 12 soldiers involved; and (4) seeks appropriate remedy, by way of award, to those unjustly treated. Bay. Lieutenant Colonel Harry Smith, who had been ill, was visited by seven of his colleagues-locals and visitors-who went up with him to lay wreaths on the cenotaph for Long Tan Day. There was nothing particularly spectacular about this, but, as those eight men stepped back from the cenotaph, the gathered crowd broke into loud and sustained applause. To me, they were emblematic of Australians who have for many years felt that many injustices in Vietnam have not been attended to. I want to talk about one of those instances tonight. It is 18 August 1966 in the partly deserted village of Long Tan, four kilometres east of the Australian base at Nui Dat. It is midafternoon; 11 Platoon is out on patrol with D Company 6RAR, and they engage the enemy. They kill one and the rest take flight. What they did not know, and nor did their commander, Lieutenant Colonel Harry Smith, the man at Hervey BayI spoke about, who was then Major Harry Smith, was that they had contacted the forward units of two and a half to three thousand Viet Cong and regional and North Vietnamese regulars. There were only 105 men in D Company, and they were engaging two and a half thousand. So the odds were over 20 to one.

195,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (7.36 Pm),"On 18 August 2008 I was at the cenotaph in HerveyVietnamese units came forward to see what was going on, a battle ensued and Major Smith had to send out 12 Platoon and 10 Platoon to try to get 11 Platoon back. Eventually, at about 6.10 pm, he got all his units together. Ten minutes earlier, a helicopter had dropped to them ammunition wrapped in blankets. Let me divert for a minute. Prior to this, support having been called for, A Company came forward with 10 APCs, seven of which were heading towards the battle. About a kilometre short of Long Tan they too met a group of Vietnamese of company strength. They took them on. One particular man whom I know in Bundaberg rolled off his APC. He and his machine gunner lay on the ground, then got up and went straight into the face of the enemy, firing at them as they went. When their ammunition ran out they went with bayonets. It was such a convincing assault that the company of Vietnamese withdrew-turned and ran, actually. Then they came on to the battle. By the time they got to the battle proper it had been completed. Major Harry Smith and his men-105 of them-took on wave after wave of battalion strength enemy who tried as they would to pierce the perimeter. Not once did they cross the Australian perimeter and, in fact, some of the battle occurred at the range of only 15 metres. While all this was going on, Harry Smith was directing the battle. He was on his belly in the filthy mud, with Captain Morrie Stanley, a New Zealand officer who was directing the fire from the 24 guns that were behind them. He directed fire into the rubber plantation at Long Tan, all 24 guns firing at once-3,500 shells-you can imagine the devastation that caused. The effect of all this was that the enemy eventually broke off the engagement at a quarter to seven that night. The 11th Platoon had already lost half its number, either wounded or killed in the initial encounter. So in effect you had 80 Australians taking that fight off. But as Harry Smith himself says, nine of the 12 men that he wanted recognised for that engagement and who have been denied that recognition, were right in the front line. Three of them came up with the APCs with A Company. Why do I feel so strongly about this? They were recommended for awards, and in fact two senior officers received DSOs. Harry Smith’s likely award, originally to be a DSO, was downgraded and he received the Military Cross. Two of his lieutenants, Sabben and Kendall, were downgraded to MIDs, and his 12 men that he recommended did not receive awards, including one who was killed in action. Unbelievable stuff. There was a review, as there is at the end of all conflicts-what is called the end-of-war review-and still these men’s awards were not upgraded. Again, what is even more disturbing is the fact that another review was held under Generals Abigail and Gower and Brigadier Warner in 2008. They restored Harry Smith’s award to the equivalent of a DSO, the Star of Gallantry, and the two lieutenants’ to the equivalent of the Military Cross, the Medal of Gallantry-but again, nothing for the 12 soldiers. There was a further review by a professor, a warrant officer who had not been in Vietnam and who had no Vietnam experience, and a former lieutenant colonel who had a staff posting in Vietnam. They again recommended against these awards. What had happened was that instead of those awards being kept for the end-of-war review, they were destroyed, and there is evidence that they were destroyed. But there is eyewitness evidence that these men acted with conspicuous bravery, and Harry Smith can tell you in intimate detail even today what each of them did. There is no justification at all for those men not receiving awards. MAIN COMMITTEE Madam Deputy Speaker, do you know that in the Vietnam War there were 726 awards, 61 going to private soldiers, and only 35 medals? In 1984 the Military Historical Society of Australia, in a paper on awards during the Vietnam War, said that the majority of awards were given to those people furthest from the action. What an absolute disgrace. I would like to go into more detail on this. I saw the reaction of fellow Australians at the cenotaph in 2008 at Hervey Bay. I know Harry Smith and his integrity. I know that these men fought with conspicuous gallantry and I am calling tonight for a further inquiry. I do not care what form it takes. Perhaps we should take it into the parliament and do it as a Senate inquiry. But this injustice cannot be allowed to continue and I will not rest until it is addressed. We go there on Long Tan Day, we put our hands on our hearts, we talk about the glories of what happened in Vietnam and yet we deny awards to 12 people who were seminal to the battle being won. It is a disgrace. (Time expired) Ms KING (Ballarat) (7.46 pm)-I rise today to speak on the motion of the member for Hinkler as someone who has a long standing interest in this issue. The Battle of Long Tan on 18 August 1966 is one of the legendary battles in our wartime history. The battle saw the 105strong Delta Company, 6th Battalion RAR, defeat the Vietcong force, estimated to be up to 2,500. The outcome was 254 Vietcong casualties, with some reports of up to 1,000 killed, and three enemies captured. Australia suffered 18 casualties with a further 24 soldiers wounded. It is difficult to comprehend how anyone in Delta Company survived a battle between 105with three New Zealanders there as well-on one side and up to 2,500 on the other. During the Vietnam War there was an understanding that a Vietcong attack on the Australian base at Nui Dat was imminent and the attack came on 17 August 1966 when the Vietcong attacked the Australian base by mortar and rocket. Bravo Company was sent out to patrol the suspected Vietcong base on the night of 17 August and were later relieved by Delta Company around midday on 18 August. Delta Company made contact with the Vietcong at 1540 hours when they were patrolling a rubber plantation in Long Tan. Following the initial contact, the Vietcong and Australian Army soldiers would be in direct contact with each other for many hours. During this time the soldiers were surrounded by enemy battalions firing mortars and automatic weapons. President LyndonB Johnson awarded D Company, 6RAR with the US Presidential Unit Citation and I read a brief extract from that: While searching for Viet Cong in a rubber plantation northeast of Ba Ria, Phuoc Tuy, Province, Republic of Vietnam, D Company met and immediately engaged in heavy contact. As the battle developed, it became apparent that the men of D Company were facing a numerically superior force. The platoons of D Company were surrounded and attacked on all sides by an estimated reinforced enemy battalion using automatic weapons, small arms and mortars. Fighting courageously against a well armed and determined foe, the men on D Company maintained their formations in a common perimeter defence and inflicted heavy casualties on the Viet Cong. The men of D Company still wear that Presidential Unit Citation. The issue of proper recognition of Long Tan veterans first came to my attention through representations from Bill ‘Yank’ Akell, one of my constituents. As I have said to him often, when he first came to tell me that instead of receiving the Republic of Vietnam’s Gallantry Cross with Palm Unit Citation he received a doll I thought he was joking. Mr Akell is one of the most humble men that I have met. He is a true gentleman who is softly spoken and he is a much loved member of our community. Mr Akell enlisted in the MAIN COMMITTEE Australian Army on 14 May 1964 and he was a member of the 105-strong Delta Company. As part of the battle, Mr Akell, a signaller, was tasked with rushing alone from company headquarters to 10th Platoon to deliver a spare radio set to platoon commander, Geoff Kendall. The 10th Platoon radio had gone off the air and it was vital that communication was restored between 10th Platoon and company headquarters. Mr Akell had heard that the 10th Platoon’s radio was out and on pure instinct knew that he had to resolve the matter urgently. He knew that without radio communication 10th Platoon was unable to request artillery or to update company headquarters with vital information. Situated in company headquarters, Mr Akell picked up a spare radio and ran blind looking for 10th Platoon. He weaved alone through the terrain in search of the platoon. He was alone in Long Tan under heavy enemy fire for over 10 to 15 minutes in search of his fellow soldiers. While in search of the platoon, Mr Akell made contact with two Vietcong soldiers who he subsequently killed. Finally, he reached the platoon. Mr Akell played a vital role in ensuring communication was resumed between the platoon and company headquarters. When you realise that Bill was just 19, it is pretty extraordinary. This is one of a number of stories from the Battle of Long Tan. Mr Akell and D Company were not evacuated until later that night. As a further sign of true courage, the battalion, lead by D Company, were assigned back into the area the very next day. Following the battle, the South Vietnamese government awarded those involved with a unit citation and singled out 20 individual soldiers who would receive various levels of the Vietnamese Gallantry Cross. Bill was one of those 20 soldiers. At the last minute the Australian ambassador intervened, with the citation and medals not being awarded. On the day these soldiers were set to receive recognition, they instead received cigar cases and dolls. I have spoke in this House about the Battle of Long Tan on a number of occasions. In particular in opposition I, alongside the then member for Cowan and the member for Brisbane, pursued the issue of the Palm Unit Citation and the awarding of military medals. I must admit to some disappointment that we had so little support at the time from the then government on the issue. I am certainly pleased to hear the member for Hinkler’s voice raised on this issue, albeit now from opposition. I am very proud to have been part of the actions of the Australian Labor Party on this issue, both in opposition and now in government. On 14 August the government announced that D Company 6RAR commander, Harry Smith, would be awarded the Star of Gallantry. We also announced that platoon commanders Dave Sabben and Geoff Kendall be offered the Medal for Gallantry. This announcement was in response to an independent review into unresolved issues of recognition. As part of this review we also announced the approval for soldiers in D Company 6RAR to wear the Republic of Vietnam’s Gallantry Cross with Palm Unit Citation Emblem-a decision that was contrary to the recommendations of the independent review panel. The Rudd government referred all unresolved concerns regarding individual awards for Long Tan to the newly established independent Defence Honours and Awards Appeal Tribunal-the tribunal we established at arms length from government to inquire independently into these and a number of other matters relating to military recognition. The establishment of the tribunal was a 2007 election commitment of this government. As a result of the tribunal’s inquiry, they recommended that Flight Lieutenant Cliff Dohle be awarded the Distinguished MAIN COMMITTEE Flying Cross and that Delta Company 6RAR be awarded the Unit Citation for Gallantry. The government accepted the recommendations of the tribunal. It took a change of government to resolve many of the issues regarding the recognition of D Company. I understand that for commander Harry Smith that recognition for those Australians who fought in the Battle of Long Tan is an outstanding issue. I certainly commend my constituent Bill Akell in his endeavours to support Harry Smith in his ongoing actions to seek recognition for those in Delta Company. This was a real battle, which has affected real people and their families. The Battle of Long Tan will always be remembered as one of the most significant engagements during the Vietnam War. It is of course not the only battle of Vietnam, but the bravery and courage of our Australian soldiers in such demanding circumstances will not be forgotten. I would like to finalise my comments on this motion with some words from Mr Akell. He states: If you believe it is just for a Government to send a military Unit off to war with restrictions in place to limit the number of decorations for bravery its members can be awarded, then you need to do nothing. But, if you believe that Colonel Smith’s 40 year fight for military justice for his men is due for a rightful conclusion, then I ask that you support this motion. While I respect that the government has taken the decision to accept the recommendations of the independent Defence Honours and Awards Appeal Tribunal and I understand the importance that this process be independent of government, I do on this occasion wholeheartedly support the motion by the member for Hinkler. contact with the enemy. In listening to the contributions by the member for Hinkler and the member for Ballarat on this battle of Long Tan motion, I will dispense with the notes I have prepared for this occasion and go from a deeper place. Harry Smith once said in an account of the battle, ‘I’ve little time for the politics, theories or criticisms which detract from the outstanding performance of my company and all the supporting forces involved in the battle.’ How true that really is. Long Tan was a victory, there is no doubt about it, against overwhelming odds. There will always be a little bit of doubt about the size of the enemy force but I think that it is pretty clear that about 1,500 or more was always going to be the sort of number that is correct. Indeed, at the end of the battle there was debate as to how many Vietnamese or Vietcong soldiers were actually killed. Yet the Americans later found evidence from Vietcong records that they found in the field that suggested that between 500 and 700 enemy soldiers were killed. I think it is a testament to the courage and bravery of the Australian soldiers, particularly these 105 Australians and the three members of the New Zealand forward observer party, that this turned out to be a victory. It was a victory not just for those on the ground, it was a victory for all those that were in the support roles. We know that some 3,000 rounds of artillery were called in from all the batteries that were back at Nui Dat, including the Americans, the New Zealanders and the Australians. So we know that was the case. We know the desperateness of the fight on the ground, the monsoon conditions, the mist that was rising from the ground, together with the accurate artillery fire and the RAAF being able to drop ammunition from the helicopters directly into the defensive perimeter of the company.

196,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (7.54 Pm),"We used to say in the Army that no plan survivesThere were a number of soldiers killed that afternoon, 18 of them. I will read into the record their names in commemoration of their supreme sacrifice for our nation: Private Richard Aldersea of Perth, Glenn Drabble of Brisbane, Ken Gant of Brisbane, Ernest Grant of Thurgoona, Vic Grice of Ballarat, James Houston of Wallsend, Jack Jewry of St Mary’s in New South Wales, Paul Large of Wellington, Private McCormack from Launceston, Dennis McCormack from Adelaide, Warren Mitchell from Dalby, Douglas Salverton from Brisbane, 2nd Lieutenant Gordon Sharp of Tamworth, David Thomas of Bendigo, Private Francis Topp of Toowoomba, Private Max Wales of Goondiwindi and Private Colin Whiston of Sydney. And from the APC squadron there was Corporal Peter Clements of Cunderdin in Western Australia. All these men were 19 to 22. These were very young men. Some of them were national servicemen, some were career soldiers within the Army. They paid a great sacrifice. But it was a victory, there was no doubt about it. The Vietcong suffered greatly from that day and they never really controlled Phuoc Tuy province after that. Yet this was a battalion that had only been established for 15 months. I think the only real tragedy with regard to this victory was the way the recognition of bravery and courage was undertaken afterwards. I found it incredible in reading through the records that we see the brigadier of the taskforce was given a Distinguished Service Order-a brigadier. There is no way he was out there with a rifle, he was up there at the base. There is even some question regarding the battalion commander. There are some records which say that battalion headquarters came out with the APCs but other records say otherwise. There are a lot of questions that still remain about this matter. I certainly support the member for Hinkler’s call for an inquiry. Maybe we should do something in this parliament to look into this with a lot of detail. It would be good to see this matter finally resolved. I know there has been great work to make sure that medals have been forthcoming but I think we need to search for the truth of this matter a little bit further. now expired.

Superannuation Debate resumed, on motion by Mr Champion: That this House: (1) supports the Government’s action to boost national savings by gradually increasing the Superannuation Guarantee from 9 per cent now, to reach 12 per cent by 2019-20; and (2) notes that the: (a) Government’s approach to superannuation will achieve two main outcomes-greater adequacy and greater equity; (b) removal of the tax penalties for superannuation contributions of low income earners; (c) reforms to superannuation will benefit around 8.4 million Australians; and (d) reforms will increase national savings and economic growth. superannuation. I have spoken on it many times before. Let me say at the outset that one of the things we are dealing with here is the legacy of former Prime Minister Paul Keating. He has spoken many times on this issue and on the need for greater national savings and greater MAIN COMMITTEE",210,Battle Of Long Tan

198,Mr Champion (Wakefield) (7.59 Pm),"It is a great pleasure to speak on the issue ofprovisions for retirement incomes for so many Australians. I think that it is worth acknowledging his role today. The government’s superannuation plans do four main things. Firstly, they deal with the great, if you like, international economic challenge-that is, the inadequate savings of developed economies. Secondly, they help to rebalance our economy, which I think is a critical thing. Thirdly, they increase retirement incomes for Australians. Fourthly, they increase fairness and equity in our community. On the issue of the economic and national savings, one of the critical problems is that in Anglo-Saxon economies there is a tendency to not save enough and to consume a lot. That is mirrored by the developing world’s tendency to save more than they consume. This has led to the sorts of economic problems we have seen in the United States, where debt fuelled consumption binges have led to asset bubbles and ultimately to those asset bubbles collapsing. One of the ways of avoiding that is to have a high national savings rate and to invest those national savings in productive investments, and that is exactly what superannuation does. The government superannuation plans add $85 billion to our superannuation savings over the next 10 years and an incredible $500 billion by 2035. That is an economic buttress against future shocks. That is a way of making sure that the nation’s economic bounty is invested in productive long-term investments. That is good for individuals and it is good for the economy. The second thing our superannuation plans do is rebalance the economy. This is terribly important. There are a lot of debates about foreign ownership-particularly about Chinese investment and other foreign investment in Australia. One of the things superannuation does is ensure that there are adequate domestic savings to invest in productive Australian assets and indeed to invest overseas. Foreign ownership is always a vexed question, but one of the causes of foreign ownership is that we do not save enough. It is absolutely critical that superannuation is there to increase savings. The third thing is increased retirement income. I have met many individuals who have had inadequate savings. For an employee aged about 30, on average weekly earnings, the government’s changes will add $108,000 on average to their superannuation. For a woman aged 30 today who has an interrupted work pattern-which is typical amongst women, particularly if they have children-it will add another $78,000 in superannuation. They are tremendously important figures, and people know the difference, when they come to retire, that having those extra savings will make. Overall, the superannuation savings of 3.5 million Australians on low incomes will be boosted by $830 million over the forward estimates. This brings me to my final point, which is that the government’s superannuation changes increase fairness and equity in our community. That is one of the most critically important things, I think. We have a problem not just with the distribution of wealth between rich and poor but also with the distribution through the time of life when you get to spend it. Typically, when you are working, you do tend to have enough money in your pocket to get by. Unfortunately, when you retire, you often do not. This is not just about redistributing wealth from rich to poor or from capital to labour, but also from a time in your life when you have an abundance of income to a time in your life when you do not. That is a critical point. It is important for fairness, it is important for economic efficiency, it is important to the country and we can only hope that the opposition sees the light and supports the government’s changes. MAIN COMMITTEE on the motion moved by the member for Wakefield. It is interesting to note that the government’s definition of adequacy is a percentage by which the government extracts from the pay of workers a sum on a mandatory basis. This government demonstrates through its actions in the economy and through its great big new tax on mining that Labor does not understand how superannuation adequacy depends on a strong and stable economy. Around 9.3 per cent of all superannuation accounts are invested in the Australian resources sector and since the great big new tax on mining was leaked to the media on 13 April over $20 billion has been stripped from mining investments of superannuation funds. This is a fact that the Rudd Labor government has been deliberately misleading the public on. On Friday the Treasurer came clean. He provided advice to Senator Ludwig that because of the great big new tax on mining, Labor’s great big new tax, there was a need to waste $38 million of taxpayers’ money on a propaganda campaign. The advice was: … the tax reforms involve changes to the value of some capital assets, they impact on financial markets. This contradicts the Prime Minister who told the House only on Thursday that the opposition and those in the private sector were ‘wrong, wrong, wrong’ for suggesting that Labor’s mining tax had any effect on financial markets and on superannuation balances. The member for Wakefield’s motion talks about the government’s approach to superannuation. This Labor government’s approach is to mislead and ignore any advice that contradicts their agenda unless and until it suits their purpose. To consider Labor’s approach to superannuation generally, I can refer to comments by the head of the government’s review into superannuation, Mr Jeremy Cooper, who was reported in the media today as saying: When you’re forced … to buy a product which is simultaneously complex and boring, it’s quite a rational thing to shrug your shoulders and walk away until you really need to pay attention. The government’s approach to superannuation has not been about asking workers and retirees to pay attention. If there is nothing to engage workers in their superannuation savings and encourage them to actively participate in their retirement, workers will still shrug their shoulders and walk away from engaging in super-a very important concept. The government would also be aware that the public are not even paying attention to their superannuation policy. But superannuants are paying attention to Labor’s great big new tax on mining. They are paying attention to how this tax is hurting their superannuation balances right here, right now-not in 2012 or 2014 or 2019, but here and now. Whilst both sides of the House want to increase the adequacy of superannuation levels, Labor has taken a very paternalistic approach. The government is not considering whether employees actually want to contribute an additional amount to their super balances. Instead, it is slugging businesses an additional three per cent on their payroll to pay for this increase. The former minister for superannuation, Senator Sherry, recognised this point when he promised before the 2007 election: We won’t be increasing the nine per cent superannuation guarantee for a number of reasons. I have said time and time again at many conferences to many people in the financial services sector, privately and publicly, that nine per cent is enough from the employer. It would be unfair to increase that nine per cent any further and we won’t not be doing it. ‘We won’t be doing it,’ were the words of the then the minister. MAIN COMMITTEE",211,Battle Of Long Tan
199,Mr Hartsuyker (Cowper) (8.04 Pm),"I certainly welcome the opportunity to speakThis also follows the Prime Minister’s comment before the election-and a lot of things have changed since ‘before the election’, I must say. On Radio 4BC the Prime Minister said that the government would not change superannuation laws, ‘not one jot, one tittle’. Well, with this track record, how can the public believe one word of what this government says about superannuation? The member’s motion is only Labor’s spin in an area of policy that has been marked by just about more backflips and more misrepresentations than any other issue in which this government has failed. As the Treasurer has now admitted, it is the economy and superannuation balances that are paying the costs for this government’s approach. The cost is neither adequate nor equitable, and the coalition does not support this motion. against superannuation could not even go for five minutes. I rise to speak in support of the motion put forward by the member for Wakefield and thank him for his strong commitment to the future prosperity of his electorate and of all Australians. It is people like the member for Wakefield who recognise that more needs to be done to ensure all Australians can enjoy a comfortable and economically secure retirement. The Labor Party has a proud record when it comes to mainstream access to superannuation. Put in place by the Hawke and Keating governments, the superannuation guarantee ensures that millions of Australians will retire with a sustainable retirement income. But more needs to be done to ensure that in the future more Australians benefit from these tough, historic reforms. As the Rudd government faces up to the reality of an ageing and growing population, now more than ever we need to ensure that as many workers as possible can retire without the need for pension support from the government. That is why the Rudd Labor government is from 1 July 2013 gradually increasing the superannuation guarantee contribution from nine per cent to 12 per cent, reaching 12 per cent on 1 July 2019-not that far away. Also from 1 July 2012 a superannuation contribution of up to $500 will be provided for workers with incomes up to $37,000, effectively refunding the contributions tax they pay on their superannuation guarantee contributions. This kind of investment demonstrates that the Rudd Labor government’s strong commitment to the long-term security and prosperity of working families is to be acknowledged rather than just picked at by those opposite without actually putting up an alternative when it comes to superannuation. You will not see the benefits at the ballot box in six months time or whenever the election is held, but when working Australians reach retirement age 20 and 30 years from now they will be far better off because of the tough decisions made now. In fact, a 30-year-old employee on average full-time weekly earnings will retire with $108,000 more in their retirement savings thanks to the Rudd government’s long-term improvements to superannuation. A 30-year-old woman-those who tend to have the interrupted employment-will be $78,000 better off in their retirement. But the coalition wants to rob ordinary Australians of fair superannuation for the future. When I am talking about super I am not talking about Clive Palmer’s retirement income, but the retirement incomes of ordinary Australians. That is who the government makes decisions for. The coalition stands against this government’s reforms to increase the superannuation guarantee and incentives for lower income earners and those nearing retirement age. The opposition leader and the coalition do not fundamentally believe in compulsory superannuation. MAIN COMMITTEE",213,Battle Of Long Tan
200,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (8.09 Pm),"It was amazing to hear that the shadow ministerIt was a Labor initiative back in the early nineties. You might well remember the sacrifices that workers made in forgoing wage increases to kick-start the process. Instead, the opposition would rather see Australians, even those on lower incomes, somehow save and invest for their own retirement. These changes are also good for our economy. In an age when we are saving less and less and putting more money on credit cards, superannuation, thankfully, is one way that we can ensure we do save the future. We have a record that is almost second to none throughout the world-certainly throughout the OECD-in saving with superannuation. By 2035 of the Rudd government’s boost to superannuation will deliver additional private savings of $35 billion per year and additional national savings of $19.5 billion. It will reduce age pension outlays by $3.5 billion a year. An extra $500 billion will be added to the pool of superannuation savings. The Rudd government is driving these reforms to boost retirement savings and deliver a fairer distribution of superannuation tax concessions. We want to ensure that more Australians can enjoy a comfortable retirement and help us prepare for an ageing population and the many challenges that that will present. We do not just make decisions for the short term, for the polls and for the electoral cycle; instead we need to make tough decisions for what happens over the horizon. These reforms ensure a strong and growing economy today to deliver the superannuation savings we need for the future and also, incidentally, help to build Australia’s record as a great manager of funds and attract funds from around the world. That was something that was laughed at during the election, but already we are seeing some great advances. I support this motion and once again thank the member for Wakefield for bringing this matter to the attention of the House. I hope that the superannuation guarantee contribution will be supported by the next speaker from those opposite. faced, first-time Labor MPs desperate to reconnect with their voter base while looking at Newspoll results. But let us be honest about this motion on superannuation and say that the measure of this government is not the fancy projections that its economists can generate for next 10 years. The measure of this administration is what it does this year for those working class families that it so often alludes to. The government has provided those families with a massive budget deficit-enormous government debt-that is getting worse, not better, and it will continue to do so next year and the year after. It is okay to prepare a budget that refers to 2014 but, honestly, what we are looking at is what is happening in this year. What we are looking at this year, of course, is uncontrolled spending. The best way a government can demonstrate its commitment to working Australians and their superannuation is to run a budget surplus. When a government runs a budget surplus it is empowered to offer greater superannuation contributions. The Rudd government is asking small business to pay the higher amounts while, at the same time, offering them miniscule tax cuts in 2013. I am definitely of the view that this administration will not be around to fill that promise. What happened to the days when governments talked about tax cuts sequentially, starting with the current year? If this administration has any form at all, it is for announcing changes for the years ahead but doing nothing in the current year. It is all well and good for the government to apologise to Indigenous Australians, but its fear of apologising for its own actions MAIN COMMITTEE",214,Battle Of Long Tan
201,Mr Laming (Bowman) (8.14 Pm),"Far be it from me to rain on the parade of ashenright now shows its true measure. What we have had from this government is rhetoric about national savings but conduct that has been the complete opposite to that. This government talks about national savings immediately before an election, but it has already engaged in the disproven exercise of writing $900 cheques to people in the hope of securing their support. The money is long gone that could have funded this superannuation increase, and now we are watching a government in demise and decline. It reminds me of those fabulous words, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, that I know you love just as much as I do: ‘Did they make you exchange your heroes for ghosts, your hot ashes for trees? Did they get you to exchange this hot air for a cool breeze?’ What we have seen in 2010 is a desperate pre-election struggle to reignite the class warfare for which that side of parliament is famous. It is picking on our own mining sector. It is using everyone’s taxes to fund its battle against Australia’s mining sector. It is a completely preformed and fabricated pre-election battle to feed into its own beliefs that anyone who has a little bit more in resources should be handing it over now to pay for its pre-election promises. I do not mind a government that looks five or 10 years ahead but the Rudd administration is simply unaccountable for what it does right now. That was no better exemplified than by the bizarre double twist with pike on election advertising. Mr Deputy Speaker, don’t you remember that waxy, polished, almost seductive face of the opposition leader in 2007 as he said: ‘You are all brothers. You are bearing witness to my words that there will be no pre-election advertising in the three months before an election.’ What do we do now in the final pre-rigor mortis struggle of that Prime Minister who will promise 10 years in advance anything on superannuation in a desperate move to retain his job? chair. The speaker needs to address the motion. broken election promise to another, but it is easy to do when you have a government that has done it 52 times. It is easy to stray from one broken promise to another because this is a desperate, scurrying government that is looking for anything to energise its voter base. The three young Turks speaking to this motion are exemplars of any promise to retain power. The Prime Minister has simply run out of ideas. He is quite happy to talk about the 12 per cent that he will never deliver. He will not be there to deliver it. He is simply there to make aspirational promises for 2019. Small businesses around this country have not fallen for the government’s tricky 2013 tax cuts because we are looking for a government that acts in 2010. We do not have one at the moment, but I hope we do by the end of this year when the day of the election comes and, with it, the day of reckoning for the Rudd administration. side would come forward and oppose this motion on superannuation by the member for Wakefield, oppose a motion that supports investment in the retirement savings of Australians? It is little wonder, because those on the other side have always opposed superannuation. They opposed superannuation when it was first introduced, because their view of the world is that the superannuation industry should have stayed the way it was 100 years ago when it was largely the preserve of the very wealthy-white collar-those that were associated with the financial sector and those in the Public Service.

204,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay) (8.19 Pm),"Is anyone really surprised that those on the otherWe on this side believe that one of the great moves towards a more egalitarian and fairer Australia was the shift that occurred with compulsory superannuation. It was a shift that was first championed by the trade union movement in the eighties and a shift that was reinforced by the first compulsory system introduced by the Keating government. The opposition opposed superannuation back then for all of the reasons that they now oppose an increase in the superannuation guarantee. ‘It will put too much pressure on business,’ they say. ‘It will put businesses out of business.’ These are all the same arguments that we heard once before, but had we allowed those on the other side to carry the day this country and the people of this country would be much worse off than they are. Superannuation has grown to become a $1.1 trillion industry. It is one of the key reasons we weathered the financial storm of the global financial crisis. The member for Bowman comes forward and mocks the cash payments. He would have to be the only personcash payments when all of the evidence, which is supported by economists all around the world, is that what was done here in Australia with the cash payments stimulated the economy and kept businesses moving. I invite the member for Dunkley to come and walk through the Penrith Plaza with me one day. Throughout the year that involved the stimulus payments, retail sales increased by 10 per cent in the Penrith Plaza. At a time when everywhere else in the world retail sales were in decline they were growing and they were growing because of the stimulus. But I do not want to be distracted by the member for Bowman. I pick him up on that point. I do not want to be distracted by his sideshow. I want to get back to the issue of superannuation. That is because, as I said earlier, those on the other side have always opposed it. There is no greater example of the strident opposition to superannuation of those on the other side than their very leader, the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition has had many positions on many issues. You have to have a look at his positions and determine whether each position was one articulated in the heat of the moment or one that was carefully crafted-the gospel truth. But I will take a comment in this place, something that is recorded in the Hansard, as being something that is a little more than a comment in the heat of the moment. On 25 September 1995, the member for Warringah came into this place and stated: Compulsory superannuation is one of the biggest con jobs ever foisted by government on the Australian people. Those are hardly the words of someone that is lukewarm in their opposition to superannuation. This is someone who has been a consistent warrior against securing the compulsory retirement savings of working people to ensure that they have a decent standard of living in their retirement. That is what superannuation is about. It is about ensuring that, after having worked all of one’s life, one can move into one’s declining years or halcyon days, whichever way you like to look at it, with some confidence that one will have some sense of comfort in retirement. That is what we are about. We want to deliver that sense of confidence to people-that they will be able to retire with a comfortable standard of living. That is what those on the other side continue to call ‘one of the great con jobs foisted on the Australian people’. It is not a con job.

206,Mr Bradbury,"that continues to scoff, as the member for Dunkley suggests, at thethat we are able to cope with the ageing population and secure adequate retirement savings for the people we represent. community in regard to the member for Wakefield’s motion before the parliament. It is a reminder of where we were before the election of the Howard government when then Prime Minister Keating used to run as to try to convince people that superannuation funds grew on trees. It is that kind of shallow, poor, economic logic that is really at the heart of the concerns many have about this increase in the superannuation guarantee levy. I, from my modest background in the community I represent, think superannuation is a good thing. It is a good thing particularly when it is a preparation for people’s retirement savings and when the people who are planning to retire actually have some say over it. At nine per cent, Australians are in a position to prepare for their retirement, and there is scope and opportunity to increase those contributions if that is a pathway they choose to go down. What is interesting about the Rudd Labor government’s approach is that they say to working Australians, ‘No, we won’t give you that choice. We will compel this contribution,’ and then they run two quite contradictory, narrow-cast messages to the Australian public about just who is paying. You have some in this place wanting to say it is money coming from the mining tax-to quote the Prime Minister’s words, ‘wrong, wrong, wrong.’ Employer superannuation contributions come from employers. They make those contributions and are compelled to make those contributions. The Rudd Labor plan is to force them to increase those contributions by three per cent, which is effectively a three per cent payroll tax on all Australian employers that employ people for whom they have a superannuation guarantee liability. The irony is that the Rudd Labor government and its hackneyed Labor members refuse to turn their minds to where these funds are coming from. You have-at times when it suits-the minister for finance and the Assistant Treasurer trying to make it sound like the government is stumping up the money when nothing could be more false. Nothing could be further from the truth. You then have them talking to a business audience saying, ‘It will be a trade-off for wages and salaries.’ Then when they go out and talk to working people it is, ‘No, no, it’ll be paid for by the employer.’ These narrow-cast, dishonest and completely incoherent messages that the Rudd Labor government puts out underline the fact that they have no policy credentials whatsoever on superannuation. The Rudd Labor government must have understood that this was important. Why else would it have sent out shadow ministers prior to the last election? In a joint press release on 5 November 2007 Nick Sherry and Wayne Swan, who were so emphatic about the need to reassure employers at a difficult economic time that they were not going to cop another three per cent payroll tax, said: ‘Labor has made it clear on many occasions that it will not be increasing employers’ nine per cent superannuation guarantee payments.’ Well what was the shelf life of that promise? It is another broken promise; the undertaking on 5 November 2007 has not lasted to this day. Then there were the Prime Minister’s famous words when the concern of the Australian public was that the Rudd Labor team would mess with superannuation. He sought to reassure people. Remember that famous quote about superannuation changes? ‘No, no, no. Not one jot, not one tittle.’ This shows you the completely bereft nature of this Rudd Labor team in terms of consistent and coherent policy development. They cannot fess up and face the fact about MAIN COMMITTEE",217,Battle Of Long Tan
207,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (8.24 Pm),"I am pleased to speak of behalf of many in thewho is paying. This is not money that grows on trees, as the Labor Party would have you believe. It is either coming out of the wages and salaries of employees or it is being paid for by employers. It cannot be anyone else; it is one of those two. If it is coming out of the wages and salaries of employees, then the Rudd Labor government needs to fess up to that fact and confront that simple truth that, at a time of increased cost of livinghaving expired, the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 8.28 pm to 8.40 pm Debate resumed from 24 May. That grievances be noted. Mining has for many years been the cinderella state when it comes to the mining industry. Much of the early infrastructure of the state was based on the super-rich copper mines of Burra and Moonta. Iron ore was first mined at Iron Knob during the last years of the 19th century, and steel making commenced in 1941 with the establishment of a blast furnace. The sixties saw the development of the Cooper Basin gas fields and, in the early eighties, the great experiment of Roxby Downs was established, destined to become one of the world’s great mines-at least, that was until the Rudd government announced a great big new tax on mining. There have been a considerable number of smaller mines which have had regional impacts without powering the Australian economy. The reason South Australia, representing around one-eighth of the land area of the nation, has not enjoyed the same success as New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland is largely to do with the geology. It is worth noting that, as the seat of Grey covers most of the land mass of the state, it stands to reason that most of the prospective growth is in my electorate. Apart from the major copper and iron ore bodies I have just referred to, our mineral deposits are not sticking out of the ground waiting for someone to trip over them. In fact, most of South Australia is covered by a layer of sand and sediment hundreds of feet thick which, until the advent of magnetic surveys, made those deposits invisible. The first of the big finds of the modern era was Olympic Dam, now known as Roxby Downs. With its usual insightful vision, the ALP fought its establishment tooth and nail, and it was once described by the South Australian Premier, Mike Rann, as a mirage in the desert. Major new mines have been established-Jacinth-Ambrosia by Iluka, Prominent Hill by OZ Minerals, the Challenger gold project and uranium mines at Beverley and Honeymoonand it seems we have just metaphorically scratched the surface. For many reasons these ore bodies are hard to find, which means they also present high-risk opportunities to the miner. Remote desert locations with no facilities at all, far from adequate ports, poor transport options and high development risks are not for the faint hearted. MAIN COMMITTEE",218,Battle Of Long Tan

209,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Dgh Adams),The question is:,219,Grievance Debate
210,Mr Ramsey (Grey) (8.40 Pm),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I have a grievance. South AustraliaThere are a string of prospective projects spread right across the electorate: coal to gas, copper, two new iron ore provinces, mineral sands and uranium, including the $20 billion plus expansion of Roxby Downs. We are on the cusp of great success, and now the Prime Minister and his Treasurer, Wayne Swan, have taken the low road to balancing their budget. Unable to control government spending, which has risen by 21 per cent in their three budgets, they have instead taken the low road and gone for a $9 billion a year tax on Australia’s most productive sector. Make no mistake: Kevin Rudd’s plan to slap a 40 per cent tax on mining profits threatens to derail the much anticipated expansion of the mining industry in South Australia and, of all South Australians, my constituents stand to lose the most. Every successive South Australian electoral redistribution has seen the seat of Grey extend further to the south because the population relative to the rest of the state has been progressively declining. Efficiencies in our traditional agricultural base have fuelled a drift to the cities. The loss of the shipbuilding industry and big reductions in the workforce at the steelworks in Whyalla, the reduction at the railway workshops in Port Augusta and efficiencies at the lead smelter in Port Pirie have all added to the relative loss of population. In effect, if you have no jobs, you have no people. The last 10 years have seen a reversal of fortunes as the mining industry has breathed new life into these communities and, in the case of Roxby Downs, actually created a new town. The mining industry is the industry offering hope to our Indigenous population. Mining companies have made significant investments in training, engaging and retaining an Indigenous workforce. Coober Pedy is anxiously awaiting announcements on the IMX Resources proposal nearby. The APY lands have encouraged exploration on some very prospective areas under their control, because they know that the only way their communities can make real advances is through their people getting jobs, and local jobs are the best of all. Mr Rudd’s great big new tax is a threat to all of this promise. Surely the government realises that you cannot just strip away profits and expect that all the sums will still add up the same. Every impediment you put in the way of development goes on top of the impediments that went before and makes possible approval that much harder. This tax will push every project that much closer to the point where it is not worth the investment risk. Every new project will now be seen through the filter of a new tax. BHP’s chief, Marius Kloppers, has said that it will be very difficult to approve the $20 billion-plus Roxby expansion under this tax. Failure to do so will be an enormous blow to South Australia and, in particular, my electorate. Other projects, including large iron ore deposits on Eyre Peninsula, coal to gas proposals in the north, uranium prospects, rare earth elements, and copper on Yorke Peninsula will all be assessed with a new bottom line. I cannot say whether individual projects will be abandoned or not. Even the proponents would not know at this stage. But I do know that some will be, and some is too many. Without this tax, South Australia should have been looking to increase its royalty regime. This tax will mean that, in the event that the Olympic Dam expansion goes ahead-and it must be said that that is far less likely now-then the state government will not be able to sit down with BHP and consider any changes, because from now on Canberra takes the lion’s share. The government proposes to take 40 per cent of company profits after they have already paid payroll taxes, wages, superannuation, WorkCover et cetera. The company will then have the opportunity to meet any interest on borrowings. What is left will then be subject to a MAIN COMMITTEE 28 per cent company tax, resulting in a combined tax rate of 57 per cent. The country with the next highest effective tax rate in the world is the US, at 40 per cent. Canada has taxes at 23 per cent. How on earth can the government believe that this will not damage the Australian economy? How do they believe that a competitive tax disadvantage of up to 34 per cent will not lead to a lessening of investment in Australia and an increase in investment in countries like Canada? How can they honestly believe that six per cent is an adequate return on risk capital? Why would anyone invest in a risky venture for the same interest they can get at the bank? Why is it that shareholders and millions of Australians, either directly or through their superannuation funds, are taxed on projects where they have taken all the risks, where they have made investment decisions based on the best available information at the time only to find that the government is prepared to change the rules midstream? The coalition have a long history of opposing retrospective legislation, as indeed we did in the recent youth allowance debate. The principle is the same here. Already we have seen a string of cancellations and deferrals from the mining industry, including Oz Minerals at Prominent Hill, and Incitec Pivot have announced that they are suspending their drilling program in Queensland. OneSteel, the biggest employer in Whyalla and the second biggest steelmaker in Australia, has issued a highly significant statement. It reads: Our USD 400+ million investment in Project Magnet to convert the Whyalla steelworks to magnetite iron ore and allow the commercialization of our hematite iron ore reserves was based on an assessment of risk and reward at the time, including the tax system in place in Australia. To apply such a substantial change to the tax rules retrospectively is unfair to OneSteel and its shareholders and seriously damages Australia’s attractiveness as an investment destination. As presently proposed, the Resource Super Profits Tax will apply equally to resources sold and those consumed internally as feed to the Whyalla steelworks. This will require OneSteel to absorb a large new cost, placing the business at a significant disadvantage against its import competition. The reason the steelworks is located at Whyalla is its close proximity to low cost iron ore, and this continues to represent a key driver of the cost competitiveness of those facilities. The Resource Super Profits Tax fundamentally changes the economics of the Whyalla steelworks and threatens the viability and, hence longevity, of our steel businesses. The statement goes on to say that the six per cent threshold is simply not an attractive level of return for investors and will severely inhibit the company reinvesting in the industry. The threat to the viability of OneSteel is a threat to the future of Whyalla and the 22,000 people who live there and rely on it either directly or indirectly for their employment. This tax grab is ill conceived, a grab for easy money to plug an enormous budget black hole caused by a government which has no self-control, has enormous cost overruns because it cannot manage projects and is incapable of telling the electorate the truth. The tax threatens the very industry that has carried Australia through the global financial crisis and has a slow-burn element. Investment will not dry up tomorrow. Projects started will finish. Old mines will continue to produce. But, in the longer term, Australians will wonder how we allowed our opportunities to pass us by and wonder why this industry has not reproduced itself as current investment runs down. MAIN COMMITTEE Disability Services Ms ANNETTE ELLIS (Canberra) (8.50 pm)-I want to take the time. I have tonight to talk about the issue of disability-the issues for those living with disability, those who care for them, those who work with them and those who support them in their daily lives. We in this place all know, I am sure, that the challenges faced by people living with a disability or chronic illness are many, but I also have to say that the rewards for them can be simply wonderful if all of the support mechanisms are put in place that allow them to lead the sorts of lives that they would want for themselves. One of the many aspects of living with a disability or chronic illness that continue to occupy my mind is the question of accommodation options. For example, what options are there when a young adult living with a disability decides that they would like to live independently? I use that word ‘independently’ advisedly, as it can mean many things to many people. It can refer to someone planning to move out of home and live independent of their family or it can mean independently on their own, in another place altogether. It can mean living with a friend or a partner. There are many interpretations that we can put on it, but the main point to make is that, when a young adult in these circumstances decides it is time to live independently, what are their options? I would like to refer to two examples I am aware of in my own community. One of them is up and running and one is very much in very early planning stages. BeforeI get to that detail, I would just like to say a couple of things about this particular issue. I realise there are many and varied opinions both within the disability sector itself and more broadly in the community about what independent living means for people with a disability. Time will not allow me to go too deeply into this part of the discussion. However, I will risk saying this much: in my opinion it really should be the choice of the individual themselves, possibly with their family or friends as well, as to what sort of accommodation they would like. After all, those of us not living with a disability are able to make that sort of choice. So why can’t people with a disability make that choice as well? I referred to the variety of opinions out there in both the disability sector and in the broader community. Some people’s opinion is that if there are more than five or six, seven or eight or 10 people living communally, for want of a better word, it will somehow lead to an institutionalised view of the world. Others believe that a gathering of 20 might be unhealthy. Some people even have the view that a group house of four is not the optimal choice. From my years of work and my experience of interacting with people with disabilities, I have to say that I cannot accept any other argument than that the choice should be theirs. It has to suit their circumstances and their needs and their wishes, and we should allow that process to occur as openly as we can. I go back to the local cases of living with disability in my community and briefly talk about them. The first one is a facility-and I am using that word carefully; a house, in other words-that has been developed here in the suburb of Curtin. It is called Abbeyfield Curtin because it is modelled on the Abbeyfield model. Abbeyfield comes from the UK originally and is a housing model that was devised for people aged about 55 or over who, for one reason or another, could not or decided not to live on their own any longer. They do not have any enormous great need, they are not necessarily ill or frail-in fact, far from it-but they wish to have a communal life. We have three or four Abbeyfield houses in Canberra. They are also MAIN COMMITTEE found in other parts of the country and in other parts of the world. The ones I have seen here in Canberra house around 10 people in quite independent circumstances within a very large, normal-looking house-from the road-with a parent or in this case a housekeeper, and they are very successful. Abbeyfield picked up the call from parents and families of young adults with intellectual disability here in Canberra who were desperately seeking some form of accommodation for their young adult children. To cut a very long seven-year story very short, Abbeyfield Curtin ended up being the first Abbeyfield house for disability in the world. It is now hopefully being copied in other parts of the country. I know that, after Abbeyfield Curtin opened here a couple of years ago, there were many inquiries from people in many different parts of this region and interstate who wanted to know how they had done it and how it was working. I am glad to report to the House that, to all intents and purposes, my information is that it is working extremely well. These young people have the benefit of a small community in which they are living, they are self-supporting and supporting each other and they go out together or independently. It is working extremely well. The other example I talk about is far more embryonic in its development. We call it the CLP or Community Living Project, and as the local member here I have been very pleased to assist with a range of meetings for nearly two years now for the CLP. This is a group of parents again of children of all ages who have disabilities such as severe autism and other types of disabilities and who are desperately seeking to know that in the future their children will have somewhere to live. The CLP is at the moment going through an exhaustive process, as these things do, to try to examine different ways and different models that they could seriously consider for future housing needs for their children. Again, there are opinions in the community about whether the CLP is striking the right chord or not. In my opinion, the CLP people and the children are the ones that should be making those decisions. They are the ones who know what they need and they are the ones who should be able to exercise those options. The CLP is only a couple of years old. I am really pleased to have the association that I do with it. I am hoping that over the coming months and years they will get to the point where they have a distinctive model they can take to government, both federal and local, to try and see whether something more can be developed from it. Advances have been made in recent years and attempts by government and community continue to try to address the whole question of living with disability. The impact of living with disability on the individual person, their family and friends, their carers, their employment possibilities and their lifestyle choices is enormous. It has ramifications right around the whole of that person and everybody associated with them. We can never do enough to understand the needs of these folk. I applaud always any efforts that go into this sort of work. We are all aware that the federal government has asked the Productivity Commission to investigate the idea of a national disability insurance scheme. I am Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family, Community, Housing and Youth and the chamber would be aware of an inquiry report that we tabled in the House in May last year on carerswho the carers are, the sorts of decisions they are making and the impacts that are happening in the lives of carers. It was through that inquiry that we became aware of the early stages of the work being done, particularly in this case by Bruce Bonyhady from Yooralla in Victoria, to try and get the debate moving on a national disability insurance scheme. MAIN COMMITTEE The importance of this work by the Productivity Commission cannot be overstated. There are thousands and thousands and thousands of Australians who will be looking to this Productivity Commission inquiry with an enormous level of interest. I am hoping that that inquiry is going to come down with some findings that give us as government and as community the best clue we could ever get, the best direction we could ever get, as to how to work into the future to address the needs of people living with disability and chronic illness. Everything that has been done so far has worked to a degree, but nothing has been sufficient to begin to address it. So let us hope that the Productivity Commission can do the work that we are expecting of it and that we will benefit from it. (Time expired) Vietnam: Human Rights Buddha’s birthday celebration, at the Pho Quang Monastery in Marangaroo. I have appreciated the opportunity to participate in this celebration on two previous occasions and I thank the Venerable Thich Phuoc Nhon for his kind invitation. The Venerable Thich Phuoc Nhon is both the President of the Congregation of Vietnamese Buddhists in Western Australia and the Representative of the Overseas Office of the Congregation of Vietnamese Buddhists. I worked closely with the Venerable Thich Phuoc Nhon to assist Vietnamese Buddhists from America to obtain visitor visas to Australia earlier this year. I would also like to thank Thich Nu Bao Son, the Abbott of the Pho Quang Monastery, and the manager of the monastery, Thich Nu Huu Tinh, for allowing me to participate. I appreciated the opportunity to speak during the service and for the very kind introduction and thanks from Mr Thap Kim Tran, and the short notice but very well performed translation of my speech undertaken by Mrs Thuan Nicholls. When I spoke to the members of the Vietnamese Buddhist congregation, I spoke of Vesak, representing the birth of Gautama Buddha and his enlightenment and his passing. AlthoughI am a Christian, I know that all Buddhists are inspired by Buddha’s example and seek to live their lives faithful to him. But I also see in Buddhism examples that inspire people around the whole world. I say this because, in the leader of the Free Buddhist Church in Vietnam, the Most Venerable Thich Quang Do, we have a courageous world leader. We have a Vietnamese man who has faced adversity and suffered throughout his life, and yet he remains resolute in the cause of freedom. It was therefore without any hesitation that I wrote to the Nobel committee to nominate Thich Quang Do for a Nobel Peace Prize for 2010. As I have said on many occasions in this parliament, there are many ordinary Vietnamese people that continue to protest for democracy, religious freedom and freedom of speech. The risk for Vietnamese people who protest in Vietnam is very great; they face imprisonment, torture and the seizure of property, or worse. There families also suffer through loss of income and other forms of persecution. Those who do fight this fight do so at great risk, and their courage is remarkable. I said on Vesak Day that it is a time when we can appreciate the bravery of the Vietnamese people, whether they be Buddhist or of another religion. I think that this is what we should do. I believe that this is particularly important and relevant because when Buddha was born he was given the name Siddhartha, meaning ‘he who achieves his aim’. From his name, for all those who have an aim, we can all derive strength and a willingness to pursue all that is good MAIN COMMITTEE",219,Grievance Debate
211,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (9.00 Pm),"On SundayI attended the 2,654th Vesak Day, orin the world, including causes such as the freedom of religion, freedom of speech and democracy. I would like to take this opportunity to speak of some more recent events that have taken place concerning the ongoing struggle for freedom, democracy and freedom of religion in Vietnam. In the last two weeks, lawyer Nguyen Bac Truyen was released after three and a half years in prison. He had been arrested in Saigon on November 2006 and sentenced to three and a half years jail, solely for his participation in an opposition political party, the People’s Democratic Party, which is committed to freedom, democracy and human rights in Vietnam. While it is good news in the case of Nguyen Bac Truyen, other members of the People’s Democratic Party have been imprisoned, including Dr Le Nguyen Sang, attorney Tran Quoc Hien and Mr Doan Van Dien. Still serving a house-arrest sentence are Mrs Tran Thi Le Hong and journalist Huynh Nguyen Dao. Medical doctor and democracy activist Le Nguyen Sang was arrested on 15 August 2006 with three other leaders-American citizen Do Thanh Cong, Nguyen Bac Truyen and Huynh Nguyen Dao-of the People’s Democratic Party. He was accused of committing acts of ‘terrorism’ for publishing articles ‘hostile to the regime’ on the internet. He is serving a four-year sentence. Tran Quoc Hien was chosen as the spokesperson for the United Workers-Farmers Organisation in January 2007. He was arrested two days later. A human rights lawyer, known for defending farmers whose land has been confiscated by the government, Tran Quoc Hien is also a prolific cyber dissenter. He has published online articles and short stories about life under surveillance. The Vietnamese government allege that Tran Quoc Hien and his associates incited demonstrations and ‘spread anti-government propaganda’. He is serving a five-year sentence. Those familiar with the issues in Vietnam would know that the digital media in the form of websites and blogging are used effectively by the democracy activists. It was recently reported that hackers from inside Vietnam attacked and crashed pro-democracy websites and have been using malware to monitor activists. The implication is apparent that the Communist Party of Vietnam’s government is responsible for these attacks. The Communist Party should, of course, understand that the cause of democracy will not be halted by such attacks. It is worth remembering that within Vietnam there are many pro-democracy advocates still being detained, including teacher Vu Hung; writers, Nguyen Xuan Nghia and Tran Khai Thanh Thuy; Ms Pham Thanh Nghien; Mr Ngo Quynh; attorney Le Cong Dinh; Mr Tran Anh Kim; Nguyen Tien Trung; Tran Huynh Duy Thuc; and Le Thang Long. These and many others faced baseless accusations and arbitrary detentions. Ngo Quynh participated in student protests supporting Vietnamese territorial sovereignty. He was arrested and beaten during the Olympic torch relay on 29 April 2008 when he tried to join a peaceful demonstration in Hanoi. On 28 June 2008, after visiting democracy activist Vi Duc Hoi, Ngo Quynh and fellow democracy activist Pham Van Troi faced physical abuse and public denunciation. They were beaten and subjected to psychological harassment by an organised group of approximately 300 Communist Party members and then taken to the police station for interrogation. On 10 September 2008 Ngo was arrested and detained until his trial and sentence on 9 October 2009 in Haiphong. MAIN COMMITTEE What these few references to individual activists shows is that there are some key issues in Vietnam. This is, of course, a central issue of democracy: the right of people to determine their own future. There is a big difference between now and that sort of future. The aim is for a Vietnam where Vietnamese people can speak freely and where the government is accountable to the people and not where the people are accountable to the government. There is, of course, also the issue of the freedom to practise one’s religion without being hindered or persecuted by the government. This is also a matter of great importance to the Vietnamese people. There is also the issue of the freedom of speech so that citizens have the right to be critical of the government without fear of harassment as a result of that criticism. It is in regard to this issue that we have seen in recent years much activity from Vietnamese people concerned for the interests of the nation. I refer to the bauxite mines in the highlands and the 1958 relinquishing of Vietnamese claims on various islands in the South China Sea. In both these matters it is a strong view of Vietnamese activists that the Vietnamese government has sold out to China. Indeed, these are seen as matters of national interest, and the concern is that the Communist Party officials are the beneficiaries of benefits from the Chinese at the cost of the national interest of Vietnam. The activists are highly concerned about the environmental damage being done by the bauxite mines and that the national and local interests have come second to the Communist Party’s agenda. In particular, the mining activity has displaced local coffee and tea farmers and has also resulted in toxic waste red mud, a by-product of the refinement of bauxite. It is notable that another strong critic of the mining activities, the famous general Vo Nguyen Giap, has cited the results of a 1980 study which predicted great ecological damage would result. It is apparent that the pro-democracy and national interest activists see the alignment of the government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam with China as of great concern and symptomatic of the failures of a non-democratically elected government. It is also notable that many of the activists that were arrested and detained in 2008 were seized in connection with protests against the passage of the Olympic torch before the Beijing Olympics, further suggesting that the close alignment of the Communist Party government in Vietnam with China is in fact distancing itself from the Vietnamese people. When we think of activists and protesters for democracy, freedom of speech and freedom of religion in Vietnam, we often think of high-profile leaders such as Thich Quang Do, Patriarch of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, or we think of Father Ly, the famous Catholic priest. Although these are two men who have suffered terribly for their cause, we should also think of those men and women who do not have the same profile but fight on as bloggers or by using other forms of non-violent protest. I have mentioned some of them already, but there are many more, and their families as well, that are never immune to the outcomes of an oppressive government such as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. To conclude in the same way I began, I say that Buddha was born with the name Siddhartha, meaning ‘he who achieves his aim’. There are many Vietnamese who have an aim of a better future, a democratic future for their nation. They can derive strength and a willingness to pursue all that is good in the world, including causes such as freedom of religion, freedom of speech and democracy. I hope that the Vietnamese people both in Vietnam and around the world achieve their aim for their homeland as soon as possible. MAIN COMMITTEE Lindsay Electorate: Cumberland Plain Woodland hectare parcel of land that spans the Penrith and Blacktown local government areas. The site is significant for its vast tracts of endangered Cumberland Plain woodland. It is also significant because over the next decade it will deliver more than 3½ thousand of the new homes required to meet the demand for housing in Western Sydney. The site has had a long and controversial history and has been the subject of much debate within the community. The former ADI site is surrounded by residential and industrial development. It began as a scattered collection of privately held parcels of land, where parts of the site were variously used for a range of agricultural purposes including grazing. In the early 1940s the site was consolidated and resumed by the Commonwealth for use as a munitions factory. The site continued serving this purpose for almost 50 years until, in 1993, ADI Ltd indicated that it would seek to redevelop the site for housing. In 1994, the Commonwealth, who owned the site through ADI Ltd and subsequently ComLand, established a joint venture with the developers Lend Lease. The Commonwealth continued to own the site through ComLand until it was sold by the Howard government to Lend Lease in 2004 for $165 million. The prevalence of Cumberland Plain woodland on the site saw a number of assessments of the significance of the bushland during the 1990s, culminating in the listing of 828 hectares, or more than 55 per cent of the site, on the Register of the National Estate by the then Australian Heritage Commission in October 1999. However, Sydney Regional Environment Plan No. 30, St Marys, only zoned 630 hectares of the site for preservation in a regional park, including 74 hectares of land not listed on the register, leaving some heritage listed areas unprotected. In 1997, Penrith City Council resolved to support the conservation of the entire site. The intention was to access Natural Heritage Trust funding and Federation Fund contributions from the Commonwealth government to retain the entire site in public ownership. However, the Federation Fund application was rejected in 1999. In 2000, the then minister for the environment, Senator Robert Hill, confirmed that the Howard government was seeking a development outcome on the site. This led to the council changing its position to pursue the more realistic objective of preservation of the heritage listed lands rather than the entire site. In 1999 I was elected to the Penrith City Council and, between September 2000 and September 2001, served my first term as mayor. As mayor I campaigned to secure the conservation of all the heritage listed areas of the site. I continued this campaign as the Labor candidate for the seat of Lindsay at the 2001 federal election. During the election campaign, the ADI Residents Action Group, who had formed in the 1990s when redevelopment of the site had first been mooted, stepped up their attempts to have the entire site preserved as a regional park. They also formed a Save the ADI Site Party to run a candidate at the election. The combined pressure that was brought to bear in a concerted community campaign of which I was proud to be a part led to the Howard government backing down and preserving all of the heritage listed land. This was later ratified in amendments to SREP No. 30, creating a 900-hectare regional park. This backdown came after the then member for Lindsay, Jackie Kelly, had spent the previous five years refusing to accept responsibility, dismissing the site’s future as a state matter, despite the fact that the site was owned by the Commonwealth government right throughout this period. In 2002, the Howard government provided its approval MAIN COMMITTEE",224,Grievance Debate
212,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay) (9.10 Pm),"The former ADI site at St Marys is a 1,540for the development by certifying an environmental assessment under the Environmental Reform (Consequential Provisions) Act 1999. During the 2004 federal election, Ms Kelly promised more than $1 million for a verminproof fence on the ADI site, but following her election neither the funding nor the fence materialised. Following my own election in 2007 and upon making some investigations into Ms Kelly’s commitment on the fence, no trace of this funding could be found in any government budget or program. The vermin-proof fence was yet another example of the cynical way in which Ms Kelly and the Howard government sought to manipulate this important local issue. Between 2004 and 2009, the redevelopment of the former ADI site progressed. Today, the redevelopment of the eastern, central and western precincts has already begun, with the 900hectare regional park at its centre. In 2004, Blacktown City Council approved the development of the eastern precinct of the site, which is now known as Ropes Crossing. It is already home to more than 740 people, with 510 housing lots sold. The Ropes Crossing Public School already has 60 students. In February 2009, the final amendments to the SREP 30 were gazetted by the New South Wales state government, allowing the western and central precincts to be developed. Those precinct plans were approved by Penrith City Council in March 2009. The western precinct, which will be developed first, has been renamed Jordan Springs. I understand that the majority of the first available lots have already been sold off the plan, and the first residents will move into their new homes in mid-2011. There is almost 70 hectares of employment land throughout the development, which is expected to create 5,300 jobs. The history of the ADI site is a case study in the struggle to find balance in a growing community. Striking a balance between managing the growth of our urban spaces and conserving our natural heritage is one of the biggest challenges that communities face right around the country. It is an even more pressing concern in growing outer-suburban communities like mine. Population growth brings with it the benefits of critical mass, greater demand for goods and services and the flow-on effects of more employment opportunities and greater wealth. However, population growth also brings with it a number of challenges that need to be appropriately managed. These include ensuring that people have somewhere to live and that the provision of housing is affordable and accessible; that supporting infrastructure like schools, hospitals, roads, transport links and sporting fields are provided in a timely fashion; and that our natural heritage is preserved and managed so that our future generations are able to enjoy it and participate in its ongoing conservation. Addressing these challenges is my focus. The time for saving the entire ADI site passed some years ago. With the site no longer in Commonwealth ownership and a legally valid approval for development issued eight years ago, the Commonwealth has no legal capacity to intervene in the development of the former ADI site. The Commonwealth is unable to ‘call in’ the development for a reassessment under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 as long as the activity on the site is consistent with the original approval. Even if the Cumberland Plain woodland was listed as a critical habitat, the Commonwealth has no penalty provisions available to it under the EPBC Act as the land is no longer in Commonwealth ownership. But there is more to our local natural heritage than just the former ADI site, and I have continued to campaign for balanced environmental outcomes in Western Sydney that also develop MAIN COMMITTEE the infrastructure and new homes that my community needs. I was proud to have delivered on my commitment at the last election for a $15 million Cumberland Conservation Corridor fund. That $15 million was used to return into public ownership and dedicate as a nature reserve the former Airservices Australia site at Cranebrook, which was sold by the Howard government in 2004 to a private developer without any community consultation. The site had been recognised as one of the sites of highest priority for conservation in Western Sydney. As part of the same election commitment, the Rudd government also ensured that the significant stands of Cumberland Plain woodland on Commonwealth owned land at Orchard Hills and Shane’s Park, which form a corridor with the regional park on the former ADI site, are protected under the EPBC Act. This government has also delivered more than $4 million under the Housing Affordability Fund to bring forward the widening of the Northern Road from Andrews Road to just north of Sherringham Road. Delfin Lend Lease are obliged to deliver this important piece of infrastructure under their development agreement, but without the HAF grant the road widening would not have occurred for at least another five years. My commitment at the last election to deliver traffic lights at the black-spot intersection of Sherringham Road and the Northern Road will be rolled into these works, meaning that existing residents of Cranebrook and the new residents of Jordan Springs will have access to a higher capacity, safer arterial road five years earlier than they otherwise would have. I am advised that Delfin Lend Lease will begin the works in the second half of this year. By offsetting the costs of delivering the road upgrade, the HAF grant allows Delfin to pass on these savings to first home buyers, providing 250 lots in Jordan Springs that will be $20,000 cheaper and improving housing affordability. I am proud to have been a part of the fight to save the most environmentally significant areas of the ADI site and to be continuing to help deliver greater bushland conservation, greater housing affordability and better infrastructure for my local community. Rudd Government personally understand the word ‘disappointment’ from a political perspective because we share that. I also know that when a child is holding an ice-cream in a cone-he has been waiting for it; he has gone into the shop with his parents; he has walked up; he has received the ice-cream; he has walked out of the shop; he has licked it for the first time-and then, plop, it falls on the ground, that is serious disappointment. I was told by Kelly Sexton, who works with Petro Georgiou, that her brother did exactly that when he was three, but it was worse. He not only dropped the ice-cream but he then stood up and slipped over in it. Kelly, as a young girl, thought it was very funny. You can imagine her three-year-old brother did not think it was funny at all. Disappointment can be one of the most hurtful emotions any of us can carry and try and deal with. I do not believe there is one person in the whole of this parliament that has not, at some stage, struggled with disappointment. Why would I be talking about disappointment tonight? I have been out in the electorate. I have had a fantastic time with the kids playing in Oliver! down at Wonthaggi. While I was there, who walks in but Michael O’Connor, brother of Brendan and a friend of mine. I said, ‘What are you doing here?’ He said: ‘My niece is in this play. This is my mum and dad.’ Grandma and Grandpa were there. The Oliver! program was fantastic-certainly no disappointment there. On the Saturday night I was with the Koo Wee Rup historical society talking MAIN COMMITTEE",227,Grievance Debate
213,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (9.20 Pm),"Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, I know youabout the town that I grew up in and painting a picture of the town as it was in the fifties and sixties. That was great, so there was no disappointment there. They might have been disappointed with the guest speaker, but there was generally no disappointment from my point of view. It was a great night with my dad and mum’s family and friends, reminiscing about what that small town was like in those years. It was quite different from today, of course. WhatI did hear from my community was a disappointment that I would not have expected in the first three years of a new government. These were the people that put this government in place. Having been around people all of my life-in business, in sport and in all the other activities I told you about the other day-I do have a feeling for the people and what they are feeling. WhatI got, right around the areas where I was on the weekend, was this uncanny, amazing disappointment with the Rudd government. I said to them: ‘What is your disappointment? Is it the pink batts?’ They said, ‘No, it is something that cannot be explained.’ What they are telling me is this. It was not the promise of cheaper groceries. They loved that, although it was not fulfilled. It was not the promise of cheaper petrol through Fuelwatch, which was not fulfilled and dumped. It was not the mother of all backflips with triple pike that we heard this week on government advertising when the Prime Minister, having said before the election, ‘No way this will happen under me,’ now disregards even the guidelines and says, ‘Now we have this national emergency on our hands.’ Suddenly we are talking about ‘national emergency’ in government advertising? The general community out there is saying, ‘This is not on.’ There is a greater expectation of government from the people of Australia these days. There is disappointment when a politician tells them that they are going to do something and then chooses not to do it, for whatever reason. I think the greatest disappointment is that it was not explained why there were backflips made which disregarded promises and overturned programs. You could say that perhaps it is Landcare. They love their Landcare and that $10 million has been taken off them. Perhaps it is the nurses they thought they were getting for their GP clinics, and they find out, ‘We’ve got $25,000 per nurse but they’ve taken all the procedures away from us.’ The GP clinic is actually going to be working at a loss for employing these nurses. Or is the nurse going to lose her job? I have a lovely email here from a practice that explains the whole situation and how it is going to affect them. If they employ five nurses they are going to end up with a $34,000 loss. I do not mind handing that on to you, Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, if you would like to look at it. I feel that the profound disappointment though comes from their overall picture of all politicians, not just this government, who they believe are saying one thing and then treating them as mugs. When the government’s ‘greatest moral dilemma of all time’, the ETS, was overturned, there would have been those within government ranks who actually thought that was great because that was a problem they did not have to deal with. In fact it was a betrayal to many, many people who believed in the promise, in the hope and in the expectation. It was like that kid with the ice-cream. He had hope and expectation: this was his ice-cream and he was going to lick it. He was going to love every bit of it, and off went the top of the ice-cream onto the ground. Kelly Sexton’s brother not only fell on the ground but slipped over and fell on his back. MAIN COMMITTEE There are a swag of people out there who are seriously and undeniably affected by disappointment in this government. I am not saying they come to me because I am a Liberal politician and they want to complain to me. I am not talking about dealing with Liberal members of my party. I am talking about the people in the street who want to stop me, grab me by the arm and tell me how disappointed they are. Sometimes they have a direct reason for being disappointed and they feel that the government has not explained itself and has not said why or what it is doing. But the great disappointment is the backflips and what they see as the costs for schools that should have been cheaper, when there is shadecloth worth $250,000 being installed for $1 million. The public hate rip-offs. They hate being ripped off themselves and they hate their own government being ripped off. They know someone is pulling it somewhere. When you compare what the Catholic schools in our electorates have done with their money, and how well the program from the federal government has worked with them, with how the states have dealt with it though their systems, you see it is the complete opposite. If you do not believe me, go and check. I do not know whether it is different in other states, but the Catholic schools in Victoria have done a remarkable job with the money they have been given. They have some projects underway, some completed, and the schools look great. I am not a Catholic but I am very close to Father Bernie. We were stuck in the back row of the car park at his church because there had been a big funeral for John Benyon, who was a great guy, and Father Bernie and I could not get out to go to the cemetery. I said, ‘What’s this over here, Father?’ He said, ‘That’s the Julia Gillard driveway.’ I said, ‘What’s this over here?’ He said, ‘That’s the Julia Gillard new memorial hall.’ I said: ‘What about the old buildings down here? There is a bit of work going on down there.’ This school has been turned from a very ordinary school into a beautiful primary school. It is a magnificent primary school due to them. He said: ‘We’re getting the Julia Gillard refurbishment right through there. We love it. It’s fantastic.’ I am not going to step back from any of those things, but a lot of very small schools in my electorate feel like they have been dudded. I have not said anything on this issue. I have been trying to help them work through their problems, hopefully, as a good backbench member would do on behalf of his community. If the government is supplying a program, let us try and deliver it. Profound disappointment has become ingrained, and I believe that if Mr Rudd does not address this profound disappointment he is going to have great difficulty facing the people in a very short time. having expired, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 192B.
