In any event, the fact is son, at his request and we have worked out an arhim and the learned judge chose to take a view of rangement whereby he will on occasions release the role of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. But what is very clear is that the role of the Minispeople for the purposes of deportation well before they have finished serving their sentences. I hope ter at least is not fettered strictly by the laws of evidence and the probity of material. I remind the that that will be a practice we can adopt in other House of what I said in my opening remarks, States, on which can be adopted for Commonwealth offences and one which therefore mitigates which was as follows: the occurrances when it can have the effect of The High Court said that the Minister is not required to accept as correct any views as to the facts or as to the weight being a double penalty. I say the effect of it beof evidentiary material expressed by the Tribunal. Thus it is cause it is not, of course, the theory behind it. I clear that the Minister is entitled to make up his own mind as think the honourable member for Boothby( Mr to the weight he gives to the material before him and that he Steele Hall) said that my decision was a practical may take into account and make his decision on the basis of matters which the Tribunal did not think to be sufficiently esone.
