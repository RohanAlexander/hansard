Can the Minister inform me whether the prices paid for the 50 or more aerodromes that have been taken over by this Government during its period of office have been amicably agreed to between the parties, or whether there has been any court litigation in respect of them? of my knowledge and belief, there has been no court litigation of any kind in connection with the acquisition of land for aerodromes in any municipality or centre. As far as I know, the price paid has always been agreed upon by the municipality concerned ancl the Commonwealth. I repeat that I know of no case where litigation has occurred. the Treasurer remembers my question last week to the Minister for Civil Aviation ahout an application by Trans-Australia Airlines for an allocation of dollars to purchase a DC6 aircraft. The Minister replied that an application had heen made, but he did not know the result of it, although it had been made to the department which he controlled.

Mr O'CONNOR,-Can the Minister for Defence state how long ago it was that the Government appointed a. high-ranking military man to take charge of civil defence against atomic attack? To what stage has the organization of which he is in charge advanced? Is it not a fact that Australia is seriously lagging behind other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States of America, in this matter? What steps does the Government propose to take to bring Australia up to date in relation to civil defence against atomic attack? the question. The Government is advised by the Council of Defence on the appropriate measures that should be taken. I do not know the source of the rumour that a high-ranking military man had been appointed to take charge of civil defence. Before this Government assumed office, an ex-military man was appointed as Director of Civil Defence, and he still occupies that position. who is the Director of Civil Defence? Wardell. He was appointed before this Government assumed office. He was appointed in, I think, 1949. in 1950. appointed in 1949 or 1950, and he is still the Director of Civil Defence.

When[ was in London a few months ago, I was able to make an arrangement with the United Kingdom Ministry of Food whereby Australian producers would be guaranteed a minimum return for a certain period related to the disposal of last year's crop. This year, the industry is facing the results of adverse seasonal conditions, which have affected the quantity and quality of the fruit, as well as difficult marketing conditions. A conference will be held in Melbourne next Friday at which representatives of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture will be present.

Recently, I received a letter from the chairman of the committee, in which he pointed out that it had not been found practicable to complete the inquiry at this point, but that the committee would conclude its work as soon as it reasonably could clo so. That, in effect, was the substance of the letter. The number of witnesses who have already been examined may give a false impression of the work that is being done. The first witness, I understand, covered substantially the whole of the ground which was intended to be the subject of the inquiry, or, at any rate, certain phases of it, and subsequent witnesses will not be required to tro into those matters at anything like the same length.

59,Mr Keon,"I direct a question to thedespite strong opposition from the right honourable member for Barton and his party, carried a resolution, in quite unequivocal terms, expressing opposition to the intrusion of overseas capital into Australian commercial broadcasting, would the Postmaster-General inform the House why, in the face of that resolution by both Houses of the Parliament, the Government has made provision to allow at least 20 per cent, of overseas capital to be invested in the companies that have been granted television licences? there was any resolution of this Parliament which rejected investment of overseas capital in television. We do not reject overseas capital in industrial corporations and so forth. The recommendation of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, which made the inquiry into the granting of television licences, was that overseas capital should be restricted to 20 per cent., and that not more than 15 per cent, of capital should be in the hands of one holder. The Government has accepted that recommendation, because it is desirable to have a certain Droportion, at least, of overseas capital in Australian industry. Television is an industry. However, in view of the recommendation to whicli I have referred, and the general sentiment throughout Australia, it is not desired that any overseas company shall dominate television or broadcasting in Australia. General aware that there is a good deal of concern by the Australian Broadcasting Commission about the conditions and constitution of the companies, representing a combination of newspaper, radio, film and theatre interests, that are to he issued with television licences? Is it a fact that the Australian Broadcasting Commission may be placed at a tremendous disadvantage in introducing television into Australia because of the present system of control of almost every theatre in the Oommonwealth and all worth-while films imported into the country? Is it further a fact that because of the photographic requirements of television, big theatres are essential for the presentation of shows? In view of the importance of television to Australia, will the Minister ensure that monopoly interests are not allowed to thwart the introduction of television by Australian interests ? anything could be said about the successful applicants for television licences, it would be that they did not represent monopoly interests. That is because there is such a variety of companies participating in the licences that no particular company could have a monopoly interest. Tho successful licensees represent a I do not think that cross-section of Australian industry and commercial interests that could scarcely be bettered. The Australian Broadcasting Commission will conduct the national television system, and the purpose of this Government in arranging for both commercial and national television was to ensure that there should be competitive television in Australia, I am quite sure that the Australian Broadcasting Commission will have no difficulty in conducting a successful television programme when its turn comes to do so. aware of the fact that the South Australian Government recently made a grant to cover the loss of local council rates on properties acquired by the State? In view of this decision, will the Treasurer consider the contribution, by the Commonwealth, of its full share of the moneys required and raised by local goverument bodies for community services? Does he regard it as just for the Commonwealth to shelter behind a constitutional provision which, although legally right, is morally wrong? aware of the situation stated by the honourable member on the contribution made to local authorities by the South Australian Government in lieu of rates, but I am aware that, whatever contribution is made by that Government iu that way, if it increases its general expenses and consequently leads to an increase of its demands upon the Commonwealth under the States Grants Act, that sum will be available to it by the",17,Television

The contribution made by the Commonwealth to local authorities in respect of the occupancy of land by Commonwealth instrumentalities is a matter to which the honourable gentleman has persistently drawn attention. It 'is also a matter which has received the consideration, not only of this Government but also of previous governments. . The Commonwealth has decided consistently not. to make any payments in lieu of rates, but it does make ex gratia payments in certain circumstances. If the point raised by the honourable member discloses a new aspect, of the matter, I shall look into containing 0.25 per cent of recoverable it and see what can be done, but I do not hold out very much hope of any alteration of the decisions that this and previous governments have made on the matter. Supply say whether any uranium exported from this country must be the subject of an export licence issued by tbe Commonwealth? If that is so, is the Minister prepared to make a statement indicating the countries to which uranium has been exported from Australia and, if possible, the purposes for which that uranium is to be used ? of uranium production in Australia at present One is Rum Jungle, in the Northern. Territory, and the other is Radium Hill:, in South Australia. ' In both cases, the output of the mines is committed under an agreement with the Combined Development Agency, whioh represents the British and American Governments. The output goes to that agency for defence purposes. Shipments from Rum Jungle have already left this country on their way to America. As far as I know, none has yet gone from Radium Hill. In both cases, export licences would be issued, because of the existence of this agreement. As I said to another honourable member, I shall make a statement to-morrow on atomic energy and uranium production. Some of the matters with which I shall deal in that statement may give the honourable member additional information on the points he has raised. Later: sonal explanation, arising' from a statement published in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of Saturday, the 23rd April, in which Mr Tilley, the chairman of Australasian Oil Exploration Limited, a uranium mining company, is reported as follows:* Mr Tilley said tbe Minister fbr Supply( Mr Beale) had promised that the Government would establish a buying centre tor ore in the Mount Isa-Cloncurry area i i Australasian Oil Explorations Limited proved sufficient ore on 76 other leases it held. The' Governments minimum requirements were 50,000 tons of onuranium oxide, Mr Tilley added. That statement is quite untrue. At the request and in the presence of Senator Laught, I gave Mr Tilley an interview on Thursday, the 21st April. He said he had not been able to obtain from the Australian Atomic Energy Commission information he desired about the Goveinment's ore buying policy, that this wa* affecting his company and its ability fo raise money and,, therefore, that hesought information from me. I told' him I was loth to make any statement which could be quoted to influence the stock market in favour of any particular company. He said he appreciated thisand he did not intend to use my statement for any such purpose. Mr Tilley then mentioned the quertion of the purchase of ore by the Government in the Mount Isa and Cloncurry district, in one area of which Australasian Oil Exploration Limited held the Mai? Kathleen leases in conjunction with Rio Tinto, and in another area of which if held some 76 leases in its own right. After discussion concerning the Mary Kathleen leases, Mr Tilley asked me whether the Government would buy OTV from the other leasesin the area held b-y Australian Oil Exploration Limited independently of Rio Tinto. I pointed out that this raised difficult problem*. Nobody yet knew how much ore there was. Moreover, the ores in the district were of varying kinds, not all of which were amenable to the same treatment. For this reason, the Government contd not give undertakings about buying ores, from these teases until substantial reserves, say. half a million tons. <*f",18,Local Government

I also mentioned that, with such a treatment plant, in existence, the question of purchase of ore by the Government might well become irrelevant, because his company could treat the ore and the Commonwealth, would buy the oxide. Mr Tilley then left, expressing gratitude for my information, which he said had helped him greatly. Two days later, in Saturday's Daily Telegraph, the statement in question appeared under the heading ""Uranium Company expects big dividend"". The Sunday Telegraph of the next day contained quite a different version of our conversation, accompanied,, however, by a leading article consisting of a violent personal attack on me. Ignoring the personal abuse, I repeat that the first, statement was completely untrue. .1 made no promise to establish an ore buying centre at Mount Isa or Cloncurry.

I cannot say offhand the loss to the revenue that would be involved in a removal of the sales tax from home furnishings, but I do know that the promises made hy the Leader of the Opposition in that connection during the last general election campaign would have involved a loss of something like £14,000,000. I know also that the imposition of sales tax on home furnishings and other articles has received continuous consideration by this Government. It will be considered again when the next budget is being prepared. inform honourable members whether he has received a report from the committee that he set up after his last budget speech to inquire into the rates of depreciation allowed under the income tax legislation?

General whether it is a fact that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, in its report on television, declared Efftee Broadcasters to be controlled by foreign interests. Is it also a fact that Efftee Broadcasters are the lessees of the Melbourne radio station 3XY, the licence of which was issued to an organization known as the Young Liberals or the Young Nationalists, one of the trustees being the present Commonwealth Attorney-General? If the position is as I have stated, having regard to the decision of this Parliament in November, 1952, which expressed disapproval of foreign control of broadcasting stations, what action does the Minister propose to take in this matter? not recommend that there should be no foreign capital in Australian broadcasting stations. The House carried a motion to the effect that foreign capital should not be substantially included. Efftee Broadcasters have a very minor interest in the new television station to be established in Melbourne. As far as the participation of the "" Young Liberals"" in a licence is concerned, I point out to the honourable members that radio station 2KY in Sydney also has an interest in a new television licence, and that station is controlled by the Labour party. ter for the Navy inform the House whether it is true that a recent applicant for enlistment in the Royal Australian Navy was rejected because he was an aborigine ? appeared in the press was entirely incorrect.

Finally, is it not a fact that the present practice is exactly the same as that which obtained before he and the Government blundered so badly with the amending legislation? honourable gentleman has not given this important subject the study that it deserves. If he had done so, he would not have been able to make a statement which is so much at variance with the obvious facts. The position that obtains to-day is quite different from that which obtained before the amending legislation was passed. Before that legislation was passed, the employer' had no say whatcver in the selection of labour that was to be employed by him. Under an arrangement that was agreed to by representatives of the employers and the unions at a conference at which representatives of the Government were in attendance, the employer now has the right of rejection. Both parties have agreed that, if the employer exercises the right of rejection, and if the union chooses to challenge the exercise of that right, the Stevedoring Industry Board will arbitrate and the decision of the board shall be final. Furthermore, representatives of the Australian Council of Trades Unions have agreed that, if the federation fails to supply names in accordance with quota requirements that have been prescribed by the board, the -""plications for employment. In that can expect no support from the Australian Council of Trades Unions. I believe that, since the amending legislation was passed, we have had a more satisfactory basis of recruitment, and that quotas on the waterfront have been filled to a. degree that we had not known previously.

When the Labour Government went out of office in 1949, the basic rate of invalid and age pensions was £2 2s. 6d. a week, nearly £12 a week, and the basic rate of age and invalid pensions has much a week. That may not sound very dreadful, but, as a result of the actions of the present Government, the harm is much for the Commonwealth to continue to Let us compare the present prices of the basic commodities that are essential to pensioners-bread , butter, meat, jam, sugar, milk, tea, fruit, vegetables, firesame time that in the intervening under its next budget but immediately.",22,Social Services

96,Mr Chambers,"The matter concontrol prices. Commonwealth controlAny one who stops to think will recognize the grand work that these persons have accomplished in the interests of the nation. They are the mothers and fathers of the present generation. Perhaps, the parents of honourable members are more fortunately situated than are the many thousands of aged and infirm persons who are dependent solely on the present age pension of £3 10s. a week. The Minister, in his reply, will probably remind the House that the income which age pensioners are permitted to earn in addition to the pension has been increased considerably during the last few years. Is the Government so mean as to rest content in this matter because it has permitted women who have reached the age of 60 years, men who have reached the age of 65 yeavs, and who have been burnt out by the toil and worry involved in rearing families, to earn an additional £1, £1 10s. or £2 a week in addition to the age pension? The Government might just as well say that it will permit them to earn £50 a week in addition to the pension, because those aged and invalid persons are not capable of earning anything in excess of the mere pittance which they now receive as a pension. I trust that the Minister will not advance that argument, I again appea'l to the Government on behalf of these unfortunate persons. We should not be true to our political beliefs or be worthy children of Australia if we failed to recognize the great service that the age pensioners have rendered in the interests of the nation. We owe it to them to provide them with at least some relief as Boon as possible. These mothers and fathers reared the members of Australia's fighting forces. In fact, they gave birth to the personnel of the Army, Navy and Air Force and to the nurses and members of the women's defence services who defended this country in two world wars. These are the people for whom the Opposition now appeals to the Government to give relief in their dire circumstances. I ask the Government not to defer consideration of this matter until the next budget is introduced. I remind the House that the age pension has been increased by only 2s. 6d. a week since 1952. Since that year thc Government has entirely forgotten these pensioners. In its famous 1953 "" nothing over 2s. 6d."" budget, the age pensioners received an additional 2s. 6d. a week. 1949. plained, as intelligent honourable members will appreciate, that the purchasing power of the age pension of £2 2s. 6d. a week in 1949 was double that of the purchasing power of the present pension of £3 10s. a week. That statement is based on an examination of the prices in 1949 of commodities which are bare necessaries for pensioners compared with present prices of such commodities. I again appeal to the Government to do something immediately for these grand people. I feel strongly on this matter because not only in my electorate but also throughout the State from which I come, I am approached daily by age pensioners .who are barely able to keep body and soul together on the present pension. Therefore, I trust the Government will give immediate attention to this matter and do something of real value for these grand and worthy members of the community. Social Services) [3.52] -The Government is clear in its approach to this problem.

99,Mr Mcmahon (Lowe,"Minister fordevelopment. In the process, the Government approves certain claims and rejects others. I repeat that the present is not the proper time to enter into a general debate on social services problems, and I clo not intend to do so. Let me examine the arguments of the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Chambers). He protested that the Opposition was not actuated by any ulterior motive in bringing forward this proposal. On that score, he protested too much. There is no doubt that the Opposition has raised this matter, as it has raised other matters, for the purpose of diverting attention from the strife and discord that now exist in its ranks. In the course of this debate, the Government has no intention of prejudicing its future line of action in respect of social services policy. For that reason, I shall not enter into a general debate on what is, after all, a budget problem, or in any way compromise the Government's position with respect to social services. The Government will act on exactly the same principles as it has acted during the last five years. As the Prime Minister( Mr reforms have been made which give the Menzies) has said, its policy in this matter will be as generous in the future fis it has been in the past. Here, I should like to make one point abundantly clear. WhatI am saying is not intended to be and cannot be interpreted as being discouraging, because the simple fact is that no decisions have yet been made in connection with the 1955-56 budget. Therefore, if no decisions have been made, my remarks cannot be interpreted as being discouraging to any persons who may think that they have a claim to Commonwealth attention. Let me return to the essential part of the and the Government has put into Opposition's argument, which is that the benefits are inadequate. That claim has been put in this House before. When we consider the terms of the definite matter of urgent public importance submitted by the honourable member for Adelaide, we are bound to agree that inadequacy of benefits is the essence of the Opposition's claim. I venture to say that if we examine the proposal on a broad basis, and on the basis of the past actions of the Labour party, it must be conceded that the Labour party, if it was in office, and if it acted on the same principles as it did in 1949, would not increase pensions at the present moment. What are the facts? In 1949, Mr Chifley, who was an able Treasurer, refused to make provision for increasing pensions when he was preparing his budget. At that date, pensions were, and remained at, £2 2s. 6d. a week. Since that time, pensions have been increased to £3 10s. a week. If we consider the arguments of the Labour party in 1949, we must come to the conclusion that the Labour party, if it had continued in office, would not have increased the pension. The honourable member for Adelaide conceded that fact. He used the phrase that the pension to-day had a. slightly greater purchasing power than the pension of 1949. Every honourable member knows, from the mathematical tests which can be applied, that the purchasing power of to-day's pension is at least as great as it was in 1949, and, indeed, is perhaps fractionally a little greater. But that is only a part of the story. Since 1949, at least four progressive pensioner much greater help, and a much more secure position, than he had under the regime of Mr Chifley. I mention four reforms. First, the Government has working-actuall y workingthe national health and hospital benefits scheme, which is of great help to a pensioner. I emphasize that the scheme is working. It was not working in 1949. Secondly, very generous pharmaceutical benefits are provided for pensioners. That reform also is novel, and this Government should receive the credit for its introduction. Thirdly, provision has been made for homes for aged people, homes has this Government provided for aged persons? committed to £4.50,000. If the honourable member for Adelaide had been awake, and if he had cared to make the effort, he could have come to the electorate of the honourable member for Sturt( Mr Makin), where I recently presented a cheque and where more than 100 aged",24,Social Services

101,Mr Chambers,B e fair! How many,25,Social Services
102,Mr Mcmahon,"We are alreadypeople are being provided witb accommodation. Much more will be done. I mention another point. The means test has heen liberalized to give an incentive to those who produce. So, on that basis, the Prime Minister was quite correct when he claimed during the course of the genera] election campaign in 1954 that the Government had been generous in its approach to pensioners, and that it had a truly meritorious record in respect of granting increases of social services benefits. If tlie House wishes, there are two tests which can be applied in order to determine whether or not social services benefits to-day are better than they were in 1949, when the Labour Government was in office. I shall deal with those two tests. Expenditure on social services, expressed as a percentage of the national income, has increased from 2.11 l»er cent, in 1938-39 to 4.03 per cent, in 1949-50 and to 4.68 per cent, in 1953-54. The estimate for 1954-55 is approximately 5 per cent., this is based on the 1053-54 estimate of national income and tbo year's social services estimate, ^o, honourable members can see that, in terms of national production, thc advance has been very substantial, and wholly for the benefit of the pensioner. The second test, which is also of importance, is that the total budget allocation for health and social services has increased from £93,000,000 in 1949-50 to £195,000,000 in 1954-55. Therefore, it is the claim of this Government, and I now repeat the words of the Prime Minister, that it has a wonderful record of achievement. I myself add, if the House will permit me to speak in the vernacular, that in comparison, the performances of the former Labour Government were what may very truly be called "" lousy "". There is one other point on a somewhat academic basis that I should like to raise. The honourable member for Adelaide has discussed the matter of associating pensions with the basic wage. I point out straight away that, in the past, Labour governments have refused to continue automatic ties between, say, the C series index or any other index, and the pension. ""We on this side of the House agree that pensions should not bt tied to tlie basic wage. If the two were associated, governments would not know where they were going and could not keep control of their spending. I want to show how little thought the Labour party has given to this problem, when its spokesman says that there should be an association between the basic wage and the pension. The basic wage is now £11 16s. a week. Of that amount £2 10s. is the prosperity loading. Therefore, the real needs basic wage-and pensioners receive their payment on the basis of needs-is £9 6s. a week. The Commonwealth Arbitration Court itself said that that amount was sufficient for a family unit of three. If we were to apply the reasoning of the honourable meniber for Adelaide, we should find that the Labour party, if it were in office, would allot as a pension not £3 10s. but £3 2s. a week. basis of my claim. member for Adelaide advanced that argument, and thereby showed that he had not considered, and did not understand the meaning of his argument. I want to expose his argument for the nonsense that it is. The Labour party has used this argument without knowing what it has said in the past and without knowing precisely where the argument would lead it. We on tbe Government side sum up our views in the following way: There is clear proof that, in terms of published statistics, which have since been verified, the purchasing power of the pension at present is at least as high as, if not fractionally higher than, it was in 1949. We say that without prejudicing or compromising our future position, or creating the impression that any decisions have yet been made. So, there is no reason for any dissatisfaction on the part of groups who may hope to benefit subsequently. In estimating the value of the pension we should also take into consideration other valuable benefits, such as health and pharmaceutical benefits, and housing, which have been granted to pensioners. I am sure that the House will accept the fact that",25,Social Services
103,Mr Chambers,That was not the,26,Social Services
104,Mr Mcmahon,"The honorablethis Government has done immensely more in terms of the real provision for the wants of the pensioners than was ever contemplated by the preceding Chifley Government. The pension has been increased, and housing and medical and pharmaceutical benefits are being provided for pensioners. So we have the pension, housing, and medicine-the three things that are so desperately needed if there is to be contentment in the heart and mind of a pensioner. BeforeI conclude, I shall mention one other great improvement made by this Government, and that is the provision made for homes for the aged. I claim that this will be a monument to the Menzies Government. Such provision for aged persons was never thought of by the Labour party. We hope that, in future, thousands of pensioners will benefit from this scheme. It is now recognized by most people that the Labour party, by using the forms of the House in this way, is trying to divert attention from its own internal troubles. Those difiiculties will be bigger in the future than they are at present, and perhaps the Labour party will be compelled to submit other definite matters of urgent public importance for the consideration of the House. We say that we shall not compromise our position. We also say that, in comparison with the Labour party's claims and actions, this Government has a truly meritorious record in the field of social services. For that reason we urge that the claims advanced by the Opposition must be rejected by the House. support the request of the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Chambers) that something be done urgently to relieve the plight of the pensioner. The attitude of the Minister for Social Services( Mr responsible for an increase of the cost of McMahon) shows a callous disregard of the plight of the pensioner, particularly the base pensioner. Since this Government has been in office it has had the unenviable record throughout of having made the poor poorer. Although the present debate is mainly concerned with the miserable pittance paid to pensioners, analysis of the attitude of the Government shows that not only have its actions had a detrimental effect on the pensioner, but they have also had a serious effect on the basic wage earner, the person who lives on a fixed income, and other people of that nature. How has thi? policy of the Government been put into effect? It was put into effect very cunningly and cleverly. First, the basic wage was pegged by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, to tbe applause of the Government, although the court had for many years adopted the principle that the basic wage should rise and fall in accordance with the cost of living. Later, the Government interceded before the court in regard to the payment of wage margins. But it interceded only on behalf of the people who were on the highest salary scales. As a result of its intercession, those highly paid employee; received some benefit. But the intercession had certainly a detrimental effect on the claims of unskilled workers who had no margin, or only a small margin. I say, therefore, that the policy of the Government throughout has been, gradually but surely, making the poor poorer. Then the Government immediately proceeded to grease the fatted pig. It increased the salaries of judges, and it gave high public servants ( Mr Bowden) -Order! This is no: a general debate. moment, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, how the attitude of the Government hac been responsible for certain serious effects, because it gave some people marginal increases amounting to more than two and a half times the 1937 level of their margins, which was the figure prescribed by the court in relation to workers in the metal trades. I shall show you how the attitude of the Government has been living, and a consequent reduction of the real value of pensions. That fact has been revealed recently in figures issued by the Commonwealth Statistician, which give details of the cost of living. I shall not go into the details of thosefigures,but I shall, say that the Statistician pointed out how the cost of living had heen affected. The commercial editor of tbe Melbourne. Herald points out, in the same",26,Social Services

107,Mr Webb,"I shall show you in aissue of the newspaper which records the statistician's figures, how inflation fears have' been revived hy cost-of-living increases. I say that all this has had an effect, on the pensioner and the miserable pittance that he receives. The Minister claims that when Mr adjustments had been made to thr Chifley was Prime Minister and Treasurer the pension had a value corresponding to its real value to-day. I say that that is very definitely not correct, because under the Chifley Government's budget in 1948 the pension had the value of 37 per cent, of the then basic wage, and that position had not changed very much by the time this Government was elected to oflice in 1949. As a matter of fact,, in case the Minister has any doubt about this matter, I quote to him statements made in the Melbourne Age of the 10th August, 1954, in an editorial in which that newspaper calls for a ""better deal fbr age pensioners"". The editorial includes the following statement:There is still a general' recognition that rises in pension rates have heen far from commensurate with tlie shrunken value oil money, and that the increases did not keep pace with .the rises of prices and costs. In HMff, the age and invalid pension was 37 per cent, of the basic wage;, to-day, it is only 291 Iicr eent. That editorial comment gives the lie to the Minister's statement about the position of pensioners nnder the Chifley Administration. makes this commentHow a country treats those who have passed tlieir working days without having' acquired resources of their own affords an important test, of its concepts of welfare. If the attitude of the Government is a.n indication of the Government's concept of welfare, it is clear that this Administration has no feelings for any kind of pensioner. The Minister said that he was not going to deal with pensions at this stage, and that that matter was something for the future. But that did not stop the Minister or the Cabinet from giving consideration to the payment of salary increases far above the standard set by the court to public servants who were already in receipt of high incomes. As I have said, the pension is reduced in value to-day compared with its value in 1949. It is still being gradually reduced in value as thc cost of living rises, because 1 the Government will not do anything in stop this trend. The pensioner in Western Australia is actually worse ofi than is the pensioner in any other State. The basic wage in Western Australia is £13 12s. 6d. If appropriate cost of living basic wage since it was; pegged it would be £13 9s. 6d. Analysed, thai shows that the pensioner in Western Australia isreceiving a pension that i? worth only 25.8 per cent, of the basK wage, and is therefore worse off than ar'pensioners in other States. Do not let honourable gentlemen opposite contend that the basic wage is pegged because Western Australia has a Labour government in office. The facts are that that Labour Government did all it could io apply the automatic adjustments to thrbasiewage. It appeared before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and spohrin favour of automatic adjustments. It also tried to put amending legislation tn give effect, to such a proposal through, the Western Australian Parliament, hut was prevented from doing so by an anti-Labour Legislative Council'. I say that justice should be given cm the pensioners before anything is done for the heads and sub-heads of Pederal departments. The Government may deny the charge that it has been making the poor poorer since it has been in office, The same editorial but I suggest that it has to do more than merely deny it. It has to do something tangible that will increase pensions now, without waiting for the budget to be presented, if that is what it has in mind, until they have the same vahie of 37 per cent, of the basic wage as they had at the time of the presentation of the Chifley Administration's last budget. To realize how the Government has permitted the cost of living to rise since it has been in office it is only necessary to look at the position of tea, which is a basic commodity for pensioners. In respect of that matter, the Melbourne Agecalled on the Government to do something about the price of tea for the pensioner. A report is published in the press to-day which showsi that the Qievernment is now enjoying a profit on tea,, because it does not now have to pay a. subsidy, tea prices having fallen in Ceylon and other tea-exporting countries. Is this not the right time for a reduction of the price of tea for people who so urgently need it? I do not know whether any further proof is required of the way in which the Government has inaladministered the affairs of this country in allowing prices to rise. However, if honourable members opposite require any further proof, I suggest that they study the World Economic Eeport of 1953, which shows that prices in Australia, under this Government's administration, have been allowed to rise more than in any other country. The report shows that they have increased by 43 per cent, since the Government took office. I shall make one more quotation in regard to this particular matter. It is from the Perth Daily News of the 19th February, 1955. Under the heading, "" Poverty ranks high in sickness causes "", that newspaper publishes the following report:About 10 per cent, of patients in an analysis taken at Royal Perth Hospital were found in be in ill-health because of poverty and poor living circumstances. This was disclosed by Royal Perth Hospital clinical research unit director Dr. Eric Saint in a Perth address reported by the Australian Medical Journal. Mr Saint said that with a view to exploring the no-inaii's land which lies between medicine and sociology and social anthropology, he had critically analysed the experience of his colleagues and himself with 250 new in-patients and 150 out-patients. A third of their patients were older than ii0. With about a third of these patients, ill-health was the result of poverty and poor living circumstances. -Order! The honourable gentleman's time has expired. AlthoughI have great respect for the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr sioners, they spoke as though all penChambers) as a very sincere man, I regret very much that I cannot accept his word that this matter has been brought forward for discussion with no idea of political propaganda. inember for Adelaide is a sincere man, as are many of the men who advocate better conditions for pensioners. They include, if I may say so, honourable members on this side of the House. But I say that this matter has been brought forward for discussion not with any idea of obtaining better conditions for pensioners, because the honourable member for Adelaide, with his political experience, knows full well that at this stage, when the presentation of the budget is only three or four months off, no government could l if t pensions out of their context in the economy of the country ancl deal with them as an isolated case. Whether the honourable member was fishing in order to find out what the Government proposes to do about pensioners in the future, T do not know; but I do know, and I think all sensible pensioners in Australia know also, that this matter has been brought forward for discussion only for the purposes of political propaganda. It is political propaganda, of the worse kind, because the Opposition is using for the purpose defenceless people whom we know are suffering. That is probably the prime reason for the Opposition's action. Another reason, as suggested by the Minmay be that, because of the chaotic condition of the Labour party in Australia, the Opposition has to make some diversion. It wants to make political capital out of this matter in order to try to help the Cain Government, which is now going to the electors. [Quorum formed.} 1 am very sorry that some of my time has been wasted by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) directing attention to the state of the House. I take second place to no one in my interest in pensioners. I know that in every community there are some pensioners who are suffering, and I should like to see something done for them. I sincerely hope that something will be done for them. But when the honourable member for Adelaide and the honourable member for Swan( Mr Webb) spoke of pensioners were suffering in the manner so dramatically described by the honourable member for Adelaide. That is not so. Some pensioners are suffering and I beThe honourable lieve the State ancl Federal Governments should get together to help them, but the help they require is not help that can be given through the general scheme of pensions legislation.

Some are suffering because State laws have deprived them of the right to occupy their own homes. In New South Wales pensioners are being seriously hurt by the restrictive legislation of the State governcumstances, an elderly married couple ment in that held. There are State welfare schemes through which needy pensioners can get a little help in addition to their pensions. Some pensioners are suffering, but there are many who find that their pensions, together with other income or earnings, are quite sufficient for their needs. Therefore, the problem is to find some way to help the people who are suffering. If any scheme for that purpose can be produced, I shall he all for it, because I should like to see something done for these people. But I stress the fact that Labour's poor record in regard to pensions does not justify the action of .the Opposition in bringing this matter forward for discussion. In the first place, Labour did not even initiate the pensions scheme. It was initiated by a non-Labour government, of the same type as this Government. Nor did the Labonr party at any time Mr Whitlam interjecting, Cameron) -Order! The honourable member for Werriwa is a man trained in the law.

What did his party do then? It made no effort whatever to improve the structure of social services. There has been some argument about the amount of the pensions. Did the Labour Government do the things that this Government has done? Didi t provide free medical services and free medicine for pensioners? Did it introduce a scheme hy which, in certain cirwho receive an income of up to £750 a year pay no income tax? In 1949, it was admitted that the cost of living was rising at the rate of 9 per cent, a year. On the 14th June, 1949, the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull), who was then member for Wimmera, addressed a question to Mr Chifley. He saidI ask the Treasurer whether the Government intends to increase the rate of age and invalid pensions. If so, will the increase be between 3s. and 5s. a week, as suggested in the press? Mr Chifley repliedXo consideration has been given to n further increase of pension rates. He went on to say that there was no intention to make any such increase. That was in 1949. No one should talk about these matters unless he is prepared to act also. Members of the Labour party have talked about pensioners to-day, but although they had an opportunity to act during the eight or nine years that Labour was in office, they did not do so. As the (Hon. Archie Minister has said, the record of this Government in the field of social services is one of which any government could be proud. In addition to increasing the amount of the pension, it has eased the means test considerably. We all know that now a pensioner can own property worth up to £1,750 without his pension being affected in any way. Previously the limit was £750. able gentleman's time has expired. do not think the speech that we have just heard from the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Cramer) reflects a great deal of credit on him.

Therefore I agree, as do the other members of my party, with the terms in which the matter was brought forward for discussion. If ever there was a time when such a matter should be brought before the Blouse, it is now. Should not the Government be apprised of what is happening and, because of that apprisal, should not it make provision in subsequent budgets for more liberal treatment of those who deserve liberal treatment?

Xt is not poor in the spirit, heart and willingness to make sacrifices of the people who live in it, but it is poor economically. Recently a survey was made of cities in the electorate that I represent and in other parts of Victoria. The results of the survey were published in a book entitled Old Peoplei n a Modern Australian Community. It was a social survey by Bertram Hutchinson, a bachelor of science and a doctor of philosophy of the University of London. The book was published by the Melbourne University Press. Some of tlie facts in that survey, which is most comprehensive, 'completely support the statements that have beeu made by the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Chambers). I shall mention examples first, without dealing with figures, which may be produced at a later stage.

Most ol those who complained about this added thab snn is setting, it is most noticeable that they thought it was due to ""old age"" or honourable members opposite are employ"" poor health or similar matters. 1 could indicate other difficulties that have to be faced by these people because of their inadequate income. Of course, inadequate income in this case means inadequate pension.. Can warmth be provided, and can the humble necessities of life be provided in sufficient quantity to keep these elderly people in some state of comfort for only £3 10s. a week ? We must also remember that most pensioners are compelled to pay rent. I am able to put certain figures before the House with regard to the rent position in the. poorer parts of Melbourne. In the electorate that I represent, which contains the economically poorer areas of Fitzroy, Collingwood, Carlton and central Melbourne, 68 per cent, of the house occupiers are tenants. Of that 68 per cent., 43 per cent, pay a rent of from. 20s. a week to 40s. a week, and. included in that group are most of the pensioners who live in that area. The whole of that argument indicates that many people, because they liave raised, families or have suffered'iii health or unemployment, have been unable to accumulate a nest egg for their retirement or incapacity to earn. When those people become eligible for social services, surely it is the duty of any government, and I charge this Government only with failure to realize the seriousness of the position, to act in accordance with the canons of the Christian faith-fee d the hungry, clothe t he naked and succor the sick. This Government has lamentably failed to do those things. able member's time has. expired. Whatever the motives of the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Chambers) in bringing this matter forward, and we assume that his motives were worthwhile, the effect of what he intended to convey to the House was dissipated hy the reactions of those who were sitting behind him. Their attack on the Government has been characterized hy recklessness, and a disregard for the emotions of those, whom they say they ing the most desperate methods to delude the public into the belief that they are still an effective opposition. I know of no. more discreditable practice than that which has been indulged in by the Opposition this afternoon, of exploiting distress and human suffering in order to gain a party political advantage. That is. a time-dishonored custom, and rare which is current practice among pressure groups, throughout, the world to-day. Their tactics are to blame the other fellow for their own shortcomings, and to blame the other man for. not doing what they should have done themselves. There is nothing more notorious in our political life than Labour's failure in the field of social services. It has been pointed out on numerous, occasions thar. the 1948-49 budget, in spite of the fact that, costs and prices had increased from 10. per cent, to 12 per cent, in that year, made no provision whatever for an increase of pensions. But the excuse is made to-day for the first time,, by the honourable member for Adelaide,, that the LabouiGovernment of 1948-49 intended to do the impossible, that it intended to control prices and costs throughout the Commonwealth. That Government, which showed such a callous disregard for the welfare of the needy of the community on that occasion, was defeated before its policy on costs and prices could be implemented, and a more realistic government assumed office. Almost immediately the new government provided an increase of 7s. 6d. a week for the pensioners. Those who were previously members of that same Labour Government, red-faced by their own failure, then attacked the new government which had increased the pensions by saying that the increase was not enough. Was the pension ever intended to be enough? No pension, except perhaps the totally and permanently incapacitated soldier's pension, has ever been considered to be, economically, enough, but this Government recognized the inadequacy of the highest pension ever paid in this or any other country and allowed the recipient to earn an amount equivalent to the pension itself.",31,Social Services

122,Mr Bowden (Gippsland) [4.35]',"If a man receives an age pension of £3 10s. a week he can earn another £3 10s. a week without his pension being reduced. The honourable member for Adelaide said to-day that a woman of 60, or a man of 65, was not in a position earn £3 10s. a week. If he is sincere will he tell me, and the House, why Labour restricted the earning capacity of pensioners to £1 a. week if it was not practicable for pensioners to earn anything? This Government, as well as providing that pensioners could earn as much as their pensions, also provided, in the same year, free medicine, free medical' attention and free hospitalization. Some have tried to put a monetary value on those services, but I consider that there is no way in which theiimonetary value <-.iin be assessed. [t. can serve no useful purpose to reiterate statistical facts. We have proved an increase of about £8 a week for each this Government's willingness to face up to pensioners' problems, even while it is obliged to spend hundreds of millions of pounds a year on preparations to defend the source of all our money. However, I believe that it will he of some advantage to the House and the country to indicate the rates of pension through the years. From .1.915 to 1916 the age and invalid pension was 12s. 6d. a week. From 1916 to 1922 it was 15s. a week, from 1923 to 1929 it was £1 a week, ancl from 1929 to 1932 it was 17s. 6d. a week. I shall not comment on that last figure, because if I had to fix it it may have been even less had I been obliged to face the problems that the then government had to face in that period of our history. From 1932 to 1939 the pension was £1 a week, from 1939 to 1941 it was £1 ls. 6d. a week, from 1941 to 1945-during the tenure of office of the Labour Government under Mr Chifley became Prime Minister the pension was increased to £2 2s. 6d., and it remained at that figure from 1945 to 1949. From 1949 to 1954 it increased to £3 10s. a week. Honourable members will notice that from 1949 to 1954 the pension increased by £1 7s. 6d. a week, whereas in any of the other periods that I have mentioned, the highest increase was only 10s. a week. Mr Bowden. It has been said that £3 10s. will not buy as much to-day as £2 would buy during the period of office of the last Labour Government, but that is so much nonsense. ought to try living on £3 10s. a week. than that. Now let us examine Labour's case on pensions. The Opposition's immediate requirement is an additional £1 a week for the pensioner. Every shilling increase of the age and invalid pensions costs about £1,250,000 a year, therefore an increase of £1 a week would cost about £25,000,000 a year. Therefore,, such an increase may or may not be practicableI am not in a position to say. But the glib talk of completely removing the means test and giving the pensioners the basic wage, would mean pensioner. That would involve the country in an expenditure of an additional £400,000,000 a year. Surely that, indicates tbe completely irresponsible approach of the Labour party to our economic problems. The honourable member for Adelaideasked who were the pensioners to-day. I reply to him that the pensioners to-day are the same as they have always been. The pensioners have always been in the same economic position, and they have always needed the help of all governments. I do not take second place to any one in my endeavours to see that justice is done to pensioners, to all people in need and to all those who cannot fend for themselves, but I cannot stand the mealymouthed hypocrisy that we hear from time to time from supporters of the Labour party. The Labour party's attitude in this matter is designed for two purposes. was £1 12s. 6d. After The first is to effect a diversionary tactic to remove the flickering spotlight from its own internal failures, and to try to beguile the people into believing that it is still ready to devote some time to the needs of the deserving community. The second purpose of Labour is an old one. The Opposition is anticipating this Government's budget, and is attempting to jump on the band wagon in case thc budget gives more benefits to pensioners.

127,Motion (By Sir Eric Harrison) Put,,34,Hughes
128,Mr Mackinnon (Corangamite),"justified. It is a matter that concerns the community as a whole. In times of war and of emergency, there 1 have stated that the Constitution is a tendency to regard the acquisition of land for Commonwealth or State purposes as something that should be done automatically, and I am afraid that that has led to the adoption of a certain attitude of mind amongst departmental officers particularly. When we study a measure <if this kind, we realize that there is a tendency to load its provisions to the advantage of those whom it is proposed 4iall exercise the power, and against those who will be the victims of that power. That point should be borne in mind when we are analysing such legislation. Honourable members know of glaring examples of acquisition hy the States and the Commonwealth. It was the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon), I think, who referred to instances of the acquisition of building property within his own electorate during the past ten years in which compensation had not been paid. Honourable members on this side of the House have referred also to the form of confiscatory acquisition that has taken place in New South Wales. It is the intention of supporters of the Government to try to ensure that, in any legislation that is passed by the Parliament, injustices will be avoided. In my opinion, we should adopt two main principles in studying the bill. First, the objective of such legislation should be the prevention of unwarranted or unjustified acquisition. That is necessary for the purpose of preventing the State from acquiring land and setting itself up as a land agent or landlord. Secondly, we should give great attention to the protection of the individual. There is a third consideration, of course, and that is that the Commonwealth has power withoutunduehindrance to acquire land for the benefit of the comreview clause 32 and consider whether munity as a whole. In times of emergency, that power is derived from the National Security Eegulations, and it has been availed of freely in the past. The problem may be considered also on a legal basis, and there is a tendency on occasions such as this to treat the problem purely from that point of view. It is one which affects the community so widely tkat it really becomes a human problem. If we confine ourselves too much to the Ifr. Mackinnon. legal aspects of the measure, we might miss some of its undesirable features. provides that acquisition must be made on just terms. Honourable membars on this side of the House are pleased to note that clause 28 makes definite provision for just terms. However, although I am not a lawyer, I suggest that that clause tends to cast on the court of jurisdiction the onus of determining, in certain cases, the legality of the proposed legislation. That might be a weakness. The honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard), in his inimitable style, like an optimistic punter trying to select winners for the following Saturday's races, took the measure, as it were, blindfolded, put a pin on one clause, and selected the clause appertaining to the powers of delegation. I had some qualms about the powers of delegation that were embodied in clause 59. I consulted my learned colleague, the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Joske), who assured me that the power of delegation would not be effective, except in cases where agreement had been arrived at between the vendor and the Crown. I 'accept h.fe judgment on that matter. I refer now to clause 32, which seeks to fix at 3 per cent, the interest rate on deposits when the payment cannot be made immediately to the claimant. I know that the existing act prescribes this fixed rate of interest, but it seems to me that it would he far more appropriate to apply the current rate of interest, because there might be occasions' when, due to difficulty in proving title and because of involved questions in relation to estates, the interest would amount to a very considerable sum. I suggest that the Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes) it should be altered to fix a rate of interest between, say, the current rate on government securities and that on hank overdrafts. The bill makes no provision in respect of one matter, which should be brought to the attention of the House. Provision should be made to prevent the acquisition and retention of land if it has not been used for the specified purpose within a certain period of time, and the original vendor or vendors should be given the right to repurchase the property at the original price, subject to any adjustment for the improvement or deterioration of their former property. It is not the function of the State to set itself up as a landowner or speculator, nor is it right or proper that the State should seek, perhaps with difficulty, to justify its acquisition by ""vesting tie acquired propthat the Ministry of Agriculture, erty in a department other than that for which the acquisition was originally made, or in a statutory body, for an entirely different purpose. A transaction of this type from which we in Australia could learn a valuable lesson occurred recently in Great Britain. Certain unsavoury features of the acquisifindings of the inquiry, the Minister, tion caused a public outcry which culminated in the rather regrettable event of the resignation of a minister, an event which, I am sure, the public and, it might be mentioned also, certain Government backbenchers would deplore. The property concerned was known as Crichel Down, in the county of Dorset. In 1937 it was acquired compulsorily by the Air Ministry for use as a bombing range, but in 1940 that ministry, which no longer required it, transferred it to the Ministry of Agriculture. In fact, the property had never been used as a bombing range, and one of the original three vendors, an ex-naval officer, who was one of the bulldog breed imbued with the spirit of Nelson, wanted his land back. It was suggested that the original vendors should be allowed to repurchase the property at a fair price. However, the Agricultural Lands Commission, which was .a corporate body under the administration of the Ministry of Agriculture, thought otherwise, having set its mind on establishing a model farm with this windfall that had come to it from the Air Ministry. Although the establishment of the model farm would have cost vast sums of public money, the Agricultural Lands Commissionthis doubtful progeny of the Ministry of Agriculture-pursue d its merry course. The murmurs of protest gradually became increasingly audible and led to an inquiry, as a result of which very definite monwealth's occupancy. Such a provifindings were made. The plan for the establishment of a .model farm, like several other well-known examples of lunatic socialist theory such as the Gambia eggs scheme, the East African groundnuts project and the Queensland sorghum scheme, was found to be financially unsound. It is even more arresting to note that this fact had been concealed from the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries. It was not revealed to him instead of paying £20,000 of public money for the equipment of the model farm for the use of a model tenant, could have sold the property to the original owners, who had established reputations as first-class farmers, for £21,000. To cap this extraordinary sequence of events, and in the face of the acting on the advice of departmental officers, announced that the negotiations with the prospective new tenant had gone too far to be revoked; so the gallant ex-naval gentleman and his two colleagues were left in the air. As I have stated, the result was that the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries resigned. I for one should like to see inserted in this measure a clause that would prevent a repetition of such an occurrence, at least in relation to lands acquired by the Commonwealth. This is not an imaginary situation. Certain Commonwealth departments at present hold lands .that are not being used for the purposes for which they were acquired, and, in fact, are not being used at all. In the interests of the community and of common justice to the original vendors, the former owners should now be given the right to repurchase those properties at fair prices. I suggest for the Minister's consideration the insertion, in clause 48, which deals with the disposal of land vested in the Commonwealth, of a :new sub-clause to provide that where any land acquired by compulsion is found to be surplus to the purpose or not used for the specific purpose for which it was acquired, within a period of, say, five years, it shall he disposed of .by giving to the vendor or his executors a right of repurchase at the original purchase price, with an adjustment for any improvement -or damage that occurred during the Comsion would recognize the rights <of the individual and would curb the accumulament or compulsorily, and, to me as a laytion, at public expense, of large areas of man, it is very interesting that the Crown land that would serve no useful purpose. may compulsorily acquire land from the I compliment the Minister on the Crown. I leave it to the lawyers to sort thoroughness with which the bill has out that mix-up. It is a little beyond my been prepared. It deals with a number comprehension. of matters that are not dealt with in the existing act. Although certain powers of accord with the purpose of the measure delegation under clause 59 are not insofar as it improves upon the existing embodied in the existing act, they are act, by replacing it and bringing into practical and I am sure that they will not action machinery designed to prevent the be abused. I ask the Minister to consider unjust exploitation of persons who own the matters that I have mentioned, land. Under the law of New South Wales, especially the redrafting of clause 32.

The title of the bill indicerned only with obtaining land for cates that its purpose is to make provision returned soldiers at the lowest possible for the acquisition by the Commonwealth price. Such an argument is fundaof land required for public purposes and mentally dishonest and unsound. I am for dealing with land so acquired. The most anxious that ex-servicemen shall deiinition of "" Crown land"" in clause receive a fair deal, but a government 5 is most interesting to me as a layman. that adopts in legislation a corruptand It is as follows:"" Crown land "" means land the property of a prices, even for the benefit of returned State., but docs not include an interest of a person other than the State in land the prosoldiers, sets a precedent in legislation perty of a State; Clause 6, which prescribes the modes of Associated with such a proposal is a prinacquisition of land, reads(1.)

129,"Mr Drummond (New England) In 1942. Subsequently, Under Protest, It","of transport, and all that he possesses may be taken from him at less than its value. This measure is legislation of a type that many people have argued should be introduced so that the terms of placitum (xxxi) of section 51 of the Australian Constitution may be binding in a sphere over which the Commonwealth has a great deal of control and influence. This provision in the Constitution is known as the just terms provision, and it ensures that a person shall not be dispossessed of his property unless he receives compensation on just terms. Strangely enough, though that provision in the Constitution binds the Commonwealth it does not bind the States. Ho State government is bound by any such provision. It is high time that what is binding upon the Crown in the Commonwealth should be equally binding upon the Crown in the State, and that when an attempt is made in a State to pursue policies of this kind, which are basically dishonest and unsound, the people of that State should have recourse to their sovereign right to demand that the courts shall enforce the provision in the Constitution to which I have referred. Plainly, we have arrived at a stage when many of the ordinary sanctions which are regarded as being effective safeguards of our liberty are no longer effective. That is proven by the experience of citizens of New South Wales whose land has been taken from them and who have been paid in depreciated money. A person who is paid 1942 values, pius 15 per cent., for his property and invests that money either in some other business or with the object of providing an income will find, if he compares the value of money to-day with that of money in 1942, that he has been paid half, or a little more than half, of the sum to which he is entitled. In 1942, the index rose by approximately 1,000 points to the order of 2,100 points. That indicates the measure of depreciation that has occurred since that year. Nevertheless, the Crown takes land from a person and pays to him for it half its value at the existing market price. Such a practice confers no benefit upon the soldier settler. He lives in the country and is subject to the effects of its laws; and if rotten and corrupt laws are passed, sooner or later he will be hit. Moreover, ex-servicemen did not fight to have unjust laws put upon the statute-book, even if such laws prove temporarily to be to their advantage. That is what has been going on in New South Wales ever since the Government of that State decided that it would be not an agent State but a principal State. Three of the States elected to be agent States. The Australian Government advanced money .to them, and, so far as 1 know, the scheme was administered by the departments of lands in those States acting in conjunction with officers of this Government. New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria preferred to take another course. I ask myself, as I believe every honourable member is entitled to ask himself, why the late Mr Curtin, when he was Prime Minister, gave to the States the option to become either agent States for the Commonwealth or to remain as principal States, expending money on war service land settlement, which they obtained, not by agreement but as a part of their general share of loan raisings as members of the Australian Loan Council. On that point, two things suggest themselves to me. Either there existed in the minds of constitutional authorities at that time a grave doubt about whether the Australian Government, could make legislation of this kind effective against the States; or Mr Curtin may have had a real fear, which was perfectly reasonable, that it was undesirable that the Australian Government, if such a course could be avoided, should invade another of those fields which, under the Constitution, are exclusively spheres of State administration. It is acknowledged that the Anstralian Government is responsible for the repatriation of ex-service personnel. This measure is an acknowledgment of that fact. Following World WarI . , the Australian Government worked with the States as principal States. Then, Mr Curtin offered the States the alternative of becoming agent States. But those States which elected to act as agent States entered into a binding agreement with the Australian Government similar to the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. I was wondering whether that course was followed in order to make sure beyond peradventure that there could be no come back on the part of the States that would detrimentally affect this scheme. Nobody desires more than I do to see enforced the placitum of the Constitution that provides for the acquisition of land on just terms. If that provision were made binding upon the States in schemes of this kind it would prevent the downright, veritable blackr mail of people who are forced to dispose of their land and accept payment in depreciated money when, if they disposed of their land on the open market it would fetch not an excessive amount but a sum that would compensate them for the decrease of purchasing power of money to-day compared with that of money in 1942. Under a corrupt and unjust law in New South Wales persons have been despoiled of just compensation in respect of land which has been taken from them. . In order to head off suggestions which may be made by members of the Opposition, I point out that some of the greatest land-owners in that State have voluntarily come forward and literally given their land away whilst others have made their land available at very low prices because they wanted to make a contribution for the benefit of men who had fought in defence of this coimtry. That was their particular decision, and they deserve credit for acting in that way. No government has a right to dispossess persons of their land for less than its value when they think they can use it to advantage. A government has no more right to apply dishonest and unsound, principles in the acquisition of land than it has in any other kind of transaction. I am pleased that this measure has been introduced and I . trust it will be fully effective. Its introduction is long overdue. If the Australian Government has the power, which the introduction of the measure implies that it has, the sooner this bill becomes operaadministered, the transaction dragged on tive the better it will be for everybody concerned, and for the good name of the State of New South Wales. I trust that the implementation of this measure will not involve the establishment of a huge department to administer the land which is taken over, or that the administration will be centralized in Canberra. The administration of this scheme should be decentralized and, to a Mr Drummond'. large degree, left to the departments of lands in the various States. The department in New South Wales has; a tradition of capable service, and I believe that tradition will be maintained' if that department is entrusted as far as is practicable with the implementation of this measure in that State. The honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Whitlam) dealt with land values and the rate of interest payable in respect of acquisitions. Speaking with some knowledge of administration, in matters of this kind, I believe that one of the greatest of the injustices that are constantly being meted out to decent citizens in this country arises in respect of th° payment of moneys for lands which have been acquired by the Crown. I realize that in some instances, in the public interest, the Crown must act swiftly. In such cases, a government cannot afford to dicker around in bringingparties into agreement with it. But very often, after land has been acquired, years drag on before final payment is made and in the interim the person whose land has been acquired is paid interest at the rate of 3 per cent. Persons who have been deprived of their places of business or. perhaps, a site for a home, are kept waiting while the Crown pays interest at a rate which has no relation to the ruling rate. Charges can be made against eveiy government in this respect. It. appears to me that public officers, no doubt with the best intentions in the world, develop a sort of philosophy which leads; them to believe that their business is to stalk the prey and kill it with the least possible effort or expenditure of ammunition. My attention has been directed to instance after instance in which, after the process of resumption passed out of the department which 1 and private individuals were black-mailed into accepting a price altogether too low, or were forced to appeal to the Land Valuation Court, which involved them, in further expenditure, or were paid in interest a sum completely disproportionate to the total value of the .property acquired or werepaid interest at a rate that had no relation to the prevailing' rate. For these reasonsIbelievp that this measure should be amended in order to provide that in instances in which land is resumed interest shall be payable at the rate prevailing in respect of overin other forms of ownership, State or drafts. If that were done it would have the effect of making departments accelerate tlie'Completion of transactions of this kind. Provision is made in this measure for the payment of interest at the rate of 3 per cent. Let 113 assume that land upon which a person has built a home is acquired. He wants the purchase money as soon as possible for the purpose .of building a home on another site. He has adequate security to offer to a prospective lender, who knows that eventually the money will be forthcoming, but for such accommodation that man has to pay interest at the rate of 5 per -cent., that is the rate on overdraft, or even at a higher rate. In tlie meantime, he is receiving interest from the Crown at the miserable rate of 3 per cent. The House should not agree to that provision. The bill should provide for payment of interest at a reasonable .rate having regard to the rate prevailing in the community. Certain cases arise in which the Crown is not to blame for delay that occurs, but in an overwhelming number of cases these transactions drag on interheard and determined impartially before minably and persons are left without their capital and, in the meantime, are obliged to accept interest at a miserable rate. As the object of this measure is to rectify one injustice that is being perboth sides of the chamber to the effect petrated at least in New South Wales under unjust legislation of that State, I trust that we shall not perpetrate another injustice under this measure. Apart from that objection, I commend the bill and again express my pleasure that it has been introduced. bill is a perfect illustration of the inevitable conflict that arises at some point between the individual and the State. In some types of political thinking in modern times, it has regrettably become fashionable to look with contempt upon the right to acquire possessions and to hold them undisturbed. Such action, one might say, is regarded as a violation of some ethical concept. What is not generally appreciated is that those who R -[8 ] felt it proper to deprive individuals by legislative action of property rights could do so only by distributing that property private; and if any Christian or other ethical precept were at stake, those who cried loudest for compulsion were probably guilty of the greatest violation. It is refreshing to see that honourable members opposite in general seem to recognize now, although it could not always be said of them, that so long as society is organized in such a way as to give the individual some freedom to act fpr himself, and some freedom to choose which of a number of material objects he wants in preference to others, then for so long must we respect, to a greater or lesser degree, his right to hold property. One of the distinguishing features of our democracy has always been a tendency to avoid a tyranny of the majority -that majority which we elect to form a government-and to preserve the rights of the minority, often of one man, because we realize that actions taken in the sacred name of the majority of people may leave some very oppressive results. We preserve, in what we call the rule of law, this right of men to have their grievances courts., I lead up in that way to the bill at present before the House, because some suggestions have been put forward on that access to the courts should be avoided, and that a panel of valuers or some other persons not trained and not subject to the same judicial impartiality of the bench, should determine rates of compensation. I hope I have made the point clear that at no stage should.we deprive any individual of his right of access to the courts of the land, because that right is a fundamental part of our democracy. The Minister is to be commended on his method of presenting this bill to the House. It is a most refreshing departure from procedures which, regrettably, have grown up in this chamber over many years. We have had a long time in which to consider the details of this hill. The Minister has promised, and I hope, having in mind some suggestions",37,Hughes
130,Mr Freeth (Forrest) [5.29],"Thiswbich I shall make in a few minutes, that he w ill recall that promise, to recommend the appointment of a select committee to examine some of the minor details of the bill before it passes through thc committee stage. Some of the problems involved are so important that I consider the appointment of a select committee would be completely justified. I am sure that all honourable members have noticed the tendency to bring the second-reading debate on a bill to completion, possibly exhaustively, possibly not so exhaustively, and then to rush the bill through the committee stage, often expediting the passage of the measure by considering it as a whole instead of clause by clause. I hope that such a practice w ill not be followed on this occasion. I trust that plenty of time w ill be devoted to the consideration of this bill in committee, and that p r i vate members w ill be given the opportunity, if the Government does not indicate that it is prepared to submit amendments, to make slight amendments which may have quite far-reaching affects. I desire to deal f a i r l y briefly with one is an undesirable feature. A t the very or two proposals at this stage. The first one to which I direct attention arises from clause 19, dealing with the making, acceptance and rejection of claims for compensation. There is a time l i m it in which claims must be served on the Minister. Sub-clause (2.) reads as follows:A claim sliall be served on the Minister within one hundred and twenty days after the dnte of acquisition or within snch further time as the Minister allows. It seems to me hardly necessary to insert a time l i m it in that clause. The Minister may say, in reply, "" ""Well, we want to get the claims brought to answer to that is, if the Minister is not satisfied with the speed at which claims are coming forward when he acquires a property, he himself is at liberty, under clause 26, to take action to have the matter determined by a court. So there seems to be no real object in imposing, in respect of the rights of individual owners, a time within which claims must be brought before the Minister. It may also be argued that the Minister is keen to get before him all conflicting claims where two or three people claim an Mr Freeth. interest in land, and that, therefore, it is desirable to impose a time limit . Again, the Minister and the department seem to be perfectly covered by clause 19 (3.) ( b ) , which reads as follows:Compensation is not payable to a person in respect of an interest in land acquired under this Act by compulsory process if(6) the interest is inconsistent with an interest claimed by another person in respect of whicli thc Minister has, in good faith, paid or agreed to pay compensation. In other words, it hardly seems necessary to prescribe a time l i m it when the Minister is covered in that way. In any event, if it is still regarded as desirable to impose a time l i m it within which property owners must make their claims, then I hardly think that any extension of time should be completely within the discretion of the Minister; because if our purpose in this legislation is to protect the rights of individuals, and I imagine that this Government is eager to do so, then it is delivering the individual, metaphorically speaking, into the hand of ministerial discretion, and that, I think, least, if the time l i m it is set, it should be open to the court before which the claims are decided to allow such further time, according to such justification as' is advanced to it , within whicli a claim may be presented. I suggest that the Minister should examine that particular clause. The next clause to which I direct attention deals with interest rates. This subject has been mentioned by the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Mackinnon) and the honourable member for Werriwa( MrW h it l a m ) . I agree that the rate of 3 per cent., which is fixed finality"". The by this bill, seems to be too low. The point that has not yet been mentioned is that the court can order a higher rate of interest in the terms of clause 28 if , in the opinion of the court, just terms of acquisition require a higher rate of in terest. But I think that, if it is the desire of the Minister to speed up the acquisition of land and property, and the payment for it , a higher rate of interest should be an incentive to the department. I agree that the Minister, if he sets the rate of interest too high, may deter persons from pressing their claims, because tbey may bave a very good investment; but in some way or otber, a balance could be struck. Tbis matter would be suitable for examination by the select committee to which I have already referred. ' Another point that I wish to raise is possibly rather a technical one. It deals with the question of conflicting claims, particularly in regard to mortgages, where land acquired by the Commonwealth is subject to a mortgage or other charge. Reference is made in clauses 41 to 44 to the rights of mortgagees. In all cases, it is suggested that the moneys duo to mortgagees w ill be paid by the Commonwealth. This point requires very careful consideration, because it could possibly happen that moneys may be due but not recoverable at law. In other words, if the Statute of Limitations had expired in regard to interest or other moneys payable under a mortgage, it would be a most peculiar incidence of this legislation if those moneys due but not recoverable at law were to be revived by the acquisition of the land by the Commonwealth. [ suggest that the Commonwealth must take care that it does not do anything to make money recoverable between two parties which would not otherwise be recoverable. As I have said, this is a technical matter. I suggest that it would be appropriate for consideration by a select committee. I also desire to refer in somewhat greater detail to clause 48, which deals with the disposal by the Commonwealth of land which is no longer required for immediate use by it . Reference has been made by the honourable member for Corangamite to the Crichel Down case in England, in which it was established as the policy of the government at the time that, in future, there would be no transfers of land from one government department to another but that so far as possible the land would be sold back to the former owner at current market prices as assessed by the district valuer. responsible Minister of the day, Sir Thomas Dugdale, resigned over the matter. I note some variation between the suggestion of the honourable member for Corangamite and the policy of the British Government. The honourable member suggested that the land should be returned at the price at which it had been acquired, and the British Government proposed to return the land at the current market price. That is a matter on which I do not propose to comment, but, again, I suggest that it is a point which should be examined carefully by this Government-whethe r or not it is desirable to embody in the legislation a mere matter of policy of this particular Government, and whether or not it is desirable to leave it free for successive governments to do things which we might now regard as oppressive and unjust. 1 think, when I make that statement, that I am speaking for the whole House. The final point I wish to make is that nowhere in this bill is a direction given to the Government against the acts of future socialist governments, if there ever conies such a day, in regard to government instrumentalities. Imagine the Commonwealth Bank coming to a decision that the head oflice of the Bank of New South ""Wales would make a desirable jjroperty for the purpose of carrying on its banking business. Sof a r as I know there is nothing in this bill, or in any other legislation tion, to prevent, for instance the Commonwealth Bankf r o m acquiring land and premises occupied by the Bank of New South Walesi n order to establish a branch of the Commonwealth Bank. There are parallel cases in respect of airlines. So far a.3 I know there is nothing in the legislation to prevent Trans-Australia Airlinesf r o m acquiring land and premises occupied by rival private airlines. The carrying on of such a business could be regarded, under the law, as a function of the Commonwealth, and after payment of compensation the airline, bank or other business concerned, which was so evicted, would be at liberty to carry on its business elsewhere, but it would, have been deprived The of a substantial degree of its goodwill and have been put to a great degree of inconvenience. I appreciate that those are matters which the court would have to take into consideration in assessing tbe compensation to be paid, but I suggest that there should be some distinction",40,Hughes
131,Mr Whitlam,O r in the Constitution.,42,Hughes
132,Mr Freeth,"O r in the Constitudrawn in this legislation between land and property required for the legitimate purposes of the Commonwealth, as a government, and land or property that may be required merely for the purpose of a Commonwealth instrumentality. I mention that point because 1 consider that we on this side of the House, at any rate, are committed to a policy of protecting individuals and private businesses from unjust intrusions on their private affairs. I suggest that if any committee is appointed to examine this legislation, or indeed if thnt matter is regarded as a far-reaching question of policy, the Minister himself should take up the point with Cabinet, and agree to some protective measure being inserted in. the legislation. Tho return of land after it has been acquired and then not needed for that purpose is a very live question, particularly in Western Australia at the moment. We have in that State a government which has done things in the name of land resumption for government purposes which are even more shameful than the actions of the New South Wales Government which have been the object of considerable criticism in this House. The Western Australian Government has embarked on large speculation in land. It has acquired huge areas of land for housing projects at a nominal rate, and has established building schemes in which sites have been set aside for shopping areas. It has later resold that land in shopping areas to people on the understanding that they are to have a complete monopoly of the business, and has then exacted a tremendous price by auction from the purchasers. In other words, the Western Australian Government has become a large-scale land speculator. There is a Case in my own electorate of land having been resumed for the purposes of a school thirteen years ago. There is no likelihood nf a school being built there for many years. The person from whom the land was resumed has not yet been paid one penny in compensation. All those things show how necessary it is for us to be careful in respect of actions taken Ly governments in the name of a majority of the people;, which are oppressive to aminority. Mr Freeth. tern Australian Government sold the land at a loss in some of these cases it would be called incompetent? in any event that is the responsibility of that Government. If a government cares to embark on land speculation it should take the political consequences either way. I say that a government that does speculate in land should not be the winner all the time. I have, I think, sufficiently indicated the dangers of placing too large a power in the hands of any government, even though it does purport to aet on behalf of the majority of the people. Minister for the Interior and Minister for Works) [5.49] -in replyI wish to thank honourable members very sincerely for the manner in. which the bill has been debated in the second-reading stage. As I said at the beginning of my second-reading speech,. I realize that this legislation will affectthe rights of, perhaps, 50 per cent, of the private citizens of this country. Eor that reason, copies of the bill, and explanations of its provisions, were distributed widely, not only to honourable members but also to the Attorney-General in each State and to interested bodies, for study during the parliamentary recess. As a result, I have received a certain number of suggestions from authoritative sources. During the debate many honourable members have advanced other suggestions, some of which I think are valuable, and which I should like to consider carefully. Many of them might be incorporated so as to improve the measure. 1 think that it is the objective of every honourable member to try to make this bill a model lands acquisition bill for all State governments to follow. It is not within our power to compel them to do' so, but we can at least try to set a good' example. The bill is mainly concerned witb administrative matters. Any suggestions for improving the machinery of lands acquisition, other than those which have been already included in the bill will be. so far as I am concerned, very welcome.. I do not propose, therefore, to proceed with the usual method of debating the bill",42,Hughes
133,Mr Pollard,I suppose if the Wes,43,Hughes
134,Mr Eeeeth,"It possibly would, but.",43,Hughes
135,Mr Kent Hughes (Chisholm,"in committee at the end of the second reading debate. I propose instead to move for the adjournment of the debate in committee on clause 1, so that honourable members who have made suggestions can have further time to consider the matter and arrange to submit amendments for discussion in committee. There are one or two observations that 1 should like to make regarding some of the proposals that have been made by lionorable members. One concerns the interest rate. That has always been laid down on the basis of the short-term bond rate, not on what might be said to be the long-term bond rate. The reason for that is that if the interest rate is too high some people have no real incentive to come to a. settlement, either by agreement or through court procedure, on the compensation to he paid. Therefore, interest has always been paid on the short-term bond rate values. That principle was recently upheld by the High Coiirt in a case in Sydney, I think it was the Grace Brothers case, concerning property which was acquired during the war. I think there is considerable justice and value in the suggestions that have heen made with regard to the disposal of property that the Government acquires, but does' not use for the purposes for which it was acquired. I think, however, that some distinction must be made, for instance, between property required by the services for the purposes of defence and property acquired for other Commonwealth purposes. For instance, the Navy might consider it desirable to acquire a certain property in. connection with a harbour or port, which may not come into use for many years later. On the other hand, in the past acquisitions have been made for certain purposes, but in the long run policy has been altered, and buildings or projects have not been proceeded with. As a matter of ministerial administration I have been operating during the last two or three years on thc basis that where a property had not been required for use within five years of its compulsory acquisition, the previous owner should have the first right to regain it at. a. reasonable valuation. However, when a property, has been sold by agreement there is, perhaps, not the. same claim for priority for the owner, because he agreed to sell and received the price that he asked for the property. There, again, Ave may perhaps strike another administrative difficulty. If a provision to deal with such cases were inserted in the bill people would all decide to have their properties acquired compulsorily, because there would be no point in coming to a voluntary agreement. I mention that to show some of the technical difficulties with which we shall be faced if we put clauses of that nature into the bill, i do not wish it to be suggested, however, that I am against the inclusion of such provisions in the bill. If the Parliamentary draftsman can meet that position, and overcome the technical difficulties, I have no objection, and I do not think the Government will have any objection, to a. clause of that nature being inserted. Various other suggestions have been made. The honourable member for Forrest( Mr Freeth) made a suggestion regarding acquisitions by government instrumentalities. I have been asked by several government instrumentalities to acquire land compulsorily. On the principle of "" No names, no pack d r ill "" I sliall not mention them by name. In most of those cases I thought the proposal was entirely wrong. They were trading concerns, and therefore, should operate in the same way as other trading concerns operate, and should not be able to acquire sites in the best positions in towns OT cities, or anywhere else, just because the Commonwealth has the power to acquire land for Commonwealth purposes. wealth Bank one of them? "" No names, no pack d r ill "" . In some cases they asked for compulsory acquisition because there were difiiculties in respect of the land title. That same difficulty applies to any other trading concerns which have to overcome it. I think that is another suggestion which, is very reasonable, and should receive the closest consideration. I do not wish to deal with all the suggestions advanced. I am merely mentioning a few of the outstanding ones.",43,Hughes

143,"Lawrence, W. R. Dr. Evatt (Barton","Leade r of theto the situation confronting the world to-day. He has no positive plan for promoting peace in South-East Asia, East Asia or elsewhere. On the contrary, his approach is almost entirely negative. It is the old method, the use of force. Of course, ih self-defence force is required, but there must always be a readiness, a willingness and an eagerness to settle disputes without recourse to force. The Prime Minister claims that he supports the Charter of the TJnited Nations. In view of his public utterances during his period of office, he can hardly be reckoned as a very strong supporter of the United Nations, because he has so often damned it with faint praise. I want to test the matter in this way. The Charter imposes on every member of the United Nations a definite obligation to settle international disputes by peaceful means. Then Article 33 provides that parties to any international dispute threatening peace or security shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, or by inquiry, or by mediation, or by conciliation, or by arbitration, or by judicial settlement, or by resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or by resort to other peaceful means. A great variety of methods is suggested in that binding and primary article of the Charter, each of them connoting an attempt to prevent the necessity to resort to force. All those methods are to be regarded as conditions preliminary to the use of force being authorized or recommended by the United Nations. I say "" authorized or recommended"" because the Prime Minister referred to the veto in the Security Council, which prevents the authorization of the use of force in the event of a veto by a permanent member of the Council. But tlie General Assembly of the United Nations'may recommend action, and its recommendation, although not binding in the full sense, is treated as an authority to poliey of the Australian Labour party any nation to act within the scope of the decision of the Assembly. During many previous debates, I have tried to point out that regional arrangements or agencies dealing with the maintenance of international peace in a region -arrangement s and agencies which are now becoming fairly numerous-ar e unlawful unless tlieir activities are, to quote the words of the Charter, ""consistent with the purposes and principles of the United Nations "". More than, that, parties to regional arrangements are commanded by the Charter to use the regional agency in order to achieve a peaceful settlement, if that is possible. So it was and is the continuing duty of the South-East Asia Treaty Organization to observe these overriding mandates. So far, there has not been even a hint of Seato acting by way of the peaceful adjustment of disputes. Surely such peaceful settlement should go hand in hand with any. preliminary planning aimed, at the use of force in self-defence within the region. In the present world situation, vastimportance attaches to the basic duty of all nations to seek the peaceful settlement of disputes. This applies whether the regional arrangement is regarded as being authorized by Article 52 of the Charter or by recourse to Article 51, which preserves the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence after an armed attack against a meniber of the United Nations bas occurred. In short, both the clear words and the overriding spirit of the United Nations Charter are based upon the principle that military force is to be resorted to only as a last expedient, and that the rule of the Charter is to command the use of every possible means of conciliation and negotiation to prevent fighting. Even when armed force has been used, conciliation should always be adopted in order to bring the fighting, if possible, to a satisfactory end in accordance with the principles of the Charter. This is not a matter of words. It is a question of fundamental policy. It should be Australia's settled approach. Between 1945, when the Charter was signed, and the end of 1949 it was the that Australia not only should assist attempts by the United Nations to prevent or stop fighting, but also should, where it thought fit, initiate United Nations action to do so. That was not only because, as a. government and as a political partu, we were pledged to the principles of the United Nations Charter, but also because, in a confused world endeavouring to adjust itself to new conditions brought into existence after the -greatest war in history, we felt, as we still feel, that the life of every man, every woman and every child is an end in itself and should not he placed in jeopardy by -the use of military force. No doubt the -Charter does authorize collective action ^by force to Tepel forcible aggression by any nation hut, to repeat what T said a moment ago, such TJnited Nations action is a rule of last resort. It should not he undertaken rashly or without investigation, and indeed should never be undertaken at all until every possible method of peaceful examination has been exhausted. So, when the Prime Minister says, as he has said in his speech, that the Charter contemplates the use of force and therefore the existence of a nation's military power, that is correct. Buti t is correct in part only. He quoted the part of the preamble to the TJnited Nations Charter which declares that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest. But the sentence from which that quotation, misleading by itself, is taken, should be read more fully. It shows the whole spirit of the Charter and proves the substance of the point I am trying to make. It is as follows:We, the peoples of the United Nations, determined to save succeeding generations from thc scourge of war which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind . . . tal human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal right of men and women and of nations large and small and . . . gress and better standards of life . . . and for these ends to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours and . . . the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods, that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest, have resolved to combine our efforts to accomplish these aims. That shows that the United Nations and its agencies are there to ensure, not only that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest, but also that the principles and methods set out in the Charter shall constitute an assurance against resort to force. while it is correct to say that Chapter VII. sets out provisions for the use by the Security Council of armed forces, Dr. Evatt. the whole of that chapter ia preceded by and conditioned by Chapter VI . , which deals with the peaceful adjustment and settlement of international disputes. Contrary to the argument of the Prime Minister, the TJnited Nations Charter puts peace and peaceful methods of settling international disputes as the first duty binding the member nations of the organization. It is about time that this more positive duty was given fuller recognition and put into regular and constant application. It is all the more necessary to emphasize it at the present time, when some people are speaking quite irresponsibly of the use of atom, hydrogen and other nuclear weapons by way of reprisal, retaliation or deterrent. I need say nothing of the sheer inhumanity of such weapons. I steadfastly believe that the evil we must all fight against is war itself, not merely the most outrageous and inhuman methods of war. Nevertheless the continuous threat exercising the minds of all men of goodwill is that, with nuclear weapons, no one can assume that a small war will not develop into a world war, or that callous, evil or frightened men will not become "" trigger happy"" and, in order to prevent or win a world war, direct the use of nuclear weapons, thus sentencing humanity and perhaps the fabric of the world to complete destruction. to re-affirm faith in fundamenI n any realistic examination of foreign affairs we must take into account the fact that we cannot go back to the to promote social proway of peace or even to the way of war which existed before the first atom bomb was exploded at Hiroshima. We have to ensure, by reached, so to speak, a point of no return in world affairs. Those who drafted the United Nations Charter at San Francisco had finished their work in June, 1945, some months before the first atom bomb was exploded. It is said that the latest nuclear weapons may cause immeasurable loss of life, destroy or atrophy the generative functions of mankind, and wreak 25,000 times as much physical destruction as the treTherefore, mendous devastation experienced at Hiroshima. It has recently been said that no effective civilian defence against such bombs is possible in the greater and most beautiful cities of tbe world. That may well be true. But it is certain that man w ill never consent to be exiled indefinitely from the home he has won for himself and his family. This all adds up to the uttermost crisis in human affairs. Australia, as well as other nations, must face that fact. I now desire to cite the words of two of the greatest men of the atomic age. The first of those men is the late Albert Einstein, the gveat mathematician, and the second is Bertrand Russell, perhaps the greatest philosopher of this day. Just before his death Einstein saidThe unleashed power of the atom hae changed everything save our modes of thinking, and thus we drift towards unparalleled catastrophe. It is the mind of man and his courage, initiative, perseverance and endurance which alone can save us. The present crisis of humanity must colour every question of international policy. modes of thinking have to keep pace with the developments of physical science, otherwise destruction will afflict not one nation alone, but all of mankind. Bertrand Bussell has saidFor countless ages the sun rose and set, the barities and cruelties were committed in moon waxed and waned, tlie stars shone in the night, but it was only with the coming of Man that those things were understood. In the great world of astronomy and in the little world of the atom, Man has unveiled secrets whicli might have been thought undiscoverable. In art and literature and religion, some men have shown a sublimity of feeling which makes the snecics worth preserving. Is all this to end in trivial horror because so few are able to think of Man rather than of this or that group of men? Is our race so destitute of wisdom, so incapable of impartial love, so blind even to the simplest dictates of self preservation, that the last fruit of its silly cleverness is to be the extermination of all life within our area and within our jurisdicon our planet?-for it will be not only men who perish but also the animals and plants, whom no one can accuse of communism or of anti-communism. I am well aware that the retort, implied not only tells us how international disi f not uttered, of those who speak of putes should be settled, how international massive retaliation by the use of nuclear conflict should be averted or brought to weapons, is that we or our friends are an end, and how international aggression invariably in the right and that it is can be put down by collective action, but always Bussia or China which is really it also tells us hoAv we. as a nation, should to blame. It is obvious that Russia and behave. Moreover, it indicates how every China have from time to time, whether nation should behave. It is a code of in the councils of the TJnited Nations or conduct for the nations-, as well as being a outside them, acted from injustice, folly charter. and unwisdom. Nonetheless, those controlling the affairs of other countries, have also been partly to blame. It takes two to make a quarrel. It fakes many parties to make a cold war, in which material assets are so readily allocated to the manufacture of weapons of destruction which become either obsolete or obsolescent as soon as they have been completed. In international affairs, permanent blame and permanent error cannot be attributed to any one nation or group of nations. The instinct of self preservation and the dictates of common humanity show that to be true. The war-time atrocities committed by our major enemies in World War II . are not forgotten by all. Yet to-day the Western democracies seek allies among those who between 1939 and 1945 were characterized as beyond human redemption. In that war, millions of Russians, more than the entire population of Our present-day Australia, were killed in action or died of wounds. The great leader of the United States forces, General Marshall, said that those men must have imposed their bodies between their homeland and the enemy and that largely by that means their nation survived. BarWorld War II . on so vast a scale that punishment for war crimes was, for the first time, adopted by conquerors. The truth is simple enough. In time of war Ave witness sublimity of courage, fortitude and endurance to the end. Yet qualities of cruelty and Avickedness also degrade some men to the level of the beasts. The time has come when Australia, facing the possibility of a total war with nuclear Aveapons, should take the initiative tion, so f a r as it extends to help to bring peace to the nations of Asia and possibly the world. Such a war must injure or destroy us. The United Nations Charter1 A prime purpose of the United Nations is to develop friendly relations among the nationsI repeat those words-friendl y relations among tlie nations. We are saddened by tragedies that occur in our own neighbourhood, such as the death of a child on the roads, but when disasters occur in other parts of the world such as at Hiroshima, and -thousands of people are killed, the tendency of mankind is quickly to pass over that affair and forget the distant scene. The Charter regards all nations as having equal rights. It recognizes the basic right of peoples to determine for themselves their own government and the form of that government. It requires each member to settle its disputes with any or every other nation by peaceful means in order not to endanger international peace. There are many who claim, and I also refer to some Australians, that Australia can do little or nothing in international affairs. I deny that. I say that between 1945 ancl 1949 many disputes occurred in the world, and some of those were dealt with on a basis of justice and equity by the United Nations, and decisions were arrived at. In some of those disputes Australia took a prominent and sometimes effective part as mediator. We had no axe to grind, and we followed the light of justice and simple humanity. We were convinced that those whose lives were lost in faraway Palestine, or in nearby Indonesia, were just as precious to their own loved ones as were Australians killed in the desperate fighting in the two world wars, or in Korea. Many of those disputes were settled or prevented by conciliation or agreement. People said-and governments in Australia will always have critics, even the present Government has some-""What, has Australia to do with Israel and the problem of Palestine? "" It had this much to do with it. that in the event of a. failure by the United Nations a general war throughout the Middle East might well have occurred,' aud Australia could easily have been involved for the third time in recent history. So, too, with Indonesia. Again we were criticized, especially by those who were quite ready to lay down the axiom that no colonial power should be permitted to hand over the right of Dr. Evatt. self-government to its colonists. In spite of the criticism we went on with the job. In the end conciliation triumphed. Probably that settlement saved a million lives in Indonesia. So, both Israel and Indonesia became members of the United Nations on the nomination of Australia. As it turned out, these were the last two nations admitted. Six years have elapsed, and not a single nation has since been admitted. That is largely owing to tbe bitterness and obstinacy of those who think that it is wrong to make a plain, sensible agreement with rivals or opponents in what is called a "" cold war"". .'But whether agreement is reached or not, the really unpardonable thing is to abandon thc duty-the United Nations duty-of trying to settle disputes. It is never wrong to try to settle disputes. One by-product of this sombre age, this mad era of "" cold war "" plus nuclear weapons, is that the top leaders of the great Powers have not met in council Together for nearly ten years. To me that omission is unpardonable. I have repeatedly advocated such meetings. J took the initiative to bring one. about in 194S-49 when I was President of the General Assembly of the United Nations, iind acted in close concert with Trygvie Lie, Secretary-General, who did such i> magnificent and non-partisan job for world peace, and received recognition from so few. I have always advocated meetings of the political heads of the great Powers in order to thrash out their differences around a conference tahle and try to reduce the area of disagreement. Those who demanded such meetings were disregarded. But two years ago Winston Churchill took up the running. He was supported by conservative newspapers which, until then, hnd frowned upon such meetings. So far no meeting has been held. A study of the means by which the Churchill proposal was half-welcomed but gradually put into the temporary discard, will repay the careful student of international affairs. The Prime Minister's speech completely failed to takn into account a spirit which is gradually sweeping the world of to-day as the implieations of the atomic age affect and influence the most casual and the least imaginative. At times the fear of desperate ruin to man is succeeded by the new hope based on the will of mankind towards peaceful co-operation. Bertrand Russell has saidL would have men forget tlieir quarrels fur a moment and reflect that, if thcy w ill allow themselves to survive, there is every reason to expect tliu triumphs of the future to exceed immeasurably the triumphs of the past. There lies before us, if we choose, continual Kai-shek, Roosevelt and Churchill. It progress in happiness, knowledge and wisdom. Shall we, instead, choose death, because we cannot forget our quarrels? I appeal, as a human being to human beings; remember your humanity, and forget the rest. If you eun do so, the way lies open to a new Paradise; if you cannot, nothing lies before you but universal death"". It seems to me that, in the plain and direct speech on world affairs that Mr Potsdam agreement of 1945 and, later Attlee delivered at Vancouver on his recent lecture tour, he was inspired by the spirit of this age, which spirit I am trying to describe. He was frank and courageous. He struck the note of urgency as he warned of the danger of world war. That is the note that must lie struck. That is the note for which I believe the people are now listening, and which they want. He declared that the Western world must live with Communist countries. It has been living with them ever since the Russian revolution, and it will probably continue to live with them for many years in the future. It was Mr Attlee's belief that common ground with the Soviet could be found. At any rate, he said that he would continue to try to find it. He referred to the problem of Communist China, or continental China, which is just as good a description of it. Both terms are correct. If Mr Attlee's view is right-h e said this iu Australia, too-the new government of the continent has had success in important directions where Chiang Kai-shek has failed. However, Chiang Kai-shek remains in. possession of Formosa and ths two disputed off-shore islands. He does so, however-and I think this is a fair way of putting it-onl y by the grace of the great military and naval forces of the United States, which originally occupied Formosa as a military operation during the war in Korea. It seems that there is no reasonable chance to-day of the Chiang Kai-shek Government ever being able to resume the government of continental China. That fact, I think, can hardly be disputed. On the other hand, the status oi Formosa has not been made definitive by general agreement among the powers concerned, including the allies of World War II . At Cairo, in 1943, there was a meeting between the leaders of China, America and Britain, namely, Chiang was solemnly declared then that all of the territories that Japan had stolen from the Chinese, such as Formosa, should be restored to the Republic of China. Of course, that was not an international agreement, but it was a statement of intention of the allied leaders. Later, similar declarations were contained in the still, in the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission at Washington. Those declarations all showed, at that time, American agreement to the assignment of Formosa to China, but it must be added that the treaty of peace with Japan was deliberately silent on the point, and that Russia and China are obviously necessary parties to any agreement dealing with the problem of Formosa itself. Some argue that Formosa is merely incidental to China, that it is part of Chinese territory, and that therefore the Formosan dispute is simply part of a civil war. I do not agree with that view, for the reality of the matter is that there is an important dispute in relation to Formosa because of the fact that the United Nations has come into the picture by its continuing agreements with the Chiang Kai-shek Government. The claims of Communist China must be resolved. Therefore, it is no longer merely a question of an incident in a civil war. Here, then, is a matter of supreme importance which is obviously one for the exercise of the United Nations jurisdiction. Even though the dispute between Comniunist China and ChiangKai-Shek might he regarded as being a domestic dispute in the nature of a civil war, the stand of the United States could not be so regarded. Because of participation by the United States in the situation or dispute, it is clearly a matter of international concern, and, therefore, the United Nations could deal with it. Then this dilemma arises: If the matter comes before the Security Council or the General Assembly, who is to be the representative of the Kepublic of China which, under the Charter itself, is already a permanent member of the TJnited Nations organization and of the Security Council? Tbat raises a very complex constitutional question with which I . do not propose to deal, except to state that it is a matter fit for peaceful adjustment, in the first instance, before the Security Council, or, if that fails because of ths exercise of the veto, before the General Assembly. In the view of the Australian Labour party, an attempt should be made-this is not the first time such an attempt has been suggested, and not the first time that it has failed-to agreement providing for the admission to the United Nations of all nations still awaiting admission. They would include Australia, Bulgaria, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Jordan, Korea, Libya, Portugal and Roumania. I mention only those thirteen nations; there are six or seven others. failure to obtain membership is the Jesuit, world, they are entitled to admission. perhaps, of the exercise by Eussia of its individual veto in the Security Council, because a nation cannot become a member of the United Nations organization except with the consent of all of the permanent members of the Security Council. Eussia has exercised the veto against a large number of those nations. But equally so, the Western powers, to some degree by way of reprisal, have refused admission to membership to nations closely associated with Eussia or satellites of Eussia. Although, I suppose, the origin of this very prolonged and wretched dispute as to membership is not of the slightest importance, the long dead-lock has gradually brought the United Nations into some disrepute. That organization was established as a genuine world organization, and to-day it certainly requires the additional members to add to its stature and strength as a representative world society. That is what it was intended to be, and that is what it must be made. If all rejected applicants were admitted, no doubt Bussia would gain a few supporters or adherents. Dr. Evatt. balance in the General Assembly would not be disturbed because, if Russia obtained three or four or five supporters, the Western powers would probably have ten or eleven or even more supporters. With regard to admission to the United Nations, it seems preposterous to challenge China's title-and I am speaking of continental China or Communist China-to United Nations membership when the nations of the world, including even the United States, are continually engaged in some sort of negotiations with China, not directly but indirectly, sometimes through the United Nations secretariat, and sometimes through some other nation, such as Great Britain, which has diplomatic relations with China. The solution of the problem of indireach top level vidual recognition of China is one for each country concerned. The decision of the Australian Labour party is that the first step towards clarifying China's Ceylon, China, status is to take action, through the United' Nations, to advocate the admission of all those nations that have been rejected, most of them frivolously, Their because, in view of their status in the In that way, the United Nations would become, as it should become, what Senator Vandenberg described as the town meeting of the world where everybody may be heard. I believe that that would contribute a great deal toward.* the easing of world tension. But far deeper than the question of recognition, judicially or diplomatically, of China by the United States is the important question of the attitude of the people of the United States towards the people of China. The interest of America in China has been active and friendly for many generations. The United States was one of the few great powers whose deliberate policy it was to minimize, or to oppose, the attempts of European nations and of the Japanese to take control over, or to seize, vital areas in continental China during the last century and the early part of this century. In the nineteenth century, we find France, Germany and Russia, and, to a lesser degree, Great Britain, exercising sovereignty or conOn the otheT hand, the trol within China and extracting special concessions from the corrupt Manchu dynasty, including the right of special concessions in matters affecting the parPresident of the Chinese Eepublic in ticular foreign country. Later, we find -Japan guilty of flagrant aggression in Korea, and making demands far bolder hnd more brutal than those of any fciiiropean country. Owing to defeat in World WarI . , German interests in China were replaced by those of Japan, which, at the same time, succeeded to Germany's interests in tbe Pacific and became the mandatory power for all of the ex-German territories north of the equator. China throughout that .period was quite unjustified when, looked at historically. It was not colonialism in the ordinary sense; it was' just that one nation went in and therefore all the others had to go in. That was the good old rule, the simple plan. Then we find that Japanese aggression followed in Manchuria in the north, and later in the south. In the north, the League of Nations failed to act, and throughout that period the one nationone amongst all, we might say-that showed any spirit of practical friendship and co-operation to the people of China was the United States. During the Boxer rebellion, indemnities had to be paid. All the nations which obtained the indemnities collected the money. The United States allocated the money Ky the grant to Chinese students of scholarships which were tenable in American universities. That explain.? the enormous influence of . American learning and culture on tlie people of China. It came to its finestflower, T think, during the presidency of the late President Eoosevelt. To America, it was not a question of tbe composition of the Chinese government. Nobody could say that the Manchu Government was anything but one of the most cori-ii pt governments in the history of China-and that is saying a great deal. But the American people and the American Government looked behind the Chinese Government to the Chinese people, and did everything that they could to help them. Two Australians played some part in those crucial years. One was a very great Australian, Dr. Morrison, Morrison"", a correspondent of The Times, who became an adviser to the 1911. The other was a newspaperman, Mr W. H . Donald, who was an adviser of Chiang Kai-shek in his early days. They became famous. What were they? They were disinterested advisers of Chinese governments, seeking entirely the good of the people. President Eoosevelt, during his second period of office, adopted towards China a policy which, in effect, continued that European encroachment in of all his predecessors, republican, democratic and otherwise. The question of admission to the United Nations, in -a sense, is vitally important to the dignity and the self-respect of nations. Good relations between the people of the United States and of China would provide one of the master keys to world peace, especially in South-East Asia. I believe that events are moving towards that end. They do not move quickly, but I believe that a situation in which good relations between the United States and China exist may come again. That is the most important problem raised in the Prime Minister's speech from the point of view of international affairs. I turn from that problem now to the situation in Malaya. The position in Malaya has some analogies with the position in Indo-China. In my view the intervention of substantial armed forces might well exacerbate the Malayan situation. What is Malaya's history? For generations the British possessions in Malaya were administered as a trusteeship, and steady progress marked the discharge of that trust. That situation was disturbed by the Japanese occupation of nearly four years. Eesistance forces were organized in the jungle and did excellent work against the Japanese. In the resistance organizations Communists became active, and their activity was actually encouraged over a considerable period hy the British forces. Many of the Communist resistance workers became the core of the guerrillas and rebels when they refused to disperse. I do not at the moment deal with the early part of tbeir history and the question of rehabilitation and gratuity. Those matters are discussed in several books to which I shall refer known as "" Chinese later. As I have stated, the situation in Malaya is similar to that in Indo-China, where Vichy Erance virtually invited the Japanese to enter. The Japanese occupied the country, and during their occupation a genuine nationalist resistance movement, which supported the allies and fought the Japanese, came into being. As it was a nationalist movement, its members after the war, were at first concerned only with attaining self-government. Why should they not have it? President Roosevelt and Mr Churchill, as he then was, in October, 1941, signed the famous Atlantic Charter, the terms of which were not limited to the Atlantic countries. The document was called the Atlantic Charter because it was signed on a ship in the Atlantic Ocean. In substance, the charter promised the peoples of the world who were seeking self-government that the allies would grant self-government, not necessarily automatically. The allies assured those nations that that was their aim. During the war there existed in Australia an organization concerned especially with what was termed psychological warfare. This term embraced the dissemination of information, the dropping of propaganda leaflets, and the like. From Australia, from India, and from all places where .British, American or Australian forces were stationed, those promises of support for the cause of self government were repeated. The people of Indo-China believed that those promises would be kept. The gravest blunder in Indo-China, as we now know, was that of delaying year after year. Gradually the Communists seized control of the nationalist forces and the consequence was the tragic events that occurred in Indo-China when the promises made by tlie great allied wax leaders were not kept. What would have happened iu India, Ceylon, Burma, Pakistan and Indonesia., which demanded tbe right to govern themselves, had they not been granted self-government? have been a thousand times worse than that in Indo-China. We must remember the promises that were made to the people of Asia. During the war, we broadcast to them appeals to ignore the promises of the Japanese in relation to their soDr. Evatt. called co-prosperity sphere in Asia, and promised that we would grant them self government in accordance with the terms of the Atlantic Charter. The assurance was not left there, but was incorporated in the United Nations Charter in terms that admitted of no doubt. The promise was not absolute. The claim had to be established. But that was the spirit of both the Atlantic Charter and the San Francisco Charter of the United Nations. I have tried to establish that there are some resemblances-the situations are not entirely the same-betwee n the position in Malaya and that in Indo-China. Writers such as Mr Justice Douglas, of the United States Supreme Court, Mr Purcell and Mr Vernon Bartlett, who all are recognized authorities on Malaya, refer to that resemblance in their writings on Malaya. As I have stated, the guerrilla warfare began. In 1953, the Singapore correspondent of the London Times stated that the position had reached stalemate. There have been steady losses by the guerrillas in the fighting, but the number of guerrillas apparently has remained almost stationary at between 5,000 and 6.000 men. Organized against them, though indirectly rather than operating directly, are 50,000 British troops, 20,000 regular police, 55,000 special police and 250,000 home guards, a total of 375,000 armed men. There is no doubt that the guerrillas are now led by Communists, and doubtless they receive support from secret societies; otherwise they could not continue. Enormous armed forces are devoted to the task of crushing the guerrillas by force, but in spite of this effort the numbers of the guerrillas remain approximately the same. General Templer referred to that fact before he left Malaya. The Prime Minister erred in describing the Chinese engaged in guerrilla activities in Malaya as foreigners or immigrants who have recently arrived in the The situation would country. That is not the position. The Chinese were early settlers in Malaya. They settled in the Malayan Peninsula before the first colonists came to Australia in 17S8. It seems to be generally acknowledged that most of those Chinese regard Malaya as their permanent home This does not mean that they get on particularly well with the Malays. Internally, the outlook of the Malay races and the Chinese who regard Malaya as their home differs. As I have stated, during World War II . , in the organized broadcasts to all territory in South-East Asia occupied by the Japanese, self-government was promised to the people of Malaya. Those broadcasts regularly reached the resistance forces in Malaya. They referred repeatedly to the promises of Churchill and Roosevelt in relation to independence or self-government for the countries of South-East Asia, and they denounced the Japanese co-prosperity sphere as a complete sham in comparison with the democratic self-government that would follow upon allied success. Doubtless, some of the broadcasts were more extensively qualified than were others, but the spirit of the message was broadly as I have outlined it. Vernon. Bartlett, who writes conservatively, suggests that the experiences of South-East Asian countries since the war show thatOnce tlie demand for complete independent*! reaches a certain temperature it is both stupid and criminal to resist it ; resistance may involve all the misery and intolerances of >i revolutionary explosion. Bartlett applied those observations to Malaya. It is equally true that the Government in control of dependent territories should not relinquish its responsibilities until there . are persons able and ready to take over the government and administer it efficiently. These are the real questions that face Malaya to-day. Purcell's study of Malaya deserves special consideration. Purcell, who is a person of outstanding experience, has been denounced by the Communists as the apologist of imperialism. He was wartime Director-General of Information, and in that capacity he always broadcast assurances that Britain would help Malaya towards nationhood. In 1950, Purcell visited Malaya, and on his return there in 1952 he regarded the clock of progress as having been stopped until the guerrillas were destroyed. Purcell came to the conclusion that a fatal error had been made in 1952 by treating the clearing up of the guerrilla fighting as only a military problem, and not as a social or economic problem, and still less as a political problem. His judgment was as follows:The result was a complete departure from the traditions of a century and a half in which the British possessions and protectorates in Malaya had been administered as a civilian trust and not as a. strategic outpost in the cold war. A trust for the benefit of the people or a strategic outpost in the cold war ? Which is it to be? Australia's choice between those two alternatives should be in favour of regarding it as a civilian trust, though it is not directly a matter of our responsibility. T suggest that Purcell's view is convincing. In his opinion the strongest links in the chain of resistance to Communist expansion in South-East Asia were the independent nations such as India, Burma and Indonesia. India and Burma received their independence from the Labour Government of the United Kingdom, and Indonesia received its independence, through the United Nations, from the Dutch. On the other hand, the weakest links in the chain were those directly controlled by a colonial power, such as Indo-China before the recent settlement of the war there, and Malaya. The independent nations resist foreign interference and control, whether it comes from the East or from the West. Purcell concluded that if the present policy of concentration on military success against the guerrillas continues, Malaya may well become another China instead of a. nation like India. This is the view of an experienced person who has studied fhe problem. Much the same point of view was expressed by Sir Cheng-Lock Teng, president of the Malayan Chinese Association, who was knighted by the late King George VI . for his public services, and who said early last year that Malaya had made no appreciable advance towards responsible self-government. This gentleman, who is anti-Communist, addedThe answer to Communism in Malaya wnu to provide a government that is satisfactory to the people . . . This responsibility rests on the Metropolitan power who controls Malaya and the sooner it is met the lonsrer will be her stay in this land . . . The minor benefits that an autocratic form of government. like tlie one in Malaya, confers on the country will never compensate for the spiritual degradation it involves. Throughout South-East Asia many people have achieved self-government. No one could justly say that the people of Malaya, and particularly those in the area about Singapore, are not just as much entitled to self-government as are the people in other areas in Asia. They have just as much capacity for self-government and they are entitled to it broadly in the same form. Purcell pointed to a similar conclusion when he agreed that Britain's existing relations with India and Ceylon are a fair model for her relations with the Malaya of the future. He addedBut since tlie hour is late and there iis not time for the gradual processes which have fashioned the constitutions of India and Ceylon, it will, in a race with Communism, be necessary to expedite thc passage of Malaya towards self-government. Here is the civil service position in Malaya. In a special article in the London Times towards the end of 1953. it was stated that there were 239 permanent British officials in the Malayan Civil Service, nearly 1,000 in other departments, 486 officers of police and 695 police lieutenants. In the whole of tbe Malayan Civil Service there were only 64 Malays and no Chinese. The Australian Labour party is satisfied that the proposed use, as outlined by the Prime Minister in his statement, of Australian armed forces in Malaya at present will gravely injure our relations with Malaya and her Asian neighbours. The guerrilla operations in Malaya have lasted for years. The eventual settlement or agreement seems certain to take the form of some amnesty and rehabilitation plan for those whose home is in Malaya. That was done in the Philippines where the rebels, the Huks, finally agreed to surrender and come in on the promise that they would be given an amnesty and would be settled on the land. The alternative of continuing operations in Malaya until every guerrilla is killed or disposed of is not in accordance with the best British tradition. Australia's true role in South-East Asia will not be helped but obstructed by the present proposal to send our armed forces to Malaya, either for garrison duty or to Dr. Evatt. take part in jungle fighting. This will, lead only to acute misunderstanding between the Asian peoples in Malaya and Australia. It will be easily misrepresented as an act of aggression. In fact, it will be an unnecessary demonstration and, indeed, an act of folly, possessing no real value at the present time. It was stated recently that 27S trade unions in Malaya have expressed strong opposition to the introduction of armed forces from Australia and New Zealand. The Prime Minister also announced that he contemplates that on the outbreak of a general war in South-East Asia, Australia's contribution will be of the order of two divisions. If that is so, the total military personnel could number nearly 100,000, allowing for supporting troops. That estimate has been published. I do not know whether it is correct. It may be an over-statement. At any rate, the military personnel that will be involved will be much greater than 40,000, which is the strength of two divisions. right honourable gentleman get thatfigure? Defence( Sir Philip McBride) tell the House the exact figure? Honourable members interjecting, to insist that the Leader of the Opposition shall be given an uninterrupted hearing. mentioned from an article by a military commentator that was published recently in a leading Australian newspaper. We do not know the correct figure, but the Minister will give it to us at the right time. WhatI say is that by the present arrangements the question of the employment of Australian forces may weil be determined in a way which will be both unsatisfactory and almost irrevocable in the situation that may confront Australia. The argument that Malaya is the area in which Australia must be engaged militarily in the event of a third world war is unconvincing. It begs the whole question. It would be far preferable for Australia's basic forces to be trained in Australia, or in Australian territories, which extend to the equator. Under modern conditions, they should be capable of being",45,Menzies

147,Dr. Evatt,"I obtained the figure 1airborne to the area that matters most. In Malaya, similar mobility may become difficult or impossible! From a strategic point of view, the commitment of Australian forces to Malaya may put them out on a limb, and such vulnerability could turn out to be disastrous. The problem of the guerrillas in Malaya is entirely outside the scope of Seato. It is not covered in Article IV . (1.) of the treaty, because no case of aggression by means of armed attack has taken place. In such cases, all measures must be reported to the Security Council, but such aetion is not even contemplated. In the case of other forms of attack, Article IV (2.) of the treaty requires consultation between the parties, but such consultation is not even alleged to have taken place. Nothing is more unreal than the Government's propaganda in an attempt, to justify the Malayan move as establishing Australia's first line of defence 2,000 miles from our shores. This is where I should like an examination to be made by those experienced in military planning in order to see whether this is a sound move. thinks that it is better to fight 2,000 miles situation may be entirely changed. Action away than to defend onr shores. To a degree that is true, but when such a doctrine is applied in. time of peace hy a nation with our limited resources, it is certain to be regarded as provocative. If it is right for Australia to establish a strategic reserve' 2,000 miles away to guard against possible aggression from the Kra Peninsula, directed presumably from China, what would be said if Indonesia, China and other Asian nations made a pact similar"" to the Seato pact? Would it be right for China to allocate armed units by arrangement with Indonesia in order to forestall possible military honourable gentleman should indicate operations from Australia? Such a situation seems absurd because we would regard it as unthinkable and highly provocative to us. Therefore, we must not be surprised if Asian nations outside Seato regard what we propose to do in Malaya as being provocative or even aggressive in intent. We know that it is not, but some Asian nations are not of the same mind. Similar illustrations may be multiplied indefinitely. Suppose a nation stations powerful forces 2,000 miles away from its own shores. It stands to reason that the possible enemy may regard such action as justifying the despatch of its forces 2,000 miles away from its shores in the opposite direction. If this practice were applied generally there would be almost a certainty of military collision and an implied threat to the peace, possibly warranting United Nations intervention. I admit that the analogy is not, perfect, but it is clear enough to show that, if one nation can advance its forces 2,000 miles against a possible enemy, then that possible enemy may with equal logic and apparent reason advance its defence line to the same degree providing it secure* the consent of the nation where the advance line is to be situated. Is this not the point? The trouble about advance allocation of substantial military forces is that other nations might do exactly the same thing and for similar reasons. We read about the dispute that has arisen over the islands of Matsu and Quemoy. where the concentration of Chinese Nationalist troops is regarded by China as being aggressive. In the case of actual Apparently, the Government or immediately threatened warfare the of the kind now proposed before there is war, or an immediate threat of war. will be regarded in Asian countries as unnecessarily provocative. The Prime Minister was studiously vague when dealing with the recruitment of two divisions and supporting troops in time of war. He saidThe Government has quite deliberately adopted a policy -which may be a new one for Australia in time of peace but which every other modern nation, at risk has long since regarded as elementary. Therefore, it is proper that the right clearly to the House the method of enlistment or recruitingthat is contemplated. We are asked, in effect, to approve of the Government's war-time, as well as its peace-time, plan. Does the Government propose to introduce compulsory service for these troops overseas? What is urgently required in Australia is a complete overhaul of the Air Force and, indeed, a review of the entire defence organization. During the past few years hundreds of millions of pounds have been expended on defence. There is very little to show for that expenditure in the form of modern equipment. Is the Government serious about the danger of nuclear bomb attack on our larger cities? If it is, what decision has it arrived at? The Chifley Government commenced to establish a civilian defence organization towards the end of 1949. Since then, this Government has not done a single thing to implement civil defence plans either alone or in co-operation with the States. Indeed, State Premiers who have asked for information about this Government's plans have not even received a reply to their request. That is how the Government views this problem. An examination of these matters should be made immediately. If the Government is serious about nuclear attack on Australia, it seems to be almost nonsensical to establish our strategic reserve so far away from Australia instead of allocating it to Australia, or our vital island territories which, as I have said, extend practically to tbe equator. Mobility is a two-way argument. within Australia; and it is just as short a dash by air fvom Austvalia to Singapore as from Singapore to Australia. I entirely, repudiate any suggestion that Labour'sdefence policy is based on isolation or selfish regard for our own interests. speaks eloquently for the rejection of such a. doctrine. I also remind the House of Labour's attitude towards the war in Korea. Nations declaration is made either by the Security Council or the General Assembly, Australia would rightly act in accordance with its legal or moral duty to join in collective action to repel aggression. But it is a very different thing to send our armed forces to the Malayan area now when, by doing so, we shall tend to commit our forces in advance without regard to the changing situation. nationalist feeling are almost always stirred up where foreign or overseas soldiery is stationed in another country, particularly in an Asian country. policy of paying full Dr. Evatt. the feelings and dignity of all Asian nations and people. Positive assistance to them in the march towards self government is the best weapon against Communist infiltration or expansion. This is proved by the success of the action that was taken by the British Labour Government in India, Ceylon, Pakistan and Burma and by the success of the action of the Chifley Labour Government in assisting the United Nations agencies in negotiating the grant of self-government to Indonesia. The Prime Minister referred to Seato in connection with the Malayan proposals. He made a statement on the 1st April, but it was not brought to the attention of Seato until the 7th April, at what is called an "" informal meeting "" of council representatives. This"" informal meeting "" merely welcomed the decision of the Australian Government to seek parliamentary approval for participation by Australian forces in a strategic reserve to be established in Malaya. According to the Prime Minister, that shows that our Asian friends regard the proposals now There must be mobility being made by the Government as being "" most acceptable "". But nothing has been said about what other members of Seato are doing or are proposing to do. There has been no planninar. Yet, that is the purpose of Seato. Therefore, it is clear that the Government's plan to join in a strategic reserve in Malaya has little or Labour's war-time record no relationship to Seato. Otherwise, surely, it would have heen discussed at Seato, not after, but before the decision was made, and some ioint planning would If an authoritative United have been considered ' and effected. Nothing of this kind has happened. There is vagueness, too, in the reference made by the Prime Minister to the United States. President Eisenhower and able gentleman's statement, but no precise obligation has been assumed by the United States in relation to Malaya because the United States has always refused to be committed in any particular locality. As Resentment and local I read the statement, the United States, in reply to the Prime Minister's expression of "" his hope to be able to look to the United States for military supplies on some basis to be arranged "" merely stated Australia should preserve a that it would take up the matter on an respect to official level and would consider methods",55,Menzies
148,Mr Dulles,"have agreed to the right honorfor improving the deficiencies in Australia's equipment. That is a two-edged document. Australia and the TJnited States agree that there is a grave deficiency in Australia's Air Force. That justifies what I have already said ahout the need to make a complete overhaul of our defence services. But I infer from that correspondence that there is no intention on the part of the TJnited States to contribute any of its armed forces to the Malayan area. That is United States policy, because President Eisenhower made it clear previously that he would not, in advance, commit a single United States soldier to the Indo-China conflict. On the contrary, I draw the inference that the Prime Minister's attempt to secure more specific undertakings from the United States proved a source of embarrassment, as, indeed, the language of the document itself rather suggests. T think, in the circumstances, that we are entitled to more precise information about when the planning for the Malayan strategic reserve arose. I infer that it arose well before the Seato agreement was entered into in September last. The whole point about Seato is that the treaty contemplates consultation with regard to military planning before decision and not merely attempts to get approval afterwards. At any rate, I do not understand that other parties to Seato like Pakistan, the Philippines or Thailand are themselves prepared to allocate any forces to Malaya. That is the position with regard to the Malayan proposals. At a later stage in the debate, I shall subby a representative of the British mit an amendment to the motion proposed by the Prime Minister, which will deal with the Malayan position and will express the disapproval of the House to those proposals. The point I wish to emphasize again is that at the present moment, in regard to Asia, we are awaiting and are entitled to a new approach based on the true spirit of the United Nations Charter. The main purpose of the approach should be positive and urgent action designed to conciliate and reduce or end differences and disagreements. Conciliation is of the life blood of the United Nations. From the begining to the end of his speech, the Prime Minister .does not mention the word "" conciliation"" or indicate the absolute necessity for Australia always to be ready to take the initiative in assisting thc growth of independent nations in accordance with the promises of the Atlantic Charter of 1941. With regard to the problem of disarmament, the control of nuclear energy and the prevention of the use of atomic and hydrogen bombs, Australia should be most eager and active in the field. One vital difference of approach is illustrated by the statement of the Prime Minister when he saidWe all devote much of our time to considering what we ought to do about tlie Communist .powers. The real hope of the world will come when the Communist powers sit down to consider what the}' are to do about us. . . . If there is to be peace, it must come from them. I entirely differ from that approach. 1 > say that the real hope of the world will come only when all the Powers directly concerned, whether Communist or not, are prepared to sit down round a table to consider what is necessary to prevent war, or limit war, or effectively forbid atomic warfare, and help to maintain peace and prosperity for their peoples. I say, contradicting the Prime Minister, that if there is to be peace, it must come jointly from all the Powers, not merely from Communist Powers. There must be consultation and conferences. In international affairs of to-day, it is impossible to regard the position as ever static. We have to note a statement made recently at the London conference nations, that the Western Powers will negotiate only if they have overwhelming strength in the particular nuclear weapon mentioned, which was the hydrogen bomb. But the truth is that the overwhelming strength of to-day may, with the rapid march of science, be the relative weakness of to-morrow, and on the third day, the whole situation may change again, because as a new invention rep^ces an earlier one, so the power of the bombs becomes almost limitless. It is even hard to speak of relative strength when two opposed groups of powers each possess the means of destroying the other and annihilating mankind. I say that is why a new approach is needed, and needed so urgently. The situation is unique, and preconceived habits of thought must go into the discard in order to prevent world to Australia of Australian Imperial catastrophe. The Prime Minister says that the people of Malaya will welcome these miliHonorable members who represented the tary arrangements. I dispute that statement. I think it is incorrect. No doubt the wealthy individuals and corporations will do so, but will the ordinary people regard our entry as other than an intrusion? How absurd it is to say, as Government supporters do, that what we advocate is simply the erection of Marello towers around our coast! That is the kind of man-of-straw argument that the Prime Minister puts up for the satisfaction of knocking over. Our attitude is not isolationist. I claim, on the contrary, that our attitude is both realistic and sound. Had the Australian position been more carefully planned, we should have been secure entirely from the invasion which so nearly beset Australia in World War II . Nonetheless, there is a healthy spirit of self-reliant Australianism in this country, and it is nothwere able to hold Australia; Australia ing to be ashamed of.

It was only by insistence and persistence on the part of the Labour Government, in the face of powerful and almost violent opposition from Sir Winston Churchill and from some leaders of the anti-Labour parties in Australia, that we succeeded in organizing the return to Australia of those veteran divisions. Was our attitude isolationist? No! It was Australian. Buti t was more than Australian because it had the approval of General MacArthur. We became a base for the United States; and General MacArthur was enabled to go north and regain the territories whicb had been taken by the Japanese. Was that isolationist? No!

149,Dr. Evatt,"I had to go to America with the decision to station forces inthai there were exchanges on vital questions of world affairs, that differences of opinion were expressed, that colonialism was discussed and that dual citizenship in Indonesia was considered. Even on the question of West New Guinea, a point of view was expressed which should encourage Australia to try to negotiate with Holland and Indonesia a security and welfare pact covering the whole relevant area. The significance of the conference lay in the expressed views and the obvious desire of those representatives to improve relationships between Asia and Africa, .ind other nations, including our own. L regret that no reference to this conference was contained in the Prime Minister's speech. However, the Minister for External Affairs has welcomed the conference, and I agree with most of his .statement on that matter. I attach special importance to that conference, because of the limited Asian membership of Seato. Eor that reason, it was especially important that nations at the conference, whether Asian or not, should have heen offered the hand of fellowship from Australia. Their representatives should have been invited to visit this country as our guests. Similar visits, leading to active friendship, would have been helpful to the delegates to understand the approach of the Australian people and our desire for a lasting and just peace with all our neighbours in these parts of the world. The opportunity was missed. The Prime Minister saidGlib words are occasionally spoken about "" peaceful co-existence "". That statement is perfectly true. But glib words are used against the conception as well as in favour of it. Personally, f do not particularly like the phrase, because with regard to the peoples of Asia, mere co-existence is not enough, fn the physically contracting world society of to-day, what is required is active co-operation between nations for the exchange of information, for the right of freedom to travel, and for the breaking down of all unnecessary and foolish barriers to understanding. This view which, after all, is merely the civilized point of view, is more evident, T think, in Great Britain than anywhere else in the world. I note that, recently, a British parliamentary delegation visited Russia under the chairmanship of a conservative member of Parliament. Visits of scholars, scientists and sportsmen to Australia should be encouraged to the maximum degree. The good relations to be aimed ai between Australia and Asian nations should include economic and material assistance. I consider that to be most important. I say that our relations must, and can, be based on a scrupulous regard for the self-respect and dignity of those Asian nations and peoples, many of whom have a civilization which has endured longer than our own. I believe that the Australian people, or, at any rate, the great majority of them, have that respect for our Asian neighbours, and I want to see the Government and the Parliament engaged in this debate on the exploration of avenues by which the peaceful objectives of the TJnited Nations can be pursued, and we can establish a lasting friendship with all the peoples of Asia.

I shall try, to the best, of my ability, not to be dreary in this speech. I think the best thing that, T can do at the outset, in an endeavour to get this discussion back on to the rails, is to compare what we took over when we came into office five years ago in respect of our relations with Asia, and what exists to-day. We took over no relations with Asia at all. The last Government had",59,Menzies

""We had no relations of any sort with Asian countries, in ' those vital four years between 1046 and 1950 when we came into office, when Indo-China was rapidly getting into the grip of the Communists, we had no posts and no observers of any sort in the whole of Indo-China. NV> effort of any sort had been made in those fateful and formative years to find out what was going on, or to t r y to help the people in their travail under the lash of communism in South East Asia. No t one thing! Since we have come into office, we have put good Australian diplomatic posts in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Burma, Viet Nam, Laos, Cambodia and Japan. When we took office the Australian Government had no diplomatic respresentative of any kind in any of those countries. perately trying, in the last five years, to regain some of the time that was so tragically lost by the Government in which the Leader of the Opposition was a Minister. No t only that, but my officers and I have spent about one month of each year in travelling around the whole of the area. We now know South East Asia very well. very well that a great factor in South East Asia is raising of the standard of living of the people. We know that there cannot be a contented people, and stability and peace, in that area, unless the economic situation is to and improved. that through the Colombo plan, which was launched in 1950, this Government's first year of office. It was launched on the initiative of Australia. We took that on ourselves as a responsibility, and it has progressed and prospered ever since. Would that something of that nature had been done in the four years that were lost before we came into office. Nothing had been done We inherited a complete lack of relations with Asia, but by a vigorous foreign policy we have created good relations with Asia, which we are constantly improving. Let me take some of the points, so far as one can pick them out, with which the right honourable gentleman started by accusing the Prime( Mr Menzies) Mr Casey. any reference to the peaceful settlement of disputes. That statement makes me wonder whether the right honourable gentleman has ever read the Seato treaty. I shall read a few reference to peaceful settlements of disputes from that treaty itself. It commencesThe Parties to this Treaty, Recognizing tlie sovereign equality of all the Parties, Reiterating their faith in the purposes arid principles set forth in the Charter of the TJnited Nations and their desire to live in peace with all peoples and all governments, Reaffirming that, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, they uphold the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and declaring that they will earnestly strive by every peaceful means to promote self-government and to secure the independence of all countries whose peoples desire it and are able to undertake its responWe have been dessibilities. Therefore agree as follows:The Parties undertake, as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations, to settle any international disputes in which they may be involved by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not endangered, and to refrain in their international relations from the threat or We realize use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations. Article VI readsThis Treaty does not affect and shall not be interpreted as allecting in any way the rights and obligations of any of the Parties under attended the Charter of the United Nations or the We have done responsibility of the United Nations for the maintenance of international peace and security In many places in the Seato treaty there are definite references to our obligations in regard to peaceful settlement of disputes under the United Nations Charter, but the right honourable gentleman apparently has not seen them. I think that I should tackle first the reasons for. the bringing into existence of the Seato treaty, which do not seem to be understood by the right honourable gentleman. The facts of life in South-East Asia are that no single one of the countries of that area would have any chance of maintaining itself, individually, against the political and m i l idealt. He tary might of Communist China. If lef t Minister to their own resources, those countries of neglecting entirely would fall one by one into the clutches of Communist China. They know that very well. Their morale was low. They knew that, from the point of view of morale and of force they could not maintain themselves. It was a situation which obviously called for the doctrine of interdependence. That is the doctrine which was enshrined in the Seato treaty. That treaty does a number of things. First, it gives heart and hope and confidence to the individual countries of South-East Asia. They now know that it is worthwhile to resist communism. Before Seato they saw and realized the might of Communist China, .and they did not think it worthwhile to struggle against it. The power with which these small countries were trying to cope seemed so immense that they almost gave up heart, and thought it was notworthwhile to resist. Seato gave them the oonfidence to get together and resist the Communist colossus from the north. The members of the South-East Asia Treaty organization are, amongst other things, helping the countries, particularly in the threatened area, to deal with Communist infiltration and subversion. Secondly, if an attack does come, the small countries in the threatened area are guaranteed the support of the other members of the organization, which includes most powerful nations outside the area. Seato also takes account of the economic situation in those countries, and the need to improve their standards of living. So far as Australia is concerned, these things are being coped with under the Colombo plan. The countries concerned know that if they are attacked they will liave the combined strength of the most powerful individual nation in the world, the United States of America,, and of Great Britain, which still has very great power and substance, plus a number of other countries of which we know. The morale in the threatened countries has greatly changed. They now have some hope for the future where little or no hope existed before. Had there been no South-East Asia Treaty organization, that position, would not have come about, and those nations would have fallen one by one, like ripe plums, when Communist China wanted to get them. The backbone of the resistance to communism is, and will continue to be, the United States of America, which has very large forces in the island chain to the east of the Asian continent. These American forces comprise no fewer than 400 naval vessels, including some of the most modern aircraft carriers, and a total naval personnel of 350,000. The forces also include 30 squadrons of jet aircraft of various sorts, and five army divisions, aggregating a total of 300,000 ground troops. Not far short of 1,000,000 men of the fighting services of the United States are in that great force, which is situated as a strategic reserve to be used when and where wanted, wherever pressure from the Communists may possibly develop. They are supplemented by forces of the United Kingdom, which are by no means small in that area., and the forces of the Philippines, Thailand and Pakistan, as well as French, Australian and New Zealand forces. So vvhat China must realize is that there are going to be no easy pickings if trouble starts in that part of the world. That is a general sketch of why Seato exists. Let me say a word now about the situation in Malaya, which came under criticism from, the Leader of the Opposition. In the first place, I think 1 should give a short outline of the Malayan situation. The Malayan people are a multi-racial group in which Chinese and Malays are almost equal in numbers, and in which there are lesser numbers of Europeans and Indians and some others. The TJnited Kingdom has promulgated a programme directed towards eventual self-government in Malaya, in respect of which responsible communal leaders of Malaya have found no real grounds for criticism. It has been regarded as a reasonable programme leading to self government for the not very distant future. Singapore now has an elected government, and the Malayan Federation elections are to be held in July this year. It may be asked why Great Britain cannot give complete self-government to Malaya and Singapore now. The simple reason is that the fabric of order, in Malaya, has been for the last six or seven years, under grave threat. Also a national spirit in Malaya, due to the wide variety of races. is only now beginning properly to develop. There has to be developed a community of interests, between Malays and Chinese in particular. That has been fostered by the TJnited Kingdom and also through adequate communal organizations. The fact about banditry in the jungle is that there has heen a resolute attempt to create chaos by a relatively small number, only a few thousand, Chinese Communist bandits in the jungle, ever since the end of the war. been, to create a standard type of Communist People's Republic under Communist Chinese control in Malaya. They have heen called terrorists, not for any particular propaganda purpose, but because they are terrorists. Tbey have gone in for a campaign of cold-blooded terrorism directed largely against Chinese and Malays as well, of course, as against the British. The casualties inflicted by the Chinese Communist terrorists in the jungle have been very large. They have inflicted no fewer than 4,500 casualties on civilians in Malaya, mostly Asians, and largely of their own Chinese race. They havo caused no fewer than 2,500 casualties among the Asian police in Malaya. Sixtyfive per cent, of the civilians they havo killed have been Chinese. They hav* killed also a number of British people, but the great majority of people killed have been Chinese and Malays. The responsible leaders in numerous communities in Malaya have all realized very well that their only possible safeguard for the future is the big security force, maintained largely by Britain in Malaya, which is coping with the jungle Communists. The Prime Minister of India, Mr Nehru, who has no great love for colonialism in any form, said recently in the Indian House of the People-the lower House of the Indian Parliamentthat Malaya was a "" special case "". He was speaking of colonialism, and he warned the members of the Hoiuse of the People against any idea that the problem of M!alaya could be solved by an immediate grant of self-government. The simple fact is that the jungle the first representative of his country. terrorists are not Malayan nationalists. That is a movement towards the creation The terrorist movement is more than 90 of more direct relationships between ifr.'Casey. per cent, a Chinese Communist movement. The terrorists are more than 90 per cent. Chinese, and are 100 per cent. Communist. Those are the simple facts of the situation in Malaya. The Leader of the Opposition said there would be resentment if Australian forces were to go to Malaya. No resentment has been expressed by anybody of any consequence in Malaya as a result of the manifold suggestions made and published about Australian forces being Their professed aim has always sent to Malaya. After all, we have had one squadron, and frequently two squadrons, of the Royal Australian Air Force in Malaya for a considerable number of years. There have been no expressions of resentment about that. The Malayan press has been full of references in anticipation of the stationing of Australian ground forces and other forces in Malaya, which have evoked no resentment from any responsible communal leader in Malaya. I think it is complete nonsense to say that there would be resentment, either in Malaya or the rest of Asia, if and when Australian forces go to Malaya. As I have said, the British have, for a number of years, been moving towards self-government for the Malayan people. It is not possible to set a date when Malaya will get complete self government, but the movement is progressing, and nobody has any serious criticism to make of the rate at which progress has been made. There is one matter which may throw some light on the situation, and which may not be known to honourable members. I refer to the fact that the United Kingdom has for some time been training a number of Malays in government departments in London, who will eventually form the body which will attend to Malayan representation in other countries when Malaya gets complete self-government. They are training in London now, and I expect that before the end of 1955 we shall see in the United Kingdom High Commissioner's Oflice in Canberra at least one Malay, working under the United Kingdom High Commissioner as Malaya and other friendly countries, designed to function when Malaya achieves self-government. It is proposed that such Malays should be employed in the offices -of TJnited Kingdom High Commissioners in Australia, India and Pakistan. That is. the beginning of an external affairs service for Malaya, in readiness for the day when the Malayans get tbeir independence. We have, as is generally known, an Australian Commissioner's Office in Singapore. The task of Sir Alan Watt, our Australian Commissioner there, is to watch Australia's interests, not only in Singapore and Malaya, but also generally in South-East Asia. Our relationships ancl our business with the Federation of Malaya are increasing, and when Australian forces reach Malaya there will be even more business to do. With that in mind, the Government has decided to open an Australian office in Kuala Lumpur, a decision which has been greeted locally witli satisfaction. Then we shall be adequately represented, not only in Singapore, but also in the Federation of Malaya. I may say that before the Prime Minister made his recent announcement that Australian forces would be sent to Malaya, the Australian Government advised Mr Malcolm MacDonald of its intention. He, in turn, advised and consulted with the executive councils of Singapore and Malaya about the prospective presence of Australian forces there. expressed. I should like to deal with some of the other comments made by the Leader of the Opposition in his speech. He assumed that the presence of Australian forces in Malaya would create resentment. I am entirely convinced that there will be no 3uch resentment. Malaya, not only by the wealthy sections of the community, but also by the people generally, that the only thing that great many years. In fact, the right is saving them from malignant oppression by the Chinese Communist terrorists is the security force, which, as the Leader of the Opposition said, consists of many tens of thousands of people. It is very largely a British force. [Extension of time granted.'] Another point made by the right honourable gentleman was that an amnesty should be granted to the Chinese Communist bandits. Under present conditions, very generous terms are offered to bandits hi Malaya, who give themselves up, by an amnesty-whie h means a complete and absolute pardon in all cases-ha s not been granted. In view of the number of people, British, Malay, Chinese and Indian, who have been slaughtered under the most brutal circumstances by those bandits, I think it would be super-generosity if an amnesty were granted to those people. T believe the present conditions are fair enough. I think an amnesty would be beyond the limits of human generosity, and I do not believe that one will come about. The right honourable gentleman said that, for reasons which he gave, he thought Australian forces would be resented in Malaya. I wonder whether he has ever thought about Nato, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Is there any resentment in Europe at the presence there of very large numbersvastly larger than the numbers contemplated in this case-of American, Britisu and Canadian troops? There is no such resentment at all. In fact, they are regarded as people who are helping to save Western Europe from the possibility of being overrun by communism. The right honourable gentleman said a number of times that he rejected the No resentment was charge that Labour was. isolationist. I do not think the charge is quite so easily rejected. A red thread of isolationism has been running through the fabric of Labour for a great many years. I know very well that isolationism is not in the mind of every Labour supporter. I know large numbers of Labour supporters who are not isolationists. But it It is realized in is not a political exaggeration to say that the official programme of Labour has been heavily tinged with isolationism for a bonorable gentleman revealed one aspect of the isolationism of Labour when he clearly resisted the conception of Australian forces being used outside Australia for the defence of Australia. We remem-ber the struggles that went on inside the Labour party after 1940, when there was a move to send Australian troops to a limited area in the islands to the north of Australia. We remember what the ' right honourable gentleman said about Seato, about the situation in Indo-China, and, more recently, about Malaya. The doctrine that we can defend Australia from the shores of Australia is tinged with isolationism. The right honourable gentleman ridiculed what t.he Prime Minister said about trying to keep the enemy as far as possible from the shores of Australia. One of the basic doctrines of modern defence is not to wait until the enemy is on your shores and your liomes are being destroyed before ytui take steps to defend yourself. You keep him at the longest arm's length possible. That, quite simply is what we have been trying to do. When the North Atlantic first mooted, although it had no direct relation to the situation in Australia, it was resisted strongly by the Labour Government then in power in Australia, on the ground that it would be provocative to the Eussians and was an encirclement of Eussia. Those phrases were used then and similar phrases were, used about Seato. The red thread of isolationism is revealed by statements to the effect that we can live our own lives in Australia, and let the rest of the world go by. If we made no attempt to help or. to co-operate with other peoples, we should be left alone if ever we got into trouble. We sometimes forget that we are a nation of only 9,000,000 people. We cannot defend ourselves by the strength of our own right arm. We must rely, first 'if nil, on the maximum defence force that we can create and organize, but that of itself will not save us from destruction Therefore, we must rely also on the combination of Australia with the most powerful friends that we can find. We have found them, but Labour did not. With the United States and New Zealand, we are a party to the ANZUS Treaty. With the United States, Great Britain and five other powers of consequence we are a party ment is doing everything to provide for the future safety of Australia. It has a first-class record, Mr Casey.. especially in view of what it inherited five years ago. We have worked fast aiid hard, on both the foreign policy side and the defence side, with the object of being able to look the world in the eye and say that Australia is carrying the burden it should carry. That will never be so if we rely on isolationist doctrines. It is not an exaggeration to say that the speech delivered to-night by the right honourable gentleman was a disappointing speech, although I expect it will be received with acclaim in quarters from which Australia, can expect no help or friendship in the future. One could say a. great deal more about it than that. The right honourable gentleman asked, in effect, why we had undertaken military commitments in peace-time, and why Australian forces were to be sent to. Treaty Organization was Malaya. The time-table of any future emergency provides the answer. The simple fact is that, important countries of South-East Asia could be overrun and destroyed if we waited until war broke out before we in. Australia began to raise, train, equip and despatch forces to that part of the world. The time-table of any future war, especially if it occurs in the area immediately to our north, is likely to be very different from the time-tables of past wars. If we do not get ready before the event, we shall not be ready when the event occurs, if unfortunately it does. We should be grossly negligent if we sat down in our tracks here in Australia and conducted ourselves in the way in which fhe right honourable gentleman says we should. The most remarkable pledge of co-operation that the Prime Minister got recently from the United' States is something for which all decent Australians should be thankful. honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) has read what was said, if we could get in peace-time from any other country words of more co-operation and more commitments than those, I should like to hear them. Anyhow, they are completely satisfactory to this side of the to Seato. This GovernHouse, and I think they have given possible immense comfort to every thinking Australian.

If he offends against the Standing Orders again by interjecting, I shall have to name him. that the established policy of the Australian Labour party can agree with that of the Government, but it must also be assumed that much of the present policies are in agreement. There is no doubt that the Leader of the Opposition is completely innocent of knowing what is necessary for the security of this country. Hi3 remarks must go down in history as completely unworthy of the leader of any party of any consequence. The establishment of Seato was particularly sensible, and Seato is not, as the Leader of the Opposition said, an organization that was established without proper planning. . The speeches that have been made for some considerable time in this House show that the Government has done some careful planning, and Seato is one of the organizations that has arisen as the result of that planning. The attitude of Communist China and Russia has always been aggressive. They are not peace lovers at all, and they have not shown any respect for the Charter of the United Nations. It is ridiculous to say that Communist China should be admitted to the United Nations, while we have before ns the record' of a Communist country that is already a member of the United Nations. It is quite apparent that Russia has not fulfilled the requirements of the United Nations, and that if that country applied for admission to-day it would to admit Russia to the United Nations, but the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition now is that a similar error should be made by admitting Communist China. One of the important things about Seato was the enlargement of the scope of our defence operations. Seato was entered into with deliberation and care, and was important to the defence of this country, because it enlarged the scope of our operations. No general staff would ever consider that Australia was properly defended if it had such an enlargement of the area of defence and could not devote some attention to the matter of where it should place its forces. There is no doubt that what the Leader of the Opposition said about sending troops to Malaya, and his observations about a reciprocal move on the part of Communist China, are completely absurd. He does not know anything about modern trends in fighting, and I say that with some experience. It has been established that if we should be involved in war, and we have bases behind the enemy, we shall find them more useful and better simply because they are behind the enemy. The Leader of the Opposition suggested that China might send, forces into Indonesia, perhaps in the same spirit that we might send forces to Malaya. AllI say to that is that it is not a bad thought to bear in mind, and if we had a substantial base, and troops, in Malaya, the enemy's position would not be as comfortable as the Leader of the Opposition seems to think. Everybody should bearin mind the proper military use of the word "" strategy"" as against the use of the word "" tactics "". Those words were used a good deal throughout the Prime Minister's speech. Strategy is the employment of troops before making contact with the enemy. When an enlargement of the area of operation occurs the military staff must, deploy its troops to the most sensible",67,Article 1

162,Mr Joshua,"It is not only possibleplaces. It is obvious that because of the trouble that has arisen in Indo-Ohina, and the possibility that the whole of [ndo-Chin'a may become Communist, countries such as Thailand may find Communist troops on their borders. 'Ihey probably do not intend to send troops to Malaya simply because they are keeping their troops on hand to use them on their own borders where they consider that they w ill be most useful. The situation in South-East Asia has been thoroughly canvassed, and we know quite a lot about it. South-East seems to be a hot spot, and a place where we should have troops if we are to protect Australia. in Malaya is of first importance. all very well for the honourable for East Sydney to laugh about that, but if he had had the job of 3ome of the bases in the Pacific during the last war he would not have found it such a laughing matter. gress of any war in which we might be involved, we shall have to get bases from time to time until the enemy has been finally overcome. Government to send a. strategic reserve to Malaya is very sensible, because Malaya is a base that we should secure; and if we do not get it now, we may not have it when we need it. The proposal is to send about a battalion of infantry, two fighter squadrons of aircraft, a bomber squadron and useful, if small, units of the Royal Australian Navy. force, and is not capable of a great deal of defence activity for Australia. ever, ir. is very important. tance of it is that it will establish a base there.

It is ridiculous for thc Leader of the Opposition to say that troops can be trained in Australia and that, when, tbey are trained, and if there is any trouble, they can bo sent overseas. What does the right honourable man suggest should be done? Does he suggest that they should be dropped by parachute? sense. I want to stress that the Governor. Joshua. incut's action has not been thoughtless. The Prime Minister pointed out that the step has beeu taken as a result of inquiry and proper examination by the military staff. He also stated that it was as a result of an over-all plan which has been agreed to largely since ratification of the Manila, treaty. The Prime Minister, however, did leave us in some doubt as to the use of these troops. I was anxious to learn whether they were to be committed, and whether they were to be committed to Asia fighting the terrorists in Malaya. If that is intended, that is the end of our strategic reserve. Perhaps a. base is preserved, The establishment of a base which is important, but once they are It is committed we have not any strategic member reserve. .1 think that the Prime Minister should have been a little more f r a n k on establishing that point, and he should have told us if he intended to commit them to help the British troops. The British During the protroops consist mainly of national service trainees who are youngsters with about twelve months' training. If our boys were, to relieve them or to help The suggestion of the them, it may be a very commendable arrangement. However, the Prime Minister chose not to tell us about that. 1 should think, after listening to the speech of the Ministerf or External Affairs (M!r. Casey), that he was endeavouring to suggest that they would be committed to fighting the terrorists. T prefer to see them retained as a That is a very small strategic reserve. [Extension of time granted.] I thank the Housef or Howgranting me an. extension of time. The imporAnother point in the Prime Minister's speech which requires amplification is his reference to the two divisions of build up a base, and troops which he says w ill probably be Such a raised very soot). That matter is i m portant to the Australian people. HowIt is a very sensible thing are these two divisions of troops to be raised? I support the true policy of the Australian Labour party, which advocates the enlistment of troops by voluntary methods, and I shall adhere to that, policy until I am instructed by the true gentleLabour party to depart from it . It is a flexible policy from which the Labour and not what is expedient. It must not He should have a bit of be forgotten that Communist China is an aggressor nation. party has departed in the light of experience at a particular time. However, for the present I believe that the raising of troops by voluntary methods ensures much better morale than does the raising of troops by other methods. The Prime Minister, therefore, should have stated how it was intended that these divisions should be raised. If it is intended to raise them voluntarily, as I suggest they should he raised, it will be done only by proper means of encouragement. The Government is trying to run the Army on very much the same lines as those on which it was run in the western desert, when it was run on -"" twopence with a shoe lace with which to throttle the enemy"". It is not fair. It is about time the Government awoke and gave a fair deal to the troops. . Their rates of pay are little better than those of tradesmen, yet they are expected to go overseas, to offer themselves as targets, and possibly come back maimed for the rest of their lives, all for a mere pittance, for a few shillings more than a tradesman receives. The Government should give these men proper conditions and rates of pay, and care for their wives. I do not agree with remarks of the Leader of the Opposition about the equipment of the Royal Australian Air Force. I should say that the Air Force is in not a bad position in relation to aircraft. Much progress has been made. The action of the Prime Minister in going to America and obtaining an assurance about further equipment was very commendable, and something which I was glad to see. It is all very well for the Opposition to criticize, but where will the Government get the planes' Where will it obtain those items of equipment that we do not make in Australia? Where will it get them in a hurry? The Opposition is thoroughly impractical. It has no knowledge of the subiect at all. In addition, the Manila pact requires that the TJnited States of America, in addition to supplying us with arms and certain hard-to-get lines, will provide men, but it has been stated that the tactical use of those troops will be decided on the service level. That means, of course, when there is a war; and I would not imagine for a minute that the Prime Minister passed through America without mentioning this proposed strategic reserve in Malaya. I imagine that there is in the TJnited States a very complete understanding of our needs. I refer also to the lofty words of the Leader of the Opposition about being represented at the recent meeting of Asian powers. What is the representation that he has arranged? He sent over his chief Communist deputy, Dr. Burton, to represent him. He intended to send also the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen), but the honourable member for Parkes was too busy chasing the deputy leadership of the Labour party, so he stayed behind. The Leader of the Opposition makes a great deal of his appeals to the TJnited Nations organization, of the manner in which appeals should be made to it from time to time, and how he has been appealing to its members over the past five years. AllI want to know is what Eussia has done all this time in its important place in the TJnited Nations organization. Has it been appealing to the TJnited Nations? No! It has been shovelling troops into Korea and Indo-China as fast as it can. What a wonderful gesture it is making t.o the TJnited Nations! Of course the Leader of the Opposition takes that line. He understands the Communists well. When the Australian Labour party was under good leadership in 1950, Australia sent a bomber wing to Malaya. There was no objection to that; there was nothing but agreement by the Labour party. In those days the party was led by a decent leader. It is all very well to speak about seeking peace, but one has to be practical. The seeking of peace must be conducted by properly conceived methods for the security of Australia, but that point is completely overlooked by the Leader of the Opposition. Communist peace overtures are merely delaying actions so that they may get their troops into strategic positions. The suggestions advanced by the Leader of the Opposition in relation to China and Formosa reject the Labour party's policy of accepting what is just and right Let me say in conclusion that the Leader of the Opposition is not a Labour leader at all. His undoubted ability is not directed towards achieving any good -purpose for Australia. He cunningly contrives-and he has done so for yearsin every speech that he makes to obtain some advantage for the Communists. He spoke for an hour and a half to-night in the old style, with a lot of statements with which one could not possibly disagree, but with a view to obtaining some advantage for the Communists. That is his line. That is why I thoroughly distrust him. I say again that he is not a leader, that he is not fit to lead the Labour party, I think that the Ambassador for the and I think every honourable member on the Labour benches should desert him. The foreign policy of the Government is one that is acceptable to the true Labour party, and I support it. But I denounce everything that the Leader of the Opposition has said as being non-Labour, completely impractical, and in favour of the Communists. adjourned.

He might like to do that, but I certainly would not do it, and I have not any doubt that three-quarters of his colleagues in this House would not do it, because they know perfectly well that those five people are not serving union purposes, but are the general staff of the Communist party in its relations with the Leader of the Opposition. We have produced our evidence, and I challenge the honourable member for Parkes and the Leader of the Opposition, to produce the slightest evidence in support of their allegations, or publicly to withdraw them. The allegations made against the representative in this country of a friendly power are most serious. Thc honourable member for Parkes and the Leader of the Opposition have suggested that the American Embassy passed money to certain people to enable those people to do certain things in relation to the political life of this country. That is a most serious allegation that no responsible parliamentarian should have made or would dare to make without producing evidence to support it. That charge should not have been made in the newspapers of this country even if it were R : [9 ] true. It should have been brought to the Parliament and evidence in support of it should have been produced in order that a proper protest might have been lodged with the representative of the United States. Every one is aware that the same stale old smear has appeared in Communist publications for the last five or six years. Every word that is uttered on the front Opposition benches of this House can be read by any one who cares to pick up a copy of the Sydney Tribune or the Melbourne Guardian, which are both Communist newspapers.

That story has been worn been suggested that an inquiry should be held. My rejoinder was that I would welcome an inquiry because the allegations were without foundation; but that if an inquiry were held, an inquiry should also be held concerning a statement which had been published in New South Wales and which had been repeated time and time again in the various places where politicians and newspapermen gather, concerning the sum of £7,000 which was given to the ""groupers"", allegedly by an attache of the TJnited States Labour Office. I did not originate this story. The sum of £7,000 was mentioned. I repeated that it had been a long-standing piece of dangerous gossip and said that if an inquiry were to be held with respect to the alleged payment of the sum of £13,000 the inquiry should deal also with the payment of this sum of £7,000. The American Ambassador said that he did not have a labour attache. I pointed out, with due politeness, that he did, that his name was Herb Weiner and that he was associated with these rumours. [Extension of time granted.] I mentioned the name of the attache because the ambassador himself had said, "" We don't nave a labour attache, but we do have an Agriculture attache""; and I pointed out that before the Ambassador commenced his term of service here there was a labonr attache at the American Embassy. I understand that that was his designation. He was associated rather closely with sections of industry, the Australian Council of Trades Unions and Labour conferences and it was alleged in public on several occasions, and not denied, that this sum of £7,000 had gone to the "" groupers"". People who are not subject to hallucinations about where the money came from have been asking where the "" groupers "" have been obtaining finance. Streamand high living of a sensational nature cannot come out of funds of the unions because they have good auditors and exercise good control of the finances of the workers. In the circumstances, this section of the Australian Labour party stood up to the criticism that has been made about the alleged Moscow payment threadbare and has never stood up to analysis. The honourable member for Yarra said that he produced facts. His statement was based on a whispered conversation, hearsay, and he topped it off by repeating a conversation, very badly, that he had with me concerning the foreign policy of the Australian Labour party. I have nothing to withdraw in the statement that I made, but I wish honourable members to understand that, with a full knowledge of what I was doing, 3 thought it was fair to direct attention to this matter, and to submit that if the Australian Labour party and its associated trade union members, as well as members of the party in this Parliament, are to be pilloried about a fabled and fictitious payment of £13,000-if that story can be aired in this House whenever the Leader, Deputy Leader or any of the "" sad seven"" members of the anti-Communist Labour party is driven to make another diatribe against the Labour party-it was fair to point to the sinister sources of the "" groupers'"" finance. It is well known that ship-owners and business men in the capital cities have financed the "" groupers'"" newspaper. No one can tell me that the "" groupers"" can produce a newspaper running to 50,000 copies an issue and with no advertisements and have no money coming to them from underground sources. Unlike the honourable member for Yarra, I have no intention to create an atmosphere thai is offensive to the great American nation. That nation can take apropriate action if one of its attaches in this country has done wrong. But, must all the smear come from the other side, from, the cowards' corner on this side of the House? 1 able member will withdraw that remark.",74,Pairs

200,Mr Speaker,"Orde r 1 the honorliave no reason to apologize for asking for an inquiry. I said that if there was to be an inquiry with respect to the alleged payment of the sum of £13,000, it should be made sufficiently wide to get the whole of the evidence with respect to this sum of £7,000. As I liave said, I did not originate this story, ft has been published on two occasions. Ft is common gossip, and to my mind it has some significance. At least, it should be inquired into. If the honourable member for Yarra who, happily for the peace and quietness of the chamber, is absent, sees anything sinister able member's extended time has expired. I never thought in my wildest stretch of imagination that I would witness such a deplorable scene as I have witnessed this evening. One week precisely before the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Dean, K. L . Eaylen) made this fantastic utterance, this chimera of an imagination that is distorted, the advocatus diaboli in the background, the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt), with his usual facility and extraordinary aptitude for seeing a conspiracy under every bush, disseminated that story and tied to it by innuendo the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon) ; and with the antiAmericanism which is the substratum of his political philosophy the right honourable gentleman spread a smear to the world that must inevitably and irrevocably be taken by our great friend and ally, our wartime helper, as a deliberate and studied insult. The right honourable Leader of thc Opposition, with his tender solicitude for Communist China and his not submerged love for Bussia, impeccable, without sin and without fault, and on the flimsiest foundation, as the honorEvntt.

205,Mr Speaker,"Order! I name theable member for Parkes is suspended from the service of the House for 24 hours. The honourable member for Parkes thereupon withdrew from the chamber. the charge against the Victorian central executive made by the lord high executioner, the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt), was simply and solely that that executive had expended Labour party funds to support the industrial groups in the fight against communism. But now, with that aberration which is characteristic of him, he plucks out of the blue, and he inspires in the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen), the fantastic conception that the American Embassy here has donated £7,000 to the same cause. I do not blame the honourable member for Parkes and those men on this side who know, deep down in their hearts, that that is not true. [Extension of time granted.'] It is all very well for certain honourable members on this side to sneer. We know that there are at least a score here who reject the right honourable member for Barton with as much finality and as definitely as any one on this side. The suave sycophants who term him a magnificent leader have every reason to be ashamed of him to-night. I do not blame the honourable member for Parkes. The poor innocent was. absent from this chamber when we demonstrated and proved inexorably up to the hilt the receipt of £13,000 from the Communist party. But the right honourable member for Barton must have another diversion after the Petrov conimission, and willy nilly, we have this story about the great John Curtin appealed to come to our assistanceMr John Curtin, the Labour leader of the past, tbe latchet of whose shoes the right honourable gentleman was not fit to loose. And through his pliant instrument, fearful of his seat in Parliament in an impending pre-selection ballot, he mortally insults one of the great powers of the world to-day. Honourable members may laugh. They do not appreciate the seriousness of this matter which is going forth to the world. With every sense of responsibility that I can summon, speaking dispassionately and with some knowledge of the destiny of my children and of how it is imperilled by such tactics, I impugn the right honourable member for Barton as a menace to the safety and the welfare of this Commonwealth. Opposition) [11.10] -Well, Mr Speaker, he is at it again. I thank the honourable member for Gellibrand ( Mr Mullens) for his attacks on me. Let me state what I know.

227,Dr. Evatt,"Mr Speaker, could youiu letterboxes, and a number of the public wrote to me complaining about them. [Extension of time granted.'] I thought that this matter required an explanation aud I made a public statement on it. I telephoned the American Consul at Canberra and he -said that he would look into the matter, ibut so far I have had no explanation of it. Possibly the papers were disturbed by members of the industrial groups. It is a strange circumstance that there should be governmental information proceeding from the United States Government and that with it, there should be distributed to the citizens of Sydney a particular pamphlet issued by the honourable member for Yarra. I do not know how it got there. I wanted an explanation, and I am entitled to one. There was nothing about money in that matter at all. The honourable member for Gellibrand made an entirely false statement last week. Not a penny was received from the Communist party. When the honourable member found himself in difficulty about this charge, he called on the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) to substantiate his utterances. After the debate recently in this House, I went through my papers because the name of the honourable member for Fremantle had been mentioned. AgainI found the same slander and false statements. I found a letter from the honourable member for Fremantle dated December, 1953. It was quite stale. Iu that letter, the honourable member told me that he was quite satisfied that nothing at all had beeu received by the Parliamentary Labour party from the Communist party. That was the basis of the whole charge. I have that letter from the honourable member for FremantleDuring the by-election for the Gwydir seat in New South Wales, the honourable member for Fremantle said that be had complete confidence in the Leader of the Australian Labour party. The opportunity to raise matters on the motion for the adjournment of the House has been abused, again by the honourable member for Gellibrand. I sum the situation up by saying, first, with regard to the statemarks of the Leader of the Opposition ment made by the honourable member for Dr. Evatt. Parkes, that my name has been dragged into the matter gratuitiously without the slightest evidence that I had any connection with it. I knew nothing of what he had done. When the honourable member foi' Yarra made his statement in the House he might have given me ful l information. The distribution of the pamphlets is a matter of serious import. .1 did not know the explanation. The American governmental propaganda or information bureau is entitled to pnt matter into letter-boxes iu conjunction with the material of the honourable memher for Yarra. There might be some explanation for this action. It has nothing to do with finance. I said that if the two sets of material were distributed by the American Government a wrong action had been taken. However, I made a publicstatement. An honourable member has a right to do so, just as he has the right to make a statement in this House. Whatever the American Government has done, it is the duty of a member of the Parliament to speak if he thinks that the action calls for explanation. I not only did that, but I also asked the United States Consul for an explanation. I am still waiting for it. Why was it done? The other matter that was raised during this debate was a rehash of a stale slander and a lie. We got nothing from the Communist party. It is a complete untruth to say that we did. Every penny received by the Australian Labour party, of which the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) and the Leader oi"" the Opposition in the Senate (Senator McKenna) were trustees, was received at that time from trade unions affiliated with the Australian Labour party. The practice adopted in the case of those contributions was the same a3 that adopted by all the previous trustees of the fund. I believe that these are matters upon which I am called to make a comment, but it is really quite disparate from what the honourable member for Parkes has said. Minister) [11.25] I do not propose to detain the House, but a few plain words, should be said about this matter. I disregard almost entirely the irrelevant re. (Dr. Evatt).",78,Pairs
228,Mr Menzies (Kooyong,"Primecause I was criticized. gentleman has said-and I accept his word at once-that so far as the statement about money being contributed by the American Embassy was concerned, he had nothing to do with it. That is all right. There is no difficulty in accepting that, although I must confess that I am a little puzzled to know why the right honourable gentleman then proceeded to make a mystery about the distribution of some pamphlets or information sheets issued by the American Department or Bureau of Information. I had always thought that that was what information bureaux overseas were for. If anybody walked into an office and said, "" CanI have 200 copies of this pamphlet?"", he would be given 200 copies with the greatest pleasure. gentleman has said that there is some mystery as to how these pamphlets came to be issued by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon). All these are irrelevancies. The discussion to-night began with a reference to a statement publicly made by the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen). It was a statement which imputed to the Embassy of the TJnited States of America a grossly improper interference in the local industrial politics Allan, A. I . of Australia. In those circumstances, the honourable member had a simple choice when the matter was raised. He could either undertake to prove his statement against the Embassy of the United States of Americaa heavy task to undertake-o r he could have said, "" I was wrong, I withdraw, I apologize. The incident, I hope, will be treated as closed"". He adopted neither of those courses. Therefore, it becomes necessary for me, on behalf of the Government of Australia to say, in the hope that the United States administration may read it, that on behalf of this Parliament, I apologize to the United States of America for this gross insult offered to it by a member of this House. The grossness of the insult is not lessened by the fact that the honourable member for Parkes adopted the method of escape which is, of all methods when slanders are uttered, the most contemptible. He said, "" I did not say it. It was common gossip, and so I thought I would get a headline by publishing it "" . That conduct is utterly contemptible, and every word that tbe honourable member for Parkes said to-night, so far from purging his contempt, added to the offence and made it even more necessary that our friends of the United States of America should be told that most of the people in this place, who are acquainted with the decencies of international usage, will have no part or lot in this kind of sneaking attack which is made for some local purpose, with utter disregard of the effect that it may have, if it is misunderstood, upon our relations with a country which stands so entirely and closely with us, and is so entirely associated with the whole security of Australia.
