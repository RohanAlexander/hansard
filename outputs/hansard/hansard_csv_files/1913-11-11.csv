The Speaker, in his reply, explained the nature of the offence which had thus been committed against the House by the member's conduct towards the Speaker; and the member made, in consequence, an apology in terms that averted the consequences of the offence. Subsequently, however, the same member published in a newspaper a letter which contained a repetition of the same offence against the Speaker. House thereupon, having heard the member in his place, resolved that the letter was a gross libel upon Mr Speaker, deserving the severest condemnation of the House, and that the honourable member be suspended from the service of the House for the remainder of the session, or for one calendar month, whichever should first terminate.

A t that moment several members were interjecting, and there was, as usual, unfortunately, some confusion. The Prime Minister later said, "" I propose to direct your attention "" to something in a paper. I asked the honourable gentleman once or twice whether he proposed to ask a question or raise a matter of privilege, and he distinctly stated thafc he desired to raise a question of privilege. I had already noticed what had appeared in fche papers, and I was familiar with the proceedings under such conditions; The and ifc was my intention, had he put a question, to have asked the honourable member for Ballarat whether he had stated what was attributed to him. But the Prime Minister is mistaken, or I am I am not sure which, but one of us is mistaken-as to whether or not he asked a question.

I am asking Mr Speaker to reconsider his ruling. my mind at the moment in giving my ruling, which, as I stated, I gave with some hesitation at that time ; but it seems to me that the whole trouble has arisen from a wrong procedure in the what I believe to have been a wrong procedure. If this matter had been Drought up in the form of a question to the Speaker, everything would have been perfectly in order, but it was not brought forward in that way, according to my memory. The attention of the Speaker was directed to something that had appeared in the papers, and this was done as a matter of privilege. The only point, however, to decide now is whether this is a question of "" privilege suddenly arisi n g , "" as provided in standing order 283.

He merely warned lionorable members against uttering such things as proved. Are they, in suoh circumstances, going to vote to suspend a representative of the people from the service of the House for the rest of the session?

It is not for the Speaker to say whether the House shall take action or not.

I did not direct the has. Clerk to read the statements, because I thought that the matter probably would be allowed to drop.

First permit me to say that I think the Government have dealt very unfairly in submitting bhe mobion before I have had an opporbuniby to study the reports of my speech in the Age and Argus.

Those quoted words were not in the original Hansard proof, but were added; and I criticised the position very severely, as I claim I had a perfect right to do, in view of the refusal to permit us to discuss it in Parliament, and of the fact that the motion of the honourable member for Barrier has been put lowest down on the business-paper.

If the honourable member for Ballarat made tliese statements believing there were no reporters present, and thinking that they would not come back to the House, his conduct is all the more reprehensible.

Really, one is astounded to find that that honourable member, despite his knowledge of the law, is prepared, without proof, to vobe wibh the Government to t u r n a member of this Chamber out of it , and refuse to allow him to represent his constituents. How would you cauterize such conduct, Mr Speaker, were you on the floor of the House! I venture to believe that your sarcastic reference to the honourable member would be such as to make him curl and hide himself for ever and a day. May I remind the honourable member, who seeks now to prove another honourable member guilby that was my privilege to draw attention to a Wangaratta newspaper, in which the honourable member himself was reported to have grossly misrepresented bhe Labour parby, notwithstanding that he had the proof to the contrary in his hand at the time. When I brought this forward and read it , the houorable member said he would neither deny nor acknowledge it . He sat in his seat over there and said, ' ' You have the newspaper, consequently you are responsible for bringing it forward; you can give the proof,"" meaning that if proof could not be given other than such as appeared in the newspaper, he consequently could not be deemed bo be guilby. The honourable member and honour, and dignity, but when he was indicted for a gross misrepresentation he refused to allow a report in a newspaper to convict him. W h y, then, does he now allow a report in a newspaper to convict an honourable member on this side of the House? proposition to put to him 1 No doubt his little outburst was congenial to himself, but if he demands that a newspaper shall not convict himself, he is guilty of something underhand if he wants to convict another member on like evidence. Let me remind bhe House bhab ib is a most serious thing to eject a member from this Chamber, because by doing so you tell 16,000 bond fide electors of the Commonwealth that they shall not for the time being be represented here. You are, therefore, doing more than merely ejecting a member; you are practically insulting a whole constituency. I ask that this shall not be done for party motives, merely that one side or the other may have a greater majority than it has at present. I ask that before it is done they shall bring such proof as will be reasonable in the minds of every bond fide citizen, such proof as can be substantiated here, and also satisfy the court of public opinion. If we wait for that to be done, it seems to me that the honourable member will not be ejected. I heard an outburst from the honourable member for In d i about the honour, and dignity, and traditions of this Chamber. L e t me bell bhe honourable member whab bhe traditions of the last three years were, when the Labour party had a substantial majority in both branches of the Legislature. We allowed upon a newspaper report, every member of the Opposition the f u l l only a few weeks ago it and free right of speech. We allowed every member to properly represent his report that appeared in the consbibuency, and to give utterance to what he conscientiously believed was right. On no occasion did we seek to close the mouth of any honourable member, no matter what advantage he was taking, in our opinion, of the Standing Orders. Those were the traditions of the last three years, notwithstanding the majority we had in both branches of the Legislabure, and we were successful in that period in passing much legislation of national importance. If honourable members have any regard for the traditions of the House, it would be well for them to give the Opposition an opportunity to speak as they think fit, so long as they obey the Standing Orders. The Attorney-General occupies an extraordinary position. He has now speaks aboub traditions, brought forward the Age newspaper to prove that something was said by the honourable member for Ballarat. Surely that is a fair bhe Agef o r bhe moment.

The honourable member is to be removed if he does not favour honourable members on the opposite side with an abject apology. which was followed in the House of Commonsi n the case which has been quoted. It appears thafc an accusation of partiality in the administration of fche closure was directed agaiust the Speaker by a member of the House of Commons. ferred to in a footnote, one occurring in 1891, and the other in 1893. in July, 1891, and another in March, 1893. there was a case of a somewhat similar nature. Attorney-General, and on which the Government base their action, an honourable member had accused the Sneaker of the House of Commons of partiality in administering the closure. H is offence was brought before the House; the Sneaker explained the nature of the offence whicr> had been committed against fche H o l l and the offending member made an apology in terms which averted the consequences of his offence. He was evidently given an opportunity of speaking, aud of saying whether he had or had not been guilty of the offence. He must have admitted that; he was guilty in some way or another, and, subsequently apologizing, escaped the consequences of his offence. But the question of his suspension arose afterwards, when, after making his apology to the House, he D i d tlie House prorepeated his offence in a letter to fche party press. Here, before the honourable member for Ballarat admits that he has said anything, and before he is given an opportunity to discuss fche matter in any way whatever, a resolution is submitted for liis expulsion for the session. for Ballarat was twice called upon to explain. member in his place, and the member having, evidently, acknowledged the reHe has petition of the offence, and having refused to apologize in any way, the House of Commons then, and only then, proceeded to take the action which has been referred to. Is this House justified in taking the action now proposed on the first occasion, and without proof of any description? The reference to May seems to have been hurriedly read, and the procedure overLet us consider the coursje looked, when it is claimed that the case referred to was on all fours w it h the case thafc has arisen here. In the case referred to punishment was only meted out to fche offending member when he had offended a second time, and had cheerf u l l y acknowledged his offence. There is no acknowledgment of offence on the part of the honourable member for Ballarat. As a matter of fact, fche honourable member has not had a f u l l opportunity to say whetlier the reports of his speech appearing in the newspapers are correct or otherwise. In the case dealt w it h by the during which the honourable member referred to the matter, he emphatically stated that, so far as the reports appearing in the Argus and Age are concerned, there were no reporters present to represent those newspapers, and, so far as fche Echo is concerned, the honourable member stated that he had not had an opportunity to read the report appearing in that newspaper.",43,Attack On The Speaker

Speaker does nofc possess the confidence of fche House, he would have been able to say things reflecting on the Speaker. In discussing that motion, he could have made statements which could nofc be made in the ordinary course of debate. As to the remarks made at Ballaratsupposing the report to be correct-the honourable member made them when smartiug under a sense of injustice, because his rights and privileges as a member had been taken from him by an unprecedented use of the Standing Orders. To continue the quotation from the reportThere was good reason for the motion, namely, of hi3 record. BufcI repeat that words thai the Speaker had lost the confidence of members. Speaker has deliberately .iltcrcd a Hansard proof. The proof showed thut tbe third reading of the Loan Bill was not carried, according to his' own words, and he altered the proof to make it appear in Hansard that it was carried. That is the charge reported to have been made agaiust the Speaker by the honourable member for Ballarat, to which the Attorney-General has added the word ""fraudulent."" If the right of free Speech was recognised in this Chamber,, and if there was opportunity to discuss tlie motion of want of confidence in the Speaker, of which notice has been given, might it not have been possible for the honourable member for Ballarat to bring proof of his assertion, and would honourable members say, if he proved it to the hilt, tliat he should be removed from the Chamber for having made ifc? Are they going to take the responsibility of removing from the Chamber a man who proves to the hilfc a charge thafc he has made ? Honourable members opposite will dare a greafc deal in fcheir sudden and temporary accession to power, bufc I doubt whether they will go so far as fco say thafc a member should be removed when he proves to the hilfc a charge that he has made. The Attorney-General presupposes that there is no proof, and is consequently prepared to condemn the honourable member, but we have the clearest proof that the Hansard report of Mr Speaker's remarks concerning the third reading of the Loan Bill was added to by someone. And the addition gives to the reporb a complexion differing from fchafc which ifc would otherwise have had. TJnder these circumstances, are honourable members prepared to vote for the suspension Let them compare the original report as transcribed, not by the representatives of party newspapers, but by the official reporters, who have no party to serve, and no endsfcogain in this matter, with the report that was allowed to go forth to the public.

Apparently the honourable member, without attempting to ascertain whetlier there is justification for the statement of the lionorable member for Ballarat, is ready to support a motion for his suspension. us, and prove that it was made. read. Silting suspended from 6.30 lo 7.1/0 p.m. adjourned for dinner, I was endeavouring to deal with that phase of the motion which necessitates the bringing forward of proof, my contention being that honourable gentlemen on the Ministerial side will not be justified in voting for a motion which is based on a newspaper report, of whose accuracy they have absolutely no proof. I take it , at present, that honourable gentlemen are desirous of being fair. I take it that they will not lightly throw an honourable member out of his place; that they will not lightly disfranchise the Ballarat constituency; and I take it that, in general, they will agree that the representatives of constituencies should be given the right of expressing tlieir opinions to their electors, even though, in doing so, they should come near to dealing with the Speaker himself in that capacity. would be a serious matter if the conduct of the Speaker, being such as even a majority of the House desired, the minority were not to be permitted to express their opinion in respect thereof. I quite agree that it would not suffice for any honourable member to go outside the Chamber, and make serious reflections on the conduct of the Speaker, or even on that of honourable members, without notice being taken of his statements. same time, honourable members will not desire that the right ot criticism, fair and reasonable, and the right of expressing an opinion in keeping with conscientious beliefs, shall be denied. For that, indeed, would be creating a serious situation, and curtailing a liberty which Australians in the past have prided themselves upon. T submit respectfully, that it would be going much farther than the constituencies in general would really desire. For, if I understand my fellow countrymen aright, they will maintain, afc all costs, the right of free speech; and the right of any of their representatives to express in public the views that he honestly holds. that they are true. fice for even this House, with all its traditions and all its powers and privileges, to takefchafcright away from any citizen. I was contending that this motion must turn on the question of whether there was any justification for the honourable member for Ballarat using expressions of the character he is reported to have used. I take the interjection of the honourable member for Hume as indicating his trend of thought-that if the statements alleged to have been made by the honourable member for Ballarat are true, or substantially true, then there was justification for the making of them. I ask the Attorney-General, I ask honourable members on the other side who have not yet made up their minds, whether, if those statements are substantially true, it must not follow, in keeping with the interjection made jusfc now, that the honourable member for Ballarafc had justification for making them. If he was justified i u using those expressions, will honourable members be justified in removing him from the Chamber? W ill fcliey be justified in depriving his constituents of his services here, and depriving him of the right of criticising what is going on in connection with the It affairs of the country? Before we adjourned for dinner, I said that, as regards the first part of his alleged remarks, which read as follows, Therefore, he wanted to say what he would not be allowed lo say on the floor of the House. the honourable member had justification, because of the repeated applications of the closure, and because, in respect of the very motiou with which he was then dealing, the Government had taken an unA t the precedented course. that, if tliere had been no closure applied, he would have been permitted to say that? ment had practically said to him, "" Y o u shall nofc discuss the motion,"" for they have put it afcfchebottom of the business paper.

There were 37 members on each side, and we could have demanded a division, with the result that the Speaker would have had to vote himself into the Chair. We refrained, however, from doing so.

He said, first of all, that no reporter from the Argus or the Age was present at the meeting in question; but he did not say that a reporter from the third newspaper quoted-the Ballarat Evening Echo-wa s not present. however, is not the point.

The House, in dealing with one of its own members, does not proceed upon the principle that he is a criminal.

I u dealing with a case of this kind, we do not proceed on the principle followed by a Courti n a case where a man is being prosecuted for larceny, or some petty offence.

I wish to say at once that nothing the Opposition have done in any way excuses what the Government have been guilty of. The Government have done what they have done without provocation, excuse, or justification. The charge levelled against the honourable member for Ballarat is that on Sunday last, in the course of a speech in his constituency, he made some statements in regard to Mr Speaker, including a criticism of the Speaker's fairness, to the effect that he was a biased Speaker, that he had altered Hansard, and that he did not possess the confidence of the House.

The amendment is not in issue at all, and it is not proposed to have two debates-the matter is too important. The amendment has nothing to do with the principle involved, beyond impressing honourable members with the serious nature of that principle. amendment on the voices, and then get to the main debate. the debate as a whole, and deal with the ameudment later on. the Standing Orders which limits debate to an ameudment, except that standing order which requires that members shall address themselves to the question before the Chair. Tliere is a special standing order limiting debate to an amendment which is moved in Committee, but, so far as I am aware, speaking without the chance at the moment to look up the matter specially, there is no standing order which requires that debate in the House shall be limited to an amendment except in the case of a member who has spoken to the main question. your ruling, Mr Speaker, to be that an honourable member, by any kind of technical amendment, may traverse a subject as often as he pleases? I submit that that cannot be good parliamentary law. Honourable members, I submit, should agree to this technical amendment, so that the question may not be traversed twice. objection is to practice-for instance, no later than the beginning of the session, when there were a motion and amendments submittedto allow discussion on both motion and amendment to proceed afc the same time. It seems to me, however, that it is the desire of the House that this technical amendment should be agreed to now.

But, nevertheless, the Speaker, as such, is no more immune from criticism than anybody else. The honourable member for Ballarat has made some charges, and he was perfectly free to make them. The charge agaiust the honourable member is that he made statements against Mr. the Speaker. Whether his charges be well or ill founded-whethe r he has exercised his right of speech to a point degenerating I suggest that we take into licence-is a matter of opinion and for consideration; but that he had a right to speak as he thought fit, there is no sort of doubt whatever. The honorahle member for Ballarat, as a representative of the people, is entitled to say here what he thinks of the Government, of any public business, and of yourself, Mr. Speaker. But he has been denied the right to say here what he thinks; and, as reported, that is the reason he gave for saying what he did at Ballarat. It is asserted now that the honourable member had no right to say what it is alleged he said. Why? An y citizen could have said the same thing. There is not one citizen in Australia, other than a member of this Chamber, whose right to eo to understand Ballarat, or anywhere else, and say what the honourable member is reported to have said, would be called in question.",55,Groom Honorabl E Members House In The Chair

Now, what did he say about you, Mr Speaker? He said that you were a "" b i as e d "" Speaker. That may give you offence; it may even arouse the ire of honourable members who sit on the Government side of the Chamber : but surely it is a charge that can be made ? What is there, in the very nature of the language, in a statement that the Speaker is biased that warrants the expulsion of an honourable member? Are we just hearing for the first time that there are persons occupying judicial or presidential chairs in this Parliament or elsewhere who are biased ? Have we not heard of biased Judiciaries? Hasi t not been declared by the supreme tribunal of this country that a citizen was at liberty to say with impunity that one of the High Court Judges was biased and a creature of the Labour party ? The High Court dismissed the point with contempt when its attention was directed to the fact that a newspaper had said something against Mr Justice Higgins much stronger than anything said by the honourable member for Ballarat against you, sir. Tlie charge preferred against you, Mr Speaker, by the honourable member for Ballarat, falls under three heads that you are biased; that you altered Ran sard; and that you had lost the confidence of the House. charge-that you are biased-it is a matter of opinion, and you cannot control opinion. Nor, indeed, the expression of opinion. T think you are biased I may not say so ? I think that any decision of yours is wrong I may not criticise it , provided I do so in a personally inoffensive way? What does a charge of bias amount to? From the very nature of things man is prone to err and unconsciously lean in one direction or another? second charge-that you deliberately altered Hansard-that , of course, is a question of fact, and it is susceptible of proof or disproof in the usual way. There is, on page 2789 of Hansard, a statement made by yourself that the t h i r d reading had not been carried, and you made a correction in Hansard, in which you said that you ordered the Clerk to correct the procedure because at the time there was such disorder as to warrant, in your opinion, a departure from the strict form necessary and proper in such circumstances. The statement made by the honourable member, therefore, was not technically inaccurate. As to the third charge-that you had lost the confidence of the House-wha t does that mean ? It is a mere matter of opinion. Only last week, the Leader of the Opposition said that the Government had lost the confidence of the House, and that was not regarded as an insult, though it was regarded as an excuse for an action which is without parallel in this Parliament, aud, so far as I know, in any other Parliament. Therefore, the charges made by the honourable member for Ballarat, if they were made against you, were charges that are to be met and treated in the way in which all charges are met and treated, first of all by having a statement of them, and then by requesting the person charged to say whether he admits having made the remarks complained of ; and whether, if so, he considers them true. MrW . H . IRVINE W h a t are true? the honourable member for Ballarat was a belated one. The charge was levelled, and the whole force and vehemence of the criticism of honourable members were behind it long before it was considered desirable to submit the matter to the honourable member who was charged. But As to the first why this startling departure from the settled practice? There are two persons now being tried in the House. The honourable member for Ballarat is being arAre you going to say that if raigned because he made a charge against the Speaker; and, with deference to you, Are you going to say that if Mr Speaker, you cannot escape from the tribunal either; because the charge alleged to have been made against you by the honourable member for Ballarat is being heard, is being tried, and will be tried. As to the General propriety of such motions, it is alleged that this is being As to the done only because it has reference to a charge against the Speaker. We are told that if it had been a charge against any other honourable member no notice would have been taken of it . I submit it is a charge which only incidentally has relation to the Speaker, and that the real",56,Groom Honorabl E Members House In The Chair
744,Mr Hughes,"The reference togravamen of the charge is that it is au attack upon a member of one party by the other party, where both sides are so evenly divided that the Speaker is carrying ou the government of the country. If , on the Government side of the House, there was an overwhelming majority, this charge would mean nothing-it could mean nothing in the very nature of it-it would be a mere personal attack on the Speaker that might properly be resented; but, when democratic government rests in the hands of one mau, he can never hope to escape criticism; nor should he escape it if he merits censure. In such circumstances such a charge takes on a very difI humbly submit that I did not transgress my ferent complexion. This charge is one levelled at that freedom of speech and right of criticism which are the two great principles underlying representative government. it will be competent for the Prime Minister to rise to-morrow or some other day and stop my mouth, or the mouth of some other honourable member, for saying some other thing to which he takes exception. In this country, and under this form of government, which we call Democracy, a man should be allowed to say anything he pleases providing it does not create disorder, is not blasphemous, and is not personally offensive, and is couched in decent language. Subject to that, speech is free, and the attempt to fetter speech by any other means must inevitably destroy the very base upon which democratic government rests. I come now to the attempt to bolster this charge by precedent. General says that the House of Commons is able to guide us in the matter, and the Minister of Trade and Customs quoted some cases in support of that, and we are told that in the House of Commons the honourable member charged was not even heard, but was condemned and suspended for the remainder of the session, tlie presumption being that conditions there were exactly the same as they are here. inaccurate. In one of the cases quoted, that in 1887, the member for the Camborne division of Cornwall, Mr the honourable member for Ballarat Conybeare had made a statement outside Parliament to which very strong exception was taken. fairness of the Chair. It had to do, I understand, with the closuring of Mr for a quarter of an hour, when he was Conybeare. It was a very natural thing. Mr Hughes. The member had been closured, and he objected and went to his constituents and said that Mr Speaker was biased, and so on and so on. He was called upon in the House to apologize, and he did so in these wordsAnd, again, I say that if , at a public meeting, in the heat of the moment, I said anything that could possibly convey any erroneous impression lhat 1 intended to reflect on your conduct and authority in the chair, I can only say I am sorry for it, for I had no such intention. I spoke on Saturday witb a f u l l consciousness of the gravity of the situation. I felt it to be my duty to express my opinion, however inadequately, on, the present position of affairs; and, witb the explanation which I have now offered, duty in saying what I did say on such a grave constitutional crisis. If you call that an apology and withdrawal, you must be very easily satisfied. If this motionis carried Mr Conybeare said he was sorry if he offended the Speaker, but he saw no reason to regret what he had said, and that what he had said was fully justified in the circumstances. Mr W. H . IEVINB -The honourable member will not even say that. following year, when the same gentleman was again charged with tbe same offence. Lord Randolph Churchill moved that he be suspended. I want to trace the procedure of the House of Commons that is used as a cover behind which honourable members are now taking shelter for the method pursued by them. There is a fundamental distinction to be drawn. First of all, Lord Randolph Churchill asked leave of the Speaker to address The Attorneya question to the honourable member who was charged with the offence. Having obtained leave, he then asked the honourable member charged whether he was the author of a letter complained of which had appeared in the press. The member charged admitted that he was the author of the letter. That was the foundation of the proceedings-firs t of all the proof thafc the charge was true, and was admitted That is quite to be true by the member charged. The letter was then read, and it certainly went very far beyond what is alleged fco have said on Sunday last. Ifc accused the Speaker of being biased; It reflected upon the it said that the member had been treated unfairly, and that he had only spoken closured, &c. The next step after the",57,Groom Honorabl E Members House In The Chair
745,Mr Hughes,"I come now to thereading of the letter was to move that the member be suspended from the service of the House. Remember that this was his second offence within one year. The member was asked if he had anything to say. said what he liad to say, he was asked to withdraw. explained the whole of the matter. He put his side before the House. note this, sir: The charge was made in Mr Conybeare's letter; Mr Conybeare was asked, "" D i d you write that letter?"" He said, "" I d i d . "" He was then asked if he had anything to say in reply, and he made a statement. Then Mr Speaker was asked if he had anything to say. A t any rate, Mr Speaker said something. He justified what he had done. Here we see a vitally important distinction between the two proceedings. case the foundation was the admitted authorship of the article. was then charged. He pleaded to the charge. The Speaker, who was presumably offended, then made his case clear, and afterwards the House debated the matter. The Speaker said that he did not wish to speak with any heat nor to import any kind of passion into the controversy, and then he went on to relate the circumstances, after which the matter was discussed. During the discussion, Mr Gladstone, perhaps the greatest parliamentary authority of our time, said it was highly inconvenient to call in question the conduct of the Speaker except in a regular and formal manner. But Mr Gladstone, although he held, as I hope we all do, that it is very undesirable to have to criticise the Speaker at a l l , with you as an individual, but I claim my recognised that, for proper cause, he may be criticised like any other person. This point needs special emphasis. -strongly protest against this gratuitous and wholly unwarranted assumption that the action, the conduct, and. utterances of the Speaker may not be criticised, discussed, or censured. The thing is absurd. The highest judicial tribunal in this land is, very properly, not beyond -criticism. Parliament itself, whose ceremonious and formal mouth-piece you are, -sir, is not beyond criticism; and the public may say of this Parliament collectively a hundred times more than it was alleged t l i a t the honourable member for Ballarat -said against you, and the people cannot lie punished for so doing. formulate an indictment that will include a whole nation. It is alleged against the honourable member that he said you were biased; that is not by any means unusual in those holding judicial and presidential offices, as I have said; that you altered When he had Hansard, technically, you admit it ; that you have lost the confidence of the Then the Speaker House; I do not think it is saying too much to say that you have Please lost the confidence of half the House. In those circumstances, what has the honourable member for Ballarat said for which he is to be punished in this way ? Excepting that he has said it , perhaps, without those extenuating phrases that a man naturally weaves into his speech when he speaks at length, how has he offended ? They have taken three or four phrases out of the honourable member's speech. In the one They have published the engraving without the frame. They have taken two The member or three things out of their context, and upon this the Prime Minister, because it has offended his nobility, because some one has dared to criticise him and his work, dared to criticise you, who were at one time his colleague, and are now the Speaker of the House, asks the House to take this most extraordinary action You were the proper person to take notice of this, and, had you taken notice of it , I should have been one of the first to ask the honourable member for Ballarat to withdraw it , because, after all, whatever opinions we may have, while you are the Speaker of this House, we mustalways endeavour to pay you that respect your position deserves. I have not the slightest quarrel right, and shall exercise it to the last ditch, to criticise anything you do or any I most other person does,"" in this Parliament or out of it , in spite of all the endeavours honourable members on that side may make to close our mouths. They have, no doubt, seized upon this pretext to endeavour to persuade the public to overlook their action on Friday last, which will remain unforgotten to the end, in spite of all they do. Standing by itself, it is a monument for decent men to avoid. It is a pillar of flame which will light them to destruction. I recall the Fusion, and what they did, and I know what became of them. You cannot Mr W. H.

Tbe statement contained in the report whioh has been read, and which is, therefore, in the possession of the House, is thatThe Speaker had lost the confidence of members. There was a good reason for the motion. proof lhat the Speaker has deliberately altered a Hansard proof."" Let me take that statement first. fact that the Speaker has altered au uncorrected Hansard proof is not an evidence that there is anything wrong. That is a right which belongs to, and is exercised by, every honourable member of this House. any honourable member's speech has any right to be quoted without the authority or consent of the member concerned. An uncorrected Hansard proof of one honourable member's speech should not be in the possession of any other honourable member without his consent. An uncorrected proof of the Speaker's decisions or remarks has no more right to be in the hands of a private member than has an uncorrected proof of any honourable member's speech to be in the hands of another private member. Indeed, it is more important that an uncorrected proof of the Speaker's decisions should not find its way into the hands of a private member, because those decisions are embodied in a permanent record for future reference, and [109]2 H . IRVINE I am certainly will be quoted as precedents. Therefore, it is imperative that the Speaker should go carefully through his unrevised proofs and make necessary corrections in order to make his meaning clear, or even to make emendations and additions where omissions occur. This has been the right and the practice of Speakers in every Parliament that has ever existed. Not only has it beeu the practice of the presiding officer of tlie House, but of every I again assure you, sir, private member of it . I do not know how an uncorrected proof of my remarks, which, I understand, had not even been seen by the Hansard staff themselves beMr Speaker fore it was quoted in this Chamber, came into the possession of an honourable member. the ordinary course. Several members interjecting, jections are disorderly.

He would, also, be exposed to the risk of having errors i u his speech made the subject of subsequent accusations against himself. It will be seen, therefore, that, in exercising the right of emendation, I merely exercised a right which is exercised by every other honourable member. When I examined my proofs, I saw that certain words to which I had absolutely given utterance in this House, were not included in the report. that some honourable members did not hear them.

830,Mr Speaker,"Order! The honorreport saying, "" Question resolved in the affirmative."" I did not tell the Hansard staff to put that in. They heard it. They must have taken notice that the question had been decided, and, as a matter of fact, an honourable member upon the Government side of the House, after it had been decided on the voices, interrupted .the argument between the leaders upon either side of the chamber, and said something to the Prime Minister, which I caught. That something was to the effect that the third reading had been carried, whereupon the Prime Minister rose immediately and moved, ""That the question be now put."" That is reported by Hansard. We have the statement in the Hansard proofThat the House do now adjourn. Tbat the question be now put. Hill read a third lime. It was here that the proceedings were interrupted, and my attention having been called to tlie fact that the Bill had not been read a third time, I interrupted the motion for the adjournment of the House, and directed the Clerk to read the Bill a third time, he having, meanwhile, drawn my attention to the fact that that formality had not been complied with. It was because I had directed him to read the Bill a third time that it was necessary for me to .make the alteration or addition in the words I have mentioned. In the circumstances, I directed the Clerk to carry out the decision of the House, and to read the Bill a third time before I put the motion. The uncorrected Hansard proof which I have in my hand shows that very clearly. Then, according to this proof, the honourable member for Kennedy, on a point of order, saidI maintain that tbe only question before the House now is "" That the House do now adjourn "" ; but a totally different question has been put. The rest of the report does not affect the point at issue. The main point is that I did not alter a word-no t even a comma -of the report in regard to the question of putting the motion for the third reading to the House. The motion for the third reading of the Bill had been carried on the voices, but the formality of giving effect to the decision of the House"" That the Bill be now read a third time "" had not been carried out by the Clerk, and I directed him to repair that omission, as already explained. That fact had a right to be recorded in Hansard. But this is not the only charge contained in the :statememt. The further charge is made thatThe Speaker was acting in a biased manner, and was proving himself a bitter partisan. The proof of that was the Speaker's ruling on Mr Cook's point of order that the want of confidence motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition should be treated as private members' business. In regard to that charge, I wish to say that, so far as I was concerned, there was no question of partiality involved in the matter. I had simply to carry out the Standing Orders as I found them, and I acted conscientiously in the discharge of my duties. I would remind honourable members that the honourable member for West Sydney when speaking particularly emphasized the point that I had to carry out the Standing Orders as they were. If I had departed from the Standing OrdersI sliould have laid myself open to justifiable attack in the House for having done so, but I did not. Motions of no confidence have not previously been interrupted in this House in a similar way because the point has not been raised, owing to the usual automatic suspension by the decision of the Govei'nment not to proceed with other business pending the decision of the House on the no-confidence motion. But, in this case, the Government intervened, and said they would go on with business. Then there is in this statement another implied chargeDuring the debate he left the chair, and Mr McGrath had no doubt that he had a consultation with the Attorney-General. For that reason the Speaker no longer possessed the respect and confidence of the House. I wish to say at once that I did not leave the chair for the purpose of having any consultation with the Attorney-General as alleged, but that I asked the honourable member for Perth to relieve me for a little while on account of an urgent matter having arisen which required my attention, and which had nothing whatever to do with the question before tlie House. personal explanation.

Next Monday, it will be just eight years since I pointed out that the very first party to squeal under those laws would be the Labour party. ""They had not the brains to grasp the facts then, and had to wait for actual .facts to prove it . The honourable member for Bendigo has given us some law. honourable member some more directly. ber has said that the honourable member for Ballarat is simply accused; but what Court is there in the world in which the honourable member for Ballarat would not have to plead either guilty or not guilty? The only case in which a plea is not taken is where the accused is incapable of understanding what he says; therefore, the inference is that the honourable member for Ballarat did not know what he was saying, or, in other words, that he was eitlier imbecile or insane. is absolutely wrong. for Werriwa has said, a million times over, things a thousand times worse than those said by the honourable member for Ballarat. away from the fact that Parliament Is a Court of the highest record-that it is the chief Court of the country. No member is responsible in any other Court for any remark he makes in the House; and, consequently, when he is outside, and makes remarks about Parliament, the House has to take notice of them if they reflect on the honour and integrity of members. There is no doubt that the statements of the honourable member do constitute a charge against the honour and integrity of the House, inasmuch as they convey that the House is guilty of keeping in place a Speaker who has been practically guilty of fraudulently altering the records. and I cannot expect the honourable memthe hands of a ber to appreciate the distinction that lies here, though I should expect a school boy of five or six to understand it . It is a very wise provision that enables this House to sit as a Court on honourable members. The Labour party voted for a law which gave £700,000 odd to certain big sugar-planters and mill-owners; and, supposing I had gone about the country charging them with having been paid £100,000 to pass that law, ought I not to have been charged in this House? member's party did so charge us, so f a r as the Tobacco Trust is concerned; and the honourable member himself made worse charges than that during his election And 1 shall give the campaign. ber will never find me making such charges. He may find me expressing a desire to know why honourable members act in such a way that, if they were in America, they would be charged with having been paid large sums for voting; but I have never said that honourable members have received money for doing such a thing. No authority but Parliament can call such statements in question. There has been attached to the statements of the honourable member for Ballarat an im portance that any one who knows the honourable member would not attach to them. We know that the Labour party have not attached much importance to what the honourable member said; and the honourable member fer West Sydney and the honourable member for Adelaide have made various explanations which tend to show, in the first place, that the honourable member was not responsible for what he said, and that, if he did say it , nobody ought to believe it or take any noticetherefore, that the House ought to take no notice. correct.

The honourable member for Adelaide said that the Labour party, when in power, allowed the right of free speech, but that was only because the forms of the House were never abused by honourable members of our party like they were to-night, when, although it was only a slip of a word .as between October and November, the Opposition actually divided the House, and wasted the time of the House. Let us look into cords of the House. Surely, lionorable It is admitted that the only members will not say they were not wasting time, and we may yet find the honourable member for Ballarat rising with his tongue in his cheek, and saying, "" I withdraw; I have wasted all the day on a thing of this sort. You thought I meant it , but I never meant to do anything but waste time."" houorable member to withdraw tlje accusation of wasting the time of the House, as applied to the honourable member for Ballarat. hesitation in withdrawing it .

It might be inferred, when I spoke about the reading of these words. having directed the Clerk to read the B ill an honourable member to make a third time, that the Clerk had been against the Speaker or neglectful of his duties. I did not intend to convey that impression, because, as a matter of fact, it was the Clerk himself who called my attention to the omission of that formality. The honourable member for Werriwa has made a speech of some importance, and containing a great deal of unintentional misrepresentation. On his misstatements he founded a declaration that the honourable member for Ballarat would be able to go to his constituents, and say that he had wasted a day.

If the honourable member for Wannon wishes to hit at the honourable member for Ballarat, not on evidence before him, but on the prejudice which is in his own mind, nothe one man body can prevent him. But no honest minded man would do such a thing even withto a criminal. Why did the Government choose the newspaper that came out with a report two days after the event? They who chose that newspaper, I presume, because the language of the report gave them the largest pull over the honourable member in their desire to humiliate him, to degrade him, and to oust him from the House for a particular period.

This motion is based upon the procedure of the House of Commons. ber for Ballarat has made certain charges against the Speaker. I do not think that the honourable member for Ballarat really knew what took place on that occasion. ber for Ballarat and the honourable member for Gwydir were appointed as tellers ber for Ballarat occupied fifteen minutes in counting thirteen members. on the Ministerial side. him fifteen minutes to count twenty-six members, so that I really do not know whether he was responsible for what he was doing. I do not think he knew exactly what took place. sir, the honourable member for Calare has been detailing what took place on a division in the House last week, and he has accused the honourable member for Ballarat of not knowing exactly what he was doing. I think that remark implies certain behaviour on the part of the honourable member for Ballarat, and that it should be withdrawn. ber is not in order in reflecting on the capacity of another honourable member, and I ask hira to withdraw the remark. draw, but when the honourable member for Perth was in the Chair the honourable member not to refer to matters that take place in Committee. servedly. The honourable member for Bourke said that when the honourable member for Ballarat made these charges against you, sir, it was your duty to bring an action against him for libel. statement, however, was made only on Saturday or Sunday last, and it is not for you to be going all over the country raking up reports of the kind. I take it to be the duty of the House to maintain the dignity of the Chair, and to protect its occupant. This matter has been brought before the House, which is the highest tribunal in the land, and we have [110] a right to settle it ourselves, and to maintain the integrity and dignity of the Chamber. I wish to preface my remarks by stating that I intend to follow a lead which you yourself, Mr Speaker, gave us last week. I desire to distinguish between the honourable member for Lang and Mr Speaker. WhateverI may have to say to-nightand I am sure the same thought is in the mind of every honourable member who has spoken, or who holds any opinion in regard to this matterI wish it to be understood that, so far as the honourable member for Laug is concerned, we entertain for him personally the highest respect. Any remarks we may make are directed towards you in your official position as Speaker, and not in your private capacity as an individual. Every honourable member realizes what a serious thing it is to impugn the honour or to question the integrity or impartiality of the Speaker, because, after all, Mr Speaker occupies a position that must appeal to the House generally. Every lionorable member must rely upon him to do that which is fair and reasonable. We on this side especially have to look to you, sir, to protect us, and to secure to us the full exercise of our privileges in the House. Honourable members on the other side, being in the majority, can well look after themselves. But unless Mr Speaker is going to protect the minority, to secure to every member of the Opposition his rights and privileges, and to secure to him also an opportunity to exercise those rights and privileges, without restriction, then we are in a very bad position indeed. I listened very carefully to your explanation to-night in regard to the charge of having altered the Hansard report, and I regret that you should have thought it necessary to make such a laboured statement. The fact that you did make such a long and heavy explanation unfortunately conveyed to my mind the idea that there was some support for the argument and the charge that had The been made against you. I confess that, until you spoke, sir, I did not think there was much in the charge. I was inclined to think that the honourable member for Ballarat had made an exaggerated and unnecessary charge against you. Your own explanation, however, convinces me that there was some ground for the statement which was made. I listened with",78,Pairs

1028,Mr Pinlayson (Brisbane) [10.24].,"something like amazement to your own admission to-night-a n admission which I find is corroborated by the Hansard report-that you put the motion that the BiU be read a third time while the House was i u a state of disorder and uproar. The Hansard report distinctly states that honourable members would not come to order, and then it goes on to say that the question was put while the House was in that condition. A more p it if u l admission of weakness on the part of a SpeakerI never heard publicly made. Speaker himself should admit-and I say this with great regret-that he put such a motion while honourable members would not come to order, is pitiable. Mr Speaker has repeatedly refused-and I commend him for his action-to go on with business unti l honourable members have come to order. he not take up the same attitude on that occasion? able to be here, and that, therefore, I cannot speak with any personal knowledge of the matter; but your own statement to-night, Mr Speaker, has convinced me that the honourable member for Ballarat had justification for his statement. I cannot imagine that the Hansard reporters could have neglected to hear or see that the Clerk had read the B ill a third time. The Clerk had to stand up in the ordinary way, and read the words, "" AB ill for -an Act to authorize the raising and expenditure of the sum of £3,080,000 for certain purposes."" are coolly asked to believe that the Clerk could stand up and read those words without the Hansard reporters either seeing him or hearing him.

As to the charge in regard to the partisanship of the Speaker, it is peculiarly fitting that the Prime Minister That the should be the man chosen to introduce such a motion; and this, because of two things particularly. The first is that the Prime Minister himself was the first in this House to degrade the Speakership by making it a political position. 1 have previously from my place here enter e i my protest, and expressed my obWhy did jection to the attitude of the Prime Minister, in the early stages of this ParI regret that I was unliament, in going around to meetings, and on every public occasion, referring to the Speaker as a political partisan. He repeatedly referred to the fact that the Speaker was going to vote in a certain Way-that the Speaker's vote was a pocket vote that he held entirely at hia disposal. I do not know whether ib was because of the protests from this side, but it was very evident, or manifest, that some influence had been brought to bear on h i m , because these statements in regard to the Speaker's position suddenly ceased. Although the Prime We Minister has not referred to the matter since the probests were made, the fact that he himselfI do not know that any other member of his party did so-too k the position that the Speaker, whose fitI decline, therefore, to beness he proclaims, was going to be a party mana political partisan Minister take up that attitude?
