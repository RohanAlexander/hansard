Ister For Commerce","be able to make a statement to the Rouse indicating whether anything in the Anglo-Argentine trade treaty affects the provision in the moat agreement that if, in order. to protect prices in the United Kingdom, a restriction of imports should be necessary, regard will be had to the clause in the Ottawa agreement providing that the dominions shall have an increasing share of the British meat market? with the British trade treaties with both Denmark and Argentine. The meat agreement provides that Argentine shipments of meat to Great Britain may be reduced 10 per cent, below thc Ottawa quota without involving the dominions in any corresponding restriction. Even ut the present time the restrictions upon Argentine shipments to the United Kingdom exceed those contemplated in tbe Ottawa agreement. the provision in the Ottawa agreement that the dominions shall get an increasing share of the British meat market? Australia is already getting un increased share of that market. Restrictions have been placed on the Argentine without any corresponding restriction of imports from the dominions, and no restriction can be placed on exports from the dominions to the TJnited Kingdom except by mutual consent. Later: Commerce advise whether, if the restriction ou thc importation of meat from the Argentine to Britain exceeds 10 per cent., as provided by the Britiah-Argentine trade agreement, that will involve a further restriction of imports from the Representatives. dominions? Also whether, if acquiescence in that proposal were refused by the Commonwealth Government, the Ottawa agreement would be maintained in its entirety, or would the provisions of the British-Argentine trade agreement receive prior consideration? had made this matter clear earlier to-day and previously. I again emphasize that an alteration of the Ottawa agreement can take place only with thc consent of the parties concerned. WOOL. complaints by the representatives of Japanese wool-ibuycrs, and press criticisms, including those in the Melbourne Age of the 26th April, suggesting careless sorting and classing and false branding of Australian wool, will the Minister for Commerce make inquiries with a view to safeguarding the prestige of the wool industry ? few major export prodhicts in respect of which there is no specific export regulation, and it' speaks volumes for those engaged in the industry that so little complaint has been made hitherto. My department has noticed the newspaper reports, and will investigate them, because, although wool is not subject to any specific export regulation, the Commonwealth has adequate power to prevent any injury to Australian commerce. I am pleased to. note also that the President of the Graziers Association has announced the intention of that body to investigate these complaints. MT.

It is true that the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner obtained from a single judge of the Arbitration Court an award, the effect of which was to reduce the basic wage fixed in the particular award applying to the Commonwealth railways. 2.

Can he assure the House that full particulars are being obtained, and recorded, so that, should those winemakers apply for the bounty, the department will be in a position to decide that they are ineligible for it? ber is aware, the position in regard to the wine bounty is a complex one. and the purchasing of grapes at less than the rates fixed by the department has provided a new difficulty.

GOLD SHIPMENTS. question which I asked last week relating to the shipment of gold for the purpose of purchasing British securities as a backing for our note issue, it was stated that about Â£9,000,000 of our gold reserve had already been absorbed in that direction. In view of the possible effects of the action of the United States of America in departing from the gold standard, is the Treasurer prepared to suspend that portion of the Commonwealth Bank Act which empowers the directors of the Commonwealth Bank to invest our gold reserves in British securities until the general international situation regarding gold as a basis of currency has been settled? for .amending the act in the direction suggested. Tliat thc bill be now read a third time. Apparently, the House has decided that there shall be a royal commission to inquire into the operations of the oil companies doing business in this country, and I do not suppose that anything that E might say will alter the position. I am too late. But it is not too late to place some restriction on the period for which the commission shall function. Judging by what has happened in the case of. other royal commissions, it is likely that this commission will go on for years, and that before it has completed its investigations and submitted its report, the life of this Parliament will have expired, in which case the return will benil, notwithstanding the expenditure of many thouexperience in connection with many of the commissions which have been appointed in this country in the past. The bill should be recommitted, in order that we may put some limit to the life of the commission. Most of the commissions which have been appointed iu Australia have been created in order to enable the government of the day to escape from its obligations. I object to commissions on general principles. They are justified only when definite charges have been laid against an industry, or certain individuals, whether capitalists or others, in which cases the recommendations of the commission can be given effect. In my opinion, not one of the commissions which have been appointed during the past 30 years has been of any use to this country. Their appointment has. merely enabled the government of the day to evade awkward issues, and to that extent they, have served tlieir purpose. When their decisions have been favorable to the government which appointed them, those decisions have been given effect; the governmeut concerned has done, with the backing of the commission, what it intended to do in any case. On those other occasions when royal commissions have arrived at conclusions contrary to the wishes of thc government which appointed them, legislation in direct opposition to their recommendations has been introduced and passed. Some royal commissions have continued in existence year after year, until, as a result of a public,outcry against them, they have ceased to function. Without reflecting on the personnel of some of these commissions, the fact remains that they have travelled about the country month after month at heavy cost until public opinion has compelled the termination of their appointment. It would be interesting to know how many, if any, of the commissions which have been appointed in Australia have done any good and how many of them have beeu successful iu getting their recommendations put into operation. I was a member of a royal commission, and in that capacity I drew hundreds of pounds of public money; it was my misfortune that I did not draw as many thousands.

The commission to which I had the good fortune to be appointed was created in order to placate a section of the Country party. over the country, and its members had a good time. It went to almost every port in Western Australia in an endeavour to find persons who would give evidence. Witnesses were obtained, even if that meant shanghaiing them in order to justify the existence of the commission. A visit was paid to Tasmania in the summer and to Queensland in the winter. The life of that commission was short, because the broad, national outlook of its chairman ceased as soon as the commission got outside the borders of his own State. He was not concerned with the vital interests of his colleagues. commission went as far north as Cairns, and from there it travelled inland to find men to give evidence. The only witness we obtained was a man who swore that he had no evidence to give. One resident of Cairns said that 40 commissions had visited that place, but he did not know for what purposej unless it were to fish or to view the -scenery. One man, known as "" Cyanide"" Craig, told the commission that if it experienced on this commission? I therefore propose difficulty in obtaining witnesses he would provide at least one witness. He was the local ratcatcher. As I have said, that commission cost the country many thousands of pounds. Unfortunately, it did not last more than a few months* so that-1 was able to draw only some hundreds instead of thousands of pounds. For rapidity and cheapness of work, we of that commission broke the record.

If the Government really wants an investigation made, and wishes to get a decision, and to act upon it, it could find out what it wants to know about oil much more rapidly and economically than by appointing this commission. But the Government has.decided to have a commission, which will linger That over the inquiry for months and yeai-s. If the Government does not desire to delay the matter indefinitely, but intends to take action, it is desirable that it should at least place some limitation upon the duration of the inquiry, and its cost to the country. At a time when economy in every direction is urged, and when wages and pensions are being cut to the bone, ""how can the Government justify the expenditure of unknown thousands to move that the bill be recommitted,, for the purpose of reconsidering the duration of the Petrol Commission. -As I explained to the honourable member personally a few minutes ago, a motion for the recommittal of a bill must be made when the order of the day is read.

The board then recommends specific as well as ad valorem rates of duty. It also states in its reportA large amount of capital has been invested in factories, and employment is being given to a large number of operatives. Later it saysWireless broadcast receivers are not essential in other industries, and their production in Australia at costs in excess of world's prices will not detrimentally affect the costs of thc products of other iudustries. But, despite these telling facts, the board has recommended a reduction of duties. I summarize fhe board's report by saying that every statement it contains is a justification for the maintenance of the rates of duty that have been in operation since 1929. After all, what does it matter whether a rate of duty is 100 per cent, or 150 per cent., so long as the local manufacturers are not taking advantage of it? . The fact that prices have been reduced in Australia by 50 per cent, is positive proof that our manufacturers are not taking unfair advantage of the tariff protection which is afforded them. dustry has since 1929. Nine new factories have been established, and employment has been substantially increased. The employment of 2,500 'or 2,600 people in this industry has undoubtedly indirectly led to the employment of other persons. Why, then, should the conditions of the industry be disturbed? The board has not been too favorable to Australian industries in the reports that it has made in receut months, and it is regrettable, therefore, that in one of the few instances in which it has been favorable it has recommended a reduction of duty. I should think that any goverument would be intent in these days on the keeping of people in employment. science of wireless broadcasting, and the new industry of manufacturing wireless sets, have been among the best employing propositions in the world in recent years. Marvellous advancement has been made in this regard. I am proud that Australia has played its part in promoting the progress of this industry. A visit to any one of our frequent exhibitions of wireless sets is an education in itself. Visits to a few exhibitions at regular intervals afford convincing proof of the extent of the progress that has been made. I attended an exhibition recently, and was informed that about 95 per cent, of the sets exhibited were of Australian manufacture, and gave expression to many original ideas. Our electrical engineers, and others engaged in this industry, have rendered a wonderful service to our people, and have really made this department of electrical engineering a veritable sheet ^anchor for the whole industry. Electrical engineers and other electrical workers who lost their ordinary employment, turned their attention to wireless, and, with splendid Australian genius, they have been able satisfactorily to supply practically the whole of our wireless requirements. Like the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin), I am unable to follow the reasoning of the Tariff Board. The members of the board seem to have said: ""Although this industry is doing well, the duties seem to be too high, so we will recommend a reduction of them "". But why should they do so ? The price of wireless receiving sets in AusThis intralia-has been reduced, and it cannot be progressed enormously argued that the industry has exploited the public in any way whatever. Not only has the price of complete sets been reduced, but so also has the price of batteries and other component parts. Every part of a wireless set which is being manufactured in Australia is available to-day at a lower price than before the local manufacture of these sets was commenced. I think, therefore, that we should let well alone. I cannot understand how the Tariff Board could recommend a reduced duty when it summed up in favour of the industry. member believe that a reduced duty will mean less employment in this industry? The new should not disturb this industry.. I should not be concerned if a duty were 1,000 per cent, or 60,000 per cent, so long .as the article subject to the duty was being made available to the people at a reduced price. There might be some argument for a reduction of duty if the price",17,Division 6 Metal S And Maohineby

One is often able to gather from a judge's summing up-and the honourable membei for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) has 1 heard many judges sum up-wha t thc verdict, in the opinion of the judge, ought to be. The Tariff Board has declared in favour of this industry, and yet it has recommended that a penalty be imposed upon it. I have been in touch with wireless broadcasting since its inception in Australia, and have had a receiving set iu my home since 1923. At that time, I purchased an imported set which gave me so much trouble that I soon disposed of it, and replaced it with an Australiau set which has given me, and is still giving, complete satisfaction. I bear this personal testimony that the Australian set that I have had in operation for nearly eight years has given me splendid service. Sir was made under the old rate of duty. was not, the fact remains that it has been entirely satisfactory. Our Australian manufacturers have been able to satisfy their clients so well that they now supply 95 per cent, of the local market. I do not desire to be charged with being an ultra-protectionist. 1 am a protectionist without the prefix. I have listened to very many tariff debates in this Parliament during the last 23 years. This report of the Tariff Board is one of the most eloquent testimonies I have ever read to the efficiency of an Australian industry. Australian manufacturers are now providing our people with receiving sets better in quality aud much cheaper in price than were obtainable from overseas firms prior to the establishment of the industry in this country. I should not have any objection to preferential treatment being given to British manufacturers, if we could be quite sure that the major part of manufacture was actually carried out in the Mother Country by British workmen; but as we now have a well-established Australian industry which gives employment to a large number of our people, my advice to the Government is to leave well alone. ber believes in the status quo? dealing fairly .by our people, there is no justification for interfering with it. Although the Tariff Board has presented a very favorable report, it has advised a reduction of the duties, and its recommendation has been adopted by the Government. I do not know the board's leanings in fiscal matters, but it may be necessary, when next we take the public platform, to elucidate certain matters in connection with that body. Our electrical engineers have applied themselves witb marvellous aptitude to this new industry, and for some years now have been supplying, at a reasonable price, a long-felt want of the people of this country. I have not read the Tariff Board's report dealing with this item, but I gather from the references to it made by the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) and the right honourable Scullin) that it states that the Australian industry is making satisfactory progress, and is meeting the requirements of the Australian market. If this is so, it is difficult to understand why the board should recommend an alteration of the duties. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell), by way of interjection when the honourable member for Maribyrnong was speaking, asked if lower duties would have the effect of adding to unemployment in this country; his inference being, of course, that it would not. It is, I think, only logical to assume that if the duties are lowered sufficiently to permit importations to be marketed in competition with the Australian article the unemployment position in this country must necessarily be affected. I am informed that prior to the imposition of the higher duties which encouraged the Australian industry, it was the custom of manufacturers in the TJnited States of America-wher e scientific research in connection with this new industry is constantly being made, and where naturally many failures are recorded-to dump wireless receiving equipment in other markets, including Australia, regardless of cost, the main consideration being the disposal of their surplus manufactures. People interested in this trade have advised me that, prior to the development of the Australian industry to its present stage, a",18,Division 6 Metal S And Maohineby

56,Mr Beasley (West Sydney) [3.22].,"considerable number of American receiving sets were dumped in this country, and as prospective purchasers were then unable to form an estimate of values, they were frequently misled into buying unsuitable sets at prices much above their real value. This may be said to apply generally to the electrical industry. Unless tests of equipment are made by competent men, the average user of electrical goods is unable to determine either the value or the life of the articles purchased. This being so, I have always contended it to be desirable, in the interests of our people, to manufacture these goods"" locally so that, in the event of faults developing, users may have an opportunity to return-them to the manufacturers and secure replacements or have the necessary adjustments made. Since the wireless industry is well established in this country, the Government should, see that it is adequately protected so that users of all forms of electrical equipment may have an assurance that it is of standard value, and can be maintained in a state of efficiency. Associates in my own .union have informed me that there is at the present time the greatest activity in the wireless branch of the electrical engineering trade. continue under these duties. Those concerned have made no complaints on that score. position is satisfactory, it seems strange that the duties should be altered, because if the protection is reduced, the ultimate outcome will be, as I have already stated, the importation of wireless equipment to the detriment of the local industry. The Minister has confirmed my information as to the activity in this industry. I wonder sometimes, at this development, because I suppose wireless may still, to some extent, be regarded as a luxury, although it might be argued that those who go in for this form of entertainment find the cost and maintenance of wireless receivers not so great as in other forms of entertainment. However, the fact is that the industry is so active that within the last few months, conditions in regard to rates of pay, &c, have been drawn up by a tribunal set up in Sydney to regulate the industry. It is very desirable that nothing should be done to disturb the present position. For the reasons given, I endorse the remarks of the previous speakers, and naturally, I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say in support of the Government's action. [3.28] -Recently a spleudidly equipped factory for the manufacture of wireless receiving sets has been erected in my electorate, so, naturally, I am concerned about the lowering of the duties. The Tariff Board's report from beginning to end, furnishes no reason why the duties should be reduced. Reference to my notes shows that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has spoken twice already to this item. Trade and Customs)-""[3.29] -There has been rapid progress, as well as swift changes, in this industry. I know of no other industry which has developed to a greater extent, thanks to the enterprise of our own engineers, and also, in a large measure, to the activities of Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Limited. bilities of Australian workmen? that. This industry has also passed through a transition stage. It now provides employment, in the making of cabinets for wireless sets, to men who formerly were engaged in the billiard table making trade. These and other cabinet makers have been kept engaged, and the volume of employment has continuously increased. The fixed duties on parts and accessories are in proportion to those recommended on the complete sets. The Tariff Board made a most careful examination of overseas prices. According to a later report by the board than has so far been referred to-it is dated the 26th January of this year-the board is satisfied that these duties will constitute an effective protection to Australian manufacturers against the importation of goods of the lowest quality and price. The rates recommended on complete receivers are the same as those recommended in 1929; and,",19,Hbney Gullett Doubtless It The Leader Of The Opposition Mr

63,Mr White,"I have referred toby reason of the drop in prices that has occurred throughout the world since that date, they are relatively higher. This industry is one of the few that has gone steadily ahead throughout the depression. A large amount of capital is invested iu it, and the employees in Victoria and New South ""Wales alone number some 2,000. I believe that I am right in saying that during the depression the number of wireless licences issued increased throughout the Commonwealth, proving that the people had the necessary money to spend on this form of entertainment, and that they were satisfied with the quality of the instruments that they were able to purchase. dustry is an efficient one. The fixed rates on complete receivers are necessary in order that out-of-date or end-of-season goods may not be dumped iu Australia. In one instance, the Government has imposed an even higher rate"" than the Tariff Board recommended. There is room for further development in the industry, with consequent reductions in prices. The adoption of the proposed duties will place the industry in a sound position. When I brought down the present schedule, the Government was subjected to a good deal of criticism, frequently ill formed. It was most pleasing to me, : therefore, to learn that the industry itself was satisfied with the duties proposed. I challenge any of those who to-day have recited the familiar story about unemployment following upon reduced duties, to name any firm in which the employment has been lessened by these new rates. The importations to-day are practically confined to special sets. Honourable members will, I think, agree that the industry can develop under these reasonable duties. The matter, however, will be carefully watched by the Government. -What the Minister has said has changed my opinion considerably. If the industry is satisfied, then I am satisfied. But I want to be satisfied that the industry is satisfied. That any industry can be satisfied with reduced protection is a revelation of human nature hitherto not manifested to us. May I ask the Minister a"" simple question: Where does it appear in any of the Tariff Board reports that the representatives of this industry have expressed themselves as satisfied with the proposed duties? Trade and Customs) [3.37] I am afraid that the right honourable gentleman has misunderstood me. WhatI said was, not that such a statement of satisfaction had appeared in a report of the Tariff Board, but that, on the day following the tabling of the schedule, the press announced that the industry had expressed no alarm at the new duties, while other industries had told the familiar story of the -unemployment that would result. The right honourable gentleman, however, has a sure method of checking that statement. He is a'director of Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Limited. I ask him, has that company ever sent to the Government a protest against the new duties? do that very thing, if necessary. able member, without consulting his board, and without knowing whether or not a protest has been made against the new duties, has taken it upon himself to address himself to the subject. As the industry is so efficient, as wireless sets may be bought at reasonable prices, and as it may be accepted that fhere is no objection to the present duties, I think that the item ought to be allowed to go through. a happy family we are on this item? This is what the Tariff Board says about the matterTaking into consideration the capital already invested in the industry, the board realizes the necessity for maintaining rates of duty which will adequately protect efficient manufacturers, selling at reasonable prices. The duties now operating, which represent ad valorem rates of 150 per cent. (British preferential tariff) and 455 per cent, (general tariff) calculated on the basis of exchange at par, are, however, excessive. Their maintenance may tend to retard improvements in designs, and may also permit of unreasonably high prices being charged by Australian manufacturers. I cannot understand why the Tariff Board has recommended the long list of duties on separate parts.. It has to be remembered that this tariff, after approval by Parliament, may continue to operate for ten, fifteen, or twenty years.

70,Mr Gregory (Swan) [3.38],"Whatduties of from 35 per cent, to 55 per cent, upon these parts, plus natural protection and exchange, should surely be sufficient for any Australian manufacturer, if it were not for the wretched policy adopted by so many leaders of governments in the past, the effect of which has been to increase the cost of every particle of raw material that a manufacturer may require. In view of the wretched industrial conditions that have to be observed, and the interference with industry that has taken place, I can understand why a manufacturer cannot make good even with a duty of from 200 per cent, to 300 per oent. able member call ""wretched industrial conditions "" ? ference by persons wbo know nothing about an industry, and who, nevertheless, are able to fix all the conditions that have to be observed in it . The honourable member talks of preserving this market for Australia. It is more important to preserve Australia, so that our people may be able to buy these things. That is what many persons apparently overlook; they believe that it is magnificent to make everything dear. A statesman would t r y to make these articles cheaper for the people. It is only the wretched politician who believes that, by making everything dearer; he is helping the people. It seems to me to be essentially stupid to think that we can keep on building up costs, imagining all the time that trade will result therefrom. The board, in its report, saysRetail prices in the United States of America paid 2s. 6d. retail in Perth. The extraare considerably below Australian prices for all sizes of receivers which allow of comparisons being made. Thc evidence showed that four-valve receivers sell in the United States of America for $15.00 (normally Â£3 Is. 9d.), and' in Australia at Â£17 17s., and live-valve receivers in the United States of America are quoted as low as $29.50 (normally Â£6 Is. 5d.), as against the Australian price of Â£10 19s. No prices were obtainable for American six-valve receivers, but seven-valve models, quoted as low as $49.50 (normally Â£10 3s. Sd.) were considered by witnesses to be comparable with Australian six-valve receivers selling at Â£37 10s. The high cost of these articles in Australia must considerably l i m it trade. bright in America, let us all go there. to-day things are very bad in the United States of America. The prices quoted in the report were ruling a year or so ago, and I feel satisfied that a considerable reduction has taken place since then. The board also statesThe average cost per valve socket, as submitted by a representative of Victorian manufacturers, was stated to be 26s. According to these figures, duties of approximately 14s. per valve socket (British preferential tarilf) and 20s. per valve socket (general tariff) would be necessary to thoroughly protect the Australian manufacturer, and such rates of duty would be equivalent to ad valorem rates of approximately 100 per cent. (British preferential tariff) ancl 303 per cent, (general tariff), calculated on the basis of exchange at par. That shows the position into which we are d r if t in g despite the fact that the I refer tb interhonorable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr. Fenton), assisted by many other honourable members, is always hoisting the black flag of prohibition. AlthoughI am pleased that some reduction of duty has been made, we cannot get away from the fact that fixed duties have been imposed upon almost every article required for wireless purposes, such as condensers, loud speakers, and coils of every description. No matter how the market may fluctuate, fixed duties instead of ordinary ad valorem duties have been imposed upon almost every item pertaining to wireless. When I was in Western Australia recently a man showed me a part for a wireless set for which he paid 15s., and he told me that the price of it in GreatB r it a in was 2s. 6d. He also showed me a screw about l i inches long, with a special head, worth about 3d., for which he had ordinary prices charged for wireless parts make it almost impossible for the average citizen to purchase wireless replacements.

It is a formal amendment similar to others which have been incorporated in the schedule. not wish to allow one point which has been raised by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) to remain unchallenged. Although his argument has been repeated time and time again throughout the tariff debate, it must be answered. The honourable member quoted from the report of the Tariff Board a comparison of prices in Australia arj.d the United States of America, and from that he deduced that Australian manufacturers were robbing the public. He asked how could we stand the strain? But he omitted to . read from the report the following statement appearing on thc same page as t h a t quoted from by h i m : memorandum. Since 1929 Australian manufacturers' selling prices of broadcast receivers have been reduced by approximately 50 per cent., while during the same period the standard of quality has improved. Reductions in prices have been effected in other countries during this period, but figures obtained by thc board indicate that the reductions effected in Australia were greater than in the United Kingdom and in the United States of America. The honourable member quoted the price of Â£17 17s. for a receiving set. The Tariff Board says that there has been a reduction of the Australian price by 1 50 per cent, prices that I quoted, reduction of prices by 50 per cent., the price for that particular set must have been Â£35 before it was manufactured to any extent in Australia. The board also says that nine new factoTies have been established as manufacturers of wireless receivers and accessories, that in the majority of these cases the firms concerned .were previously importers of the goods which they now manufacture, and that before manufacture became firmly established importers must have been exploiting the public, because they were then charging twice the price that is now being charged for receivers. If is of no use for the honourable member for Swan to compare local prices with those ruling in other parts of the world; he should contrast the prices charged in Australia, before the new factories started, with the prices ruling to-day. That is the proper test to apply to our protectionist policy. Amendment agreed to. Sub-item and paragraphs, as amended, agreed to. Item 184Washers and rivets, copper, ad valorem, British, 45 per cent.; general, CO per cent. That that portion of the tariff resolution introduced' into the House of Representatives on 8th March, 1933, relating to Item 184, be incorporated in the present proposals as on and from the 9th March, 1933, in lieu of Item 184 of the tariff resolution introduced into the House of Representatives on the 13th October, 1932. * This is the usual formal amendment, and it does not in any way alter the wording of, or the rates set out, in the group absurd position obtains in the copper rivet industry and allied industries. The price of copper in London to-day is Â£35 a ton, yet those who control the copper supply of Australia have such a hold of it that they are able to fix the Australian price for copper wire at up to Â£126 a ton. There is a margin of about Â£10 a ton between the price of pig iron ancl the price of wire drawn from rods made from pig iron. Yet the difference between the price of copper ingots and that of the .copper wire from which copper rivets are manufactured is no less than Â£91 a ton. In addition, we export 9,000 tons of copper annually, and the suppliers here have the advantage of the margin of freight to London, but no allowance is made for that in the price of the copper for ' local use. Today copper rivets can be bought in England for Is. Id. per lb., and delivered in Australia at is. 5$d. per lb., yet those who control the supplies of copper wire in this country are charging Is. lÂ£d. ""per lb. for the wire from which the rivets are manufactured. This is a good opportunity for the Minister to make further inquiries into the industry in order to see whether something cannot be done to remedy this ridiculous position. Eirst, .we have a duty on copper, although there is no likelihood of copper being imported into this country. Then there is a still higher tariff on copper rods, and a duty of 35 per",22,Hbney Gullett Doubtless It The Leader Of The Opposition Mr

According to the Tariff Board's report, the quantity of copper used in Australia in the manufacture of this commodity represents only 1 per cent, of the copper exported. think that this is a trivial item, and that the extra price for the local product is merely a trifle, but it is. the cumulative effect of all these small items that makes the cost of production in Australia so high. This industry employs only twenty persons altogether, not all of them men, while the aggregate yearly wages total Â£2,850. the manufacturers have reduced their price by 2d. per lb. since'the publi-1 cation of the board's report, but even at the reduced price Australia, still pays Â£3,760 more for its copper rivets and washers than it would have to pay if they were imported duty free, and that is after allowing for exchange and transport charges. It is evident, therefore, that the manufacture of copper rivets in Australia is not an economic undertaking. We were told by the British Economic Committee which visited Australia, that we were attempting too much in the way of manufacture. The Government should use its discretion when deciding what industries are worthy of protection and what are not. The duty of 35 per cent, on the quantity of copper rivets used in Australia would represent almost twice as much as the wages paid in the industry, for material represents 90 per cent, of the cost of this commodity. We must also remember that the twenty persons employed in the industry represent the aggregate. In the iron and steel industry, and galvanized iron and wire manufacturing industry, besides those directly engaged in manufacture there are the men employed in mining the ore and coal, and in smelting, but the copper we produce is exported, and would continue to be produced in the same quantity whether any were used locally for manufacturing rivets or not. That does not apply to the iron and steel industry. Every one who uses copper rivets is penalized for the sake of keeping these few persons in employment. The time has come when we should consider, not only the particular industry seeking protection, but also the effect of Mr A'ocfc. protection upon other industries which ' use its products. I hope that the Minister will give an assurance that there will be an inquiry for the purpose of finding out why the price of locally-made copper Honourable members may wire ih Australia should be Â£126 a ton, while the London price of copper is only Â£35 a ton. ing regard to the facts placed before the committee by the honourable member for Eiverina( Mr Nock), the Government would be justified in reducing the duty on this item. Copper rivets were at.one time admitted free, and under the Pratten tariff, the duty was 5 per cent. British, and 10 per cent, general. The Government has, unfortunately, been influenced by the wild s'tampede of the Scullin Government, which increased duties without any regard for the Tariff Board or the people's interests. I move, as an amendment upon the proposed amendmentThat the rates of duty be reduced to 15 per cent. (British preferential t a r if f ) and 35 per eent. (general t a r if f ) . In this, as in many other industries, those who ""began manufacture in Australia have done the country a disservice ""rather than a service. If the figures quoted by the honourable member for Eiverina are correct, it is evident that it would pay the Commonwealth to provide the whole of the wages of those employed in the industry, and to import what we require from abroad. How can it be to the benefit of Australia to encourage industries which have no prospect of developing, and which place such a burden upon the consumer ? Trade and Customs) [3.57] -There is no need for this amendment, which stipulates a rate chosen at random by the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse). There is a great deal in the . argument of the houorable member for Eiverina( Mr Nock), and much of what he said has already been brought before the Tariff Board. Influenced by those arguments, the board recommended that the duty be reduced, and that has been done. Certainly the industry is small, but 90 per cent, of the material used is copper produced in Australia.

I remind, honourable members that a definite reduction has been made in the duty in order that prices may be competitive. A considerable part of our requirements in copper rivets is still being imported, and even under the high tariff of 1931-32, no less than Â£1,826 worth were admitted. This is another of those petty little indusproposals as on and from thc 9th March, 1933, tries the protection of which adds to the general cost of production in Australia. Probably no other company has taken so much advantage of the duty on copper and copper goods as has the Australian Metal Company. Time after time the Gibson) has pointed out in this chamber the enormous charges made by that company for copper coils and copper wire generally. We are producing the copper in this country, and there is no justification for a high duty on imported copper goods. Certainly 35 per cent duty, together with natural protection and exchange, is far too high. These small industries have been occupying the Tariff Board when others much more important require careful consideration. Over a long series of years no company has been able to take such advantage of high duties as has the Australian Metal Company, which supplies the copper' rods, if it does not actually manufacture the rivets. Having regard to the price of copper, the company's charges for copper wire of every description are outrageous. I hope that the Minister will have inquiries made through the Tariff Board regarding the excessive cost of copper goods, particularly wire. not move an amendment because I considered that it would be futile to do so, but I support the proposal of the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse). I am confident that if it were agreed to, the immediate result would be the reduction of the cost of wire supplied to the manufacturers of. rivets. Amendment upon the proposed amendment negatived.

It is absurd that every imported bend, elbow, knee, or other malleable fitting, should be subject to a duty of 2d. or 2^d. per lb. Iron castings have to be weighed as if they were gold dust in order that the duty upon them may be assessed. Of more than 5,000 types of fittings required in Australia, only 261 are manufactured locally. In New South Wales, girls arid boys are being placed on small holdings to grow vegetables and flowers; to this enterprise, water supplies are essential, and. in order to benefit the manufacturers by means of a duty of so much per lb. on iron fittings, these young settlers are to be penalized. I have pointed out previously that on a 3-in. bend costing 3s. 9d. in England, the duty is 13s. 6d. Trade and Customs) [4.7] -The honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) is under a misapprehension. The committee is not discussing pipe fittings. Malleable castings differ from ordinary grey iron castings, in that they have to be annealed after they are cast. The industry is comparatively new to Australia, and is supplying the ordinary requirements of the engineering trade. As the castings are worth only from 3d. to 9d. per lb., they could even be brought to Australia as ballast, and no ad valorem duty, however high, would be protective. The fixed duty is imposed so that rio foreign exporter can evade the present moderate tariff by depreciating invoice values.",24,Hbney Gullett Doubtless It The Leader Of The Opposition Mr

The manufacture of tools of trade was investigated by the board about, two years ago, but since that time, the industry has made considerable strides, and is giving a good deal of employment. The conditions of the industry have entirely changed, and thc manufacturers desire that the duties should be further considered. If the. Minister will not agree to postpone consideration of this item until after the receipt of a report from the Tariff Board, I ask him to promise that if the board recommends an increase of duty, prompt action will be taken to give effect to the recommendation. will provide an increased market for the steel works will mean, eventually, a reduction in the cost of all steel products. Moreover, it is desirable that we should establish industries that, in the event of war, could be speedily converted to the production of munitions. Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [4.10] -Tools of trade were inquired into by the board in May and June, 1931. The firm on whose behalf I am speaking, has taken to heart the lesson r,aught by that inquiry, and has completely re-organized its plant. It is now employing 60 hands instead of 9 as formerly, and the whole of the materials used in manufacture are Australian. Notwithstanding that Australian raw materials cost 200 per cent, more than the price paid by British manufacturers, local firms are confident of being able to compete if they are given a little furmachines or by hand, and screw plates ther consideration. The manufacture of tools provides an increased market for base metals, and, therefore, may be regarded as natural to Australia. We should also encourage the establishment of factories that can be put to national use in times of crisis. This firm has reduced its prices for picks from 35s. 4d. to 29s. 3d. per dozen. Several other firms are engaged iu this industry, but the representations made to me are based entirely on picks and mattocks. I ask the Minister to postpone V further consideration of the item pending a reconsideration of it by the Tariff Board. I support the request made by the honourable member for Cook( Mr Riley) and the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr E. J. Harrison). This is a comparatively new industry. Although, in the early stages, its products were not of the best, it has advanced considerably, and locally-made tools are giving satisfaction to the users. The industry employs a considerable number of people in several States! The more we encourage the manufacture of tools of trade, the better it will be for the users and for Australia. existing duties had upon the industry? Every industry that of certain lines are feeling a great deal of apprehension. They claim that they suffer a considerable disability under the existing rates of duty, but that if additional protection were given, they could produce goods which would suit the users in respect of both quality and price. I hope that the Minister will agree to the request to refer the item back to the Tariff Board. Trade and Customs) [4.15] -Although this is a new and a comparatively small industry, it is important, for it is engaged in the manufacture of tools, which include not; only shovels, picks, and mattocks, but also small stocks and dies. The Tariff Board has held an inquiry into the industry, and the only alteration made in the schedule of 1921-30, in consequence of its recommendations, is that the duties on dies, taps and chasers for use in and stocks, have been reduced from 45 per cent. British and 65 per cent, general, to 35 per cent. British and 45 per cent, general. The Scullin tariff provided for duties of 55 per cent. British and 75 per cent, general in sub-item A. There has actually been a reduction of 10 per cent, in the item iu accordance with the recommendation made by the Tariff Board on the l l t h September, 1931, and, of course, an increase in the general rate on subitems A and o of 5 per cent., and on subitem B of 10 per cent, to conform with",25,Hbney Gullett Doubtless It The Leader Of The Opposition Mr

Many tools of the kind now under consideration can be made locally only at considerable extra cost to the users, in consequence of the limited demand for them in Australia, I say emphatically to the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton), and other honourable gentlemen who are over enthusiastic in their support of Australian industries, that it is a mistake for a manuturers bave asked that this item be subfacturer to imagine that because he can successfully manufacture one or two tools, he can also successfully manufacture the whole range of tools in that class. Manufacturers who have endeavoured to do so have frequently met with disaster. The Tariff Board has, time after time, saved manufacturers from themselves in this regard. A man who may be skilled in the manufacture of a certain article, frequently launches out into the manufacture of other articles of a similar nature, only to find failure waiting for him through an endeavour to do too much. An inquiry by the manufacturer himself, or by the Tariff Board before such manufacture had been commenced, would frequently have prevented disaster from overtaking the industry. We have always to remember that there is only a limited market in Australia. vernment is preventing the local manuintroduced facturers from obtaining the market. orable member. A manufacturer may be proposals able to make shovels successfully on a the tariff resolution introduced into the House commercial basis, but if he proceeds to of Representatives on the 13th October, 1932. manufacture axes, he may make a serious blunder. A totally different class of steel and a much higher degree of skill is required in the manufacture of axes. If an almost prohibitive duty is placed upon axes which have to be imported, the man on the land is penalized, and no oue receives any advantage. These are fundamental facts which should be borne in mind by the advocates of very high duties. In reply to the honourable member for (Chinaware, parian ware and porcelain Cook( Mr Riley), and other honourable ware). gentlemen who have requested that this item be referred back to the Tariff Board The pottery industry, which is engaged for further consideration, I may say that in the manufacture of earthenware, china, in consequence of the manufacturers reglass and stone, is one of the oldest in ferred to by the honourable member for Australia.

The item now under consideration covers domestic ware such as teapots, jugs, cups and saucers, plates, bowls, dishes, jardinieres, and such articles. It may be said in favour of this industry that 98 per cent, of the materials which it uses arc of Australian origin, and that the employment which it gives is spread over a very wide area. difficult to understand why the Tariff Board, after giving favorable consideration to the item covering sanitary ware, should recommend a reduction of duties on this item. Eor some reason, unknown to those who are interested in this trade, the duties have been reduced to a substantial extent. some justification for this reduction. This industry is at present being subjected to severe competition from eastern countries such as Japan, and in this circumstance a reduction of duties at this stage appears to be a serious mistake. Until recently, the principal competitors of the Australian manufacturers were the manufacturers of the United Kingdom, but now Japan bas entered the market to an alarming extent. Japanese importations constituted 50 per cent, of the total. market has been absolutely swamped with brightly-coloured Japanese crockeryware such as jugs, teapots, and cups and saucers. I have seen a large quantity of these Japanese articles in the big business houses of our cities and also in certain auction marts. The honourable member for Denison( Mr Hutchin), in discussing the cost-of-living figures the other day, referred to the decline in the price of crockeryware in consequence of the entry of auctioneers into this trade; but it should be remembered that the goods which are being sold at these cheap prices have been dumped in this country from J apan at prices which render -competition by the Australian manufacturers impossible. Surely we should preserve our market for our own people, who are able to manufacture all the domestic ware of this kind that we need*. In order to show' how seriously this Japanese competition is regarded by tbe manufacturers of other countries, I direct attention to the following statement which appears in Mr Makin. Ceramic Industry, a New York publication, of November, 1932:Japan with its low Labour Cost is Chief Offender. Japanese imports for six months of 1932 lost $1,200,000 in wages to American labour. It will be seen, therefore, that Japanese competition is also having an unfortunate It is rather effect on the industrial life of another great manufacturing nation. I hope that the Government will see the wisdom of checking imports of this -' nature from Japan. The Australian manufacturers consider that the protection at present being afforded to the crockery . and earthenware industry is inadequate. The Minister should offer This is a natural industry to Australia, and it should receive the fullest fiscal consideration in respect of those lines that are being commercially manufactured here. Action should be taken without further delay to put a stop to the dumping of Japanese goods in this country, otherwise the whole trade will soon fall into the hands of the Japanese. The pottery and earthenware industry of Australia is not located in In 1931-32, only one or two centres, hut is engaged in all over Australia. The people of South The Australian Australia and ""Western Australia often utter serious complaints because the secondary industries of the Commonwealth are located, to a large extent, on the eastern side of the continent; but here is an industry which has been established in many centres all over the Commonwealth. It is, therefore, desirable that the Government should take every possible step to protect it by providing adequate duties. There is no justification for the importation of pottery for domestic purposes wbich can easily be made in this country. The just claims of this industry should, therefore, receive the favorable consideration of the Government. The item now under consideration should be reviewed, and the . duties broughtinto proper relation with those provided under item 241. I shall bave something more to say later if the Minister is unable to give a satisfactory explanation of the Government's intentions. [4:31] -The manufacture of china ware,",27,Division 8 Earthenware Cement China Glass And Stone
98,Mr Jennings (South Sydney),"parian ware, and porcelain ware is one of the oldest natural industries of this country, aud is worthy of protection. Ninety-eight per cent, of the materials used in the manufacture of these goods is of Australian origin. This industry provides work for numbers of Australian coal-miners, and altogether, both directly and indirectly, it employs many thousands of our people. It is capable of supplying the whole of this country's pottery requirements, with the exception of certain special lines. Although those engaged in the manufacture of these goods are concerned that the duties are inadequate, they realize that the most serious danger confronting them is the dumping of goods from abroad. Of the importation of goods covered by these sub-items last year, fully 50 per cent, came from foreign countries where the labour conditions are not comparable with those of Australia. The competition A these goods has caused some agitation in both Great Britain and the United States of America, where action to prevent dumping has been found necessary. In the interests of the thousands of employees, and because of the large amount of capital invested in this industry, I hope that the Minister will take immediate and effective action to protect dumping. Trade and Customs) [4.32] -The duties under these sub-items are the same as in the 1921-30 tariff, and are 10 per cent, lower than the rates provided by the Scullin Government's tariff schedule. The goods concerned do not comprise all the items covered by the term "" pottery "". The honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Jennings) was scarcely correct when he claimed that the Australian potteries could manufacture Australia's crockery requirements; they are noted more for their pipes and other products used chiefly in the building trade. These sub-items deal with cups, saucers, plates, teapots, jugs, dishes, and similar articles. referred to contains some pertinent stateAt an inquiry conducted by the Tariff Board, it was not denied that Australian manufacturers were able to supply only a small proportion of the lines in demand. The board was satisfied that the cups and saucers made by Australian firms were good products of their class; but it stated that local manufacturers would have to [43] reduce their production costs, and increase their operations considerably, before they could be regarded as potential suppliers of the whole of the Australian market. The board's report statesThis claim was generally conceded by those supporting the request, it being acknowledged that the local production is practically confined to brownware, earthenware, and stoneware. . . . The immensity of range and the varying shapes, sizes and qualities included in the range may be gauged from the statement' of one importer, that in his showroom in August, 1930, he counted 3,447 samples representing separate linos of chinaware and earthenware, none of which was produced in Australia. The Australian industry enjoys a natural protection, because overseas competitors have to pack these goods carefully to prevent breakages in transit. In the opinion of the board, the nat-ural protection is equal to 65-J per cent. The board expressed the opinion that the proposed duty was a sufficient protection to those lines which are made in Australia. The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) referred to a flood of imports, chiefly from Japan. Immediately I took office, it was brought to my notice that foreign manufacturers were imitating British pottery, and I , thereupon, issued a regulation under the Commerce Act requiring all pottery imported into Australia to show clearly tbe country of origin. That regulation protects the Australian buyer. If the' local manufacturers have evidence of dumping, they should bring the facts before the department, and establish a prima facie case, so that appropriate action may be taken. Statements which are uot substantiated serve no useful purpose. I claim that the protection is adequate on the limited lines made in this country. A statement in one of yesterday's Melbourne newspapers supports the contention of the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin). The newspaper ments regarding chinaware and porcelain ware by a Mr Cann, who recently returned from the East. Mr Cann said that in some pottery works in Japan which he visited, about 75 per cent, of the employees were children, who received 3d. or 4d. a day for their work. Unless Japan has recently passed legislation",28,Unfair Foreign Competition Ruining Domestic Pottery Industry

That gives an indication of the competition which Australian manufacturers have to meet. I believe that the Minister is alive to the danger of this competition, and I hope that, if he finds that these goods are being landed in Australia to the detriment of the Australian industry, he will take immediate action to prevent their importation. disagree with the Minister's statement that the domestic ware covered by this item comprises only a small proportion of this class of goods. Evidently th6 Minister and the Tariff Board are not aware of the scope of this industry. AusÂ« tralian manufacturers of pottery make a wide range of domestic ware, including cups, saucers, plates, teapots, jugs, bowls, dishes, basins, egg-cups, coffee pots, trays, ewers, bread-crocks, biscuit barrels, vases, ornaments, jardinieres, and other articles. In view of the alarm regarding the effect of these duties, I ask the Minister to institute further inquiries, in order to ascertain to what extent Australian manufacturers can supply this country's requirements of these goods. remarks of the Minister to-day will not be viewed with satisfaction by those Australian pottery firms. The importation of these goods from Eastern countries in which cheap labour is employed, will do untold harm to this old-established Australian industry. I hope that the Minister will agree to restore these duties to the rates contained in the Scullin tariff. clo so. Sub-items agreed to. Item 239 agreed to. Item 241, sub-items ( B) (c) (Earthenware) . Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [4.43] I should like further consideration to be given to these sub-items, because the earthenware manufacturing industry, like all other associated with the building trade, has suffered severely during the recent depression. This is one of the oldest industries in Australia, and 90 per cent, of its raw material is of Australian origin. It gives employment to large numbers of Australians, including many coal-miners, and produces articles which compare favourably in quality and price with the English article. In February and March, 1925, the Tariff Board investigated charges of dumping of these goods, and on its report that dumping had occurred action was taken. The industry fears that dumping will agaiD be attempted. Agents of Britisb firms in Australia have reported to their principals that the Australian pottery industry is languishing, and these manufacturers are ready to attack the Australian industry. When the embargoes were lifted, they circulated price lists which tended to knock the bottom out of the Australian market. In order to combat the competition from overseas, and to give Australian consumers of these goods articles of good quality, one Australian manufacturer installed a Dressier kiln at a cost of Â£40,000, also a modern casting plant. Such an industry is worthy of our protection. I ask the Minister to give this matter further consideration, in view of the fact that the industry has already suffered considerable loss owing to the almost complete suspension of operations The in the building trade. After again reviewing the facts, the Minister may be prepared to refer the matter back to the Tariff Board, or to restore the duties to the level at which they stood prior to the recent reduction. [4.46] -Here we have another case in which the life of an industry is threatened by reason of dumping. It I regret that I cannot appears that dumping is being practised in all countries where tariffs have been lowered, and action must be taken promptly if this particular industry is not to be reduced to the same condition as that of other branches of the pottery industry. I support the case presented by tbe honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr E. J. Harrison). industries I endorse the views expressed by the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr E. J. Harrison), and the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Jennings). I can give the Minister definite information which calls for an explanation from him.

104,Mr Makin (Hindmarsh) [4.47],"sanitary and lavatory articles of earthenware have for many years held the view that they have been unfairly attacked by manufacturers and exporters in the United Kingdom, particularly in regard to those lines of sanitary earthenware which are in most frequent use in Australia, and therefore form the major part of the production of the Australian factories. In confirmation of this view, it may be mentioned that the ordinary hollow front closet, and the smaller sizes in wash basins, both corner andflat-backedkinds, appear to be quoted by exporters from the United Kingdom at much lower prices relatively than the larger sizes, or even the smaller sizes, in styles that are not in general use. ""When the embargo was removed last year, the prices circulated to the trade for the closet in popular demand in Australia was 13s. 9d. f.o.b. London, and, since the end of the year, the price has been further reduced to l is . f.o.b. London, both prices being less 5 per cent, and 2Â£ per cent, for London payment. Recent English price-lists show conclusively that the range of sanitary ware manufactures which is in popular demand in Australia is being clumped into this country to the serious detriment of the local manufacturers, and the destruction of an old and valuable industry is threatened. should not permit the dumping of these goods to the detriment of the Australian trade, and we ask that he should give an assurance that, where dumping can be proved, he will take the steps necessary to resist it, and see that the Australian manufacturers are given an opportunity to exploit the possibilities of the Australian market, provided they do a fair thing to the users of these goods. Trade and Customs) [4.50] -This subitem comes within the same category as item 237, which deals with the duties on crockery. It relates to sanitary earthenware, a line which has been satisfactorily made in Australia for many years. The Tariff Board points out that the local manufacturers make certain kinds of these goods, but do not supply a large proportion of the requirements. Therefore, they receive a high natural protection by reason of tbe cost of freight, breakages, packing, &c. It was stated to the board that the local manufacturers were being severely undercut in price by Japanese exporters, but the board satisfied itself that this competition could be successfully met by the local manufacturers concentrating on the sizes they usually made, instead of endeavouring to supply the market in ranges containing sizes not in general demand. Sub-item c, of item 241, covers sanitary and lavatory articles of earthenware, and the evidence submitted to the board indicated that the operations of the local manufacturers were confined to the production of the lower grades of goods, for which there is a general demand. The more expensive articles are generally of fireclay manufacture, which the board states has not yet been exploited by local factories. report six months old? 1931. Practically the whole of the trade in the lines made locally is held by the Australian manufacturers, although some goods which could be supplied from local sources are being imported, and it is with a view to stopping the importation of these goods that the extra 10 per cent, duty is proposed under sub-item 241 o 1. If , as has been stated, further facts have emerged, and improvements have The Minister occurred in manufacturing methods, the matter could again be referred to tbe Tariff Board; but I point out that, after the board submitted its report, a Queensland firm-the Dinmore Pottery Company-stated ' that it was manufacturing the larger articles of sanitary ware included in sub-item 241 c 2. Th<company was requested to furnish a full statement of its case, which, is necessary, of course, in all applications for tariff revision, and, although this information was requested in June last, no statement has yet been received. In these circumstances what are we to do? Statements made in this chamber should be definitely substantiated. I ask the committee to pass this sub-item; but, if honourable members can show that the local manufacturers are suffering from the effects of dumping, or are manufacturing on a different scale from formerly, employing new furnaces or kilns, this matter will be taken into account. Mr E. J. HARBISON I can give the Minister a list of prices.",30,Unfair Foreign Competition Ruining Domestic Pottery Industry

107,Mr White,"It is dated February,the consideration of prices is when a matter is before the Tariff Board; but, if these prices are sent to the department, I shall give them consideration, and, if a good case is made out, it will be reconsidered with a view to sending the matter back to the board for a further report. Company informed me that it had presented it3 case to tlie Tariff Board through its representative in Sydney. Its failure to reply to correspondence from the department is explained by the fact that it had presented its case, not directly, but through an agent. that, when a request was made to the company in June last for certain information, no reply was received. If the company's methods are a little lax, it cannot expect the duties to be altered at the last moment on the matter being raised in this chamber. . Mr E. J. HARRISON (Weutworth) [4.55J I draw the attention of the Minister to the fact, on which he has not commented, that this industry has previously been threatened by outside interests. In February and March, 1925, a definite inquiry was made into the industry, and a clumping duty was imposed. The clanger of dumping confronts the industry to-day, as has been proved conclusively by the prices quoted by the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr the importation of tiles and sanitary Makin). He said that, when tbe embargo was removed last year, the price of the article in popular demand in Australia was reduced from 13s. 9d. f.o.b. London to l is . f.o.b. London, less 5 per cent, and ment has been asked by the British 2-J per cent, for London payment. The recent English prices show, without doubt, that articles similar to those being manufactured in this country are being dumped into Australia to the detriment of the local manufacturers. Again, I stress the fact that the published accounts of the two largest manufacturers in Sydney and Melbourne reveal heavy losses for the past two years. English companies are au fait with the position of this industry in Australia, and they are now starting to exploit this market, with a view to crushing the local industry out of business. members will realize that competitors always work upon tbe lower-priced goods, which are the bread and butter lines. The Sydney manufacturers, to whom I have referred, have put in new plant costing Â£40,000, and they produce a fine grade of article. They cannot be expected to compete in the better grades of goods if they do not begin on the lower grades. If the Minister does not take this matter into immediate consideration, he will find that the local industry will be crushed, and the experience that it has gained will go for nought. The plant that it has imported and installed will be rendered idle, and its workmen will be thrown out of employment, although over 90 per cent, I have already stated of the material used by it is Australian. If this industry went out of existence, many other subsidiary industries would also be destroyed. We expect that, when prosperity returns, a fillip will be given to the building industry, and it would be disastrous if the stocks of sanitary ware were then found to be low. In view of the fact that this industry has made heavy losses in the past, aud that its competitors overseas threaten to smash it completely, I hope that the Minister will give the matter his earnest consideration. [4.58] -An article published in the Trade and Engineering Supplement of the London Times on the 10th September, 1932, stated that the removal of the import prohibitions in Australia against ware was most welcome news to the pottery industry. It was pointed out that each month Australia was taking ware valued at Â£26,810. The British Governpottery industry to impose a 50 per cent, duty on pottery ware imported into Britain, or twice the rate imposed under the Australian tariff against British pottery.

If the Ministerf or Trade and Customs( Mr White) fails to recognize the importance of assisting this and similar industries, he will quickly have brought home to hi m the disastrous effects wbich w ill result to those who are directly and indirectly engaged in them. very gratifying to find that my proposals in connection with this important item are being supported by some honourable members on this side who, as protectionists, usually vote the other way. The name of Fowlers Limited has been mentioned during this debate. That firm is of long standing in Sydney, and has a branch establishment in Melbourne. I agree that it is necessary that the pottery industry should be retained in Australia, where it has successfully operated. The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) referred to the poor rates that are paid in this industry in the East. In that respect, the following press extract is interesting. It reads3D. A DAY. "" It is difficult to see how the world is to compete with the East,"" stated Mr Cann, a Melbourne business man, who is returning home by the Changte after a visit to Japan. In pottery works ho saw in Nagoya, there were about 100 employees, and 75 were under 10 years of age, and earning about 3d. a day. "" They were just bits of kids,"" said Mr square feet, Britisli, 2s.; general, 4s.; Cann. I am glad to have the Minister's assurance that he w ill watch the position closely. That press statement should convince the honourable gentleman that it is essential that this trade should be protected to enable it to continue to operate It is incomprehensible why in Australia. Trade and Customs) [ 5 . 4 ] I point out that the item that we are discussing does not concern pottery in general, which has already been dealt with. This item in cludes earthenware, brownware and stonegoods that they manufacture. ware, also sanitary and lavatory articles of earthenware. One honourable member has referred to the losses made by certain companies. The pottery industry, is It should build ancillary to many brickworks. The that building industry has slumped tremendously for some time, and is only now Instead, the Government is regaining stability; therefore, it is only to be expected that brickworks sbould have suffered. I am unable to determine what tbe honourable . member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) meant by bis threats or promises. I assure h i m that it is the desire of this Government to afford protection to Australian industries, and to preserve a balance, which may be a delicate one, changing from day to day, to get the It is best out of both primary and secondary industries in the matter of employment. The Government w ill use the T a r if f Board to examine tbe activities of these industries fro m an economic point of view, for it is also determined to protect the interests of consumers. I gave honourable members an assurance that this industry is being watched. As there seems to be a fear that thc Government ia doing nothing, I amplify that assurance by stating that our customs officers in GreatB rita in are investigating the matter of eastern and other competition, and the possibility of dumping. If it is found that the overseas export price is lower than the manufacturers' price in Australia, which is one of the conditions precedent to the application of a dumping duty, the provisions of the Industries Preservation Act w ill be brought into operation.

Tariff Board has reported on the subject, and, as I \vant the matter to receive consideration, I move That sub-item (B) be amended by omitting "" 1933"" with a view to insert in lieu thereof "" 1934"". I have previously objected to the over large powers that are given to Ministers in the matter of deferring duties. Only a little while ago, I referred to a deferred duty in connection with sheet glass, which originating in 1925 was re-deferred by proclamation every succeeding six mouths. The report of the Tariff Board statesThe deferred duties had been postponed from time to time on the recommendation of the Tariff Board. 1 want that to sink into the minds of lionorable members. tinuesand were due on the 1st August, 1930, for consideration as to whether their operation was justified. However, six weeks before the (late of deferment had expired, a tariff resolution was tabled providing duties identical with tliose of the deferred provisions. The proposal to impose the duties was not referred to the Tariff Board. When the Government imposed a duty On tin plates, we received an assurance from the Minister that the matter would be referred to the Tariff Board. The honourable gentleman forgets that he will not always occupy his present portfolio, and that a successor might bring these duties into force. One has only to read the report of the Tariff Board fo understand the difficulties to which Australian industries bave to submit, because of the foolish actions of the Government. Only a couple of years ago, when in opposition, tbe present Postmaster-General( Mr Australia have complained bitterly about Parkhill) and the honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett) spoke on this subject much more strongly than I intend to do. The duties on sheet glass had been deferred to the 1st August, 1930. A statement made to me at the time, wbich was confirmed by two of the leading members of the present Governas to its good quality false? ment, was to the effect that the Australian Glass Company purchased in Sydney practically all the available stocks of sheet glass, and that, shortly after, the duty was imposed. Consequently, that firm was in a position to take advantage of the act of the Government, and make great profits from the transaction. I consider that the whole thing was a scandal. The Tariff Board had recommended against the retention of the rates of duty operating prior to August, the main reason given being that local manufacturers were not in a position to produce the commodity commercially, nor was it clear when production on a commercial basis could be expected. Yet, in face of that report, the deferred duties were brought into force. The Tariff Board further reported that "" the rates of duty were so high that they would seriously add to the cost in Australia of au important commodity without commensurate advantages to Australia "". On the 1st September, 1932, the recommendation of the board was given effect by the Customs Tariff Proposals No. 6, and on the 23rd The report conSeptember, when tbe matter was again referred to the board, a proclamation was issued prohibiting the importation of plain sheet glass unless tbe consent in writing of the Minister for Trade and Customs had first been obtained. This Government, many supporters of which had spoken bitterly against the action of the previous Administration, gave an order prohibiting importations, and then essayed the difficult task of rationing supplies to importers who, in good faith, bad ordered the commodity from abroad after finding that it could not bo supplied locally. One witness, MrH . E.

If honourable members would like to bear the views of some of the witnesses before the board as to the quality of the Australian glass I will satisfy them. MrL . E. Irwin, president of the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects and chairman of the Building Industry Congress of Victoria, offered this opinionI sliould say that thc Australian glass ia the poorest glass I have ever seen of any quality or any standard. I have never seen such consistently poor glass as was presented to me at Brooks Robinson's. I have already mentioned that Mr Ross, representing the institute of architects of New South Wales, expressed a favorable opinion about the quality of the Australian glass. This is what he saidMy examination was quite impartial in that respect, and it was comparative. . . . In making this comparison, I would like to say that I regarded thc Australian-made glass which I investigated in sheets at the worksthe danger of placing too much power in sheets picked at random and in many cases covered with dust the accumulation of some weeks-as being distinctly superior to the average of the not-identified imported glass. I turn now to complaints made by those who had to sell this glass. There is no doubt that complaints have been very general about its quality and the difficulty of securing consignments. Minister should have investigated this aspect of the industry before the uew duties were imposed. Mr J. M . Harvey, giving evidence on behalf of Clarkson Limited, of Adelaide, stated that immediately the Australian Window Glass Company commenced manufacturing his firm gave it a small order to test out quality and delivery. The order, which was given on the 2nd November, 1931, was for 112 boxes of sheet glass. Deliveries were made in the following order in 1932:-.1.7t h June, 5 cases; 20fh June, 21 cases; 30th June, 30 cases; l l t h August, 43 cases; 19th August, 10 cases; Sth September, 10 cases, making a total of 119 cases. The summary of this transaction shows that, on the 26th October, 1931, the Australian Window Glass Company wrote promising delivery of sheet glass in November-December. Following this advice, his company, on the 2nd November, ordered 112 boxes of sheet glass. On the 28th November, and again on the Sth December, Clarkson Limited wrote to the Australian Glass Company stating that the stocks of glass were reduced to danger point, and that, in view of the company's undertaking to give delivery, at the latest in December, Clarkson Limited bad postponed placing orders oversea. On the 16th January, 1932, the manufacturers wrote stating that they were drawing glass on the 18th January, and would immediately send a representative shipment so that Clarkson's coxild judge its quality. On the 27th January the company wrote definitely assuring Clarkson's that the glass would be shipped on the 29th January. On the 15th February, Clarkson's wrote stating that no glass had been received, and that the samples sent to the Adelaide branch were too small to form an opinion of the quality, but that the glass appeared to be very thick; anything up to 40 oz., and quite unsuitable. I have on other occasions emphasized the bands of the Minister, particularly with respect to the imposition of embargoes. It has been stated that tbe Australian Window Glass Company threatened Belgian manufacturers that if it did not get the sole control of Belgian coloured glass in Australia, the compauy would induce thu Commonwealth GovernThe ment to impose an embargo on the importations of that kind of glass. This emphasizes the danger to which I have just alluded. I am not suggesting that any Minister for Customs has been in any way influenced in this matter, but what I bave said shows clearly that the people generally know very little of what is being done in tariff matters in this country. The board's report laid on the table in March, 1932, makes somewhat extended reference to this subject. It appears that Mr W. C. Price, a tile merchant of Waverley, New South Wales, who opposed the request for increased duties on behalf of Comptoir des Verres opals, in evidence stated that, in 1929, Mr Smith, of the Australian Glass Manufacturers Company Limited, and Mr Hession, an indent agent of Sydney, were in Belgium, and that, Avhile there, Mr Hession succeeded in obtaining the sole agency of Belgian opal glass in Australia.

I am profoundly sorry that this industry has been interfered vvith, even to the extent of the reduction from 35 per cent, to 25 per cent. Biitish. It is true that a number of our big competitors are established in foreign countries; but there is also serious competition from Great Britain. At the present time, the company which makes this cut glass says quite frankly that, with -by some of the masters of the art, who, the advantage of the exchange rate, it can just about carry on. But its existence is entirely dependent upon exchange, and that is a precarious position for it to be in. I believe that it was the Attorney General( Mr Latham) who said the other day that, in appealing for higher duties against the competition of other countries, we bad developed an inferiority complex. I do not admit that that is so. But I clo say that an inferiority complex has been demonstrated by many of the critics of Australian industries, wbo will not believe that it is possible to produce in this country artistic articles of high quality. No firm would welcome more readily than this company a visit from honourable members; and, it would do everything possible to enable honourable members to see exactly how ifs operations are conducted. Many honourable members have no conception of the nature of those operations, and probably have not, to their knowledge, seen the work that is turned out. The pressed work is splendid, but I am concerned more with the cut glass, because of the artistic nature of that trade. It is an occupation that develops the very best qualities in the operatives. The employees work continuously on splendid designs, aud with beautiful crystal, in the most expert manner. The labour costs represent a very large percentage of the total. In a small article, such as a vase or a fruit dish, the principal part of the cost is not in the material, although that is the finest crystal, but in the highly skilled labour that is employed in fashioning it. That should appeal to honourable members. In the past, those who have had tbe means to purchase costly presents, or something beautiful for their own homes, have been obliged to accept the imported article, for wbicb au exceptional price was charged. To-day, there is no need to buy an imported piece of crystal, no matter what design or what degree of perfection is required. I speak with emphasis on this matter, because I was amazed at what had been done when I visited the factory, and was most pleasurably impressed recently at the advance that had been made within the last twelve months. The young men and women who are employed in these works have been taught in tbe initial stages, were brought to Australia from other parts of the world. The skill and the aptitude of these young Australians for the work is admirable. They are being trained in a beautiful occupation, which must elevate their outlook, and which saves them from the sordidness that, unfortunately, is encountered in many other occupations. Are we to leave to others the monopoly of the artistic and the beautiful? Is this country, or this Parliament, so devoid of imagination that it would permit this industry to be stagnant, and to go out of existence should the rate of exchange drop, with the result that 200 young persons, who have been trained at tbe expense of their own time and application, might be compelled to take up an occupation that does not call for the expression of the higher side of one's nature? That will be the fate of an industry which has just been created, if we follow tbe lines that are suggested, merely for the sake of reducing the British duty by 10 per cent. Any lowering of the exchange rate must mark the difference between the success and tbe failure of the industry. I appeal to the Minister to look at this matter from an altogether different angle from that which he is warranted in viewing other cases. It is an industry that appeals to the aesthetic tastes of many thousands of our people, as well as to the idealism of the boys and girls who are engaged in it. I earnestly urge the Minister to ensure that the industry is placed on a sound foundation, and that a firm which has shown such enterprise, and taken such risks, is given an opportunity to expand and to employ a greater number of our younar men and women. Trade and Customs) [5.43] -The right honourable gentleman bas paid what is undoubtedly a well-deserved tribute to the efficiency of this industry, and bas also, on the. artistic side, made an eloquent appeal on its behalf. I submit, however, that other factors have to be considered. Questions affecting the tariff are mostly urrromantic, and are concerned with pounds, shillings and pence.

It considers the nature and the extent of the employment, importations, and prices. last report? under an item that is subsidiary to the item that has just been deferred at the request of a deputation that is now in Canberra. It is a subsidiary part of a very large industry; but, although small, it nevertheless is efficient and important.. Let us see what the Tariff Board says about it. That body deals with factors that must be taken into account before any appeal to our artistic sense. The board bas reported as follows:The commercial manufacture of cut glass ware in Australia is rendered difficult by the wide range of designs and patterns called for, and the very limited demand for many of these. T h a t is the old story of the m a n u f a c t u r e r w h o commences o n one t h in g , w it h respect to w h i c h he wishes to have the field e n t i r e l y to h i m s e l f , and then sets out as it endeavours to cover the whole field to cover the whole range of items. The r e p o r t continuesEvidence was tendered showing that the patterns displayed by some of the local representatives of overseas suppliers run into hundreds in the aggregate. In the opinion of the Tariff Board, it is not an economic proposition for a local manufacturer, with the restricted market at his disposal, to endeavour to produce all the lines for which there might arise a demand, but production should be concentrated on those goods which, by reason of the greater demand, offer opportunity for manufacture in reasonably large jmntities and at reasonable costs. There are no official figures from which Australia's requirements can be definitely iscertained, but tbe local manufacturer at that time estimated their value at Â£15,000 per annum. The Tariff Board considered that that figure was approximately correct. At the time of the inquiry the Australian output was valued at only Â£1,500. two years ago. doubtedly, grown apace since then, probably because of tbe increasing demand for those articles which can be economically manufactured. The argument holds good that if the industry desires to cover the whole field of manufactured articles, including those not in general use, then it will become uneconomic, and its prices to the consumer will be increased. The board in its report saysA t the inquiry in 1929, Mr Smith, who also represented the applicant company at the present inquiry, stated that his company did not anticipate being able to produce every line that might be required. He claimed, however, that the Australian manufacturers and the suppliers in the United Kingdom could, between them, meet a l l reasonable demands. In the opinion of the board, the attitude adopted by the applicant company at the inquiry in 1929, as indicated in the preceding paragraph, was reasonable, and is one that should still be applied. It is obvious that the Australian manufacturers w ill not be able to commercially produce all the varied types and patterns. four years ago. destroyed, how can it produce any article commercially ? to enable the industry to conduct the manufacture of certain lines, but so soon of manufacture it will become uneconomic. The board further saysA t the same time it is considered by the board that, with a duty of 25 per cent., and the added protection in the form of freight and other charges (excluding exchange which at present represents an added measure of protection), the Australian manufacturers should be able to compete successfully against British manufacturers in many lines. W it h the duty at 25 per cent., the suppliers in the United Kingdom would be in a position to supply goods which do not lend themselves to economic production in Australia, and thus assist in providing the public wit h a reasonable diversity of articles and designs.

If they prove to be inadequate, and if the company can show that unemployment is a result, the matter will be reconsidered. Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) advanced a good argument for a bad case. In reply to an interjection which I made during his speech, he said that prices overseas and local were comparable, but in saying that I do not know whether he took into consideration the duty and thc exchange. He then upset his own argument by declaring that if tbe exchange fell, the industry would languish, and that if the protection given to it by his Government were restored, the number of employees engaged in the industry would increase. aspect of this industry which this Parliament should take into consideration; it is not the aesthetic, but the financial aspect. We are short of revenue. The bulk of the importations of cut glass come from Belgium and countries with which we enjoy favorable trade. In one year Belgium bought Â£10,000,000 worth of goods from us, and we bought from it only Â£1,000,000 worth of goods. By continuing that favorable trade we shall employ more people in this country than by encouraging the manufacture of tbese articles. This National Parliament should take this matter into consideration. We must show countries like Belgium that we bave some spirit of reciprocity. The manufacture of these articles in Australia employs but few Avorkmen. We receive no customs revenue from local manufactures. If we encourage the making of certain lines of cut glass in Australia we shall offend a valuable customer, and, in addition, pay higher prices for the finished article. I ask honourable members to consider dispassionately whether the development of this industry will help Australia. the misery of unemployment in this country. ber is always thinking along miserable lines. He is utterly incapable of dispassionately calculating the cost to Australia of dsveloping this industry. We must take every factor into consideration. Can we afford to offend a customer like Belgium? The honourable member knows very well that if we shut out the goods of another country we are likely to bring about reprisals. If we encourage this industry, ancl, as a result, offend Belgium ancl other countries nnd lose their trade with ns, shall we be better off? I consider that thc present duties are too great. The Leader of the Opposition has stated that the price of the local manufactures has not heen iucreased. Let me inform him that the price of 8-oz. dispensing bottles for chemists is now 32s. a gross, whereas the pre-war price Avas 12s. a gross. Some time ago, because of the imposition of duties, the price of the local article Avas increased to 32s. a gross. A. manufacturer then set up in opposition to the glass There is an company and sold these bottles at ISs. a gross. The glass company thereupon reduced its prico to 14s:, and, later, to 13s. a gross.

The Minister, when he is next in Sydney, should take the opportunity to see the out glass that is now being made in Australia. It is.not only of great beauty, but also covers an exceedingly large range. I am sure that when he views the locallymade articles be will not apply the term "" uneconomic"" to the industry. all, it is quite different from other indusseven lines to the many hundreds it now tries. It has much to do with the culture of the nation. Cut glass serves to adorn many humble homes in this country. Tbe industry is of a highly artistic character, and it deserves all the protection that we can give to it. Tbe Minister has admitted that the report of the Tariff Board is two years old. About seven years ago, I saw this industry in its initial stages. Two foreigners were teaching the trade to five Australians. Iu a comparatively small room, these meu were laying the foundation of what has become au important industry to Australia. At that time, seven meu were employed in it, but, to-day, employment is given to over 200 persons. The Australian product is of greater beauty than fhe imported article, whether it be made in Great Britain, France, or Belgium; and in workmanship is equal to it. That has been discovered, although belatedly, by those who are engaged in this particular line of business. The local raw materials which are used by this industry are apparently the main factor in giving to the locally-manufactured glass the clarity and beauty that it possesses. Some years ago, a Belgium barque came to Australia to load wheat, and those chartering the vessel thought that if would be an excellent proposition to load it with Belgium sand for disposal to the glass manufacturers But wben the sand ballast from Belgium was analysed and tested, it was found to be inferior to the Botany sand which was available in unlimited quantities at the door of the glassworks in Sydney. What applies to cut glass applies also to window and pressed glassware, and to the many ether lines produced in the glass factories of New South Wales. Even the Tariff Board, which in my^ opinion, has a biased and anti-Australian outlook, has conceded in its report that the Australian raw material and manufactured glass is Mr Blakeley. just as good, from the point of view of texture and strength, as the imported article. The Minister stated that it would be uneconomic to produce the whole of our requirements in Australia. I do not pose as an expert, nor, I suppose, does the Minister, but after seeing the way in wbich the local industry has exAfter panded from the manufacture of six or makes, it seems evident that there is no line of cut glass for wbich a demand exists in Australia, wbicb cannot be made here. If the 10 per cent, duty were restored, the company would be encouraged to expand its operations, and supply everything that the market could possibly require, from the elaborate bowls referred to by the Leader of tbe Opposition ( Mr Scullin), on which tbe cost of labour is probably Â£10 or Â£12, down to a simple little butter bowl or candlestick. I cannot conceive of any ordinary article which cannot be manufactured in Australia. There is an army of men in the fitting shop and blacksmith shop of the factory, men who are artists in their way at the making of dies. Some are moulded, and some are cut with chisels. No matter what dies are required, they can be provided. No matter how small the order, dies can be cut to execute it at a cost which does not make the finished article prohibitive. I remind the Minister that this is a clean and healthy industry, employing men, youths ancl girls at good wages, under excellent conditions. I cannot agree witb tbe honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse), wbo said that we should not offend other countries by declining to take their manufactures. Other countries desire to employ their own people, and we wish to do the same. I ask the Minister to postpone here. the item, with a view to re-imposing the 10 per cent. duty. The Minister, in opposing the suggestion for the re-imposition of the duty, quoted portions of the Tariff Board's report, and particularly stressed the statement that this industry had tried to cover the whole field, rather than confine itself to one particular line. The company set out to develop the industry. The extent to which its business can develop depends, naturally, on the population, and the'",39,Where Childben Of Ten Work For
138,Mr Beasley (West Sydney) [6.5],"demand for the articles which it produces. As the population of Australia is relatively 3mall, the company had to install plant ancl equipment sufficient to produce a greater output than the Australian market can absorb. Therefore, it was necessary for the company to launch out in many directions in order to recoup itjaslf. That is necessary in any industry, forward such proposals is to prevent if wisely directed. In such circumstances, to depend on one line, especially when competition has to be faced, would be fatal. industry is observing proper conditions of labour, it should be encouraged to expand until it can supply the whole of the Australian market, and if it does so, rather than being condemned, it should be commended and helped. It has been said that the commodity turned out by this factory is a luxury, that it produces something wbich the bulk of the people do not need. If that be so, it seems to me that tbere is all the more reason why the Government should not hesitate to grant it sufficient protection to enable it to supply the Australian market. The bonorable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) referred to Belgium, and said that we should not antagonize that country because it buys large quantities of our produce. But the more I study such matters, the more I am convinced that the policy of the various countries is dictated by economic factors. of our consumption of cut glass comes from Belgium. every country is striving to protect the interest of its own people in economic matters, and I believe that Australia sbould do the same, both in regard to primary and to secondary industries. It has been said that Belgium takes from us large quantities of our primary products. As a matter of fact, she takes from us only what it pays her commercially to buy. ments more cheaply and of a satisfactory quality from the Argentine or from Russia, or elsewhere, she would clo so. Belgium bas no particular liking for us. Her trade with us is a purely business matter, and she will continue to buy from us only so long as it may suit ber to do so. It is not likely that we shall be able to increase our exports to Belgium by agreeing to buy glass from ber, because tbe markets of the world are already over stocked with the commodities we produce. We read almost daily of proposals for restricting tbe export of butter, eggs, wheat, &c. The object of tbose putting market gluts, and to stabilize prices at a level which will cover tbe cost of production. I believe that, if an Another argument advanced by some honourable members opposite is that the importation of goods from overseas assists our revenue through the duties paid upon them. We should not have single-track minds in regard to revenue, any more than in regard to other things. What is the use of getting revenue through customs duties if we have to pay out all of it and more by way of food relief? Revenue is collected from many sources, and I think that it is better that it should be collected from our own thriving industries than on overseas goods if our own people are to be thrown out' of employment as a consequence. Employment must be stimulated if the economic life of the country is to be healthy, and to stimulate employment we must encourage local industry. It is clear, therefore, that, from all points of view, this industry sbould be protected, perhaps more than many others which have received consideration in this chamber. The company itself has admitted that certain lines are not yet manufactured in this country, and that is only natural. factured if the company is given a chance. industry is not given sufficient protection to enable it to expand and develop, it will never have any incentive to produce all that is necessary to supply the local market. Recently, some members of my family made a careful examination in the shops of' cut-glass goods, and agreed If she could get her requirethat the Australian product was equal to, if not better than, anything imported. That is a tribute to the local manufacturers, a tribute to their workmanship, and to their designing. One honourable member said that -we should regard these matters from the point' of view of Â£ s. and that there was no sentiment in business. I think that we may fairly claim",40,Where Childben Of Ten Work For
139,Mr R. Gbeen,"Less than 3 per cent,",41,Where Childben Of Ten Work For
140,Mr Beasley,That may be so. Still,41,Where Childben Of Ten Work For
141,Mr Jennings,They will be manu,41,Where Childben Of Ten Work For
142,Mr Beasley,"That is so. If anthat there is a great deal of sentiment in these matters, that most of us are prepared even to make some sacrifice to encourage Australian industry. In my opinion, a case has been made out for a protective duty on these goods, and I urge the Minister to give consideration to it. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. A good case has been made out for retaining the duty on cut glass. Those who in have to overcome mauy obstacles before their industries are established, and it is the duty of Parliament to give to them reasonable consideration. Germany and America, by tbe protection of their industries, have become two of the most important trading nations. Over Â£500,000,000 is invested in Australian secondary industries, and it is well to remember that. Ave rely on them for the major portion of taxation, and for the continuation of employment. Approximately Â£2,000,000 bas been invested in the development of the glass industry. Prior to the depression, it employed about 2,400 persons. At present, the number is reduced to 2,000, but when normal conditions return, it is expected that tbe industry will employ 3,000 hands, and pay in wages approximately Â£600,000 a year. The glass industry deserves support because 95 per cent, of tbe materials it uses are of Australian origin. Of the quality of its products tliere can be no doubt. Australian cut glass compares favourably with the imported, and, as invariably happens, Australian production has brougbt about a reduction of prices. I have seen many fancy containers manufactured by the Australian firm, Avhich has helped other industries to obtain the local market for their products. Britisb industries are asking Australia to lower .the duties on tbeir products. That is a legitimate request, but the TJnited Kingdom is itself busy erecting tariff walls. Britisb manufacturers are asking that the duties on pottery imported into tbe TJnited Kingdom be raised from 25 per cent, to 50 per cent., and on hats, they want a duty of 50 per cent. While Ave are reducing the duties on British goods, Great Britain is increasing tbe rates on those commodities which compete Avith its manufacturers. There is au agitation for a tariff truce throughout the world, but Australia must not take the risk of being slaughtered for the sake of economic peace. If honourable members will inspect tbe glass works in Sydney, tbey will be impressed Avith the quality of the articles produced there. These products are obliged to compete Avith goods from countries where wages are lower, and labour conditions are not governed by arbitrainvest large sums of money tion courts. If the former duty of 35 new manufacturing enterprises per cent, is restored, the Australian industry will have a chance to become firmly established, maintain employment, and keep in circulation the money invested in it. display of cut glass, AvhichI Avitnessed in Sydney recently, Avas one of thc most delightful exhibitions of Australian craftsmanship that I have been privileged to see. The samples were proof of technical skill and artistic taste of a high order. We should do nothing that will impede the development of an industry that affords scope for the artistic capabilities of our artisans. If the Govornment persists in reducing the tariff protection by 10 per cent., this neAv industry will suffer seriously. Those who have been sufficiently enterprising to invest their inoney in cut glass production, regarded it at first as only a side line to the main glass industry, and the maximum number of persons employed was 17; but when adequate protection was given in the Scullin schedule, the industry developed rapidly, and the number of persons engaged in the production of crystal ware increased first to 100, and later to 200. If the duties are reduced by 10 per cent., this valuable industry may be lost to Australia. We can ill afford to lose a craft Avhich will provide an opportunity for our young people to express both their skill and their artistry. Belgium has won Avorld-wide appreciation of the skill of its people in tbe production of cut glass, which has become one of the important industries of that country. I hope that the Minister will not be unmindful of the special features of this enterprise, especially the fact that it calls for a high degree of skill and aesthetic",41,Where Childben Of Ten Work For
143,Mr Jennings (South Sydney) [8.0].,,42,Where Childben Of Ten Work For
144,Mr Makin (Hindmarsh) [8.5],"Aexpression. I ask him to assure the committee that he will relieve the manufacturers of their present feeling of insecurity and encourage them to extend their enterprise. [S.10] I also urge the Minister to reconsider the duties on this item. The production of cut glass is a comparatively minor phase of a large industry, but often the subsidiary industries help to make the major enterprises witb wbich they are associated profitable by lowering the overhead costs, keeping the staff employed, and obviating broken time. Apart from that, tbe production of crystalware is a very artistic craft. There are in every community persons wbo are unfitted for arduous toil. Those wbo bave had industrial experience will admit that it is difficult to find outlets for males and the attitude of tbe Minister; but that is females wbo, though not physically strong, have a capacity for tbe skilled and artistic crafts. Tbis industry provides openings of a kind that are needed, and we should develop it. It is an enterprise that can be encouraged without prejudice to the general tariff policy to wbich the Government is pledged. I appreciate the views of those who resist highly protective duties which make more costly the implements of primary production, and tbe raw materials of other industries. But crystalware is not a tool of trade, it has no bearing upon the production costs of the farmer, and it is not the raw material of other manufactures. Minister has not been as generous to tbe cut glass industry as he might have been. Por instance, be based bis case on the state of tbe industry two or three years ago, when it was still in its infancy. How could those who were then embarking upon it boast of what they might be able to do in a few years ? The Minister should judge the industry by its present stage of development and its possibilities. He might also ask whether it has detrimentally affected any other industry. Some erroneous statements bave been made regarding the prices of the local product. imports were allowed in free of duty, prices would be lower than wben tbe Government is trying to protect a struggling local industry. That certainly is not true of the cut glass industry. I am certain that prior to the commencement of local production, cut glass was much more expensive than it is to-day. We have bad similar experience of many other commodities, especially those wbicb are a luxury rather than a necessity. If we compare a cut-glass price-list of two or three yeai'S ago with a current price-list, we shall find that prices were higher when we were at the mercy of the importers than they are to-day. We should be proud of the cut-glass industry of New South Wales. I have not been through the factories of that State, but in Melbourne showrooms I have seen some of the articles made in tbose factories, and they are of very high quality. If a little additional protection for this industry would be prejudicial to any other industry I could understand not the case. Tbe Minister bas frequently said-and in 99 cases out of 100 I would agree with him-tba t industry cannot be conducted on the basis of sentiment. An industry which supplies the raw material of some other industry, or articles wbicb are necessaries of life, cannot, of course, be conducted on sentiment; but, in this case, there is room for a little sentiment. Our chief competitors are the cut-glass manufacturers of Czechoslovakia and other European countries. I have sat at conference tables, and in banqueting balls, with The tbe representatives of other nations, and I have frequently beard it said of the TJnited States of America, "" Wbat price 100 per cent. USA. ?"" Canadians bave said the same thing. To-day it is common for German artisans to say, "" What price 100 per cent. GermanyV Tbe same thing is being said by Italians. In these circumstances I ask, particularly as we are dealing with an industry which is developing the artistic taste of our people, ""What price 100 per cent. Australia ?"" I agree with tbe view that has been expressed that it is desirable to encourage trade among tbe nations wbich Many people believe that if comprise the British Commonwealth; but I do not see any reason why we sbould not also give a little additional encourage,ment to our cut-glass industry, which, after several years of struggle, has demonstrated its capacity to provide a high grade article. There is no reason why",42,Where Childben Of Ten Work For

The report of the Tariff Board statesI n the opinion of the Tariff Board, it is not circumstances have altered to any extent un economic proposition for a local manufacturer with a restricted market at his disposal to endeavour to produce all the lines for which there might arise a demand. The honourable member will, I think, admit that I said that the industry has made some progress since that report was furnished. I do not desire my remarks to be misinterpreted. Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) had made an eloquent speech, in the course of which he had observed that we should consider the artistic nature of this industry. I did not use the word ""sentiment"": but since the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has used it, I shall say that sentiment should enter into trade considerations. If it were not for sentiment this Government would not be seeking to give such full effect to tbe Ottawa agreement, which also is soundly based commercially. It would be a good thing if honourable members opposite displayed a little more sentiment in their consideration of tariff matters and trade generally. think that we sbould put Australia last? honourable member asked me to be a big Australian. Does be suggest that I am a little Australian? It must be recognized in these days that it is a fallacy for any nation to think that it can live to itself. The TJnited States of America, with all its wealth and resources, tried to do so, and is to-day paying the price of its economic folly. Apparently, the lesson which tbe TJnited States of America has learnt has not yet been mastered by some honourable gentlemen opposite. Telling hard-luck stories about this or auy other industry and expecting the Government to be influenced by them is useless. We shall not suddenly reverse our tariff policy in response to special pleading of that nature. The Tariff Board has made an inquiry into this industry, and the duties now proposed have been determined in consequence of its report. I remind bonorable members that no protest has been made by. this industry against tbe reduction of 10 per cent, in the British duty. If tbe industry were in jeopardy, it would undoubtedly utter a protest. If recently, and this is proved to the satisfaction of the Customs Department, the Tariff Board will be asked to reconsider the duties. to reply briefly to tbe honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse), who made. I said that the some comment about the value of the goods we purchase from certain countries and the value of tbe goods we sell to them. Wben it suits the lionorable gentleman, he uses arguments of that kind to advance his extraordinarily narrow free trade views;, but be sat silently behind a government whicb, for many years, was satisfied to sell four or five times as much to Belgium, for instance, as we bought from her. Yet the bonorable gentleman is now prepared to criticize that policy. It gives him, of course; an opportunity to express his peculiarly warped ideas in regard to Australian industry generally. The lionorable member now suggests that any increase in tbe duty ou cut glass might seriously affect tbe trade relations between Belgium and Australia. That suggestion is absurd, because most of the cut glass imported into Australia comes, The not from Belgium, but from the Unite' Kingdom, Germany and Czechoslovakia. This industry can be given adequate protection without there being any risk of incurring the displeasure of Belgium; but whether or not our action offends Belgium, I believe in protecting Australian industries. The members of the Australian Imperial Force rendered a great service to Belgium not many years ago, and I feel sure that that country docs not expect that we should break down our tariff barriers and injure our industries and the workers therein. The Crown Crystal Glass Company, which docs practically the whole of the cut glass work performed in Australia, is located in my electorate, but I am not interested in this industry solely on that account. I am as ready to assist the wheat-growers in the electorate of Forrest as I am to protect an'industry in my own electorate.

[8.36] I should be glad if the Minister would explain this big reduction in the duties. Why should tbe duties on picture frames be reduced by 20 per cent, since tbese goods can be manufactured in Australia? I fear that the lowering of tbe duties will injure the local industry. Trade and Customs) [8.37] -The ad valorem rates of duty proposed are based on the recommendation of the Tariff Board, but the fixed rate margin of Is. each, operating at tbe time that the Ottawa agreement was signed on tbose frames the value of which for duty exceeds Is. 6d. each, bas been maintained. That is a protection which is not apparent at first sight. Tbese goodf. cost from 6d. to a few shillings each wholesale, so that a fixed duty of 3s. each British, and 4s. foreign, was altogether too high; in some cases, it represented 315 per cent. Tbere is no reason why tbe manufacturers of metal picture frames sbould be granted a greater measure of protection than is given to other metal manufacturers, in whose case the duties are from 35 per cent, to 45 per cent, against Britisb manufacturers. The rates of duty previously in operation in respect of tliese sub-items were altogether out of proportion. Tbe Tariff Board investigated this matter, and recommended duties wbicb I consider are adequate. in respect of wooden frames? not anticipate that tbere is any danger there. The metal frames are stamped. challenge the concluding remarks of the Minister( Mr White) for I bave figures wbich justify the fears of those engaged in the manufacture of photograph frames and picture frames. For the three years ended June, 1930, frames to tbe f.o.b. value of over Â£20,000 were imported from tbe United States of America. In view of the low price at which they were invoiced, it is evident that we imported not less than 200,000 frames, which, if made in Australia, would have provided continuous employment for at least 100 operatives at an average wage of Â£3 10s. a week. The Minister was wrong when he said that this industry need not fear overseas competition. ing the years referred to? cally tbe same as now proposed; tbey were lower than those imposed under the Scullin Government's tariff. This industry sbould be safeguarded. Although the Australian manufacturers of picture frames informed tbe Tariff Board that competitors in tbe United States of America were making a strong bid for the Australian market, their appeal for adequate protection fell on deaf ears.

Item 333, sub-item ( A 1 ) (Pneumatic rubber tyres and tubes). tbe case of pneumatic rubber tyres and tubes, fixed rates of duty are imposed, or, alternatively, ad valorem duties, whichever return the higher amount. do not know why tbe Government bas agreed these duties, whicb, in my opinion, will mean an increase of When the committee of economists was appointed by the Bruce-Page Government, it made special investigations regarding tbe effect of the tariff in Australia, and one of the appendices published at tbe end of the economists' report dealt with the value of the duties and tbe amount paid in wages and salaries in tbe rubber-manufacturing industry. It was pointed out that tbe salaries ancl wages amounted to Â£1,300,000, and that the value of tbe duties imposed was Â£2,100,000. In other words, tbe value of the duties, assuming that advantage was taken of tbem, was Â£800,000 greater than the total amount spent in salaries and wages. I notice that heavy duties are to be imposed on all rubber goods that may be required for medical purposes. Of course, the poor people will be called upon to pay. A considerable reduction bas taken place in tbe cost of labour in tbe rubber-manufacturing industry, and the general impression that I bave gathered from tbe reports of the Perth Chamber of Manufactures is that agreements have been made among the manufacturers in regard to the prices charged by them, ancl that most of the profits made in the industry go out of tbe country. It seems strange that something cannot be done in th'direction of reducing the duties, and placing the industry on a competitive basis. provisions in the Industries Preservation Act have been applied to bicycle tyres and tubes, the importation of which is practically prohibited. Tbe fixed duties of 9d. and Is. 3d. apply if tbey are higher than the ad valorem duties, and the particularly unreasonable tariff of 25 per cent, is given to the local manufacturer manufacturer, aud a duty of 42^ per cent, is provided against , tbe foreigner. But, with that prohibition, through the tariff, bringing in its train combines and monopolies in the industry, I wish to know if the Minister can say if tbere is any provision for tbe I control of prices, or for protecting the public from exploitation. In spite of the to the imposition of low price of rubber, and tbe reduction of wages and of interest rates, tbe prices of prices. tubes were recently raised by from 48 per cent, to 50 per cent. It is this prohibition by means of a "" tariff which allows the local monopoly to obtain, by the fixation of prices, higher rates than are reasonable. Tbe local prices are above tbose at wbich similar goods could be imported were it not for the tariff. I u March, 1932, certain tubes were sold at 8s. 6d. each, and in August of that year, tbe price was raised to 12s. Tbe price of otlier tubes that were 9s. 9d. was raised to 13s. 6d., and the price of 13s. tubes was increased to 19s. 6d. In some other cases, the increase was 15 per cent. Increases of 48 per cent, and 50 per cent, in the price of tubes, whicb is possible because of tbe tariff, ought to be looked into, and the Government, wbich is tbe custodian of tht rights of the people, sbould see that the manufacturers do not combine and exploit the public. [8.54] -It sbould be remembered that the manufacturers have to pay a duty of 4d. per lb. on crude rubber, a commodity which is not produced in Australia; and the fact bas also to be remembered that the overseas competitors of the Australian manufacturers obtain their raw material free of duty. Tbe honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) mentioned that the Australian rubber industry paid Â£S00,000 a year less on salaries and wages than the value of the duties imposed on rubber goods; but I point out that one of the companies pays to tbe Commonwealth, in taxation alone, Â£400,000 a year, a great proportion of -which consists of customs duties.

For the benefit of bonorable members who tliink that tbe duty is not low enough, introduced into the House of Representatives I point out that, compared with tbe previous Government's proposals, tbe proposed rates represent a 50 per cent, reduction, the previous Government's proposed rates being Is. 6d. per lb. British preferential, and 2s. 6d. per lb. general. Prior to tbe imposition of the additional duties, the local manufacturers were experiencing competition from low-priced cycle covers from Holland, Belgium, France, and tbe TJnited Kingdom. The covers imported from those countries were unguaranteed, and, in order to meet such competition, the local manufacturers brougbt out an unguaranteed cover, which was retailed at from 4s. 6d. to 5s. each. The price of the imported unguaranteed tyro was slightly less, and tbe Australian manufacturer was losing business. With the advent of the prohibitive duties, the manufacture of the unguaranteed cycle cover in Australia ceased, and tbe lowest price at wbich a cover could be purchased was 7s. A substantial demand had existed for tbe cheaper type of cover, and the opportunity previously afforded to the public making tbeir purchases between guaranteed aud unguaranteed covers no longer existed. The trade in those covers became monopolized, and this state of affairs is directly attributable to tbe inproved itself capable of supplying Auscreased duty. In summing up against the increased duties imposed by the last Administration, tbe Tariff Board states that the Australian manufacturers have secured over 80 per cent, of the local market for the tyres under consideration, with tbe ad valorem duties operating previous to the tariff resolution of the 19th June, 1930. The board states that the duties are scientifically worked out, and are adequate to place tbe industry on a competitive basis. Sub-item agreed to. Item 341 agreed to.

That that portion of the tariff resolution on the 8th March, 1033, relating to .item 342,. be incorporated in the present proposals as and from the 9th March, 1933, in lieu of item 342 of the tariff resolution introduced into the House of Representatives on the 13tli October, 1932. This item covers black printing ink, commonly known as news ink, which is used by the daily and other newspapers in various types of newspaper printing machines. It was not until June, 1930, that an alternative basis of protection was provided, and it was effective particularly against the TJnited States of America, which was previously the principal competitor of Australian ink manufacturers. For a period of ten years, the local industry bas been carried on; but it was not until effect was given to the last Government's tariff proposals that tbe industry was able so to establish itself "" as to be able to supply practically the whole of the requirements of the Australian market. Ho complaint is made concerning tbe quality of tbe ink supplied by tbe local manufacturers, or regarding their ability to meet Australia's requirements of this class of ink. It is remarkable that the Government should seek to imperil an industry that has tralian requirements when assisted by the duties provided in the Scullin schedule. Tbere is grave doubt whether it can continue to do so witb lowered duties, ancl every prospect that manufacturers of tbe TJnited States of America will encroach upon our market, to tbe disadvantage of Australian manufacturers.

The manufacture of printing ink can be carried on successfully only under bulk production conditions, wbich will not be possible if no evidence was advanced against the the Government opens the door to competition from abroad. Tbe finding of the Tariff Board seems to me to be illogical for, while admitting that the previous rate of duty had enabled the industry to become established and supply a satisfactory article without increasing the price to the consumer, it recommended a reduction of duty, fearing that the higher rate might result in increased prices to the consumer! Tbe action of the Government is a poor compliment to the enterprise and service of those connected with tbe industry. Trade and Customs)[9.4] -The Tariff Board is satisfied that tbe high rate of duty propossd by tbe Scullin Government was not required to protect tbe industry. In the opening paragraph of its report the board states that it considers that customs duties should not be required to protect an efficient manufacgaged in the production of ink returer. In this instance local manufacturers enjoy 98 per cent, of tbe available ink was sold enabled the group, taken trade, for which 75 per cent, of the materials that are needed are imported. Consequently, the labour involved is small. Item, as amended, agreed to. Item 343 (Printing and stencilling inks, n.e.i.). remarks of the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) on the last item, apply equally well to this one. The Minister suggested that importations of tbese commodities are so small that tbe matter is not worth bothering about. The trouble is that if we encourage such importations they will amount, in the aggregate, to a substantial volume, and we shall find ourselves reverting to the wicked old days when our imports greatly exceeded our exports. The Australian requirements of printing and stencil ink amount, roughly, to about Â£2,000 per annum, and tbere are at least twelve firms engaged in tbe manufacture of tbese inks in this country, one of whicb has been established over 60 years; therewithstanding the increase of duty there has beeu no increase in the price of these commodities. When the Tariff Board inquired into the matter some time back Scullin duties either by the importers or consumers, which suggests that both parties are satisfied witb the quality and price of the local product. We should not encourage unnecessary importations, for the consequences will be serious.

The manufacture of travelling bags falls into two categ6ries, one consisting of fibre cases and the other of leather cases and trunks. manufacture of suit-cases became available in Australia twenty years ago. Previously great quantities of matting hampers and suit-cases were imported from Japan. The industry bas developed quickly in Australia, and it must be said to its credit that, by sheer merit, it has established a reputation for the superior appearance and excellent wearing quality of its manufactures and for comparative cheapness as against the imported article. It is believed that if the proposed reduction of duties is made the travel goods industry will receive a serious setback. For a period of years tbe industry bas had a lean time, and now, when there is every hope of a revival of trade, tbere is to be a reversion to tbe duties of 1928-29, witb the result that orders will be diverted to overseas manufacturers. Tbere are 23 firms manufacturing these goods in Australia, so that the importance of the industry will be recognized. The likelihood of Japan endeavouring to re-establish itself on the Australian market in this connection is not mythical or uncertain. It is definite that that will be the result if this amendment is accepted, for Japan will bave tbe advantage of lower duties coupled witb tbe added advantage of the rate of exchange and tbe suspension of the 50 per cent, surcharge. Those who desire to retain Australian trade within the Commonwealth will view the proposal with concern, for the industry offers a suitable opening for many Australians to secure a desirable class of employment. I ask the Minister to assure the committee that be will do everything he can to discourage the foreign importation of tbese articles, and that be will have the item reviewed should that competition become a serious menace to Australian industry. Tbe departmental ruling that shopping bags are to be classified under sub-item B, bas created a glaring anomaly wbich I desire to bring to the notice of tbe Minister. Tbey are essentially hand bags, but some are made in combination form. Japanese shopping bags are being dumped on the"" Australian market at prices wbich, if unchecked, will ruin this side of the Australian bag industry. It is contended that if they are classified, as they should be, under sub-item A, Japanese imports 'will Fibre sheets needed for the be met satisfactorily. I , therefore, strongly urge that the present departmental ruling be altered, and that shopping bags be classified in the manner suggested; also that Japanese prices be checked, and that sucb goods be entered for customs at tbeir correct market value. I shall be glad if the Minister will give me an assurance that the departmental ruling will be reviewed along the lines suggested so that unfair competition from Japan may be met.

Tbe manufacturers quite fairly ask that wardrobe trunk fitting3 sbould be admitted under departmental by-law, in view of the fact that tbey are not made in this country, or in tbe United Kingdom, and their further request, that shopping bags be classified under 376 A, is also a reasonable one. Amendment agreed to. Trade and Customs) [9.18] -As the matter mentioned by the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) and the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Jennings) touches an important side of the bag industry, I remind the committee that certain lines of bags were dealt with in group 5. If bonorable members will turn to that portion of the schedule, they will find that the local industry is adequately protected, the ad valorem duties being 50 per cent. Britisb, and 70 per cent, general. The only lines that come under this heading are suit and attache cases, fibre-board cases, and wardrobe trunks, some of wbich are made only to a limited extent in Australia. An investigation by tbe board disclosed that the selling price of Australian cases was two ancl a half times higher than the price for similar cases in England, without taking into account tbo exchange and wages conditions. With regard to wardrobe trunks, it was found that the Australian cost of production ""was 240 per cent, more than the English selling price. The board, therefore, considered that a satisfactory industry in that line could not be established with the cost of production at sucb a high level. item B covers many other classes of bags and cases than tbose just mentioned; and as the local manufacturers did not attend the inquiry, the board assumed that tbey were satisfied with the duties imposed under tbe 1921-30 tariff. The bonorable member for Hindmarsh mentioned certain classes of goods that were being imported under a wrong classification. I shall inquire into that matter, and if I find that the classification is wrong, I shall have it corrected. I would, however, point out that, by currency depreciation, any nation can get uncler practically any tariff. This was proved in tbe case of gum boots from Japan, with tbe result that we were obliged to take tbe necessary measures to safeguard the Australian industry. Sub-items, as amended, agreed to. Item 392, 3ub-item (c) (Yarns, woollen or containing wool). Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [9.21] I direct the attention of the Minister to a matter whicb was mentioned before the Tariff Board by one or two witnesses, but was not considered by that body when framing its report. I refer to tbe conditions existing in spinning mills handling percentage yarns, containing wool. At tbe outset, I pay a tribute to the efficiency of tbe Australian spinning-mills as a whole. They supply Australian users witb yarns wbich are equal in quality, finish and colour to the best English, and I understand give complete satisfaction to tbe trade. In this connection I especially mention the pioneering firm of Paton and Baldwin, Launceston, who are very jealous as to the maintenance of standards in tbeir products. Since percentage yarns containing a proportion of wool are used for tbe manufacture of the cheaper grades of underwear, one would, naturally, expect them to be cheaper than average woollen yarns; but that is not the case in Australia, because, so I am informed, tbe spinning-mills handling percentage yarns are taking advantage of the duties offering, and, in some cases, are charging 2d. per lb. more than for the same quality of woollen yarn. Subthe manufacturing processes? Mr E. J. HARRISON -The difference, I understand, is very small. Tbe wool and cotton being combed together, manufacturing costs are not increased; but it is a slight departure from the straight-out processes used in tihe manufacture of all woollen yarns. In England, percentage yarns are always considerably lower in price than pure woollen yarns; but, as I have stated, the positiou in Australia is different. Until recently only one spinning mill, the Australian Cotton and Silk Company, was manufacturing percentage yarns, and it would handle only large orders",51,Division 16 Miscellaneous
183,Mr White (Balaclava,Minister for,52,Division 16 Miscellaneous
184,Mr Rijley,"Wbat is tbe difference inwhicb. would justify the necessary alterations in the frames. Latterly, the Bradford Spinning Mills bave entered this branch of the trade, and is now producing percentage yarns at a more satisfactory price. I suggest that the Minister consider tbe separation of this item. Objection is not taken by tbe spinning industry to the reduction of the duties from Is. per lb. British to 6d.; but the average knitter takes the view that if Australian percentage yarns are not available here at a satisfactory price there should be opportunity to import so that' the people of this country may obtain the cheaper grades of underwear at a more reasonable cost. This item affects an important industry. In 1929-30, tbe output of woollen yarn was 7,658,849 lb., of a total value of Â£1,992,269. This included only a small proportion of percentage yarn, because the trade, as a whole, found it more convenient to purchase tbe lo>,cal woollen yarns than to pay tbe extraordinary prices asked by this particular spinner for percentage yarns. I hope that the Minister will give consideration to this matter, and see if the item can be divided so as to enable Australiau users to obtain cheaper underwear garments containing a fair percentage of wool. Trade and Customs) [9.25] -Tbe bonorable member for Wentworth ( Mr E. J. Harrison) has asked that consideration be given to this sub-item witb a view to its separation. Tbis request, I understand, was not advanced previously by the. trade, but the facts which the honourable gentleman has brougbt to my notice are deserving of consideration, and some good may come of the proposal. I am prepared to have an analysis made of tbe articles affected by this sub-item, and will see what can be done. 'The reduction of the duties is not a drastic one. Australian spinners secured 84 per cent, of the trade wben the duty on Britisb yarn was only 20 per cent, ad valorem, and I suggest that they can hold it with tbe duties now proposed, which are in accordance with the recommendations of the Tariff Board. Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [9.26] -The only other point to which I would direct tbe attention of tbe Minister is this: The spinning mill, whicb is charging 2d. per Ib. more for percentage yarn than for woollen yarn of equal quality, is associated with many companies in Australia, including knitting mills. It seems rather peculiar that tbe knitting mill associated witb it at tbe present time has practically a monopoly of union underwear. It is believed that this spinning mill is cutting out other manufacturers and giving a distinct advantage to its own mill, so that it may enjoy a monopoly of tbe trade in this type of underwear. Tbat, in itself, calls for some investigation. Sub-item agreed to. Item 394, sub-item (D1, 2) (Compressed or agglomerated corkboard). -Unless tbere is a later Tariff Board report than that' dated the 23rd July, 1931, I am at a loss to understand why this sub-item is in this group, wbicb is supposed to include only amendments made by the present Government whicb are supported by Tariff Board reports. I was informed a few weeks ago by a responsible officer of the department that the 1931 report was the latest on this subject issued by the board. If that is so, this sub-item should not have been included in this group, because, certainly, the duties proposed are not supported by the board. Perhaps the Minister can inform me if tbere is a later report than the one wbich I have mentioned. This sub-item deals with corkboards, a substance used for insulating freezing chambers in butter factories and other similar establishments. Under the Pratten tariff, tbe duty on corkboard was 30 pel"" cent. Britisb, and 40 per cent, general. Tbese rates were increased by the Scullin Government to 2-Jd. a square foot British, and 3d. general, for board of 1 inch in thickness. Tbey bave now been reduced to l i d . a square foot Britisb, and 2d. a square foot general. Tbat is entirely out of harmony with the recommendation of the Tariff Board; which readsTliat no alteration be made in the rates provided by the Customs Tariff 1921-30, in respect of any of the goods under review, namely, corks, crown seals, cork insets for crown seals, ancl corkboard. The following statement appears iu tbe report of tbe board:According tofiguresgiven to the board, the f.o.b. prices of 2-in. corkboard from overseas",52,Division 16 Miscellaneous
185,Mr White (Balaclava,Minister for,53,Division 16 Miscellaneous
186,Mr Paterson (Gippsland) [9.27].,"ranged from 3s. id. to 7d. per square foot. Taking 5d. per square foot as an average f.o.b. price, the duty payable at 40 per cent, under the Customs Tariff 1921-1930, would represent considerably more than the direct labour cost given by the manufacturer referred subject to the continuance of the existto in the preceding paragraph, while the rate of 3d. per super, foot provided in Tariff Resolution of llth December, 1929, would cover and other factors wbich enter into costs direct labour, overhead, and portion of administration and selling. The point that I particularly wish to make is, that if the Tariff Board is correct in its statement that 5d. a square foot, 2 inches thick, is the average price of imported corkboard, then this duty of 2d. a square foot, 1 inch thick, which is equal to 4d. a square foot, 2 inches thick, would represent 80 per cent.; because 4d. is 80 per cent, of tbe od. wbich the Tariff Board says is the average f.o.b. price. Tbat means that, instead of having duties of 30 per cent, and 40 per cent., as recommended by tbe Tariff Board, we have on corkboard, 2 inches thick, duties that are the equivalent of 60 per cent, and 80 per cent. Trade and Customs) [9.33] -The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr for lots of less than 3,000 square feet, Paterson) has quoted from the latest printed report of the Tariff Board; but as further facts were advanced by tbe manufacturers of corkboard a year ago, the matter was re-submitted to the board. that later report. the case when a report is sent back, it was furnished in memorandum form. Tbis occurred before I became Minister for Trade and Customs. review has brought to light additional information. At tbe time of the board's latest report the f.o.b. price of 2-in. corkboard was 3.25d. a square foot, and the landed-into-store price, with 40 per cent, customs duty, primage and current exchange, was 8.25d. a square foot. Tho local manufacturer bas been able to reduce his manufacturing costs for 2-in. corkboard from 13.59d. a square foot in May, 1931, to 9.089d. a square foot. attributable mainly to the fall in the price of cork products generally, reduced cost of raw materials brought about by arrangements for better purchasing facilities, and improved factory efficiency. As regards prices, the company bas given a definite undertaking to sell 2-in. corkboard at a uniform price not exceeding 10|d. c.i.f. main Australian ports, ing conditions as to cost of raw materials of production and distribution. The local manufacturer bas promised also that users will receive the benefit of any reduction of cost. Although tbe present landed-into-store price of 8.25d. a square foot for imported corkboard is somewhat less than tbe selling price of tbe local line, such landed cost only applies where corkboard is indented and not bought through a wholesaler. In other cases, the merchants' or distributors' profit will increase the landed price. In very many instances, little or no added cost will be incurred by the use of tbe local corkboard, as the Australian manufacturer sells direct to the users, and such sales will not have to bear the merchants' profit or the distributors' commission. It is as well to state at this juncture that over 90 per cent, of the orders received by tbe local manufacturer are and that the material is required at short notice. If the direct supply facilities provided by the local manufacturer were not available, purchasers would be compelled to obtain tbeir requirements from the middleman, at prices very much in advance of those at whicb the material could be indented. The results of tests of the local corkboard, conducted at the Brisbane University, show that it compares favourably in quality witb the Tbe further imported article. In summarizing the position, the Tariff Board states that if the facts now advanced had been placed before it at the time of tbe inquiry in May, 1931, it would bave recommended the proposed rates on corkboard. I trust that that explanation will suffice. I believe that very good corkboard is being manufactured in Australia, andsold at a reasonable price. The Minister This reduction in price is must admit, however, that in the circumstances I was justified in the inquiry that I made. Honourable members ought.to bave been in possession of the subsequent report of tbe Tariff Board, in order that tbey might understand the position.",53,Division 16 Miscellaneous

I sbould like to hear the reason whicli actuated tbe Government in making tbe alteration to this item. It appears to me that this action supports tbe view that the Government intends that, so far as it is concerned, there shall be no shipbuilding in this country in the future. This must naturally excite tbe interest of a large number of men wbo follow sucb avocations as those of boiler-makers and shipwrights. the amount of employment offering in connection with ship-building is restricted. One can, therefore, appreciate tbe extent to which the chances of these men of again obtaining sucb employment will be prejudiced by this action of tbe Government. There are ship-building yards in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, in which punts for vehicular and passenger traffic, tugs, lighthouse tenders, &c, could be constructed; Government possessed a most modern shipyard. It has now been handed over to private enterprise. When these yards were functioning, tbey provided an avenue of employment for a considerable section of our artisans, but since they I quite agree with the bave been closed down those men havo had absolutely nothing to do, and have been compelled to walk the streets of Sydney, and, I suppose, of the other capital cities. They probably hoped that circumstances would arise that would restore to them their former employment, but it now looks as though tbey are doomed to disappointment in that respect. Tbe Government sbould give serious conmen are to do. After all, those who aro .trained in this particular line cannot easily be absorbed in other walks of life. The free entry under the Britisb tarifT 1934, ad may be a concession that was agreed upon compared witb the conditions that prevailed under the last Government that the Minister ought to give tbe reasons for it. At one time, the ship-building industry was well established and in a flourishing condition in the electorate that I have the honour to represent. Men of skill and enterprise were then able to demonstrate that it was possible to turn out this class of work in Australia. I understand that tbeir workmanship was unequalled. But the whole of tbe machinery at Port Adelaide has now been dismantled, and tbe artisans have gone to othei parts, 1 many of them having returned to tbe United Kingdom. The abandonment of the enterprise that was carried on by Poole Even in ordinary times, and .Steele bas deprived us of a valuable adjunct to our secondary industries. I deprecate strongly any action that might have the effect of repeating in other States what has happened in this case. 1 do not say that tbe policy of'this Government was responsible for the abandonment of the South Australian project; but I do contend that this industry did not receive in times gone by tbo encouragement that would have enabled it to preserve for Australia this valuable and until recently, this secondary project. The Government would do well to recognize that every encouragement must be given to industries of this description. South Australia was unfortunate in the loss of its ship-building industry, and, in that respect, it still believes that it did not receive a fair deal.",54,Division 16 Miscellaneous

Tbe decision of the Government to follow blindly the recommendation of the Tariff Board, based on the Ottawa agreement, is likely to place this important industry in a serious position, and if another war occurs, we shall bave to depend upon oversea establishments for tbe supply of whatever vessels we require for tbe maintenance of essential services. Some months ago, this Government decided to free itself of the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, and leased it to a private company. There is in tbe southern hemisphere no better equipped establishment than that dockyard, ond ou national grounds, and in fairness to the people as a whole, the Government should do everything in its power to assist those in control of tbe dockyard, who have undertaken no small task indeed. At the last election, tbe statement was made by members of tbe United Australia Party that if returned to power, their party would find jobs for all. I have been waiting patiently for sixteen or eighteen months for an announcement of the programme of .works which it intends to put in hand in order to give employment for our people. The ship-building industry provides a golden opportunity for employment; yet the Government is not prepared to lend a helping band to encourage and foster it. Board, and I find that only one witness gave evidence in support of the previous duty on vessels of 500 tons gross register, and that was tbe chief draughtsman of Morts Dock and Engineering Company of Balmain, Sydney. Had that inquiry taken place a month or so ago, wben tbe Cockatoo Island Dockyard was placed under tbe control of a private company noted for its organizing ability,, and its wonderful success in other branches of industry, I feel sure that that company would have been well represented at tbe inquiry advancing cogent reasons for giving adequate protection to the shipmaking its recommendations, was largely influenced by the evidence tendered by representatives of interstate steamship companies; Those companies are anxious to be protected against the competition of oversea companies, yet tbey are not prepared to take a broad outlook, and to encourage an. Australian industry so as to provide employment for our own people. Tbey derive tbeir profit from tbe carriage of Australian passengers and cargoes. The policy of this Government in establishing secondary industries bas given a great fillip to interstate shipping by providing cargoes for interstate vessels whicli would otherwise have been conveyed in foreign bottoms. No doubt tbe members of the Country party will contend that any assistance given to tbe ship-building industry will tend to increase freights. ence to that in tbe report of the Tariff Board. years, tbere has been a considerable increase of oversea freights, which, of course, cannot be attributed to the high cost of local construction, because tbe oversea vessels are by this Government not built in this country. Tbe trouble is that we bave on the United Kingdom-Australia berth, vessels sucb as the Strathaird and the Stralhnaver, wbicb are. luxurious liners of 22,000 tons.

Por many months .1 have been hopeful that the Government would come forward with some proposal to provide employment for otfr own people, but while it follows blindly the recommendations of the Tariff Board, the unemployed can expect little or no relief. Amendment agreed to. [9.55] I understand that on all vessels over 500 and. up to 1,000 tons, tbe previous duty was 50 per cent. British preferential and 70 per cent, foreign, and that it has now been reduced to-free , British preferential, and 15 per cent, foreign. One would naturally have expected that the protection taken from tbe Australian ship-building industry would have been given to the British shipbuilder as against tbe foreign shipbuilder; but it seems to me that we bave reduced the preference to Great Britain in favour of the foreigner. The British ship-builder has had a bad time during the last few years. Tbe tonnage list shows that some foreign companies are progressing, while British companies are retrogressing. accordance with the Ottawa formula, tbe object of which is to enable ""British, industries to compete with foreign industries. that the Ottawa formula could work out in such a way as to take some preference from Great Britain in favour of foreign nations. Prior to this alteration of duties, with vessels of 1,000 tons. These vessels there was a protection of 50 per cent, to Australian ship-builders as against Great Britain, and of 70 per cent, as against the foreigner. That gave the Britisb ship-builder an advantage of 20 per cent., which bas now been reduced to 15 per cent. Tbe present duties will be of great advantage to one section of the commuuity only, and that is not the shipbuilders, but the ship-owners. I want to tage any compensation is to be given to the primary producers and other shippers of goods throughout Australia. Tbey are certainly entitled to some compensa^ tion. I should like tbe Minister to make some inquiries on that aspect of the matter. Trade and Customs) [9.58] -Witb reference to the preference that is being given to Great Britain under this item, paragraph a of schedule F of tbe Ottawa agreement statesWhen goocU the produce or manufacture of the TJnited Kingdom are free of duty or are liable to duties of customs not exceeding 1!) per cent, ad valorem, the difference between the British preferential tariff rate and thc rate upon similar goods from the most favoured foreign uountries, sliall be at least 13 per cant, ad valorem. One would imagine from the speeches of some honourable members that tbe shipbuilding industry of Australia is likely to be destroyed as a result of the imposition of these duties; but that is not so. On the contrary, tbe duties of 50 per cent. British preferential, and 70 per cent, foreign, apply to vessels of up to 500 tons, a class of vessel which for many years, although not recent years, was built in Australia. The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) has said that the ship-building industry in his electorate has closed down because of the lack of orders. Let me point out that that happened at a time when the duty was much higher than it is at present. This industry is languishing, not because of the tariff, but because no orders are forthcoming. The Tariff Board has submitted two reports on this industry, one in respect of vessels exceeding 1,000 tons gross Tegister, and the other in respect of vessels of over 500 tons, up to and including 1,000 tons.

Should sucb a' duty be applied the added cost would be so serious that for some considerable period there would be no purchases of new boats for the Australian trade. I put it to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) and tbe honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), who are interested in those engaged in the shipbuilding industry: Are they not also concerned that employment should be provided for seamen? If tbe number of ships engaged in the coastal trade is reduced, many seamen will lose their employment. Should, however, some purchases be made at the increased rate, the increase of freight charges which would have to be made to offset the additional capital required would seriously affect other industries. We know that freights are already tbe subject of complaint, shippers believing them amended in accordance with the Ottawa to be too high. The local companies protest against British competition, and any proposal to suspend tbe coastal provisions DIVISION of the Navigation Act is strenuously fought in Parliament. Even with such a duty it is exceedingly doubtful whether tbe orders for new vessels would be placed in Australia as the board was conapparel elastics). vinced that the commercial manufacture of vessels over 1,000 tons was not likely to eventuate in the near future. In connection with vessels from 500 tons to 1,000 tons, the board' stated that tbe position was similar to that in respect of tbose over 1,000 tons, and that any advantage gained by the shipyards by reason of a duty would be far exceeded by the disadvantages to the community in general. Tbe reduced demand for new vessels would have a serious effect on the efficiency of the Australian coastal fleet. At the present time, when the primary producer bas to accept sucb low prices for his products, it is imperative that his charges be kept at as low a level as possible. Any increase of freights, however small, would have a serious effect on tbe already low net returns received by him. give us any hope that freights will be reduced ? Mr White. doing what it can to have them reduced. Tbe Tariff Board bas inquired into these matters carefully, and the Government believes that its recommendations, if given effect to, will assist the shipping industry in Australia. Honourable members have said that the industry has faded out in spite of tbe protection afforded. Tbe Government bas now reduced the duty so that ships may be obtained from Britain at reasonable prices, thus enabling freights to be reduced, both overseas and interand intra-state. No injury has been done to the Australian shipbuilding trade, because the protection has been allowed to remain in respect of that class of building for which the local trade can cater.

Tbe CHAIRMAN ( Mr Bell) The motion by the Minister for Trade and 'Customs( Mr White) is to postpone items that are not in group 7.

AND GHOCEKIES . Item 38 (Biscuits). I this opportunity to move for the postponement of the item, because this is an item in which Britain may conceivably be interested, and I desire to protest against tbe ratification of this and the other items coming within the group. I realize that I can make my amendment apply only to this item, but anything I bave to say in regard to it applies also to the other items. Some time ago, during the general debate on the tariff, I protested against tbe ratification of those items on which the duty had been increased when the increases had not been supported by Tariff Board reports. Tbis item with whicb we are now dealing is one of a group amended by tbe Scullin Government, and not supported by Tariff Board reports. We have undertaken to bave the items examined and reported upon by the Tariff Board, and tbe duties amended at tbe earliest possible opportunity in accordance with the board's recommendations. Wben the duty on any item is increased by a resolution tabled in this Parliament, the increase becomes operative immediately. Tbat cannot be said of reductions unless tbey apply to items which have not been ratified. The increased rates in item 38 and succeeding items bave not yet been ratified; therefore, any reduction recommended by tbe Tariff Board can take effect immediately upon tbe tabling of a resolution, provided that the reduction is not below the previously ratified rate in the. 1921-30 schedule. Ratification now of the items in group 7 will thus raise an unnecessary obstacle to giving immediate effect to such reductions as the Tariff Board may from time to time recommend. Every item in the group could, therefore, be well left in its present state of suspension, tbe collection of duties by tbe Customs Departratification will be to delay tbe implementing of recommendations for reductions; for if we ratify the items and the board subsequently makes tbe recommendations wbicb we expect it to make, and which the Ottawa agreement requires, and the Minister tables a schedule containing tbem, the reductions cannot take propose to avail myself of Houses of Parliament.

We cannot claim that we are observing the spirit of the Ottawa agreement if we deliberately create any obstacle to the prompt carrying out of recommendations for reductions of duty. Tbe Sydney Morning Herald, of the 22nd of November, 1932, published a leading article under the heading "" A Test of Good Faith "". From it I quote the following:Tlio bill to r a t i fy tlie Ottawa treaty with Britain is in passage through the Senate still without any ministerial statement to clear up the doubts to which the Berald has more than once drawn attention. We refer to the plans-if ail}'-of the Cabinet for carrying into effect the treaty articles 8 to 13, which embody the Australian undertaking to reduce the present high tariff, and article 10, which postulates "" necessary legislative or. other action being taken as soon as may be practicable "" after the signing of the treaty.

Mr Bruce has stated in London that there will be "" a gradual adaptation of Australian tariff policy to the principles agreed upon at Ottawa"". If the Government is sincere in such statements, why does it propose to tie its hands by ratifying tlie current tariff, thus preserving thc treaty articles as merely an expression of pious sentiments? That is a strong expression of opinion by a newspaper of high standing.

211,Good Faith Towards Its Treaty Leader Of The Country Party ( Mr Pater,"item was the Pratten tariff of 1925. At that time Parliament determined that the rates of duty on the various items in that schedule should be those wbich appeared in tbe fourth column of tbe memorandum furnished to honourable members to assist them in this debate. While tbe Scullin Government was in office some consideration was given to the subject of biscuits, and it was pointed out at that time by the then Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Porde) that the Australian biscuit manufacturers were supplying 98 per cent, of our requirements, and that tbe other 2 per cent, were medicinal, or diabetic, biscuits. It was also admitted then that tbe Australian biscuit manufacturers bad not asked for an increase of duty. Yet the Government increased tbe duties per lb. from lÂ£d. British and 2d. foreign to 3d. British and 4d. foreign. This increase surprised the reputable biscuit manufacturers of Australia. I am glad that tbe Acting Leader of the Country party bas selected this item for tbe purpose of a test vote. Tbis is my first speech during the debate on this schedule, and I express the hope that common sense will mark tbe decision of the committee in dealing with this item. When the previous Government was in office a number of honourable members who are supporting tbe present Government joined with members of tbe Country party, including myself, in strenuously opposing the increase of duty on biscuits; but now tbose honourable gentlemen are just as strenuously fighting for the validation of this duty. grounds can tbey possibly justify tbe granting of an increased duty of 100 per cent, on biscuits which was not asked for by tbe biscuit manufacturers? granting of this duty will amount to backsheesh to tbe biscuit manufacturers. Many changes bave occurred in our financial position since the Pratten tariff was under discussion. At that time primage was unknown, and the exchange was not against us. To-day primage and exchange are both important protective factors. Yet the Government is seeking to validate an increase of 100 per cent.' in the duty on biscuits. I sincerely trust that the amendment will be agreed to, and that Parliament will insist on a reversion to L44] the duty on biscuits provided in tbe 1921-30 schedule. I support tbe amendment of tbe Acting son) from tbe point.3 of view of both that honourable gentleman and tbe bonorable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green). Tbe proposed increase of 100 per cent, in tbe duty on biscuits was not asked for, and is not required. Tbe Tariff Board bas not recommended this duty. It is not long since the direct supporters of the Government and the members of tbe Country party combined to pass tbe Ottawa agreement through this Parliament. Tbe Leader of thg Opposition ( Mr Scullin) and bis followers could find no virtue whatever in ibe agreement; but tbose who supported it were enthusiastic about it, because tbey thought it would hearten industry and benefit both Australia and Great Britain. I support the amendment, because I believe that it is in accordance witb article 11 of the Ottawa agreement, wbicb readsHis Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia undertake that a review shall be made as soon as practicable by tlie Australian Tariff Board of existing protective duties in accordance with the principles laid down iu article 10 hereof, and that after the receipt of the report and recommendation of the Tariff Board the Commonwealth Parliament shall be invited to vary, wherever necessary, the tariff on goods of TJnited Kingdom origin in such manner as to give effect to sueh principles. If we are genuine in our approval of this article, and if we are really desirous of stimulating inter-Empire trade for tbe On what benefit of both Australia and Great Britain, we will accept this opportunity to refrain from validating such items of the schedule as are contained in tbe Tbe group now before us. If consideration of this item is postponed pending tbe receipt of tbe Tariff Board report upon it, tbe Government will be able to give effect to tbe recommendations of tbe board immediately tbey come to hand; but, if Parliament validates ibe item, it will deliberately postpone the only real opportunity afforded it of giving reasonably early effect to tbe Ottawa agreement.

A t the rate at which Parliament is dealing with this tariff schedule and the other business of the country, it is possible that very little, if anything, will be done by this Parliament to give effect to articles 9 to 12 of the Ottawa agreement. Here is an opportunity for. the Minister and tbe Government, by the simple process of delaying tbe validation of this group of items not reported on by the Tariff Board, to do something to implement article 11 at an early date. Mr ""WHITE -Ho w could that be done by delaying matters? support the amendment moved by tbe Acting Leader of the Country party ( Mr. Paterson), who made it clear that his amendment referred to all tbe items in this group. If a i l to understand why the Government bas brougbt forward tbese excessive duties, wbicb, in some cases, provide for increases of over 100 per cent. The Minister spoke of obtaining reports from the Tariff Board, yet he asked tbe committee to validate tliese duties, adding that when the board's reports came to hand, the Government could then take further action if it saw f it . Instead of inquiring into those duties Avhich affect principally tbe trade between Australia and the TJnited Kingdom, tbe Tariff Board bas dealt Avith the duties on all sorts of tiddly-winking industries. It may bo years before the board cau report on these items. Article 12 of tbe OttaAva agreement readsHis Majesty's Government iu the Commonwealtli of Australia undertake that no new protective duty shall be imposed, and no existkeen desire to do so. I want to see someing duty shall be increased on TJnited Kingdom goods to an amount in excess of the recommendation of the tariff tribunal. Tbe duties in this group bave never been approved or ratified by Parliament. Eor not one of these increases is there parliamentary sanction. Were Parliament to strike out the increased duties Avithout carrying forward the date from Aviuch the reductions Avould operate, tbe Government Avould be compelled to refund any excess sums of money paid. In the true sense of tbe term, the duties which have been collected are not the existing duties, because tbey have not been approved by the Parliament. Tbe Government has collected these duties with out parliamentary authority. I emphasize the remarks of tbe Acting Leader of the Country party, and I endorse every word in the leader in the Sydney Morn ing Herald, extracts from Avhich bave bsen read to-night. I agree that tbe Government sbould give an exhibition of its f a it h in tbe agreement into whicb it bas entered. man makes some most extravagant statements. truth f u l.

The reason for that attitude on tKe part of tbe Country party is that it desires to strangle more of our Australian industries, and tbe first item it selects for its attack is one that protects item, and be said, ""Because it does a primary industry.

The importations of biscuits prior to tbe imposition of those duties were not heavy in comparison witb tbe substantial. In 1928-29, the imports were valued at Â£39,000, Australia was then bordering on financial collapse, and, despite its adverse trade balance, the people were buying imported biscuits. I contend that if we are not satisfied with biscuits made in our own country, Ave ought to go without them, because tbe quality of tbe locally-made article is, undoubtedly, high. My Government uot only tabled high duties on imported biscuits, but also placed a prohibition on tbeir importation, and that position sbould have been maintained.

He believes that the Government will accept slavishly the recommendations of tbe Tariff Board, and be wants them applied as rapidly as possible. I fear that the honourable gentleman's prophecy may be fulfilled, for, judging from its reports, tbe Tariff Board provides'that the Tariff Board shall be will recommend in a downward direction, irrespective of tbe barm that will result to Australian industries. I also fear that the Government will accept its recommendations. Because of that, I am glad of the early opportunity to ratify these duties so that before tbey can be altered tbere will be a delay, I hope, for. tbe twelve months anticipated by the honourable inember for Gippsland; for then we shall be nearer to tbe time wben tbere will be a change of government and policy, in the interests of Australian industry.

There bas not been a comprehensive tariff passed by Parliament since 1922. Various resolutions have been brought down, and amendments bave been made. The purpose of the Government is to put this schedule through in order to implement the Ottawa agreement as quickly as possible. I am surprised that tbe Country party sbould adopt sucb a selfish attitude. Its members bave constantly alleged that the Government is not implementing Ottawa, and have allowed statements to go abroad to tbe effect that this Government is Board bas worked very hard indeed, and Whatever case tbe produced innumerable reports; I believe that this year it has submitted more than in any previous year.

Yet honourable members of tbe Country party are constantly quibbling, raising questions of privilege, and threadbare arguments about by-laws, and so on. as if tbe Government had been guilty of dishonesty.

Yet, to-morrow, members of tbe Country party, who profess that they desire to have that Ottawa agreement implemented as quickly as possible, intend to move the adjournment of tlie House in order that tbey may tell us the same old thing over again. These duties are in accord with the policy of tbe Government, wbicb was made clear at the election. In that connection I shall quote from tbe speech of the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), whicb was applauded by the Country party. The right honourable gentleman saidAs to the future, the United Australia Party would not, even where it has any disagreement with particular tariff items, engage iu sudden, drastic changes upon ministerial initiative, and without investigation by the Tariff Board. We believe that tariff changes of such a character may easily prove bad for industry and business generally, and, consequently, for employment. Where the tariff has been raised to what may be considered excessive levels without reference to the Tariff the principle of equality of sacrifice. The Board, we would submit oases for hearing as soon as practicable, ancl we would, in broad principal, abide by the recommendation of the board. The whole of the tariff has been submitted to the Tariff Board, in accordance with the Ottawa agreement, and the board is carrying out its task magnificently. It is up to the Country party, which professes to stand for tbe implementing of tbe Ottawa agreement, to support tbe Government in carrying out the recommendations made by tbe Tariff Board, ancl not seek to effect reductions merely to serve its own ends. gest that we should proceed with the items in this group, upon some of wbicb amendments will be moved in accordance with reports received from tbe. Tariff Board. Tbe Government does not intend to depart from its policy of having inquiries made by the Tariff Board before it effects duties. Despite thc remarks of the Leader of tbe Opposition ( Mr Scullin) and tbe Minister, I am not disposed to charge my intention to vote with tbe Country party in this matter. Wben tbe Scullin Government imposed these duties, I well remember tbe agitation that was made by lionorable gentlemen wbo now occupy the ministerial bench. They said that it was a slipshod way of doing things. Yet tbey are now prepared to ratify that slipshod method for an indefinite period. The then Prime Minister intimated that the duties were imposed purely to rectify tbe adverse balance of trade, and, in reply to the complaints of the Opposition, he admitted that they were not scientifically designed. In tbe circumstances the claims of tbe Country party for a revision of tbese unscientific duties is most reasonable. But tbere are other grounds for asking that this item should be reduced. Honourable members on both sides of tbe chamber speak glibly about equality of sacrifice. Biscuits are manufactured from a product of wheat. When the Pratten tariff of l i d . , 2d., and 2d., was imposed on this item, the price of wheat was twice as much as it is at present, ancl tbe price of flour was also higher. Seeing that tbe price of wbeat is now so low it is inconsistent to preserve sucb a high rate of duty; in no way does it carry out capacity of the people to buy biscuits bas been lessened, so that these duties become a levy on tbe food of tbe people. I am astounded that tbose who so strongly opposed the Scullin duties, ancl, apparently, sincerely, sliould now desire to ratify them. . When the Pratten tariff existed tbe Australian biscuit manufacturers were successfully exporting their product. Why, then, is tbere any need for continuing heavy duties, wbich were imposed for revenue purposes? I clo not admit that the present Leader of tbe Opposition did such I suggreat things for Australia wben Prime Minister. In tbe application of tbese duties he did rectify the balance of trade somewhat, but be exported a terrific amount of our gold. Tbe net effect of the imposition, by tbe Scullin Government, of the higher duties on biscuits and other items was to increase the taxation of tbe people by 30 per cent. As for tbe general effect of its tariff and industrial policy, it would not be wide of tbe truth to say that for every four minutes of tbe right bonorable gentleman's term of office, one man in this country lost bis job. Tbis Government sbould not ratify tbe tariff legislation of its predecessor. Tbe successful appeal to the people turned on tbe condemnation, by the then Opposition, of the Scullin Government's general policy, and on tbe distinct understanding that, if returned to power, it would",64,Division 4 Agricultura L Pboducts
234,Mr Prowse (Forrest) [10.56],"reduce duties whicli had been imposed without recommendations by the Tariff Board. There is no evidence, except this tardy announcement of tbe Minister, of tbe intention now to submit to the board the items covered by this group. It would be a physical impossibility for tbe members of the board to review witbin a year all the items included in the group; ( and in view of the attitude of the Government and its supporters, wben in opposition, to these duties, bonorable members sbould not now be asked to ratify them. It is a reflection on the manufacturers of this country to suggest that they require this additional protection.

The Minister omitted to reply to my allegation that this item bad not been referred to tbe Tariff Board by tbe Scullin Government, and that the manufacturers bad not asked for this additional protection of 100 per cent. Nor did be reply to tbe Acting Leader of the Country party ( Mr to tbe manufacturers in regard to both Paterson), who commented on tbe attitude of Government supporters, wben in opposition, to tbese duties. The Leader of the Opposition has made it plain that tbe higher duties in this group were imposed, not for protective purposes, but to rectify our adverse trade balance nt the time. Clearly, the additional protection was not required, because even then our biscuit manufacturers were supplying 98 per cent, of Australia's requirements, and in addition were doing a fairly active export trade. I shall be glad if the Minister will state definitely whether a request has been made by tbe manufacturers for this additional protection, also whether tbe proposal bas ever been considered by the Tariff Board. I disagree with the Leader of the Opposition that the postponement of this item will prejudice the revenue position. It is well known that whenever a government is making an appeal to tbe country, as was the case when tbe Scullin Government, fortunately, was suddenly defeated in this House, all sections of the Parliament agree to validate tariff proposals so as to protect tbe revenue. Eollowing tbe usual practice, tbe many tariff schedules brought down by the Scullin Administration were validated on the eve of the general election solely for tbe purpose of conserving tbe Commonwealtb revenue. The postponement of this item will not affect tbe revenue, and the Leader of tbe Opposition must bave been well aware of that fact wben he indulged in bis usual display of histrionic acrobatics this evening. The Scullin Government made a good deal of capital out of the alleged listened carefully to the remarks of protectionist ""tendency of the people of Australia. While Country party members in this House represent primarily our rural producing interests, tbey also pay regard to the general position of our secondary industries. Honourable members are well aware that tlie standard attained by the different Australian manufacturers of biscuits is a particularly high one. Tbey are able not ouly to supply 98 per cent, of tbe local market, but also to export a proportion of tbeir output. The question of quality or of efficiency does not arise. I pay a well-deserved tribute the quality and tbe price of their product. Because they were well satisfied with those factors, as well as witb tbeir marketing arrangements, they were perfectly content witb tbe original duty, which tbe last Government raised by 100 per cent"". Tbe predecessor of tbe present Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) has definitely stated that they did not ask for that increase, and that the matter was never referred to tbe Tariff Board. As honourable members on tbe Government benches fought this duty wben they sat in opposition, I appeal to tbem to be consistent by fighting it now, even though tbeir own Minister has brought it forâ¢rd . : . : Â« [] I am very much exercised in my mind",65,Division 4 Agricultura L Pboducts

236,Mr Maxwell (Fawkner) [11.12].,"as to how I should vote on the amendment of the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson). I am asked by tbe Government to vote for a duty that, on its face, appears to me to be exorbitant and unnecessary. I waited anxiously for the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr tions of the duties proposed. The MinisWhite) to explain why I should vote for such a duty. The bonorable gentleman, however, merely quoted from the policy speech of the Prime Minister( Mr implement the Ottawa agreement. We Lyons), to the effect that, even though existing duties whicb bad been imposed by tbe previous Government were exorbitant, bis party would make no drastic change without an investigation and a recommendation by tbe Tariff Board. AlthoughI am asked to vote for what I consider an exorbitant duty, I am given no assistance by that body. I understand that it has not made any report in connection with this particular item. It is now suggested that' the item should be postponed. That strikes me as a reasonable request; because, as bas been pointed out, even though the duty is not ratified to-night, its collection will continue, and, in due course, we shall receive assistance from tbe Tariff Board wben it bas bad an opportunity to investigate tbe matter and report upon it. It seems to me, too, that there is a good deal of force in tbe contention of the bonorable member for Gippsland, that' tbe postponement of this and similar items would facilitate the giving effect to the Ottawa agreement. But leaving that on one side, the mere fact that a postponement of tbe item would not in any way affect the revenue of the country, and that ou its face the duty is exorbitant, makes me feci that I cannot vote for its validation until the report of the Tariff Board is before us for our guidance. port tbe amendment, for two reasons: Pirst, as a matter of principle; and, secondly, because the duty is so extremely exorbitant. As a matter of principle, I consider that tbe Ottawa agreement comes into the picture. That agreement provides that full opportunities for reasonable competition shall be given to Britisb manufacturers, allowance being made for relative costs of production in Australia. Yet tbe protection given on some of tbese items amounts to as much as 100 per cent. It is futile to propose amendments for reductions of duty. Tbe Government appears to be determined to bludgeon this schedule through in spite of the most reasonable requests, supported by tbe most cogent arguments, in support of altera-' ter for Trade and Customs( Mr White) has requested tbe Country party to assist tbe Government to desire to do that. The acceptance of this amendment, we believe, would have tbe effect of hastening the implementing of the agreement. Tbe price of flour is approximately Id. per lb., while that of biscuits is from 7d. upwards. A tariff of 3d. per lb. against Great Britain, and 4d. per lb. against foreign countries, on a commodity that is made from a primary product, the price of wbich is in tbe vicinity of Id. per lb., must be admitted to be exorbitant. Downs) 111.18] I cannot sec my way to support the amendment of tbe bonorson). We bave to look at this matter from the point of view of tbe whole of the Commonwealth, and of those who are engaged in industry, trade and commerce in it. We bave before us a tariff schedule wbich covers the wholerange of industries in Australia, and there is a keen desire to have a general tariff act placed on the statute-book. Last year, lionorable members wbo sit in the corner opposite argued very strongly that the Government sbould press forward witb the tariff, and not countenance long delays. Acting upon that advice, the Government called bonorable members together well before tbe usual time. As the Leader of tbe Opposition ( Mr Scullin) bas pointed out, strong objection has been taken to tbe practice of having a series of tariff resolutions unratified for a number of years. Objection has also been raised to the failure to prorogue Parliament each year. That has led to a departure from the constitutional practice of baying annual sessions witb, at the beginning of each session, a Governor General's Speech containing a proper presentation of policy, followed by a motion for the adoption of an Address-in-Reply, which",66,Division 4 Agricultura L Pboducts

Tbe object sbould be to revert to normal conditions, witb a session lasting six montbs, aud a recess of a similar period, during wbicb Ministers might devote themselves to the administration of tbeir departments. Tbe Government early in this year summoned bonorable members from all parts of the Commonwealth, at considerable inconvenience to tbem, to Canberra, so that this tariff schedule might be passed by Parliament. The Country party now proposes, in effect, to bold up tbe whole of the items, although most of them bave been considered by the Tariff Board. which we are discussing bas beeu investigated by tbe board. Sir lionorable member wishes tp hold up the whole of the tariff until tbe last investigation is made. According to tbe Ottawa agreement, the revision of the tariff is to he continuous during the period of its operation. Tbat means, of course, that Parliament will, in the usual way, revise the tariff from time to time. Business people wbo are concerned with the tariff know that the whole of the items depend upon tbe passing of the schedule. It is desirable, in the interests of Australian trade, that tbere sbould be a definite law on tbe statute-book in respect of tbe tariff, so as to enable tbe people generally to know what duties bave been imposed. At present, tbere is an incomplete schedule, containing proposed certain duties, but that is not satisfactory to tliose engaged in trade and commerce both in Australia and abroad. Under tbe circumstances, the proper course to take is to proceed witb the schedule aud complete it. There should be no objection to that. The Country party proposes to hold up the tariff until certain Tariff Board reports bave been presented. How loug will it be before tbose reports are presented? If , in accordance witb tbe Ottawa agreement, reports are to be made continuously, the investigations of the board, if made on proper lines, are likely to be continuous throughout tbe year. It is desirable that we should place a tariff law on the statute-book, and follow the normal parliamentary practice, whicb is to allow the Tariff Board to continue its investigations, and after the presentation of reports to the Government, for the Minister to introduce amending schedules into this House from time to time. will elapse before effect is given to the board's recommendations ? Sir LITTLET ON GROOM -It is much better to .deal immediately with tbe tariff, rather than allow the whole of the commercial world to remain in'a state of uncertainty because of tbe tariff not being placed on the statute-book. exorbitant duty? Sir LITTLET ON GROOM -Before this schedule was brougbt down, the tariff upon tbe statute-book was the law of tbe land. At the time of the elections, mised that if his party were returned to power, it would not alter existing duties without inquiry and report by tbe Tariff Board, even though the duties were considered to be high. Therefore, if we place these duties upon the statute-book, we shall be only carrying out tbe promise of tbe Government that it would not alter existing duties without an investigation by the Tariff Board. these duties to be altered without reference to the Tariff Board. Sir LITTLET ON GROOM I am answering the query of the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell), whether we should vote for tbese duties wbicb, in bis opinion, are exorbitant. As the Government is carrying out its election promise, I think that it is better to place the complete tariff on the statute book as tbe Government is now proposing to do. I do not think that it has any intention not .to fulfil the terms of the Ottawa agreement. of fulfilling tbem up to the present.

244,Mr Gbegoby,"It bas shown little signI do not mean to add mucli to what I have already said on this item. The honourable member for Darling Downs( Sir Littleton Groom) was most unfortunate in using the argument that, if the tariff were uot completed immediately, the commercial world would be left in a state of uncertainty, inasmuch as the particular part of tbe commercial world which is interested in biscuits did not ask for 'this duty, did uot want it, and certainly is not concerned if the duties sbould revert to what they were previously. But the point is that we are not asking for a reduction of tbese duties. We are merely asking the Government to refrain from unnecessarily ratifying this item until tbe Tariff Board bas bad an opportunity to make a recommendation regarding it. Tbe bonorable member for Darling Downs has referred to the necessity for placing this tariff schedule on tbe statute-book, but I ask what necessity is there for that to be done immediately? Had the bonorable gentleman been in the last Parliament, he would bave recalled the picture of bonorable gentlemen wbo are now occupying leading positions in the Government, opposing these duties because of their extreme height, and because of thc fact that tbose who are concerned did not ask for tbem, and did not require them. This particular group of the tariff schedule embraces duties which the Government and its supporters have led us to suppose that t'hay were temporarily tolerating until such time as tbe items could be reviewed by the Tariff Board. Tbey admitted that, in most instances, tbe duties w ere too T high, and in the last Parliament they condemned tbem wholeheartedly. Now we are told that the items must be ratified in order to put at rest the fear3 of tbe commercial community. If we refrain from ratifying this item and succeeding items, immediate effect can be given to the recommendations of tbe Tariff Board as they are tabled by the Minister; but immediate effect cannot be given to recommended reductions if tbe Government now insists upon ratifying the present rates. Tbe Minister( Mr White) himself was no more happy in bis reply than tbe honourable member for Darling Downs. Prom time to time during this [45] tariff debate, I bave admired his imperturbability, but on this occasion he became quite violent; in fact, he was more violent than logical. He used no real argument in reply to my statement. He did, it is true, quote part of the policy speech of the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), but was unhappy even in that instance, because he quoted tbe promise of tbe Prime Minister that tbe Government would not depart from its policy of acting upon tbe reports of the Tariff Board. We are not asking the Government to depart from that policy. We wish it to carry on tha* policy by not ratifying these duties until the reports of tbe Tariff Board are available. Our attitude ou this question is more in conformity witb tli6 Prime' Minister's policy speech than is that of the Minister. The Government has declared that it believes in Tariff Board reports. If that is so, why does it accept a pig in a poke? Why does it accept something which bas not beeu investigated by tbe board? Why does it ask its to carry out. in a slipshod way tbe passage of the tariff without the assistance of the recommendations of tbe Tariff Board? The Minister charged us witb making random shots at tariff improvement; but I maintain that that is what the Minister himself is doing when be asks us to ratify duties whicb were imposed, in tbe first place, in a slipshod and random way, without any Tariff Board investigation. I agree with what tbe honourable member for Eawkner( Mr Maxwell) said, and I am glad to bave tbe support of bis logical mind. The Minister has not replied to the charge I made that, by the ratification of these duties, we shall deliberately plact an obstacle in the way of giving immediate effect to sucb recommendations as tbe Tariff Board may make. Mr E. J. HABBISON (Wentworth) [11.32] I think that most honourable members wbo investigate this item must come to tbe conclusion that some alteration of the Government's tariff policy in connection with it is called for. I listened witb a great deal of interest to the remarks of the Leader of tbe Opposition ( Mr Scullin), wbo told us, in his usual flamboyant style, that Peek, Frean's had opened up in Australia, because they",68,Littlet On Groom Tb E Tbe Prime Minister Mr Lyons Pro

That proves that tbe industry does not want the extra protection. the industry is worthy of protection. Mr E. J. HARRISON -If it was able to compete with tbe manufacturers of tbe whole world, and sell its product on the world's market, it proves that tbe industry was efficient; and if it was able to sell its of trade. product on the outside market, surely it was able to bold the local market without this enormous protection! imposed, Â£39,000. worth of biscuits was imported annually into Australia; after the imposition of the duty, only Â£2,000 worth was imported. Mr E. J. HARRISON I agree; but that merely proves that tbe local factories ciid not manufacture certain fancy kinds of biscuits which a section of tbe public demanded. Some people are prepared to pay a big price merely for the sake of seeing tbe name "" Peck, Erean"" on tbeir biscuits. said by tbe' honourable member for Fawkner. The Acting Leader of tbe Country party ( Mr Paterson) said that, should the Tariff Board recommend a reduction of duty on this item, immediate effect should be given to the recommendation. That would be in tbe spirit of the Ottawa agreement, and with that contention I agree. I feel that the Minister sbould give some indication to bonorable members regarding what he intends to do if, after these items bave been validated, the board recommends a reduction of duty. Isi t his intention immediately to introduce a schedule to give effect to tbe board's recommendations? long delay before the duties are ratified in another place. Mr E. J. HARRISON I recognize that, but if tbe Minister will give us an assurance that tbere will be no undue delay, I feel confident that tbe honourable member for Gippsland will withdraw That remark moved me to bis amendment. Mr ""WHITE -Tb e whole group is before tbe board now. Mr E. J. HARRISON -If tbe Minister will give tbe assurance for wbicb I have asked, I am sure it will satisfy tbe honourable member for Fawkner, as it will satisfy me. If the Minister cannot give sucb an assurance I shall not be satisfied. Tbe Leader of tbe Opposition said that tbe duty on biscuits was not increased by bis government at the request of the manufacturers, but was done in order to adjust finances and restore tbe balance able member wishes to upset that balance again. Mr E. J. HARRISON I do not, but no one can justify tbe present duty when we remember that, under the duties operating from 1921 to 1930, the Australian biscuit manufacturers were, in one year, able to export Â£147,000 worth of biscuits. I must support tbe amendment moved by tbe honourable member for Gippsland, unless tbe Minister is able to give me the assurance for wbich I have asked. I agree with what was The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White), speaking on the amendment moved by tbe honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson), described the Country party as a sectional movement. It is always rather amusing to hear that reference to proposals emanating from this party. It is an easy gibe, and, on almost every occasion that it is made, it is as ignorant as it is easy. No one who has followed tbe debate on this item can justifiably accuse the members of the Country party of supporting sectional interests. The primary producers as sucb do not come into tbe matter at all. The action wbich bas been taken in this respect arises out of a desire to give effect as early as possible to tbe terms of the Ottawa agreement.

278,Mr Feanci S (Moreton,"Assistantcharges disproved, both the letter and the report obtained on it are on the file, so that, sbould any subsequent charges be made, there is evidence that no further investigation need take place. In that case, the record is complete, as I believe of wages due to Commonwealtli employees as all departmental records sbould be. Simia result of the action of the High Court in larly, if a charge contained in an anonyruling against a recent award made by Judge mous letter is investigated, and proved to be well-founded, there is a record to support any action taken. AlthoughI do not agree witb the writing of anonymous letters, I submit that tbe official files should be complete. Tbat is my present view, but I shall give the matter careful consideration, and see what can be done. Question resolved in tbe affirmative. House adjourned at 12.5 a.m. (Friday). !

What control is the Government exercising over the expenditure under the federal aid roads grant to the States? 2. Is this money being used primarily for the completion of the original scheme; if so, is it estimated that the ten years' scheme will be completed in that time? 3. What supervision, if any, exists with regard to the character of the work performed by the States? 4. Is any part of the allocation being utilized for maintenance purposes? 5. Under what obligation are the States with regard to the proper maintenance of the work already carried out under the federal aid roads scheme? I now desire to advise bim as follows:1. The FederalA i d Roads Act, as amended in 1031, places the responsibility for ' the expenditure of the moneys provided under the act wholly in the hands of the State authorities. The State Auditors-General cert if y from time to time that the moneys provided under the act have been expended upon thc construction, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of roads. 2. The State authorities select all works for execution from the moneys provided; the question as to whether such moneys should be expended on works commenced under the original scheme or not is a matter wholly for 3. The Commonwealth does not exercise any direct supervision over the work carried out by the State authorities, but the periodical statements furnished by the State Auditors General indicate that the provisions of the Federal Aid Roads Agreement are being complied with. 4. Yes. 5. As the roads constructed in pursuance of the original act are part of the State road systems, it can be assumed that the State authorities will ensure that maintenance work will not be neglected.",73,Anonymous Letters On Files
