The item contains chiefly articles which are composed of several materials.

Every one must admit that the higher the impost the greater is the encouragement offered for fraudulent practices. On this question I take a view rather opposite to that favoured by most of the committee. Honourable members' seem to run away with the idea that because jewellery is an ornament it is necessarily a luxury; hut I am of opinion that the daughters of the people have as much right to be adorned as their luckier sisters who can afford to buy high-class jewellery. It has been pointed out that hat-pins may be tipped with precious stones, and it is contended that, because of that fact, the daughters of the people should be called upon to pay a duty of 25 per cent, on the humbler classes of pins which they use. that, great as this Commonwealth may be, the habits of the period of Louis XV . are going to be adopted, and that our eyes may be dazzled with jewellery worn by the wives and daughters of Australians on the fashionable promenades in Melbourne, Sydney, and other capitals? necessity for a duty of the kind proposed, and for the protection of the revenue as well as for other reasons, I ask the Treasurer to reconsider the position.

I submit this amendment with the view of subsequently moving that the words "" for adornment"" be also omitted in order to substitute the words ""partly or wholly made up of gold, silver, or precious stones."" That amendment would save the department an enormous amount of trouble, because the distinctions proposed in the Tariff are so difficult to make that there is constant friction between importers and the department.

As to the item generally, I hope the Government will adhere to a duty jewellery is manufactured very largely. of 25 per cent. Let us have here and there in the Tariff some evidence of the fact that factured in New South Wales, and the differwe are imposing reasonably heavy duties on ence I have shownin the importations is enorthe luxuries of the rich as well as extravamous. Theprincipalpurchasersof jewellery are gantly heavy duties on the necessaries of the poorer, not the richer classes, but it is the poor.

I am informed, however, that very little made-up jewellery is imported, because it does not pay to import it since, when it is imported in a finished state, duty is charged upon the precious stones it contains, whereas unset stones are admitted free. I am advised, however, by those in the trade that a duty of 25 per cent, is too high. trade appear to be anxious to obtain an advantage. We may be perfectly certain that they do not want the duty reduced so that the importations may. increase, but they woidd naturally be glad to be able to bring in samples and other small articles at a lower rate. I went thoroughly into the whole question with the Minister for Trade and Customs, and while we came to the decision that it was hardly worthwhile to place a duty upon unset precipus stones, we thought that a duty of 25 per cent, upon jewellery would be a reasonable rate, seeing t that the rate upon the requirements of the jewellery trade is only 15 per cent. strong feeling in regard to this matter, but it is refreshing to find the honourable member for Melbourne moving for a reduction I hope that of duty. place more machines on the free list than the honourable member did. that more revenue will be obtained by a to duty of 25 per cent, than by a duty of 20 per cent., I shall vote with them. worth) I have stated that I felt inclined to support this proposal, but on second thoughts, seeing that we have had no experience of the operation of a duty upon I do not see jewellery in New South Wales, while the Treasurer can look back upon the records of 20 or 30 years of the operation of a similar duty in Victoria, I am prepared, as he says a larger amount of revenue will be obtained from the higher rate, to vote with the Government.

Photographs are admitted free, but dry plates, films, sensitized paper, and cameras, which are required to make photographs, are all taxed. I received this morning a letter from the South Australian Photographic Society, which contains 112 active members, and by theni I am informed that the better class of cameras, which must be used to obtain the best results, are exceedingly expensive, and that a duty of 20 per cent, will restrict, if it will not prevent, their importation. Photography is used to a very large extent for illustrative work in connection with weekly and monthly journals, and, therefore, from the artistic point of view, it would be wrong to impose a tax upon the cameras used by those who are in the trade.
