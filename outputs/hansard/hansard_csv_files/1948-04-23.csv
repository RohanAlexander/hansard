That the House, at its rising, adjourn to this matter with the.Premier ofQueensWednesday next, at 3 p.m. whether it is a fact as alleged yesterday by' the honourable member for Herbert that approximately 250,000 tons of unrefined sugar is held up at Queensland ports? Isi t a fact that manufacturers throughout the Commonwealth areimpeded in their production because of the shortage of sugar, and that housewives are seriously inconvenienced for the samereason? Will the right honourable gentleman tell the House what special actionis being taken by the Government to ensure that sugar awaiting shipment isspeedily loaded and transported to therefineries in the southern States? matter at some length in reply to a question last Wednesday by the honorable member for Cook. I am not aware that as much as 250,000 tons of unrefined sugar is being held up in Queensland ports. I understand that the new season's harvest will commence to come forward at the end of June. I am speaking on information supplied to me by Mr Hanlon, the Premier of Queensland, who, when he spoke to ine a fortnight ago, gave me a statement of the position showing that at that time 130,000 tons of raw sugar was held up at Queensland ports. Apparently, that sugar was held at far northern ports. up at tbe mills. the quantiasof raw sugar waiting to be shipped from northern areas to southern ports. When the industrial trouble in Queensland ceased, as I intimated' to the honourable member for Cook, all ships suitable for the transport of sugarwere already loaded with cargo and these had to be despatched to their destinations and unloaded. The one exception was Ocean Valour, which was sent in ballast to Mackay, but when the vessel arrived' there no berth was available, and it wasalso found that sufficient sugar was not available at Mackay to load the vessel, f t then had to proceed to Cairns, whereeight ships have moved in for the purpose of loading raw sugar.

Eveni f Ocean Valour could have been loaded at Mackay, it could not have been despatched to southern ports before the 4th May. I understand that the loading of vessels at sugar ports takes approximately a fortnight. That information has been supplied to me in documents. I assure the honourable member, as I assured the honourable member for Cook, that everything possible is being done to expedite the transfer of the 130,000 tons of raw sugar now awaiting shipment from Queensland to the refineries-the honourable member for Herbert has suggested that there may be more-so that the storage sheds may be free to take the new crop in the middle of the year. question to the Minister for the Interior. By way of explanation, I remind the honourable gentleman, that during the life of the last Parliament a public meeting of 800 people was held at Tumut to press the claim for a direct road from that town to Canberra. The meeting was attended by Commonwealth and State Ministers and representatives of several adjoining shires. The outcome was a definite promise by the State authorities that a survey of the proposed road would be made from Tumut to the border of the Australian Capital Territory. I should like to know whether the Minister has taken into consideration in his plans for the development of the National Capital the provision of a more direct road from Canberra to Melbourne through Brindabella and Tumut, to link up with the Hume Highway somewhere north of Albury? vernment undertook to confer with the New South Wales authorities in connection with the construction of an all-weather road from Canberra to Jervis Bay. I have already approached the State Government in regard to the date of that conference and I give the honourable member for Hume an undertaking that the proposed road in which he is so greatly interested will also be discussed. Should an amicable agreement be reached in regard to that road, which I consider to be essential, the Commonwealth Government will be prepared to carry out its portion of the work. ister whether it is correct, as suggested by the latest Treasury progress returns, that Commonwealth expenditure for the current year will be met almost completely from revenue, and that a balanced budget is in prospect. If this information is correct, what is the necessity for the large public loans that the Commonwealth is continuing to issue? Is the Commonwealth borrowing in excess of its requirements, and, if so, what is being done with the money so obtained? Is portion of this loan, money being used to fund treasury-bills? If so, what is the value of the treasury-bills so funded? by the honourable member for New England could best' be answered in writing. I point out, however, that the Australian Government does not control the issue of these loans. The loans are raised under the auspices of the Australian Loan Council. The amount and rate of interest, and term of the loans are matters for agreement between the State Premiers and myself as Treasurer, acting on behalf of the Australian Government. It is not fully understood by many honourable members that the business of the Loan Council is not a subject for discussion by this Government at all. We are entitled to put our case to the Council for such loan money as we think is required. The States do the same, and an agreement is reached regarding the amount that it is thought desirable to raise. Loan raising is not discussed even by the Cabinet because it is recognized to be a matter for the Loan Council, of which the six State Premiers and myself are members. The present loan of Â£23,000,000 is primarily for the States, although a part of it is for the CommonWealth. However, so that I shall not take up any more of these precious 35 minutes",12,Sugar

23,Mr Holloway,"I have read theoffers to Australia a splendid opportunity to earn dollars? Has the Government given any consideration to this market in its survey of the dollar situation? If so, what steps have been taken or are proposed to be taken to make use of it, or, if the Government has decided adversely, on what grounds was such a decision made ? Butler. This Government is aware that a market exists in various countries, particularly in the Pacific area, for Australian live-stock, especially dairy stock. However, as the result of the impact of war on the dairying industry in Australia, our herds have been depleted. In addition, there is a very great -demand in all States for first-class dairy stock for land settlement schemes for -ex-servicemen. This Government desires, and I believe I am justified in saying that the State Governments also desire, that our dairy herds shall be increased to the maximum number of the very finest types of cattle as soon as possible. The Government also wants Australia to be in a position to supply the United Kingdom with the maximum possible -quantity of butter. All honourable members are aware of the action that was taken recently to provide a sum of money for the stimulation of dairy production in order to achieve that end. Having regard to these circumstances, action has been taken to limit severely the numbers -of first-class dairy stock, particularly stud matter with the Department of the Navy, stock, that can be made available to any area outside Australia. Dame ENID LYONS I understood that the statement referred not to dairy -stock but to beef cattle. there is not a great demand for stock tralia. In other circumstances, this -other than dairy stock outside Australia question would be directed to the Minisfor breeding purposes. The main demand ter for Commerce and Agriculture, but that has come to the notice of the Departon this occasion I address it to the ment of Commerce and Agriculture, even Prime Minister, because it has a dollar from dollar areas, is for first-class dairy significance rather than an agricultural stock. Action has been taken to permit significance. I have asked a similar the export of beef stock from the question on a number of occasions for Northern Territory in cases where such more than a year. In view of the -exports will not impose a drain on supexpected continuance of the dollar strinplies to the eastern meat works for the gency, and our substantial purchases of purposes of the contract with the United tobacco from the dollar area, does not the Kingdom. ""We are very alive to the fact that the trade, within certain limits, is justified as long as it does not interfere with the United Kingdom contract. We believe that, in the present circumstances, we should severely limit the export of dairy stock and other stock which I think Mr Butler had in mind. the Navy inform me how long the Slazenger Construction Company will continue building vessels for the islands trade at the Phoenix shipyards, Stockton, under contract to the Australian Government? The reason why I ask this question is that on the 1st August, 1944, the Newcastle Council requested the firm to make arrangements to have the shipyards connected with the sewerage system. In November, 1945, the company advised the council that its contracts had finished. However, the company is still using these yards, which are not sewered, and the Newcastle Council has written on three or four occasions to the Department of Munitions and the Department of the Navy asking how long the company proposes to continue operations there. In view of the necessity for protecting the health of the employees, does not the Minister consider that the departments concerned should give some indication of the period that the company will continue to occupy these premises? and inform the honourable member of the exact position.

This week, officers of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture have been attending appraisals in Queensland. I remind the honourable member that the State governments also have a considerable measure of responsibility for the stimulation of tobacco-growing in Australia. my question. thing possible to stimulate tobacco growing, and we hope that beneficial results will accrue from our efforts. The position of all the agricultural industries was most difficult during the war, because of the shortage of labour and materials and other factors, and it is only now that tobacco-growing and other branches of agriculture are returning to normal.

Can the Minister for the Navy give the House any information regarding the arrangements for the exhibition of the film? the honourable member has referred is not a documentary but one which was made by a private company in conjunction with various units of the Navy during naval exercises last year. The film has been viewed by members of the film industry and representatives of the press and has received very favorable comment. Because of the part played by the Royal Australian Navy in the making of the film, the company concerned has offered to give a preview of it to members of the Parliament and their wives at the Capitol Theatre, Canberra, at 9.15 a.m., on the 29th April. the Army inform the House of the results secured to date in the campaign to obtain recruits for the Australian regular army?

If recruiting continues at the present rate, I DAWN. have no doubt that we shall secure the required number in the time expected. FOOD FOR BRITAIN .

Debate resumed from the 22nd April (vide page 1084'), on motion by Dr. That the bill be now read a second time. bill and the Commonwealth Electoral Bill, if passed, will have the effect of increasing substantially the number of members of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The number of voting members in this House will be increased from 74 to 121, and the number of Senators will be increased from 36 to 60. This is the first proposal for a substantial increase of the size of the Parliament since federation in 1901, and has profound implications of a social, economic and constitutional character. No emphatic mention of this matter was made by the Government prior to the last general elections; nor was very much heard of it, if anything, at all, for a considerable time after that. It ranks with the nationalization of the banks as the second great issue introduced by the Government during the life of this Parliament for which no authority was received from the people and of which little was heard before the general elections took place. It is, therefore, proper to ask what are the reasons that have actuated the Government in bringing forward so hurriedly this proposal for a major constitutional change. first few moments of my speech I propose to examine the reasons put forward by the Government through its spokesmen who have already addressed themselves to the bill. Those reasons appear to fall under three heads. First, it is claimed that so great has been the growth of the Australian population since federation that it is reasonable that there should be more [37] members, and other English-speaking countries, notably Great Britain and Canada, are cited as illustrations of Larger national parliaments in relation to population. Secondly, it is argued that the work of members of the Parliament has greatly increased since federation. The third reason was advanced with emphasis last night by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman), who claimed that the issues with which we have to deal to-day are very much more complex than the simple matters, as he put it, presented to the founders of federation. Because the Government's case principally rests on those arguments, it is appropriate that we should examine each of them. I think it will be found that the case made out by the Government rests on a flimsy base. Undoubtedly, the population of Australia has greatly increased since federation, but a mere increase of population is not the proper test of what a member of Parliament has to do. The population has grown substantially, but so have the means, conveniences and amenities that enable us to cope with the increased numbers of people. The men who went to the first Australian Parliament in. Melbourne in 1901 travelled by horse carriage, Cobb's coach, slow trains and slow ships; but the men who come to the Parliament to-day from Perth or the northern parts of Queensland fly to Canberra in a matter of hours. The men of those days had no secretaries to assist them in their tasks, no speedy Buicks in which to drive hither and thither and no greatly expanded public service to examine problems for them and furnish them with the answers. In the first Cabinet there were nine Ministers and in the second and third only eight, whereas to-day the Ministry consists of nineteen men to carry out the weighty tasks that are pressing on them so heavily. But is the test of numbers fair? A cursory examination of the facts will For the show how hollow that claim is. I represent 83,000 or 84,000 people in my electorate of Fawkner, but there is no part of that electorate that I cannot drive to by car within 15 minutes.

If honourable members consider the circumstances of the representative of a rural electorate with a much greater area, they will see that his task is much more arduous than that of men who represent compact metropolitan areas. But will the Government's proposal meet that problem? It will not. The Government does not attempt to suggest that it will.

56,Mr Holt,"Apparently , in the elecI t is a comfortable role, but the Senateflimsy. Whatever test we apply to the allegedly constructive arguments put forward by honourable members opposite in their attempt to justify these proposals, will show how feeble such arguments are. It is said that not merely do these arguments commend themselves to us, but, quoting from statements made by leaders of the Opposition parties, honourable members opposite say that we, ourselves, have already indicated our support for a substantial increase of the membership of the Parliament. There has been no attempt in this debate to hide what has been said by leaders of the Opposition parties in the past or in the printed platforms of the parties to which we belong. But it is again utter and wilful misrepresentation to drag out of the platform of a party one plank which obviously is linked with others, and to ignore the rest, thus showing a distorted picture. The view of the Liberal party is clearly expressed in our platform. We believe that after more than 40 years of federation, a review of the constitutional responsibilities and the functions of the Parliament is required. We have said that in connection with every constitutional proposal that has been advanced in recent years. The platform of the Liberal party states1.

The urgency only developed quate consideration. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies), in his policy speech prior to the last elections, said that if his party were returned to office, it would examine the question of increasing the membership of the Commonwealth Parliament. That, I suggest, is the proper course. The founders of our federation spent years giving careful thought and close consideration to the problems which the drafting of the Constitution involved. Contrast the care with which these statesmen undertook their task with this clumsy, hasty, slipshod proposal which has been suddenly thrown before thi9 Parliament. No attempt has been made to ensure a balanced discussion between representatives of the Commonwealth and the State Parliaments, or to follow through the tremendously important implications of the measures now before us. While twitting members on this side of the chamber with inconsistency, Government supporters have ignored their own policy as set out in the platform of the Labour party. I remind the House that, far from advocating an increase of the membership of the Senate, the platform of the Labour party includes a proposal to abolish the Senate entirely.

""Within a fortnight, the balmy air of approval which had wafted upon the Government during the previous few years, and gathered in strength at the last elections, changed to the icy wind of disapproval. As they felt this blast around their legs, honourable members opposite started scurrying around to see what could be done about it. There had been a lot of talk about a pensions scheme for members of the Commonwealth Parliament; but suddenly the emphasis was changed, because this was a much more serious matter than the provision of pensions for a few members of the party. This issue could, if public opinion continued in the direction indicated by the Victorian elections, result in the annihilation of the Labour party. Certainly, it could result in the annihilation of those Labour senators who were clue to face the electors at the next elections. So, this proposal has been brought forward. The Minister for Information was hailed as the champion of those who favoured an enlarged Parliament, and we read in the press of the discussions that were taking place and of the Calwell faction opposing the Rosevear faction and so on. It was even suggested that so many difficulties had presented themselves, and that the unfairness of this proposal to the smaller States was so manifest that there was strong caucus opposition to it, but when it came to a vote in the party room, what was the real issue that carried the day? In the first place, there were eighteen Labour senators who would have to go to the polls at the next elections, and, on past experience, if public opinion continued to run against the Government, not one of them would be returned. once in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament. elections to all but three Opposition senators, and it could happen at the next elections, as the honourable senators concerned are well aware, to all of them. By introducing a system of proportional representation a miraculous change of fortune for 111o Labour party could be achieved overnight, because, assuming that the retiring Labour senators received the endorsement of their partyI have yet to learn of any course of conduct which can disqualify a Labour candidate for selection-wit h seven vacancies to be filled in each State, not one of them could fail to be returned. So, the Minister for Information had eighteen votes "" in the bag ""' for a start. In addition, there were fifteen other senator& who knew that with proportional representation, they would not have to worry about a pension scheme, because they would have an annuity for life in the Senate of this country. For that reason,a substantial proportion of caucus was prepared to vote for this proposal. Then, of course, there were members like the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) and the honourable member for Martin( Mr Daly) who held "" d i c k y "" seats. I invite any one of them to deny that he voted for this proposal. They could see security instead of uncertainty, or, in some cases, sure defeat. I say with full conviction that the inspiration for this legislation was not statesmanship, but self-preservation and security. mental instinct of all, and it operated strongly in this instance. The Government's proposals constitute an insurance policy for a caucus already fearful of the wrath to be directed against it in 1949. seems to be annoyed. annoyed as disgusted. I have some regard for the significance of this Parliament, which should deserve the respect of the people. If the Government had been honest, it would have gone to the people and said: "" This Parliament has been functioning for nearly 50 years, and the Constitution has remained substantially unaltered for that period. Let us have a thorough examination of the Constitution, not on a party basis, but by a body of men representing the States as well as the Commonwealth. Let it examine constitutional problems in a detached manner, and then we will submit legislation embodying its recommendations"".

66,Mr Holt,"I am not so muchparticularly the Senate. I do not say that the Government wishes to sabotage the House of Representatives, but I do say that it is attempting wilfully to sabotage the Senate. Everybody knows that one of the planks of the Labour party provides for the abolition of the Senate, and the Government is aware that no more effective short cut to that end could be devised, apart from an alteration of the Constitution, than to make the Senate ridiculous by so filling it with unwanted additional members that the public will become thoroughly disgusted at the unnecessary expenditure and the utter uselessness of the chamber so constituted. If the Government had wished to meet the constitutional position properly it would have brought forward a proposal for the amendment of section 24 of the Constitution. It knows perfectly well that we cannot go on indefinitely maintaining the Senate at half the strength of the House of Representatives. Because the founders of the Constitution were considering their own immediate problems, a provision was inserted to the effect that the number of senators should be as nearly as possible half the number of members of the House of Representatives. There is no reason why the Government should not have put forward a proposal for the amendment of this provision. It cannot argue that it wished to save expense, because a referendum is being taken in any case, and it would have been easy to include a provision to limit the size of the Senate. The Government has thrown to its own supporters in caucus the sop of political security for some years to come. Further, it hopes that the public outcry against an enlarged Senate will eventually lead to the abolition of that chamber. I come now to the proposals of the Government for increasing the number of members in the House of Representatives to approximately 121. The effect of such an increase will undoubtedly be to make a lop-sided parliament even more lopsided. It will enhance the importance of the role already played in the life of the Parliament by the State of New South Wales which, by all accounts, and in the view of all impartial observers, is a most unstable and volatile influence on the political life of the country. It is no the Government thus voted into power. Mr Holt. answer to say that the proportion of members from New South Wales, as compared with other States, will remain more or less the same. There will be just that many more persons in the House to bring pressure to bear in order to dominate the political future of Australia. There will be 80 representatives from New South Wales and Victoria alone, and we can visualize the effect which such a preponderance of strength will have upon future policy, particularly when effect is given to the Labour party's policy of one vote, one value, as enunciated by two senior Ministers during the course of this debate. This can only result in increasing the political strength of the industrialized urban districts at the expense of country areas. All parties have for years advocated the decentralization of population and industries so that rural areas would obtain a greater share of each. We are all agreed that the amenities of country life should be improved so that more people will be induced to live in the country, but the Government, far from increasing the importance, and protecting the rights, of country areas, will by this legislation deal another heavy blow to country interests. There can be no doubt that the political strength of metropolitan industrialized areas will be proportionally increased under the new arrangement. The proposals to the Government include the adoption of a system of proportional representation for the Senate, a system which has earned the commendation of speakers from both sides of the House. It is undoubtedly attractive when we remember how, in the past, one party has enjoyed an overwhelming preponderance of representation in tbe Senate. However, what we are proposing to do, we should do with our eyes open, and the fact is that we are proposing to introduce a profound constitutional change. In the past, when one party has had an overwhelming majority in the Senate it was because, in the previous election, the public had given overwhelming support to that party. It may be assumed, therefore, that they would not favour interference by the Senate with the legislative programme of [Quorum formed.] In the future, however, no matter how strong may be the support given to a political party in the House of Representatives, the operation of proportional representation may result in the election of a powerful opposition in the Senate. Indeed, in the forthcoming election in 1.949, the result could very well be that the present Opposition parties would gain an overwhelming electoral victory, only to have their policy frustrated by a Labour majority in the Senate. I do not want to elaborate that point, because, to honourable members with some knowledge of constitutional effects, it is already sufficiently clear. We are making a major constitutional change; we are bringing into the councils of the parties, whether they form the Opposition or the Government, a very much stronger voice from the Senate. That, too, has its Constitutional reactions. It will make in the main for a more conservative policy, which may or may not be a bad thing. That is the sort of issue I was stressing earlier when I said that there are profound implications in what we are doing. It is monstrous that the Government should rush through a major change of this kind, when only through the cave and thought given by those who framed the Constitution has that instrument stood up to the tests that have been imposed upon it since federation. This is not a. plan brought forward for the betterment machine; it is a scheme brought forward by the Government for its own preservation and for the preservation of individual Labour members. In the words of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr member and other honourable members Menzies), this proposal is a political racket and the people will not stand for it. For the second time since this Government was elected a great issue, which was soft-pedalled at the time of the elections, has been brought before the Parliament directly against the will of the people. The people were overwhelmingly opposed to the Government on the banking issue, and on this issue, too, a very strong majority of the people oppose the increase of the number of the members of the Parliament in this way. The Government claims to be democratic. The Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) beats his chest ait the council tables of the world and talks about the high principles for which his Government and this country stand, yet, in defiance of every democratic principle which the people of this country have always upheld, two great issues are forced through this Parliament. What the people want is not more government by more members, but less government by the same number of members as we have now. One reason why the Government advocates an increase of the number of members in the Parliament is that during and since the war it has grabbed functions, powers and responsibilities which could more conveniently and properly be exercised by the States. Having grabbed these powers, the Government is determined to hang on to them, and because of that it has had to enlarge its ministerial machine. There arc now nineteen Ministers by comparison with eight at federation, and 123,000 members of the Commonwealth Public Service as compared with 68,000 before the war. The people do not want more government from Canberra; they want the States to carry out their proper responsibilities. This issue should be deferred at least until the people of Australia have had an opportunity to vote upon it. Repatriation) [11.48] -A t the outset I of the parliamentary propose to make one or two observations on the speech delivered by the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt). One cannot help deprecating the characterization of this proposal by the honourable opposite, and, indeed, by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) himself, as a racket. Whatever may be said by honourable members opposite, the people and the press of Australia have expressed very definite views on electoral reform. They are of the opinion that the Parliament should be enlarged and that it should accept greater responsibilities. The answer to the assertion of the honourable member for Fawkner that the people want less government from Canberra is furnished by the results of the recent referendum at which the people authorized the Commonwealth to exercise",23,Evatt

The honourable member for Fawkner said that a constitutional convention was advocated by the Liberal party to consider desirable alteraing day in the Sydney Morning Herald tions to the Constitution and the means by which they should be given effect. Let us consider what happened in the not distant past in relation to a certain proposal for the alteration of the Constitution. parties in this Parliament and of State governments and-opposition parties met in 'Canberra to consider a plan for the transference of certain powers from the States to the Commonwealth for a limited period. Agreement was reached that certain powers should be so transferred. When, however, the proposals were placed before the people at a referendum, Opposition members, including the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron), stumped the country opposing the very things that were agreed to by their leaders. ment does not administer the powers it now possesses. Why increase them? duty of the Opposition to oppose the Government-and it performs a very useful function when it draws attention to defects in the Government's legislationI do not believe that the honourable member for Fawkner has his heart in his opposition to this proposal. We have on record the statement made by the Leader of the Opposition in his policy speech during the last election campaign that the question of increasing the size of the Parliament would be examined by the Liberal party if it were elected to power. the House of Representatives must be, The assertion that this Government has no authority from the people to proceed with legislation for enlargement of the with the Parliament because the subject was not included in the Prime Minister's policy speech is not correct. The fact is that the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) made a perfectly clear statement on the subject only three or four days before polling day. He saidIf the Labour Government is returned at so Saturday's elections, it will consider an increase in the size of the Federal Parliament after the next year's census. That was an unambiguous statement of the policy that would be pursued by the Labour party during the life of this Parliament if it were returned to power. It was published three days before pollat any rate. Nevertheless, honourable members opposite say to the Government, "" You have no mandate for this legislation; you did not make any statement about it to the people; it was not Representatives of all part of your policy at the last elections "". might be like the Prime Minister, who apparently never reads the newspapers. honourable member in that category because, judging by quotations which he makes from newspapers in this House from time to time, he reads the press very closely. what he reads, though. the injustice of saying .that, because I have some respect for the honourable gentleman. The members of at least one faction of the Opposition said that an enlargement of the Parliament would be considered if they were elected with a majority. According to their policy, they agree that the Parliament should be expanded. Their complaint now seems to be that the Senate should not be enlarged although they concede that the numerical strength of the House of Representatives should be increased. They should know that, under the Constitution, if one House of this Parliament is enlarged the other House also must be enlarged. The Constitution provides that as nearly as practicable, twice the size of the Senate. There can be no doubt on",25,Evatt

Honourable members opposite are also critical of the proposal to alter the system of election of senators. For a quarter of a century the present method of electing senators has been the subject of very severe criticism hy all sections of the community. The system has been condemned after every election because it tends to give to the popular political party of the day a complete monopoly of seats in the Senate without providing for representation of the minority. Nobody could argue honestly that such a system should be encouraged or even tolerated in a democracy. I agree with what the honourable member for Barker said on this point last night-that proportional representation is the only system appropriate to a democratic country. Minister carry that to its logical conclusion and apply the system to the House of Representatives? to its logical conclusion. In future, all senators will be elected according to the proportional representation system. However, I do not agree with the honourable member's suggestion that we ought to establish some bogus reason for a double dissolution of this Parliament by sending to the Senate a bill that it must reject. that. inference to be drawn from what the honourable member said. bute such a suggestion to me. attributing anything to the honourable member. The logical conclusion of the honourable member's argument is that this House should submit some bogus proposal to the Senate, have it rejected by that House, and force a double dissolution of the Parliament. that. could a double dissolution be brought about? there could not be a double dissolution. There is only one way of causing a double dissolution under the Constitution, and the necessary conditions do not apply in this Parliament. honourable member's point of view. I shall develop the argument along another line. has the whole Sahara Desert before him,but he cannot find a place to land, will find a. good place to land as far as this bill is concerned. It will be passed by the Parliament and, in future, we shall have a democratic system of election for the Senate, providing for representation of the minority as well as the majority of the electors. Honourable members opposite have complained because senators who were elected at the last general elections will be allowed to continue as members of the Senate until the period for which they were elected expires. It would be grossly unfair to manufacture some means of dissolving the Senate merely because we had decided that the old system must be discontinued on account of its anomalies and inequities. HadI been elected to the Senate at the 1946 elections I should be very resentful of any scheme to throw me out merely because the government of the say day, and the Parliament, decided that a new system of election should be introduced. Such a course of action would be most improper. To suggest, as honourable members opposite have done, that the Government has framed some sinister scheme in order to preserve a majority for itself in the Senate is most unfair. Such untrue accusations should not be made. Honourable members opposite should give just as much credit to the Government for honesty of purpose in this matter as they claim for themselves. In all this "" looking into the bowl "" I detect a reason for the Opposition's concern about the proposal quite different from the one that has been stated.

Their respective policies conflict in many respects, and I suspect that the enlargement of the Parliament will bring into the House certain elements which will not please honourable members opposite. That has already been suggested in some sections of the pres9 and seems to be one of the reasons why the Opposition is opposing the bill so vigorously. I now desire to refer to the position of the less populous States. AlthoughI represent a constituency in one of them, I am not opposing this bill. Indeed, I vigorously support the measure in this chamber, as I did elsewhere, because I believe that the enlargement of the Parliament is proper after nearly 50 years' experience of federation. At present, the Parliament is too small to perform the functions for which it was originally constituted, and to deal with the ever increasing volume of business. The honourable member for Barker will recall that when he and I became members of this House in 1934, the Commonwealth budget was about Â£60,000,000. Â£80,000,000. not reach the figure of Â£100,000,000 until some years later. year the Commonwealth budget is approximately Â£4S0,000,000. but the fact remains that the Commonwealth budget has reached those proportions. Without attempting to fill the role of prophet, I suggest that the budget is never likely to be reduced to anything like its pre-war proportions. History will repeat itself in this as it has in other matters. After World WarI . , the responsibilities of the Commonwealth increased rather than diminished, and now, after World War II . , they will continue to increase. In addition, the responsibilities of honourable members will continue to grow, and the population of Australia will increase. That presupposes increased responsibilities. The decentralization of industry and the settlement of population will proceed, and, in many ways, the responsibilities of this Parliament must inevitably be greater than they were years ago. For that reason alone, the action of the Government in introducing this bill is justified. I return to the subject of the less populous States. Tasmania has only five members in the House of Representatives, and the Leader of the Opposition considered that it was worthwhile making some observations about this matter. The Launceston Examiner, of the loth April last, published the following news item:If Tasmania's representation is to remain at five members in the enlarged House of Representatives of 133 members, its representation will become quite insignificant, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) said last night. Tasmania, he said, therefore had a special interest in the proposed redistribution of Federal seats and the enlarged Parliament. Wheni t was suggested that Tasmania would have ten senators, Mr Menzies replied, "" That will not be much consolation to them. It seems curious to have five in the Lower House and ten in the Senate"". Mr Menzies said the Government could easily increase the representation of Tasmania in the Lower House. This would mean smaller electorates in proportion but it could be done. He said the views expressed by the Tasmanian Liberal party opposing a larger Parliament were not inconsistent with the joint statement made recently by himself and the Leader of the Australian Country party, Mr Fadden. He 1939. indicated that the bill for the enlargement of Parliament would come in for stringent opposition and criticism. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition .did not mention that, in his own policy speech before the last general elections, he stated that, if returned to office, he would consider the enlargement of the Commonwealth Parliament. However, that is not the particular point which I desire to mention now. The right honourable gentleman saidThe Government could easily increase the representation of Tasmania in the Lower House. He knows perfectly well that it cannot be increased without an alteration of the Constitution. the Constitution states that a State shall have at least five members and there is nothing to prevent it from having more than five.",27,Evatt

I am advised by an eminent constitutional lawyer ""Maxie"" Falstein? this discussion, I do not need to mention his name. I am advised that the representation of Tasmania in this House could not be increased because of the provisions of the Constitution. the Minister did not pay for that advice. the position or not, we cannot justify an increase of the representation of that State in this House. Each Tasmanian electorate for the House of Representatives has slightly fewer than 32,000 voters. When this bill becomes law, Commonwealth electorates generally will have approximately 45,000 voters. We could not justify Tasmanian electorates having only, say, 25,000 voters when electorates on .the mainland have 45,000 voters.. The Leader of the Opposition was "" beating the air"", and playing to the gallery on this matter. He was not so concerned for the rights of Tasmania when he had an opportunity to do something practical. Between the 26th April, .1939, and the 29th May, 1941, the right honourable gentleman formed two Ministries, but not one of them included a representative of Tasmania. The Fadden Government, which held office from the 29th August, 1941 till the 7th October, of that year, also omitted a representative of that State. The Leader of the Opposition made the statement, which I have read, for public consumption in Tasmania, because he thought that it would attract support. Presumably, he disregards consistency, and does not mind what he said yesterday. What does matter to him is what he says to-day. But the fact remains that when he had the opportunity to give Tasmania representation in the governments which he led he refrained from doing so. I remind the not House that the Leader of the Liberal party and the Leader of the Australian Country party select the members of their Cabinets. which the Minister referred, the Australian Country party did not have a Tasmanian representative. matter. The important fact is that Tasmania did not have a representative in any of those Cabinets. Contrast that with the treatment which Labour governments have always given to the less populous States. The present Government includes two representatives of Western Australia, and that State has been represented in the Cabinet by two members ever since the Curtin Government took office in 1941. It is true that South Australia has only one representative in the Government, but Tasmania has two, and this is not the first Labour administration which has included two representatives from the smallest State. The electors of Tasmania can rest assured that while Labour continues in office they will still have a voice in the Government because the Australian Labour party has always recognized the right of all Statesto be represented in the Cabinet. OF course, when the proposed increase of the number of representatives of other Statesis effected, Tasmania will still have only five representatives in this House, and' it may be contended that because of.' the change that State will not continue to enjoy the same proportion of Cabinet representation. However, I remind honourable members that following the last general elections a representative of Tasmania, which is the smallest State, prevailed over a representative of New South Wales when a selection of members to form the Government was made. In saying that I do not feel that I am divulging confidential information because it is almost common knowledge. When Labour candidates obtain a majority of seats at elections, the people know that the members of the new Government will be selected by exhaustive ballot from members of the party, which",28,Evatt

103,Cameron,"Was it Mr BARNARD That does notis a democratic method. The Commonwealth of Australia is a federation comprising the several States all of which have a moral right to be represented in the Government. The Australian Labour party believes in the electoral principle of one value for one vote, and it is convinced that the needs of Australia can best be served by a Parliament elected on that basis. So far as is were right "" of the beam "" because it is possible Labour seeks to cater adequately for the needs of the less populous States, but it keeps in mind all the time that in a democracy no State is entitled to more seats than the numerical strength of its electors justifies. I am satisfied that the Government's proposals are right in principle, and wise in conception, and are founded on a sound practical basis. The honourable member for Fawkner referred to the ""rigging"" of electoral boundaries. endeavoured to convey to the people the idea that the Government is not doing the honest thing. However, the simple fact is that electoral boundaries cannot be "" rigged "". The Commonwealth Electoral Act, prescribes that recommendations for alteration of electoral boundaries shall be made by the electoral commissioners in each State. After presentation to the Government, their reports are laid on the table of the House so that the Parliament is afforded an opportunity to consider them. Members of tlie Parliament, who possess a greater practical knowledge of individual electorates than do electoral commissioners, have the opportunity to criticize those recommendations, and to decide whether they should be accepted or returned to the commissioners for further examination. Honourable members are aware that maps of the constituencies are exhibited in Parliament House and displayed m places where the public can examine them, so that any one who has any objection to offer may make his objection known. For that reason the allegation that boundaries can be "" rigged"" is just so much nonsense, intended to tickle the ears oi the public. The size of the electorates will immediately be reduced if the Government's proposals are adopted. Jlfr. Archie Cameron interjecting, Mr Barnard. speech made by the honourable member for Barker last night, and I heard him assert that the Government would attempt to secure some tactical advantage by increasing the size of some electorates and reducing that of others. He mentioned the electorate of Kalgoorlie as one which would be altered. However, his remarks a matter of mathematical certainty that when the boundaries are reviewed the size of all electorates will be reduced. From my own point of view I should not mind if the boundaries of the electorate of Bass, which I represent, were reduced. Compared with Kalgoorlie .or Barker, it is a mere pocket handkerchief in size, but compared, to Fawkner it covers a. substantial area. I cannot go over my electorate in a tram in fifteen By that innuendo, he minutes, nor, indeed, can I "" cover"" it in fifteen days. It is a matter of sheer impossibility to secure anything in the nature of uniformity of size between city and country electorates, and in any readjustment of electoral boundaries it is inevitable that country electorates will cover much more territory than metropolitan districts. We must remember that large numbers of people are concentrated in extremely small areas in the cities.' The electorate of Dalley, which is represented by Mr Speaker, is probably the smallest in Australia. The honourable member for Denison (Dr. Gaha) also has a small electorate, but the electorate of the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) embraces almost all the centre of Tasmania, and it takes him days to travel through it. However, those are mere accidents of fortune, and very little, if anything, can be done to rectify such inequalities. That being so, I deprecate the suggestions made by honourable members opposite that the Government is actuated by sinister motives in introducing the present proposals. I believe that when these measures are properly understood they will be favourably received by the press and the public, and that honourable members on both sides of the House will realize the great advantage which they are designed to confer on the community. Although members of Parliament have at their disposal to-day much more rapid",29,Evatt
104,Mr Barnard,"I listened to themeans of transportation to "" cover "" their electorates than did the parliamentaryrepresentatives of a generation ago, the fact remains that the demands upon them Constituents have a right to the ear of their parliamentary representative and they should have first call on his time. However, because of the size of the present electorates it is quite impracticable for many people to interview their parliamentary representatives. It has been suggested that Tasmania will not be adequately represented if the size of the Parliament is increased in accordance with this proposal. There will, however, be four more Tasmanian senators and, therefore, four extra voices speaking for that State in one of the Houses of the Parliament and in the party rooms. It is true that Tasmania will have only five members in the House of Representatives, but the view of constitutional experts is that that position cannot be avoided at present In any case, taking a realistic view of the matter, that number can be increased only when the population is sufficient to warrant it. What may be regarded as an anomaly to-day can be corrected when the population of the State has increased considerably, as I am confident that it will, in view of the industrial expansion that is now taking place there. I support wholeheartedly the two measures now under discussion. -Unlik e the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Barnard), I oppose the proposal contained in the two bills now under discussion. At the same time, I concede that there is some justification for a re-organization of electorates in relation to the House of Representatives, designed to improve the representation that it is possible to give under the present system. This problem is not one that can be solved properly by a decision taken at a short meeting of the members of one political party. Many factors have a bearing upon it, and they must all be considered before an equitable solution can be found. Prom the evidence before us, it is evident that the Government has considered only one of the many factors involved in this matter, namely, the increase of population that has taken place since the present system was evolved. I admit that that is an important factor, but it is not the only one and does not of itself justify this proare much greater to-day. .posal for an increase of the number of seats in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Government has made a deduction from a cursory examination of only one factor, and I say that deduction is unsound. Under the present system, there are a number of small and compact city electorates, and the task of representing them is relatively light. The member can easily walk round the whole of his electorate in one day, and his constituents can, by the expenditure of a few pence, attend at a central office to submit their problems. The social requirements of the member can be easily attended to from the comfort of his own home. In those circumstances, 60,000 or 70,000 electors can be effectively and efficiently represented by one man, particularly when secretarial assistance is provided. If need be, that assistance could be increased at a small cost. In such a case, the increase of population is not an effective argument for the enormous expenditure that this proposal will entail. By no stretch of the imagination can the increase of population be used as an argument in favour of an increase of the size of the Senate. The Senate is primarily a house of review, and has a special duty to safeguard State rights. Its function is such that senators are not required to undertake detailed representation of electors in their States. I contend, therefore, that an increase of the present number of senators is entirely unnecessary. The Senate as now constituted should be able satisfactorily to perform the special functions required of it. It cannot be contended that an increase of population alone is an argument in favour of a proposal of the scope and extent of that which we are now discussing. At the commencement of my remarks I conceded that some increase was necessary. That statement was based upon a consideration of all the factors involved in this problem. I shall refer briefly to some of them in support of my contention that some increase is necessary and to explain what I think should be the extent of that increase. The first factor",30,Evatt
105,Mr Davidson (Capricornia) [12.26].,"is the increase of the size of the populathe equal representation of all sections tion. The second is the size of some electorates. I referred to that in dealing with the small city electorates and pointed out that the increase of population does not warrant a reduction of their size. The position is vastly different in country electorates, some of which are so large as to prevent the member from having that close personal contact with electors in all parts of his coning the membership of the Senate. So the stituency that is so essential to efficient Government has said, "" All right, irrerepresentation. The close contact that is possible in the small city electorates but not in the large country electorates is, I believe, very important, because it is the only means by which a member can be kept constantly informed of the various movements in his electorate. At present the electors in small city electorates have words, costs have been disregarded. an advantage over those in large country districts, because they enjoy such contact with their members. It follows, therefore, that the representation of the large country electorates could, with advantage to the whole of the community, be increased. The third factor is bound up with the second. It is the proper representation of the productive capacity of the nation, which relates principally to economy in all branches of public adminprimary production and is centred in the large country electorates, which have not the same degree of representation as have city electorates. It is unassailable that production generally, but, particularly primary production, should have effective representation in this Parliament-representation at least equal to that of the other sections of the community, which are not directly connected with production, but only handle the products or live by virtue of them. Therefore, the present system, with its large, sparsely populated rural electorates, which produce the greatest part of the wealth of Australia, is a serious impediment to proper representation, and something should be done to improve it. The proposal to alter the system of representation presents the opportunity for that improvement. That does not mean that I endorse the fancy schemes that depart from the basic principle of one man, one vote that one hears about from time to time; but I believe after due consideration that it would be possible to alter the matter to the people. The Constitution present system slightly in order to ensure Mr Davidson. and that the time has arrived when it should be done. It seems that no consideration has been given by the Government to the cost factor. Obviously, it9 main intention is to increase the number of representatives in this House. As the Constitution stands, that can be done only by increasspective of the need for an increase of the membership of the Senate and of the added cost that that will entail, we will increase the number of members in the Senate so that we'shall achieve our objective of increasing the membership of the House of Representatives "". In other The proposal means the further crowding of two already overcrowded chambers, the provision of more office space and accommodation in Canberra, together with additional secretaries and other officers. All that will cost a considerable sum of money, the expenditure of which is not justifiable in the face of the crying need for istration. The cost entailed in the increase of the membership of the Senate seems to be entirely a squandering of public money and is not justified. The proposed increase of the membership of the House of Representatives is on a far greater scale than I consider necessary and the cost is not fully justified. The quota system by which the number of seats in the House of Representatives is determined also bears on the problem. The Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Barnard) and other honourable members said that the method prescribed by the Constitution must be adopted in the redistribution of seats. The Government has not hesitated to consult the people by way of referendum when it has considered an alteration of the Constitution necessary. If it is thought that the quota system cannot be departed from without an alteration of the Constitution, the difficulty could be easily overcome by referring the lays down that a quota shall be determined by dividing the total population of Australia by twice tbe number of structions to take into account all the senators. The number of members to be factors bearing on it, not just the"" one -chosen in each State is determined by factor of an increase of population. When dividing the number of people of the State the commission has reported back to the by the quota. That gives the number of Parliament, it9 proposals should he subseats in each State. The quota is also mitted to the people by way of a referenresponsible for the determination of the dum. That is the only democratic way in boundaries of the various electoral diviwhich the problem can be tackled adesions, because the boundaries must be quately. so drawn as to embrace within them the number of electors determined for which have some bearing on this problem. each electorate by the method to which In determining the course of action I have referred. Obviously,as long as which should be followed, the following that system prevails, we must have a condeductions can reasonably be drawn from tinuance of the state of affairs under them: First, the increase of population which we have in closely settled areas which has taken place since federation tiny electorates, with little productive justifies some increase of the number of capacity, whose representatives are in membei-s of the House of Representatives, close touch with the people and, side by but does not justify any increase whatsoside with them, large country electorates ever of the number of senators; secondly, which produce most of the wealth of the many country electorates should be nation but are difficult to represent reduced in area in order to provide more effectively.

The final factor to be considered is what the people of Australia think about except by way of an all-round adjustment the proposal before, the House and the of all the electorates throughout Ausproblem of redistribution. A principle tralia; and, finally, that the electors that has long been regarded as cardinal themselves are entitled to be heard on in the practice of democracy is that the these proposals. The solution which people, not the Parliament, shall have the flows logically from those deductions is right to determine how and by whom they that there should be established a conshall be governed. That principle is stitutional convention to consider all the involved in this proposal because it factors involved. That body should reaffects the determination of the electorates port, to the Parliament and its recomand the number of representatives in the mendations should ultimately be referred Parliament. The present system, which to the people at a referendum. By that has been in. operation for many years, was means we could re-adjust the present sysdetermined originally by the Federal Contem on sound logical grounds, and the revention.

It \ was decided at the conference that the St.ite\ immigration authorities would advise my department where their need of certain occupational categories of British migrants was urgent. My department is still awaiting replies '.from most of the States. During ray visit overseas last year, my colleague, Senator Armstrong, then the Minister for Munitions, who acted as Minister for Immigration in my .absence, replied on my behalf to correspondence from, the Graziers Federal Council of Australia and other affiliated bodies, which made representations for priority of travel to be accorded to rural workers under the migration schemes. A full explanation of the prescribed procedure in operation between the Commonwealth and the States, which receive nominations in the first instance, was forwarded to the Graziers Federal Council, and a letter of appreciation was received from that organization. The council was informed that whilst the questions of introduction of numbers of rural workers, and the .priority of shipment to be accorded them, were primarily mutters for consideration by the State immigration authorities in each State my department would assist in every way possible in facilitating passages for nominees recommended for high priority by the State immigration authorities. The honourable member may also be aware that I have recently agreed to the allocation of 1,000 displaced persons, who are being brought to Australia under an agreement with the' Preparatory Commission for the International Refugee Organization, for employment in the sugar industry in Queensland and New South Wales to assist in harvesting the valuable 1D4S sugar crop. In addition, I have undertaken to facilitate the entry into Australia, of 500 northern Italians for employment in that industry. These Italians will, of course, have to be nominated by residents of Australia who are suitable guarantors and in a position to maintain and accept responsibility for the accommodation of these nominees. No government financial assistance will be given to these Italian settlers. The thousand displaced persons who are to commence employment in the sugar-cane harvest are at present en route to Australia in two vessels, the first of which, the General Black, will arrive in Melbourne on or about the 26th April. After a short course of instruction in rudimentary English, in Australian currency, weights and measures, and the Australian way of life generally, at my department of immigration reception and training centre, Bonegilla, they will commence moving to their new employment on or about the 14th May, at the rate of 50 or 60 per day. The second vessel, the General Sturgis, carrying the balance of these people is due in Australia on the 12th May. The cane cutters on this vessel will commence to move to their employment about the middle of June. In replying to the honourable member's question, which particularly relates to Queensland, I do not want to convey the impression that it is the only State in which assistance has been given to rural industries. Bach State haa received its share of immigrants and displaced persons have been allocated to those industries, including rural industries, in most urgent need. Examples of the rural industries in other States which have already received valuable help are the fruit-growing industries in Tasmania, Victoria, and South Australia, and the timber industries in New South Wales and Western Australia. Immigration, upon noticeIsi t correct, as stated in a report from Melbourne, that two deserters from the Dutch ship Muiderkerk, who were fined for desertion in Melbourne City Court yesterday, .produced certificates from the Immigration Department entitling them to reside in Australia for three months? Isi t the policy of the department to issue such certificates to foreigners who have broken tbe Australian, as well as their own, laws by deserting their vessels? Does not the Minister consider that the issue of such certificates is an encouragement to deserters? honourable member's questions are as follows:On the 16th April, the honourable member for Flinders asked whether two deserters from the Dutch ship Muiderkerk had been granted certificates allowing them to reside in Australia for three months and whether it was tbe policy of the Immigration Department to issue Buch certificates to foreign deserters. I then pointed out that until recently it has not been the practice to take punitive action under the Immigration Act in respect of seamen of European race who deserted overseas ships. Such' action was not considered necessary as deserters could be prosecuted under the Navigation Act, the number of desertions was not sufficient to impede the movements of ships and generally it was found that the men signed on other ships after a stay here. It was the practice in such cases to place the men under exemption to ensure that action could be taken to enforce their departure if they came under adverse notice. Recently, the number of desertions has increased to an extent that shipowners, both British and foreign, have become apprehensive as to their ability to keep their ships moving and if desertions continue at the present rate it may have a serious' effect on our overseas trade and the flow of migrants to this country. I therefore issued instructions recently that all deserters from overseas ships were to be prosecuted under the Immigration Act us prohibited immigrants. It is expected that this action will prove an effective deterrent and will greatly reduce the existing rate of desertions.",34,Immigration Rural Workers Deserters From Dutch Ship
