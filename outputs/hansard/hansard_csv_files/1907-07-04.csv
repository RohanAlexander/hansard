I submit that even if the Government. were agreeable and the House consented to the further postponement of the Orders of the Day, it would not ""be possible to proceed with the election of Chairman, because the motion of the Treasurer merely asked for the suspension of the Standing Orders sufficiently to allow of a Supply Bill being passed through all its stages without delay.

In my opinion we can appoint a temporary Chairman of Committees at any time. present time is that there is nothing whatever before the House. which notice had been given have all been disposed of.

I would therefore urge the Treasurer to eliminate the item. think that the deputy leader of the Opposition has quite appreciated the position with regard to sums that ought to be paid, apart altogether from the ordinary recurring monthly expenditure. He has asked the Treasurer to omit the item of £ 8 0 , 0 0 0 in respect of the Treasurer's Advance. I had the misfortune, or otherwise, to be in office in the month of July a year or two ago, and I know that it is absolutely essential that the Treasury should have some money in hand to meet payments in respect of work which might have been completed in June, although not passed by the inspectors until some time in July. member secure a vote of this kind when he was in office? difficulty in regard to it .

I do not think that the honourable member for Parramatta desires anything of the kind, and I am sure that when he considers the position, he will no longer offer any objection to an advanceI do not know how much is required-bein g made to the Treasurer.

But it sometimes happens that big claims f a l l due after the close of the financial year, and it is, therefore, necessary for the Treasurer to have something to go upon. surer) [3.10] I hope that the deputy leader of the Opposition will not object to the item of ""Treasurer's Advance."" I find that we have always asked for something like the amount which we now invite honourable members to agree to. In 1903-4, the Treasurer's advance was £ 7 5 , 0 0 0 . On the 2nd July, 1904, £ 1 2 6 , 0 0 0 was passed; on the 8th July, 1905, £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 was passed ; and on 28th June, 1906, £ 8 0 , 0 0 0 . It will thus be seen that we are asking for £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 less than was granted in respect of Treasurer's advance in July 1904. As I have already mentioned, various contractors have to be paid, and men working on day labour all over Australia are anxious to obtain what is coming to them. There are various unforeseen expenses that may have to be met, and I think that the Committee may trust the Treasurer, as it has done hitherto, with this vote of £80,000.

We are told by the Government that owing to the last session being entirely a formal one, the same mover and seconder of the Address-in-Reply have been selected on the present occasion in the Senate and the same mover in this House as when we last met. Of course, we must accept the explanation for what it is worth; but I take leave to say that it is a case of "" needs must when the devil drives."" rate so far as the Senate is concerned it is well known that the Government had no one in the Chamber on whom they could rely, and they had to appeal to a gentle man to come to their rescue, who at the last election was in direct opposition to the -Government and all its works. The present position probably discloses why that selection was made in the Senate, and why the same selection, so far as the mover is concerned, has been made in this House. This reminds me of the generally anomalous position in which the House finds itself. After an appeal to the country there is, I should say, a huge majority in the House opposed to Socialism as a national policy. But that fact notwithstanding, our honourable friends in the corner are still directing the policy of the Government, and are still the arbiters of political matters in this Chamber. In my judgment, the sooner that is ended the better. in the Government programme? gether what is in the programme. Honourable members know that during the currency of the last Parliament most of the legislation which was termed socialistic was never contained in any programme brought forward in the House between the time of the meeting and the close of the Parliament. Indeed, honourable members have given several notices of motion to-day which indicate the trend of events which we may expect in the course of this Parliament. We may be very sure that before the close of this session our honourable friends in the corner will take good care that, although there is not very much of Socialism in the programme of the Government, the time of the House will be taken up by the consideration of some proposals which may be fairly termed socialisticI mean, of course, in the conventional sense of the word. I admit freely that the decision at the last election was, so far as practical legislation in this House is concerned, that preference was to be given to protection over that much greater question -in my judgment, at any rate-of sound constitutional government for Australia. I bow to that decision; any public man must bow to the decision of the electors, no matter how much he may disagree with it. As to the mover of the Address-inReply, I only desire to say that the honourable member for Gippsland delivered a A t any speech to which, so far as I know, no exception can be taken, beyond, perhaps, the little lecturette he felt called upon to deliver as to the preservation of those allegedly musty old forms such as we are observing at the present moment. privilege of voung members. I should not have mentioned the matter had this been the first and not the second essay of the honourable member for Gippsland. As the honourable member for Gippsland spoke it struck me that I had heard, or read the language before in one of the morning journals of this State. I have no doubt that the honourable member, out of sheer gratitude, repeated, almost after the manner of a phonograph, statements made in a newspaper which had contributed so much to assist him to displace a man of the highest character, and certainly one of the best statesmen this country has ever produced. It is not altoParramatta did not say that when the Tariff was before the House. glad to be reminded by that interjection : it enables me to point out that the late member for Gippsland has not been replaced by a better protectionist; I think I am perfectly safe in saying that, and the sequel will prove it. Parramatta will get his "" Waterloo"" if he lives long enough. shall all get our "" W a t e r l o o "" by-and-by. As to the seconder of the Address-in-Reply, I only desire to say that in my judgment he put in a very modest little plea for more of what is termed the new protection for the electorate of Batman. I should like to remind honourable members that Batman, the founder of Melbourne, was born",20,Governor General S Speech Addre Ss In Re Ply

Reply went on, in a large spacious way, to argue that the Commonwealth ought to immediately, or as early as possible, acquire for itself all the functions to which it is entitled under the Constitution. respectfully say in reply that a condition precedent to the clothing of the Commonwealth with the further powers to which it is lawfully entitled is the acquirement by some means or other of a greater measure of the country's confidence. I say that advisedly. We shall get all. the functions to which we are entitled under the Constitution, without the. slightest hindrance from the States, when we have proved to the people of Australia that we can perform those functions better than they are being performed now. The first condition to a further grant of power, I take it, is to win the confidence of the country-to establish in the hearts and minds of the people that confidence which, I regret to say, does not exist at the present time. Nothing could be more damaging to the confidence which ought to exist between the States and the Commonwealth, and between the various peoples of this vast continent, than to perpetuate fiascos like that of the late mail contract negotiations. Such is not the way to win the confidence of the people of the country, and is certainly not the way to obtain the further functions to which the Commonwealth is entitled under the Constitution. In this connection I should like to mention a little incident which occurred just prior to the last election. Conference was held in Sydney, and on the agenda paper there was a proposal by the Victorian delegates in favour of the establishment of an Agricultural Bureau under Federal auspices, a proposal which, before to-day, has been ably championed by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. I happened to go to the Conference in the afternoon, when I found that this question had just been discussed. I ascertained that every delegate who had spoken agreed as to the advisability of setting up a Federal Agricultural Bureau, but, strange to say, every delegate, including some of the Victorian delegates, voted against the proposal giving as their reason that they would not trust the present Federal Government with So far as this demand for any further powers. If the Commonwealth is to exercise those further functions to which it is entitled under the Constitution, way to the confidence of the great bulk of The mover of the Address-in the people, who, after a l l , are the basis of any real power which we may possess. As to the speech itself, it contains the usual catalogue of Ministerial aspirations. Everything that could possibly be thought of is May I placed in the programme. The Prime Minister is back from the hub of the universe, and displays to us his package of political wares, and we discern in the package many very old friends, some of which have been in Government programmes during the whole currency of Federation. The shop window is gaily dressed as of yore, and the Prime Minister appears once more in the garb of a universal political provider. This is a way which most Governments have; and the Prime Minister is following it on the present occasion. Amongst the many old friends we find reference to old-age pensions. The item is tacked on to the financial relations between the States and the Federation; apparently old-age pensions are to be an incident of a thorough discussion of the whole of these financial relations. In my judgment, the Government is only trifling with this great question. On the last occasion the old-age pensions proposal was tacked on to a proposal for specific duties, and we, on this side, who opposed that proposal, have been amply justified by the course of events.. We pointed out then that the Federal Treasurer had underestimated his revenue. I do not want to use any hard names, but it seems to me a practice, and a pernicious An Inter-State Fruit practice, of our Treasurers, to undervalue the possibilities in a revenue direction. over-valuing. honourable member that huge surpluses are only a slightly lesser evil than huge deficits. We see what is going on to-day all over Australia; every Treasurer in the group is distributing largesse, and no doubt making himself popular thereby throughout the whole of the electorates. one of them. the Western Australian Premier is an exception.

Its withdrawal to be almost exactly the amount forecasted by members of the Opposition when discussing the proposal for special duties. However, I shall not deal with this matter at greater length now. In my opinion, a proposal for the establishment of a Commonwealth Old-age Pensions system should not be tacked on to any other. Any Commonwealth pensions scheme should be broad-based, like the other functions of the Federal Government, on the revenues of the country, without respect to any particular ear-marking or allocation. Similarly the establishment of a High Commissionership should not be tacked on to immigration proposals. aright, that proposal was, last Parliament, tacked on to one for fostering our rural industries by the establishment of bounties. enough to stand on its own merits. Reference is made in the speech to the cancellation of the mail contract, which has at last come to an inglorious end. That is what the Opposition predicted twelve months ago. No set of business men would have allowed a business proposition of the kind to dangle for so long a time. May I remind honourable members of one or two facts concerning it? rare in connection with the history of this matter. and learned friend is quite right. haps I should say one or two aspects of the case. The history of this affair is very that they are not possessed of that quality, curious and interesting. In the first instance, the contract was a speculative option, which, in spite of our protest at the time, was treated seriously by the Government. that the providing of a mail service is of supreme importance to the commercial interests of the land, and would have known that the shipping companies which in the past have been providing such a service would not readily allow a good thing fo slip from them. The fact that they were put out of the competition was, in my judgment, a reason for requiring every posall they were here for was to give him valusible financial guarantee of the bona fides of the contractors. The first suspicious incident after the signing of the contract was it was a true one. ""the withdrawal of Messrs. Beardmore and Company from the contracting syndicate. That firm alleged that it withdrew on the ground that it had been led to believe that the Commonwealth would guarantee the dewas made light of by . Mr Croker, who has had such a marvellous influence over the Government throughout the proceedings. I do not know him, but he seems to be a very able man. At any rate, to put it vulgarly, he has "" had the loan"" of the Commonwealth Government for a whole twelve months. He immediately announced that other firms had stepped into the place vacated by Messrs. Beardmore and .Company. At this point it would have occurred to ordinary business men to make inquiries into the tiuth of that statement. We have, as our agent in London, Captain Collins, a keen, If I remember shrewd business man. behindhand with all his information. information which he does not possess. before Captain Collins knew that he had left England. judge Captain Collins in the same way as we judge those on the spot. The strictest inquiry should have been made as to the proof of Mr Croker's allegations, and the Government should have satisfied itself that other firms had taken the place of Messrs. Beardmore and Company. As a matter of fact, no other firm did so. That would have been ascertained had an inquiry been conducted Perwith ordinary business acumen. That Ministers did not find out the truth shows or, if they knew the facts, they had no right to keep them from the people of the country. Messrs. Clarke and Esplen then appeared in Australia, and it was announced All business men are aware in a cablegram that they had come here to try to secure an amendment of the agreement. This was denied by them, and by the Postmaster-General as well. It was next alleged that they had come out to advise the Government in matters of naval construction in connection with the proposal to construct a Commonwealth Navy, and the Minister of Defence publicly stated that able information on that subject. these gentlemen never have had to do with the construction of battle-ships.

We were told at a later stage that Captain Collins had approved of the plans of the proposed vessels, and that the keels of some of them had been laid, and some of the materials supplied, and that the builders were only awaiting the working out of some little details. declared that the delay which was evident was being caused byCaptain Collins in his criticism of the plans. The next thing that happened was that the Minister of Trade and Customs when in London demanded the payment of the bond of the syndicate, to which they demurred on the ground of some technical informality. When a great firm of reputed standing began to quibble on technical grounds about paying a paltry bond of .£25,000, the Government should have looked further afield. No self respecting firm which had definitely undertaken to carry out a contract of this kind would have demurred to the payment of their bond. On the Prime Minister arriving in England he made a further demand, to which the company replied that it would put up the money as soon as the Commonwealth guaranteed its debentures. withstanding all the demands for bonds and all the guarantees which the Government were alleged to have received, are they able to say that they hold threepence in cash belonging to the contractors? ter said this afternoon that we hold £2,500 in cash, and a bond guaranteed by a bank for £25,000 more. vernment taken steps to secure the honouring of that bond ? made to-day that all necessary steps have been taken. assume that the Government intend to secure the £25,000 represented by the bond? hope that we shall never see so much muddling by CommonwealthMinisters again, and that we shall never again see ""anActing Prime Minister closeted with a State Cabinet, advising them to annex for themselves all the advantages of a contract which it was solemnly declared would be equally apportioned between the States. ber refer to the attendance of the Acting Prime Minister at the Premiers' Conference? attendance at a Cabinet meeting of the Victorian Government.

It will be difficult to deliberately shut out tenders, but there will be need for infinite care in the drawing up of specifications, and in connection with the acceptance of the proposals made. I come now to more important features of the Governor General's Speech, 'and paradoxical as it may seem, the important features of this speech are the omissions from it.

Mr Balfour is his beau ideal. pion of the House of Lords and the landlords of Great Britain is his beau ideal of a statesman. Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the man of all the public men of Great Britain who most nearly approaches the Minister, so far as his democratic purposes are revealed, is the man whom he found was "" not up to much at all."" The Minister declares that Sir Henry CampbellBannerman actually reads his speeches. It struck me as peculiar that the Minister should make use of an expression of that kind concerning the Prime Minister of Great Britain. The idea of the Minister of Trade and Customs, of all men, accusing the Prime Minister of Great Britain of reading his own speeches ! Does the Minister forget that when he was Treasurer in New South WalesI pulled him up on two occasions for reading his speeches? Minister of Great Britain. he ought to* be. . I have yet to learn that, it is a crime to compose a speech and to read it. Of course, the best man he met in the old country was Mr Lloyd George, and he proceeds to offer the explanation of this fact. It appears that at the Navigation Conference Mr Lloyd George gave him most of the concessions for which he asked, and, being the most benevolent gentleman with whom he had to deal, the Minister naturally comes back with the impression that Mr Lloyd George is the very greatest statesman in the British Empire. Of course, it is very difficult indeed to criticise the Prime Minister and his actions amid the glamour and shimmer and shineshall I say glory-in which he is now enveloped. But, in my judgment, he made one or two serious mistakes. The honourable gentleman told us that he did not interpose in party politics in Great Britain. I have read some of his speeches, and I am quite unable to acquit him of interposition. He did interpose, and he did deliver party speeches. One in particular, the so-called Baltic speech., was from beginning to end a long-drawn-out jeer at Mr Asquith's speech in the Conference. The Prime Minister had his audience crying shame on Mr perial Conference to be "" a new creation Asquith. That was no part of his function. He was not sent home to do that. some pretty good facts. ing with the merits of the case at all, but it did seem to me that the Prime Minister transgressed in making such a speech as that which he delivered before the gentlemen who foregathered at the Baltic Exchange. It was that speech which supplied the reason for Mr Churchill's somewhat rude remarks at Edinburgh, or Glasgow, when he spoke of having "" banged the door in the face of the Colonial Premiers"" on the question of preference. That address was a reply to the Prime Minister's speech at the Baltic Exchange, and when we realize that, we understand the reason for the someivhat bitter feeling which sprang up at that particular time. However, I have no desire to dwell upon that episode. The Prime Minister, when in London, confessed himself disappointed with the work of the Imperial Conference, so far as its actual results were concerned. But the moment he reached Australia, he practically said, "" We have done more good than will ever be realized."" That was a great change in sentiment and attitude. Of course, he had in the meantime been transported 12,000 miles. The Minister of Trade and Customs, when on the other side of the world, just as plainly expressed his disappointment with the result of the Conference, but the moment he returned to Australia, and found the people greeting him in a representative capacity, he began to discover that he and his colleagues had done very good work. I now wish to ask the Prime Minister some questions relating to the Imperial Conference. I think that we have a legitimate right-no w that the shouting and the tumult which very properly greeted the honourable gentlemar* upon his return, has died away-to apoly our critical faculties to the work of that body, and to interrogate the Prime Minister concerning some of his actions there, and some of the work which was performed.

In respect to this point, I should like to ask the Prime Minister one or two questions, and I hope that he will not regard them as being put in a factious spirit or for purely party purposes. There are some matters that are beyond the scale of party warfare, as such, and I therefore hope that the Prime Minister will give a little attention to the questions which, simply to make the issues plain, I now propose to put to him. What is this new creation of which he speaks? The Conference was the third held in London at which representatives from oversea Dominions were present and took part. wish to ask the Prime Minister whether this "" new creation for Imperial purposes"" is intended to supersede any of the older powers which we possess, and which we have found so valuable in the working out of our destiny in these oversea Dominions. The question is of the gravest consequence, and we ought to know exactly what is being done. The Prime Minister, however, does not tell us, except in the most vague and general terms, what he means by the setting up of this new creation which is to exercise such extraordinary powers. What is our present position? We have absolute autonomy. We are working out our own destiny as seems best to us, nobody questioning what we do except now and again when, perhaps for high Imperial purposes, some action is taken to which we afterwards cordially assent intended to curtail any of the powers and upon just reason being always shown. That is the only hindrance that we suffer. We are absolutely independent and free to exercise all the powers and functions given to us by the conferment of our Constitution. Our present relations with the mother country are in every way satisfactory. There never was such a flood tide of loyalty throughout the Australian States as there is to-day. The same, indeed, may be said of the whole Empire. The Empire is welded together to-day, as never before, in the highest and surest of all bonds-the bond of mutual loyalty to every part of the Dominion. Then, sir, our powers extend even to the control of the commerce sought to be carried on with us by the mother country itself. words, we are permitted to exercise our Mr Joseph Cook. powers of independent government to such an extent as to tax the products of the mother country brought to our shores. That itself is a new branch of Imperial power given, shall I say, to daughter Statesa grant that has never hitherto been known in the history of the worldand I should like, by the way, to say that -as soon as we have dealt with the motion now before us we are going to put this taxing power into active and vigorous operation. Then, again, we have a Torrens title to the whole of this vast continent a Torrens title given to us by the Imperial Government. In addition to that we exercise, and are proud to exercise, to-day all the privileges resulting from the consular services of the Empire, services which some of us when we go abroad do not ap„preciate as we ought to do. All these are I given to us .without the payment of a penny. We have undisputed possession of this Continent, unrestricted freedom in its development, and are guarded by the Imperial fleet while we proceed. What are we to gain by ""this new creation""? The Prime Minister may have in his mind some proposal for the conservation of these privileges, and indeed, for their expansion. If so, will he tell us what it is? referring to the Imperial Conference? to the proposal which the Prime Minister describes as "" a new creation for Imperial purposes."" The term is so large and vague that it is incumbent upon him in his position of responsibility to the people of Australia to tell us exactly what he means. Is it privileges that we now possess, or to extend, amplify, and conserve them? If the honourable and learned gentleman, when he speaks of a new creation for Imperial purposes, has in mind the new Secretariat, I do not quite concede the aptness of the language employed by him. I should like to hear some definite meaning given to his statement, and as one in search of information, I appeal to him to sav what benefit we shall obtain by the transference of our relations with the Home Government from the Colonial Office to the Prime Minister of Great Britain.

138,Mr Joseph Cook,"I am referring.When we make our representations to the British Government, they go to the Colonial Office. Does the Prime Minister think for one instant that such representations are disposed of without reference to the British Cabinet? 1 am sure that the Prime Minister of Great Britain is consulted in regard to every important matter relating to these oversea Dominions. if he is not. am sure that the Prime Minister will not deny that he is. That being so, what shall we gain by being able to go direct to the Prime Minister of Great Britain? If we sent Home an important document concerning, say, the New Hebrides, New Caledonia, or in relation to any of those perplexing questions so near to our door, what would the Prime Minister do with it? Would he not refer it to the Colonial Office? It is the Colonial Office which supplies information and makes recommendations to the British Cabinet concerning such matters. I am therefore unable to see that the mere transference of these questions to the Prime Minister will mean any actual advantage to us. I know that the proposal is part and parcel of the sentiment which as expressed in the phrase that the Conference has been a meeting of nation with nation instead of a gathering of subordinate peoples with superior peoples, as has hitherto been the case. I mean, of course, in a purely official sense; but I have yet to learn that, so far as any actual advantage is concerned, our dealing direct with the Prime Minister of Great Britain will facilitate the business which we have to transact with the Home Government. The new Secretariat can of itself do nothing. It has been clothed with no executive function; it will have no representative character. I understand that it is merely to collect and colJnte information. If that is to be its sole duty, it occurs to me that a branch of the Colonial Office could do the work equally well. the work to be performed, and the facilities already existing for its performance, T was not surprised to find Sir Wilfrid Laurier in opposition to my honourable and learned friend, so far as this matter is concerned. ber like to see the Secretariat clothed with executive authority ? that that question might be more usefully answered by some one a hundred years hence. can be answered when time has permitted the evolution of events when we have grown into a nation. It is impossible to say what the future may unfold for us in the way of closer Imperial relations, and whether an Imperial Council, having a common legislative authority, will finally be set up. I do not expect in my time to see any such creation, but I desire to know whether that is the ultimate objective of the new creation to which the Prime Minister refers. MeantimeI ask whether the Secretariat will do for us in London anything which the Agents-General, or the High Commissioner to be appointed, could not do. What are these officers for but to collect and collate information of advantage to every part of Australia as well as to every other portion of the King's dominions? I shall be glad, however, to hear that the Secretariat has to subserve a function of some practical and not merely theoretical value to Australia. If the Prime Minister means that there was established at the Conference the principle of common consultations at certain recurring periods and places, then, beyond the possibility of doubt, I shall admit that something has been gained for us. I should not, however, exaggerate its importance in the way that the Prime Minister, in the full flush and heyday of his return, is disposed to do. He has told us that this new creation is only the beginning -that the first step only has been taken. What are the other steps or stages and where will they ultimately lead us? Before we take even a first step we ought to know the direction in which we are trending, and I hope to hear from the Prime Minister a statement that the direction which he proposes is such as will comport with the preservation of our autonomous powers. Having regard to the character of will pardon me I should like to say that I have received to-day a cablegram informing me that a consultation is being held with respect to,a proposal made by Sir Wilfrid Laurier as to the "" All-red route."" One set of proposals goes to the British Cabinet and the other-that relating to the cost and value of the proposal to New Zealand and Australia if the route be extended through the Pacific-is being",27,Governor General S Speech Addre Ss In Re Ply

That is the kind of action that I contemplate. delighted with action of that kind, and we can only hope that the fullest explanation will be given. new development. Prime Minister will admit that our efforts in that direction have not been particularly successful. Vancouver service, which has not developed to anything like the extent we expected. Nor can it be said that we have yet secured from the Pacific Cable all that we expected. If the Prime Minister can assure us that we are to obtain from the Secretariat better official machinery for dealing with matters of this kind I shall say at once that the achievement is a very valuable one. But is that all he proposes to do? For instance, does he propose to take any step which will bring us nearer to a common trade within the Empire? If there is one man more than another who has emphasized the absolute necessity for this in any grand Imperial scheme, it is the Prime Minister of the Dominion of Canada. A little while before going to the Imperial Conference, Sir Wilfrid Laurier gave expression to his views on the matter, and it is a thousand pities that we had not an opportunity to hear our Prime Minister before he left our shores. I venture to say that such an utterance would have helped him in the conduct of affairs in England, and would certainly have enabled us to much better understand the trend of events there. regard to the Imperial Conference, just before going Home, said :There could be no Imperial union unless a Grand Parliament representing it had power to enact fiscal legislation for all divisions of the Empire, or unless an absolute system of free trade was established between its component parts. Sir Wilfrid Laurier is not alone in that idea. All those who have studied the question earnestly have come to see that we can have complete consolidation of the Empire, only on the basis of a common trade and a common defence. These, it seems to me, are the two fundamentals. Canada contribute towards the Imperial Navy? am not putting Sir Wilfrid Laurier's view as to that point, on which he did not touch ; I simply say that the more I look into the matter, the more it seems to me that we can have no Imperial UnionI am not arguing whether Imperial Union is right or wrong, advisable or otherwise-unles s by t means of a common trade within the Empire, and a common defence of that Empire. One proposal of the Prime Minister at the Conference appeals to me very, strongly; I refer to his proposal for a There is, for* instance, the slight Imperial duty for the purpose of Imperial Defence. I think it was the late Cecil Rhodes who first threw out that idea over twenty years ago. Cecil Rhodes who was the originator of the idea. I remember reading about twenty-five years ago a proposal made by Rhodes that there should be an Imperial duty of, I think, 2 per cent., and I am bound to say that this is an idea which appeals strongly to my mind. What steps are to be taken in the evolutions which are to follow, in the direction of a common Legislature' for the Empire? Is the ideal to be a common Legislature for the Empire, or, as Mr Bryce put it the other day, common legislation for common purposes by the various sections of the Empire? The distinction is very broad -on e preserves' our absolute autonomy, while the other, it seems to me, absolutely, surrenders it. These are the two ideals, and I should like the Prime Minister to make a definite statement as to what is to be done in this respect. If there is to be a common legislative authority our autonomy, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, speaking in must go, and no Australian is prepared, I think, to surrender our autonomy at the present time. If it is to be legislation of a common character by the various portions of the Empire, that is more feasible. It would preserve our autonomy, though, at the same time, it would originate some very, awkward problems for us to solve. For instance, would Australia be prepared to-day to permit outlying portions of the Empire in any legislative fashion, or even by way of recommendation or veto, to have anvthing to do with our immigration restriction legislation, or interfere in our relations with the islands in our immediate vicinity? No Australian would, I much does think, be prepared to permit an outlving portion of the Empire to seriously trench on our legislative domain in these matters. But that, I take it, is the ideal which the Prime Minister set up when in England;",28,Governor General S Speech Addre Ss In Re Ply

152,Mr Joseph Cook,"I think it wasat any rate, it is the idea of Lord Milner, whom the Prime Minister seems to take as his great exemplar in regard to Imperial questions. Every advance towards Imperial control must necessarily mean the modification of our autonomous powers. The practical question we have to put to ourselves is this-wil l this modification of our autonomous powers lead, in the main result, to an amplification or an increase in the scope of the beneficial influence of those autonomous powers which we possess to-day ? That is the problem; and I desire to hear the Prime Minister make himself clear on the matter, so that we may understand exactly what he has done, and what he means by the creation of this new order of affairs. Are we to advance towards a common defence of the Empire? If we are to believe Mr such steps for many years. Haldane, the recent Imperial Conference has done a great deal in this direction. Speaking the other day, Mr Haldane waxed very warm on the matter, and said, amongst other things, that the Premiers had come to the conclusion that the forces of the Empire could be welded to a large extent into one. statement, which means much, and I should like to hear from the Prime Minister how 'far it is correct as applied to the work of the recent Conference.

Haldane said:The Premiers had come to the conclusion that -and I should like to know from the the forces of the Empire could be welded to a large extent into one. An interchange of officers, in my opinion, is to be commended in every way. But our position lately has been somewhat antagonistic to anything of the kind. We sent away an Imperial officer before he had time to do what he should have done for the efficiency of our forces. Since then we have not taken the slightest trouble to get other Imperial officers to advise us. We rely, I take it, on General Hoad, whom I do not know, but whom I believe to be an excellent officer. I do not think, however, that General Hoad would have us believe that his attainments are equal to the best military ability in England. an Imperial officer. might be a great deal better, but we desire to be assured of that. I take leave to think that General Hoad is not better, and in saying that I hope I shall not be misunderstood. I have nothing whatever to say against General Hoad, whom I believe to be an able and valuable officer; but in the matter of the defence of the Empire we ought to be able, irrespective of localities or local conditions of any kind, to command the best ability available within the Empire. pasr Imperial officers have been imported to teach Australian officers, and surely some of the latter must have learned something by this time? forward has been taken towards obtaining the best teaching ability of Great Britain. doubt even that.

I should also like the Prime Minister to explain what seems to me an anomaly in connection with this matter. Mr Haldane says that we are go ing a step towards organizing a scientific system of Imperial Defence in the direction of a unitary control of the Army. It seems to me, however, that we are departing from that principle in regard to the Navy, though, again, I say I speak subject to the correction of the Prime Minister. While the honourable gentleman seems anxious to go with Mr Haldane in any scheme to unify our Army control, he does not seem to take the same view in regard to the Navy, the control of which, I submit, is of more serious importance to Australia. the same lines.

I hope that next week we shall have those reports. need to wait for the reports. I take it that the Prime Minister knows exactly what he did in Great Britain, and can make the matter clear. In regard to the naval proposals, if anything the Prime Minister has done will insure for us a common purpose in regard to the navies of the Empirea common plan, a common type of vessel, and a common command in war time-h e will not find any difficulty on this side of the House, so far as I know; he certainly will not find me in opposition to anything he proposes if he will preserve those essentials of what I taike to be an efficient naval defence of the Empire. There is only one other point to which I desire to refer in this connection. The Prime Minister has said that we are to share further in the powers of the Empire, in powers which now belong exclusively to Great Britain. I ask the Prime Minister this question-doe s that mean that we are to be sharers of the cost as well as of the powers? are to become sharers in those great powers which are now in Great Britain's exclusive possession, are we also to share the cost which the sharing of the powers involves? Lord Milner, speaking the other day, referred to this matter in this way: Once establish the principle of common deliberation about external affairs, or even only about external affairs directly . affecting one or more of the colonies, and you are bound to face the problem of what I may call mutual insurance. r take that to mean that if we are to possess those ampler powers and control which the Executive of Great Britain now exercise exclusively, we must share the cost also. I should like to know whether the Prime Minister subscribes to that doctrine, because it seems to me the logical sequence to our coming into the possession of the ampler powers to which he referred in those splendid speeches of his. I desire here to make allusion to the supreme importance for Australia of the Naval Agreement now in existence, and in regard to this I should like the Prime Minister to be as explicit as possible. In the old country the Prime Minister was explicit enough; there was no doubt about his voice there. He spoke in resonant tones, as to which there could be no possibility of mistake, of his intentions in regard to a Naval Agreement. But since he has come back to Australia we have not been able to get him to make a definite statement on this important matter. Why? Does he find his proposal not so popular as it seemed in London? Nothing could be more ludicrous orI use the word againtortuous than the course of the Government in regard to this supreme matter of the Naval Defence of Australia. It is only four years since the present agreement was made, and when made, its purpose as set out in the preamble of the Bill which we passed, was to secure unitary control of the naval defence of the Empire. There was to be one control, one discipline, one drill. The Government of the day consisted largely of the Ministers who form the present Administration, though the then Prime Minister has been translated to another sphere of action. Those Ministers subscribed to the principle which I have enunciated. Ever since, however, they have followed a more or less tortuous political course. The Treasurer has avowed himself one of the warmest advocates of the Imperial Navy, and in Power means cost, and if we a memorandum which he submitted, he affirmed that if we paid as large a contribution to the upkeep of the Australian Squadron as we ought to pay, our share of the .burden would amount to £5,000,000. He argued strongly that there should be one navy and one control, and condemned in unqualified terms the proposal for the building of an Australian Navy. He saidI am not prepared to recommend, under existing conditions, the establishment of an Australian Navy. Eveni f it were established, I am afraid it would not be very efficient no change for the officers and crews, who would* go on year after year in the same ships, subject to the same influences, and, I fear, with deteriorating effects There is only one sea to be supreme over, and we want one fleet to be mistress over that sea. That was the right honourable gentleman's statement four years ago. But since he has been a member of the present Government he has been playing with the question, and has been making statements to the country of a very doubtful character. This course, I take it, has been ended by the straight-out declaration of the Prime Minister, made in London, that he is prepared to move for the cancellation of the Naval Agreement. From time to time, Ministers have given answers to questions",30,Governor General S Speech Addre Ss In Re Ply
164,Mr Joseph Cook,"We do notput to them by honourable members, and furnished information on the subject of the Naval Agreement which, to say the least, were of an unsatisfactory character. The Minister of Defence declared the other day that nine-tenths of the people of Australia are in favour of an Australian Navy. Does he mean that nine-tenths of the Australian people are opposed to the maintenance of the present Naval Agreement? That is the point. They may be in favour of the establishment of an Australian Navy. who is opposed to it. But the honourable gentleman is trying to throw dust in the eyes of the public in making these random statements. We are all in favour of doing something for our own defence, but the question is, shall what is to be done be the alternative of, or supplementary to, the present arrangement? establishment of a local fleet, in addition to paying a subsidy of £200,000 a year for the maintenance of the Imperial Navy? member, when the Prime Minister last year told us that he proposed to spend £350,000 per annum on our own defence, in addition ' to the present subsidy of £200,000, a total expenditure of £550,000, took part in a dialogue for Bland asked the Prime Minister to do without the £200,000, but the latter refused. friend is very keen on these matters. without breadth. member for Bland no doubt spoke jocularly, because if any man in the House has studied the question of Naval Defence, it is the honourable member for Wentworth. We should be told by tlie Prime Minister whether the Government's proposals for an Australian Navy are to dovetail in with the scheme of Imperial Naval control, and if so, to what extent. We wish to know what his proposals are. It has been laid down by all the experts that the first essentials of effective naval warfare are unitary control, common drill, and a common type of battle-ship. It is of supreme importance that an Admiral in war time should understand his ships, and his men, as otherwise the consequences may be disastrous to all concerned. Lord Milner makes the position very clear in the following statement:Without a common understanding or any arrangement for mutual help, Colonial Defence Forces may become a burden out. of ail proportion to their utility. He there follows the expert opinion of the Empire, and I am anxious that the Prime Minister shall make it clear whether he proposes to derogate from the principle of unitary control in time of war. The Prime Minister has declared that the NavalI do not know any man Agreement is unpopular in Australia. I quote his remarks from a report which appeared in the Age, because that report is a little fuller than some of the others, and because I am sure that that journal would not willingly misrepresent him. It states that: Before the Conference rose, a most important announcement was made with regard to the Australian Navy by the First Lord of the Admiralty. Lord Tweedmouth stated that, as the result of several interviews with the Australian delegates to the ConferenceI take it that the Prime Minister is prepared to accept the responsibility for this report because he was the Australian delegate, and as the plural number is used, the Minister of Trade and Customs seems to be included he was now able lo summarize the British Admiralty's decisions. As far as Australia and New Zealand were concerned, the Admiralty would be willing to leave the continuance of the present subsidy entirely in their hands, leaving them to do whatever they thought best. He realized that Australia did not favour the present mode of contribution. Mr Deakin, following him, stated that, assuming Sir Joseph Ward's consent, he would ask the Commonwealth Parliament to terminate the agreement with Great Britain, and apply the subsidy to secure the harbors and coastal ports. -I do not believe that Australia is anxious to cancel the Naval Agreement, or that it is unpopular. I am of opinion that if the mind of Australia could be ascertained, it would be in favour of contributing more, and not less, to the upkeep of the Imperial Navy, and that altogether apart from any. proposal for the construction of an ""Australian Navy. I have never heard any one declare himself to be opposed to the Naval Agreement, with the exception of a few whose views are set forth by a prominent Victorian newspaper, and who include Captain Creswell. If the opinion of the Australian people could be ascertained tomorrow, we should, I believe, get a short, sharp, and emphatic affirmation of the desirability of continuing the Naval Agree-",31,Governor General S Speech Addre Ss In Re Ply

170,Mr Joseph Cook,"The honorablement. The question has been somewhat prejudiced by the interference of irresponsible considerate eye upon this particular newspersons, who have from time to time made suggestions as to our contribution and line of conduct in this matter. A little while ago, an Admiral who had been on the Australian station declared that we should conWales. tribute at least £500,000, and not twelve months since the Times published the opinion that we should contribute not less than £1,000,000. Sir Frank Swettenham, following our own Treasurer, thinks that we should pay £5,000,000 per annum. I am emphatically of the opinion that these meddlers should keep out of the business.

It is proposed that, ten years hence, we shall have obtained for ourselves a mosquito fleet which will be able to defend our large ports and to prevent an enemy from landing on our coasts.' But I venture to say that,'while we may make half-a-dozen of our large ports secure, we shall not have prevented the possibility of an enemy's fleet raiding our shores and landing men upon them. Our coast-line is far too extensive for any such measure as that to be of an effective character. a little while ago, the Prime Minister himappeals to me in this way: This proposal self seemed to realize this. Here is a quotation from a journal called The Patriot, which, I understand, was circulated very freely by Ministers during the recent elections, and which it is said enjoved special facilities for transmission through the Post Office. I do not know with what justification that statement is made, but it is alleged that the postal authorities looked with a very kind and paper. tained more facilities than were enjoyed by free-trade organizations in New South before this debate closes we shall hear something about those facilities. many facilities as they could reasonably expect. Patriot did-a t least rumour says so. That, however, is a matter which will be cleared up at a later stage. According to The Patriot the Prime Minister declaredA country which is unpeopled must necessarily be undefended, and when we look at the vast north of this country, we behold a vast menace to the whole of our Continent. . . . There is little that makes Northern Australia ours except the British flag and the British fleet. r venture to say that that is a correct estimate of the position of affairs here. There is nothing that will make Northern Australia ours but the British fleet in close proximity to our shores. Under the Government proposals we are to get a fleet of our own in ten years, but meantime our commerce is expanding by leaps and bounds. I wish now to put my view of the matter of our contribution We learn that the proposals under the Imperial Naval Agreement. Our commerce is expanding by leaps and That is stated in the bounds, and there is an old saying that "" the fatter the lamb the stouter must be the fence."" If that be the case with regard to our commerce to-day, the practical question arises"" Shall we make the security of Australian commerce and Australian soil greater or less by cancelling the Naval Agreement ?"" That is the only practical question we ought to face and answer. If we could guarantee to our commerce the same security that it enjoys now, I admit that the Prime Minister might make out a good case for the canIndeed, speaking in Sydney cellation of the Agreement. The matter is merely one to defend our shores. Captain Creswell admits that-n o one more definitely and readily.

I hope that he will presently say what he has to say, and allow me to proceed. I -am quite sure that he will have plenty to say by-and-by, and if he will allow me to give him a little advice, it is that, as a new member, he will not do himself any harm by treating other honourable members as he should. What is the position with regard to our commerce to-day ? One-fourth of our commerce never touches the shores of Great Britain. the Empire is between British possessions and foreign countries, and never goes near Imperial shores. total trade of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and India, is with foreign countries. Similarly one-fourth of the British trade is with foreign countries of the world. These facts may be gleaned by a perusal of the Admiralty memorandum which was submitted on the occasion of the last Conference of Premiers. debted for them to a pamphlet which was issued some time ago by the honourable and learned member for Angas. our trade, I repeat, is not done with Great Britain, but with foreign countries. Who is to continue to police that trade? Isi t to go undefended in its track across the ocean to find its markets in foreign countries, or are we to relv on the Imperial Navy to protect it ? . If we are to rely uponi that Navv, are we so mean as to allow it to perform that duty without receiving any consideration from us ? The proposals of the Government relate to coastal defence, and that coastal defence would be of little use if once the Imperial Navy were destroyed on the high seas. admitting that it would be effective in dePersonally I canfending our large ports, and in protecting us from hostile raids, there yet remains the policing of the commerce which leaves our shores, which is valued at over I think that he merely ^100,000,000 per annum, and which is advancing by leaps and bounds. The least that we can do is to continue our present contribution, if we do not increase it , toI wards the protection of that commerce. There is another aspect of this matter which we ought to take into consideration. So the question resolves itself into I refer to the menace which is gradually closing in around us, to the intricate and difficult problems of statesmanship which are looming up in regard to the control of our islands. Do we remember that already there are 30,000 Indians in F i j i , and that very many more are expected there shortly? The Fijian is dying out rapidly. Do we remember that only the other day 3,000 Chinese were landed in Samoa by the German Government? The Chinese are flocking to New Britain, the Solomon Islands are being peopled by the Javanese. Altogether these islands are being taken possession of by other nations, and Asiatics are being crowded into them by Governments over whom we have not an atom of control. To decrease our contribution towards making our security as great as it One-fourth of the commerce of is possible to make it, in view of this Asiatic menace, would be the acme of folly. I shall not weary the House furOne-half of the ther. There are some other matters to which I should have liked to refer. I will only say that we have a large empty continent here, and in view of the overcrowded state of the other countries of the world, a large empty fertile continent becomes a menace to ourselves and a constant temptation to people outside. It is I am inno bogy to say that we shall soon be compelled to take further steps for our security by attracting a larger population, and by One-half of initiating a more efficient system of defence than we have to-day. Taking a broad view of the matter, therefore, I conclude that this is not a time when we should cease our contribution under the Imperial Naval Agreement, notwithstanding that we propose to take such steps as we may deem feasible to defend our ports and to prevent hostile raids upon our continent.

But we do expect fair treatment from the Government, and if we get it, they will receive reciprocal treatment. I trust that, as soon as possible, they will bring forward that measure which they urge as the supreme reason for their occupancy of the Treasury benches, so that it may be disposed of after reasonable discussion and fair, considerate treatment, and so that the way may be clear for such a re-arrangement of parties in this House as shall, in some measure, bring to it that dignity, status, and confidence which this branch of the Commonwealth Parliament ought certainly to possess. of Trade and Customs) [4.57] -I , have no complaint to utter against the tone of the speech which has just been delivered by the acting leader of the Opposition. l t is very pleasing to' know that he is in a better frame of mind than he has sometimes been. I am quite sure that the good feeling which he has expressed will be reciprocated by the Government. BeforeI deal with one or two matters to which he has referred, I wish to say on behalf of the Ministry-if I may be permitted to do so-that we exceedingly regret the reason which has been given for the absence of the leader of the Opposition. I speak personally, and I say that I regret it as much as does anybody. The honourable member for Parramatta commenced his speech by declaring that the Government represented a minority of the House, and that there was a huge majority in this Chamber which is opposed to Socialism. Before he dealt with that question, which has been so much debated, and which is so much misunderstood, I should have liked to ask him to define what he means by "" Socialism.""

Much has been said as to the desirableness of promoting immigration to Australia, but I do not think that what has been done in this direction so far is likely to be successful. A month before I left London something like 16,000 emigrants from the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, Glasgow, and other cities in Scotland, left for Canada. This was the result of advertising done in Great Britain by the Dominion as well as by the railway company. I may say, by the way, that the railway company in Canada advertises perhaps even more largely than does the Government of the Dominion. to advertise Australia in a big way ? had my way. Australia is in a sorry position if she cannot afford to incur the expenditure necessary in this direction. well, or leave it alone. Sir WILLIA M LYNE I quite agiree with the honourable member, and I trust the Prime Minister will be induced at an early date to take action in the direction I have indicated. I come now to the question of the mail contract. The negotiations were far more protracted than I desired, but the object which the Prime Minister, and I think I may say all his colleagues, had in accepting the tender in the first instance, outcome of our experience. was to secure the substantial saving which seemed open to us. ship Company had offered to carry our mails for a larger subsidy, and it was recognised that there was a vast difference between that and the tender of the syndicate to do the work. The Government, no doubt, were largely influenced by this prospect of effecting a substantial saving, and personally I do not think that we have been treated fairly by the contractors. They dragged on the negotiations, although we had given them more than ample latitude up to the time when the Prime Minister and I left London. I was requested by my leader to undertake the task of carrying on the negotiations in connection with the mail contract whilst we were in London, since he found it impossible, owing to the pressure of other duties, to do so. I endeavoured to find out what sort of men were in the syndicate, and what they had previously done in this direction. I certainly took action, with a view of completing the negotiations, and served on the contractors a notice requiring them to give further security. Subsequently, a second notice was served on them. I do not know whether the first was considered to be invalid, but if it was, I certainly cannot be held responsible, since I acted on legal advice. Thereafter, the only delay was that which took place during our voyage to Australia, and which was unavoidable, since it was only at three or four points that we could ascertain what was being done. Almost' as soon as the Prime Minister returned to Australia, the question was finally dealt with. If honourable members are prepared to view the matter in a fair light-and judging by the remarks of the deputy leader of the Opposition. I think they are-the y will readily admit that the Government could not have done more than they did, particularly having regard to the statement made, and also published, in the press, that the money required by the company had actually been raised in London. I was of opinion at the time that this assertion was not correct, and my surmise proved to be right. The money was not found, and we had to cancel the contract. In future the Postmaster-General, who has the conduct of these matters, will take great care that any company or syndicate tendering for the carriage of our oversea mails makes a substantial cash deposit. The Orient SteamSir WILLIA M LYNE -It cannot be denied that the cash deposit lodged by the syndicate under the contract was not sufficiently large, and I am sure that the Postmaster-General will insist, in future, upon a large deposit being made in connection with such tenders. The honourable member for Parramatta, in the course of his speech, referred to certain remarks which he said I had made about my visit to London. I do not think it is quite nice, on an occasion of this kind, to refer to conversations which may have been held. So far as I am concerned, I never made any such statement as the honourable member indicated I had made to the public press; at any rate, if it is not possible to have a little joke as to events which may have occurred during a trip, we shall all have to hold our tongues.",36,Governor General S Speech Addre Ss In Re Ply

I -take it, however, that what the honourable member for Parramatta said was more in joke than earnest. In London, both the Prime Minister and myself were faced with a great deal of work which had to be transacted in a very short space of time, with the result that certain matters had to be left unattended to. Under the circumstances it was impossible to do justice to one's self or to the work in every direction. tion was only a small one. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -The honourable member is quite right. When I arrived in LondonI found that the Australian delegation at the Navigation Conference was the smallest of all. The New Zealand delegation was larger than that of Australia, while the Im|perial delegation and the shipping delegation were larger still. If the occasion should arise for another Conference of the kind, I should certainly not hesitate to propose that more representatives should be sent from the Commonwealth. I do not intend to deal in any detail with the deliberations of the Imperial Conference; that, I take it, is a matter which I should leave to the Prime Minister. I desire, however, to say a word or two in reference to the Navigation Conference. When the honourable member for North Sydney and the honourable and learned member for West Sydney and myself left Australia, remarks were made which were derogatory to the personnel of the delegation. But I do not think it could have been anticipated by those who expressed their disapproval in that way that the delegation would practically obtain everything which they were sent to advocate. The present position in Australia now is, that the Commonwealth Parliament has full power to pass what laws may be deemed advisable for controlling shipping on our own coasts'. veto ? Sir WILLIA M LYNE -No; the British representatives agreed to certain resolutions which, I believe, have been published, and we now have the power to deal not only with the Australian ships and Australian seamen, but also with oversea ships and seamen if they trade on the coast. tish Merchant Shipping Act? where it is arranged not to pass certain provisions interfering with it, we have been given power in every respect.

There is provision that if a passenger chose to stop at a particular port, and then resume his voyage in another ship belonging to the same line, or if goods, were left at a port and were subsequently carried on by a vessel of the same line, this should not be held to come within the definition of coasting trade. not taken up? point raised by the honourable member for Angas refers to oversea ships which might come here, and, while doing no coastal trade, did not conform to all reasonable conditions.

Sir WILLIA M LYNE I do not know what was said in the House of Commons, but I know what appears in the official report of the Conference, which is quite as full as our own Hansard reports, and which, I expect, will be available for honourable members shortly. There were one or two motions which I had intended to press, but legal representatives of the Imperial Government, and also Mr Lloyd George, said that all that those motions would achieve could be done under other resolutions which were carried. In short, we have been given power to protect our seamen in the matter of food, wages, air space, and so forth, and to compel ship-owners to make any improvements which are proved to be necessary. Altogether, I think it must be acknowledged that the British Government have dealt very fairly by us, and in most cases the ship-owners were more moderate than I had anticipated.

The honourable member for Parramatta contended that a certain action taken in the Imperial Conference would lead to a weakening of that loyalty which he very aptly said is greater now than ever before throughout the Empire.

242,Mr Fairbairn,"That saved theto. run a great pioneering work like the development of the Northern Territory. If any one of us were going to undertake the task, we should look around the world and ascertain who was doing that class of work well. The State must do what the individual would do, otherwise the State must come to grief. If we look around the world we shall see that Canada is successfully developing her territory. She possesses an inhospitable region in the north-west of her borders, just as we do. But Canada is filling up that portion of her territory, and we are not filling ours. She is going about it in the right way, and is now receiving an enormous stream of people. The Canadian Government called for tenders in all parts of the world from persons who were prepared to develop that territory, and they were fortunate enough to strike the Canadian Pacific Railway Syndicate. The Dominion Government made that syndicate a present of one-half the territory which it developed. It was a present which was worth nothing at the time, but the Canadian Pacific Railway Company possessed sufficient pluck and experience to take the work in hand, with the result that besides filling up vast areas they have made the land which remained to the Government very valuable indeed. good land in the Northern Territory. hear that, because I have read a good deal -about it. I have been just across the '.Queensland border, and I have heard it described as very indifferent country by some and in the most glowing terms by others. Personally, I do not know much about it. But we must deal with this matter in a business-like way. If a syndicate did make a little money out of the transaction, we must not forget that the Commonwealth would gain in population. About twenty years ago, I am aware that the Mennonites were very desirous of sending out members of their sect to the Territory, but the project fell through at the last moment. If anv similar body is prepared to embark upon the enterprise, I say that we should allow them to do so. Let us try to get the -northern portion of this country settled in some way. When the Government 'introduce the Bill covering the transfer of the Territory, I hope that they will indicate upon what lines they propose to -deal with it. Tf it is to be administered ,-as it has been, save that the Commonwealth Government stroke is to replace the South Australian Government stroke, I am entirely averse to taking it over. the public servants have to work very hard for their money. the civil servants in any way. But the system of endeavouring to do developmental work with the red-tape that surrounds Government departments member think there would be the slightest chance of carrying a proposal for a land grant railway? presented to us are to leave that country practically vacant or to develop it through the agency of a syndicate, or of the Salvation Army, or some kindred body, surely the Labour Party will be patriotic enough to assist us to settle it.

I look to see how successful developmental work has been done in other parts of the world, and I say that we cannot cite a single instance in which it has been undertaken by a Government upon a large scale. It is true that the Government can assist the enterprise in a thousand different ways, but it cannot successfully perform the initial work. If the Northern Territory is to be transferred to the Commonwealth to be held vacant, or if we are going to squander money upon it, I am entirely opposed to taking it over. Paragraph 20 of His Excellency's Speech makes reference to a Bill which will deal With the much-debated question of the Federal Capital Site.

But I think it is quite possible that the representatives of New South Wales in this Parliament may see their way-in preference to spending the limited amount at our disposal in building a new capital-to recommend that at the end of this Parliament the Seat of Government should be transferred to Sydney. The only feasible objection raised to the adoption of that course was that urged by Mr Carruthers, who said that it might involve the sale or the transfer of a certain area in Sydney to the Commonwealth authorities as Federal territory. I think that that difficulty could be overcome by the flotation of a loan or in some other way. I feel sure that a suitable building in which this Parliament mio-ht meet could be found in Sydney. It seems to me that the plan I have suggested is a common-sense one, which would obviate a vast expenditure. If we are short of anything in Australia it is money.

On the 18th of October last-jus t prior to the general electionhe stated publicly thatWe now resume our original position as an absolutely independent party, without engagements, public or private, expressed or implied, and nothing else except the policy we now put forward-the policy of immediate Tariff revision, of immediately dealing with the reports of the Tariff Commission, which will be knocking at the door when the new Parliament assembles.

The honourable gentleman's object was to show that there was no room for three parties in the House-that there was no room for the Government of the country to be conducted under a tri-party system. In these circumstances, I wish to know how he is going to carry on the Government of Australia. If he really believes what he says, is he going to retain possession of the Treasury Benches, and carry on with the support of a separate politically independent party, or is he going to endeavour to bring to an end a system which he has so often described as utterly destructive of the first principles of responsible government? luncheon given by the Lord Mayor of Melbourne on 9th May, 1904, the honourable and learned gentleman saidI t was three months since he took occasion to call attention to the matter in the most open manner. He pointed out then that there were three parties, and that if two is company and three is none, two parties meant constitutional government, and three were just about equal to none. This statement was received with cheers. He went on to say thatConsequently, one of the chief considerations before Parliament and the public was the reduction of these three parties to two. That declaration is on all-fours with the views expressed by the Prime Minister when, a few months ago, he used the illustration of the tricycle on the bicycle track. On another memorable occasion, he The existence of three parties rendered congovernment impossible, and such a state of things must not, and ought not, to con, tinue. Three wheels could not go along a Instead of taking. the downward path that would lead to political servitude, and perhaps to political slavery, we want to rally to our flag those in favour of responsible government-to restore majoritv rule, and maintain that priceless heritage that our forefathers have handed down to us, and which we should preserve, or perish. These are admirable sentiments beautifully expressed. Does the Prime Minister still ' stand by them? If he does, how can he reconcile them with his present attitude in trying to carry on the Government of the Commonwealth only by the favour of a party which he himself has condemned in the most unmeasured terms ? The position of a Government able to remain in office only by the favour of a party which has not concealed its hostility to them, and which several of its members have described in terms which imagination in its wildest flights could not describe as friendly, is a most degrading one. We have only to turn to the speeches delivered by the Treasurer to learn in what estimation he holds those who, presumably, are according him their support. The sooner some attempt is made to bring about a state of affairs more in accordance with our ideas of responsible governmentto place in office a Ministry with a working majority, and to secure an active Opposi-. tion to check any mischievous legislation that they may attempt-the better it will be.

It seems to me the matter is one for adjustment within the Parliament itself. the Prime Minister deploring the present conditions, and expressing again and again a desire to alter them.

We all know that cabled reports, or newspaper reports at any time, are not always the most reliable source of information; that is especially true of reports in certain newspapers published in Victoria. One fact that strikes me on reading the speechof the Governor General is the omission of any reference whatever to the Naval Agreement. this question loomed so largely at the Imperial Conference, it was reasonable to expect that some reference would be made to it, whereas the fact is there is not a word about it in the speech of His Excellency. If we are to believe the cabled messages published in the newspapers some very important steps were taken by the representatives of Australia, who committed us, or, at any rate, professed to express Australian sentiment in connection with the matter. I venture to sav that Australian sentiment has been absolutely misrepresented in this connection. If the opinion of the (people of Australia were tested to-morrow it would be found that, so far from there being any desire to modify the terms of the Naval Agreement, the desire is rather to retain the Agreement for as long a period as possible, only on much more liberal conditions than our present contribution fulfils. more prominently than another, as a matter of regret, so far as the people of Australia are concerned, it is that we pay so little towards the up-keep of the Imperial Navy in Australian waters. Our contribution is something like £200,000 a year, while the Imperial Government spend in Australia on the Navy something like £300,000 in excess of our contribution. '£700,000. Sir WILLIAM £500,000. ment stronger, seeing that the amount I mentioned is corfsiderably smaller than the actual expenditure. Even from the most sordid point of view we have decidedly the best of the bargain; and on the ground of self-interest alone we should be making the most fatal mistake if we modified the Naval Agreement in any way. Of course, it may be that the Prime Minister was incorrectly reported; but, at any rate, all the leading newspapers published similar cablegrams, and I should like to read one or two extracts from reports which were published in the Sydney Morning Herald and also, I believe, the Melbourne Age:Lord Tweedmouth (First Lord of the Admiralty) stated that as the result of interviews with the Australasian delegates, he was now able to summarize the Admiralty's decisions. So far as Australia and New Zealand were concerned, the Admiralty would be willing to leave the conSeeing that tinuance of the present subsidy entirely in their hands, leaving them to do whatever they thought best. He realized that Australia did not favour the present mode of contribution. The Admiralty was willing to adopt the principle of Australia choosing for herself, especially as the Admiralty wished to be relieved of the obligations of the agreement respecting the strength of the squadron to be kept on the Australian station. It is very clear from this statement that something of a definite character must have been said as to the attitude of Australia towards the Naval Agreement. Whatever may have been the actual words used, the impression was evidently left on the mind of Lord Tweedmouth, and, I suppose, on the mind of the British public, that the Australian people had expressed views indicating that they were tired of the agreement, and desired to get rid of the expense of contributing towards the maintenance of the Imperial Navy in Australian waters. As I gather from the English newspapers, the idea was that the Australian people If one fact stands out thought the money would be better expended in building the nucleus of a fleet of their own. Although that may be the opinion and desire of a certain section of the Australian community, that section is extremely limited in number. So far as the press is concerned, I believe there is only one newspaper-the mendacious Age, published in Melbourne-that has expressed views of the kind. able member not think it better to have local vessels for coastal defence? any way undervalue the advantages of having a local navy, or the nucleus of a local navy, for coastal and harbour defence, but I do not desire to see such a force substituted for the vessels of the Imperial Squadron, and placed under separate control.

For many years to come we must rely upon the British Fleet as our first line of defence. However anxious some of our friends may be to cut the painter, and establish an Australian Republic, they will be obliged, in their own interest, to wait for the realization of their possessing no auxiliary power. At the desires until our population becomes very much larger than it is at present. lishment of an Australian republic? the honourable member does, but there are those associated with him who do. I believe that the Labour Party, as a whole, recognises the truth of what I have stated. must buv its cabbages in Svdney. the next agreement comes to be considered Victoria will insist that no cabbages shall be supplied to the ships except from Melbourne. Such a demand would be in keeping with her (policy ever since the inauguration of Federation. shall not deal with this subject at greater length, because the Governor General has told us that it is proposed to introduce a progressive scheme of coastal and harbour defence, and when it is under consideration we shall be able to go more fully into the general question. The Minister of Trade and Customs informed us this afternoon that our delegates to the Navigation Conference in London succeeded in getting considerable concessions to Australian sentiment. sions to Australian sentiment, but substantial concessions in regard to the framing of legislation. sions to sentiment. I am quite willing to give the members of the Conference credit for the good work done by them, but some most important things did not receive attention at all. No doubt this omission arose from the fact that none of the representatives of Australia possessed any nautical knowledge. One of the members of our Navigation .Commission, Senator Guthrie, has had a nautical training, and should have been one of the Australian delegation. His practical knowledge would have been of great service to the Conference. In the absence of the official reports, I cannot speak with accurate knowledge of what was done; but, judging by the reports received by cablegram, no mention was made at the Conference about the periodical surveying of ships. was dealt with and settled. know it. I saw no reference to any provision for securing the safety of steamers present time many steamers carry no effective sails, and have only one propeller, upon which they rely wholly as their means for reaching one port from another. Should the tail-shaft break, or the blades be stripped from the propeller, such a vessel would, if on a lee shore, and the wind strong, be unable to save herself from destruction. like that. mail steamers and other passenger vessels rely wholly upon a single propeller, and it is by the greatest good fortune in the world that we have not had on our coast accidents such as I speak of, resulting in However, I an appalling loss of life. Numbers of steamers in the Australian trade have broken down, and have drifted for weeks at the mercy of wind and wave; but the breakages which have crippled them havehappened when they were away from land. Let honourable members imagine cases of that kind happening on the coast of New South Wales during the prevalence of a south-easterly gale. Let them picture a ship fitted with ,a single propeller and a couple of sticks which are unable to carry enough sail to keep her off the lee shore. There would be absolutely nothing to prevent her from being dashed to pieces upon the rocks. That is one of the matters which was overlooked at the Navigation Conference, notwithstanding that it was one of the most important which should have engaged attention. It is little short of criminal to permit persons to send ships to sea under conditions such as I have outlined. Every vessel should be fitted with twin propellers, or should be able to carry sufficient sail to render her independent of steam incase of an accident to her screw. think of that? went a long way further than that.

309,Sir William Lyne,"The Conferencediscussed the propriety of installing the -Marconi system of wireless telegraphy upon every vessel. adoption of the Marconi system would not be of much aid to a ship in a case such as I have described, except that it might be the means of procuring assistance from a port which might be some 200 or 300 miles distant when the margin of safety might be a matter of minutes. Another matter to which I desire to address myself has reference to the equipment of ships with life-saving gear. It is true that provision is made for carrying a certain number of boats, but if the Minister of Trade and Customs took the trouble to note the way in which these boats are made fast on some of the vessels sailing to and from our ports, and are covered up, he could not fail to be struck by the fact that in nine cases out of ten it would be impossible to launch one of them in a heavy sea in less than twenty minutes or half-an-hour. overboard and had him aboard the vessel again in seventeen minutes. modern mail steamers, but of the smaller vessels which trade along our coast. The boats which they carry, in many instances, have rusted in the chocks in which they rest, and have been painted there year after year until boats, chocks, lashings, gear, and davits seem to be one solid mass, and it would take the entire crew the best portion of an hour to launch one of them in calm water.

It is bad enough for such conditions to obtain in vessels which are confined to the smooth waters of the harbour, but it is a great reflection upon the responsible authorities when they apply to vessels which go to sea. It was alleged that when the Albion was placed in dock for a periodical overhaul, workmen were warned not to hit too hard with the chipping hammers because they might go through her plates.

328,Mr Johnson,"I admit that the Minpossible. In this connection, it is rather amusing to recollect the speeches which were delivered by the Prime Minister and the Minister of Trade and Customs during the recent election campaign and prior to that period. During the last Parliament, we were assured that the industries of Australia, and particularly those of Victoria, were in a most deplorable condition. The spectacle was presented to us of honourable members upon the Ministerial side of the House organizing agony dinner meetings at which they urged all the factory employees to agitate for an immediate revision of the Tariff, with a view to securing an increased measure of protection, and so averting the ruin of languishing industries. So urgent were these meetings deemed to be that some Ministerial supporters actually sacrificed their luncheons in order that they might lose no opportunity of arousing the operatives to a proper appreciation of the position. Upon one memorable occasion, at least, the House was counted out while the Government whip was absent on an expedition of that kind. Government which was counted out. to the occasion when the honourable member for Bourke arrived just too late to save the situation. I mention this matter with a view to showiilg how anxious the Government were to deal with the Tariff question at that timeThey urged that it would not admit of a moment's delay. The late Attorney-General, who has since been translated to a quieter, and I hope more congenial sphere, actuallv shed crocodile tears whilst assuring us that so great was the distress amongst languishing industries throughout Australia that he felt it a difficult matter to conscientiouslv eat his Christmas dinner. Then the Prime Minister, in Adelaide, some fifteen months ago, saidThe circumstances of our situation have made protection indispensable here and now. Until the fiscal policy of the country is placed on a sound economic basis the discussion of the other with the framing of the new Tariff-lef t great problems pressing upon us can never receive our undivided attention. Notwithstanding that declaration by the Prime Minister uporo 29th March last year, no attempt was made to deal with the Tariff as the session progressed. Later on, speaking of the reports of the Tariff Commission, the Prime Minister saidThey must be ready for presentation early next For there was no necessity to delay the year. ' So we sav, and I think the public will say with one voice, that nothing can justify the work of Parliament and remove to Engburying of the reports and recommendations of the Commission when they are presented in the first session of the new Parliament. The honourable and learned gentleman was then referring to the first session of this Parliament. But what was our experience? Notwithstanding this declaration, as soon as we met, the Prime Minister came down to the House, with no proposal to deal with the Tariff, or anything in that direction. Despite his earnest declaration -receive d by the people of Victoria with frantic cheers-h e laid aside the Tariff as not being of [pressing importance, and went off to attend the Imperial Conference, although he had no mandate from the people to represent Australia there. When such declarations are followed by such an unnecessary delay in any attempt at execution we are entitled to doubt very much the sincerity of the professions of the Prime Minister and the members of his Government in this or any other regard. Referring to the fact that the leader of the Opposition would, willy nilly, have to face the fiscal question as soon as the reports of the Tariff Commission were presented, the Prime Minister saidI say, in these circumstances, it would be criminal to put the fiscal question aside. What is to become of the great work of the Commission if the recommendations of the Commission are not to be dealt with. (Cheers.) In reviewing the coming elections for the next Parliament, never forget this cardinal fact, that the Tariff Commission will be knocking at its door the day that it assembles. to put the question aside? would be criminal to lay aside the reports of the Tariff Commission in the first session of the new Parliament, vet we were not asked to deal with any of them in that session. Although the Tariff Commission was knocking at the door, and demanding early consideration of its reports, the Prime Minister, together with the Minister of Trade and Customs, and the Comptroller of Customs-wh o were all intimately connected for England on a four months' trip. Meantime the Tariff Commission was still vainly knocking at the door of Parliament, and demanding the immediate attention which the Prime Minister had declared it would be criminal to withhold.

Is a bounty again to be proposed for the production of peanuts? member is not careful he will have the same fate that befell "" peanuts."" likely to meet with that fate for some time, although it often befalls those least deserving of it. There are honourable, members whom we could have spared far better than some we have lost. The system of encouraging industries by means of bounties is, save in very exceptional circumstances, a most pernicious one. Whenever a bounty is granted, we almost invariably have a demand for an extension of the period originally fixed for its payment. In this way, we have put before us propositions for sliding scales extending over a number of years, and these in turn are followed by proposals for imposing protective duties as soon as the bounty is entirely removed. In these circumstances, I think we should be very chary in adopting the principle of granting bounties. A better means of encouraging new industries is to be found by co-operating with the States in the extension of agricultural and technical colleges, so that the best information may be imparted to those engaging in primary production. money is to be spent for the encouragement of industries, it would be much more -justifiable to distribute it in some such way as that than to give direct bounties to 'producers. I see that the appointment of a High Commissioner is referred to in His Excellency's Speech in the following terms: Though immigration to the Commonwealth is -generally increasing, its growth is not in any -degree commensurate with our needs or opportunities. The conditions under which it is proceeding call for serious consideration. The ap'pointment of a Commonwealth High Commissioner, urgent on many grounds, will supply the necessary authority in the mother country. No one, I think, disagrees with that view; but where trouble may possibly arise will De in selecting a suitable gentleman for the office, and it would be interesting to learn what are the Government intentions. 'Is the House to be consulted, or is the appointment to be an Executive act, irrespective of the wishes of honourable members? In another place a desire was expressed that there should be a joint sitting of the two Houses for the purpose of considering the matter; and that is a proposal which should seriously commend itself to the Government. At any rate, the House might be enlightened as to what course the the honourable Government intend to pursue. The matter of harbour and coastal defence I shall leave to a later period, when the terms of the Government proposals are before us. I should like, however, to draw attention to 'the cancellation of the mail contract. Paragraph 10 of His Excellency's Speech is as follows:I regret to inform you that the new mail contract, vid Suez, has been cancelled; fresh tenders will be invited to-morrow. An arrangement has been almost completed with the Orient Company for an extension of their current contract for another year. The whole proceeding in connection with this mail contract reflects anything but credit on the business capabilities of the present Administration. The Commonwealth of Australia has been, held up before the eyes of the world in a very unenviable light. The Government cannot complain that the circumstances which have arisen were entirely unforeseen when the negotiations for the contract were entered into. When the terms of the contract were laid on the table of the House some honourable members oh this side, including the honourable member for North Sydney, the honI f any public orable member for Parramatta, myself, and others, drew special attention to the fact that the contract was very loosely drawn ' up, and that a great want of foresight had been exhibited in its preparation. We contended that the amount of the deposit wa« ridiculously small, considering the financial interests involved, and that there ought to have been a cash deposit, that there ought to have been a time fixed for the commencement of the construction of the vessels, and a penalty provided for the non-fulfilment of the conditions of the contract. But all these suggestions were poohpoohed by the Prime Minister, the Postmaster-General, and other members of the Government. Our attempts to safeguard -the interests of the community were regarded as not worth listening to, because, I suppose, the objections proceeded from members of the Opposition; at least, I take that to have been the main reason for the Government's inattention to obvious",52,Honourable Members Hear Hear

Apparently there was never any serious intention to go on with the contract, but it was merely an option which a certain syndicate had power to hawk round for twelve months,' and which could then be dropped without any serious loss to the members of the syndicate. Now that the anticipations and fears of the Opposition have been realized, I am glad to have the assurance of the Prime Minister of the. day that safeguards of the kind suggested by the Opposition on the last occasion will be placed in the new contract. on without the Opposition. vernment have very much to thank the Opposition for. The Opposition has assisted the Government in a way which reflects the highest credit on honourable members on this side; they have, certainly improved many of the Government measures, and made them much more acceptable to the people. Opposition altered any of the measures. ment measure was carried in the form in which it was introduced, and I am glad to find the Minister of Trade and Customs so grateful and appreciative of the assistance we have rendered. In connection with the mail contract, I should like to call attention to the following paragraph, which appeared to-night in the Melbourne Herald:The determination of the Federal Cabinet to cancel the mail contract when it was thought the capital required by the Laing syndicate was about to be subscribed in London is attributed, in some quarters, to the influence of New South Wales members, who are stated to be jealous of the bargain made by the Victorian Government under the guarantee scheme., Will the Minister of Trade and Customs tell us whether that alleged reason is the true one-whethe r the cancellation of the contract is due to the action of representatives of New South Wales? I have been led to believe myself that the contract was cancelled from motives of an entirely different character, and that there is absolutely no truth in the statement in the newspaper. However, the contract has been cancelled, and I suppose we have seen the end of what, to call it by the best name possible) is a very bad piece of commercial business for the Commonwealth. Another matter referred to in His Excellency's speech is that of the Federal Capital site -almos t at the end of the speech. tionally. whether it was done intentionally, but it would be interesting to know whether the fact that the reference to the question is' almost at the end of His Excellency's speech, and is confined to one line, is an indication that the consideration of the matter is to be held over till late in the session. I hope that is not the case, because the people of New South Wales regard this as a serious question-as a failure of the Commonwealth Parliament and of the other States to keep the compact with New South Wales', a compact which was largely responsible for inducing New South Wales to enter the Federation. The delay has caused an immense amount of irritation and dissatisfaction in the mother State, and is looked upon as a serious breach of faith. I hope the question is not going to be hung up indefinitely, but that it wil? receive prompt attention. It is to beI do not think the trusted that the present Ministry, if they remain in possession of the Treasurybenches long enough, will bring down some proposal at an early date, so that the matter may be settled once and for all. I notice that the Minister of Trade and Customs said nothing about the Federal Capital in the course of his remarks. to matters dealt with by the acting leader of the Opposition, who did not say 'anything about the Federal Capital site.

However, I do not wish to dwell on the subject longer now. No doubt, other representatives of New South Wales will have something to say about it, and the House will has find that we are very much in earnest in regard to it. I assure the representatives of other States who are so anxious to secure the transcontinental railway that, if they, seek the support of New South Wales, they must first give some consideration to the Federal Capital question. They have no written bond, whereas we have a bond signed by the Premiers of all the States. it had been fulfilled, we should not find in the Governor General's Speech a reference Dalgety was to the proposed introduction of a Bill relating to a site for the Seat of Government. If the matter has been dealt with, why do not the supporters of the Government ask what is meant by introducing legislation relating to a matter which has been settled? The paragraph to which I That refer is an admission that the matter has not. been settled, and if I had had no other justification for referring to it, it would have been sufficient to cause me to do so. The people of New South Wales have another grievance. Reference was made by the Governor General to the appointment of a Commonwealth Meteorologist. But why was it necessary to bring that officer from Sydney, and to locate him in Melbourne? We hear a great deal about the Federal spirit from the representatives of Victoria, but so far as they and the newspapers which support them are concerned, the opinion seems to be held that Victoria is the whole Commonwealth, and that no part of the country outside this State is worth consideration.

Everything must be concentrated in Melbourne, and it has been said by the Premier of the State that Melbourne is the centre of the Federation. Victorian members are never tired of talking of the parochialism of the representatives of the other States, whereas they are themselves the most parochial in their views of any body of men in the universe. An officer in the other States cannot get a yard of red tape without referring to Melbourne. What a fine outcry there would have been in Victoria if all the Federal offices had been located at Adelaide, Sydney, or Brisbane. There would have been nothing but denunciation of such an un-Federal act. It is, however, quite right to concentrate them in Melbourne, which, according to Victorians, is the hub of the universe. I do not complain because Victorians exhibit the parochial spirit, but I take exception to their grumbling about the parochialism of the representatives of other States who ask for the fair recognition of the rights of their people. The mention of the Federal Capital within the hearing of a Victorian is like the waving of a red rag in the sight of a bull. Passing away from the Federal Capital question, I wish to refer to the proposal of the Government to take over the control of beacons and ocean lights. Although the matter is mentioned in the last paragraph of the Governor General's Speech, it is one of the most important with which we can deal. Undoubtedly there should be a central authority to control the lighting of our coasts. Our sea borne trade is constantly increasing, and the adequate lighting of our coasts cannot be left entirely to the Governments of the States, because it entails a burden which some of the less populous States are unable to bear. During my recent visit to the Northern Territory I had an opportunity of seeing how inadequately the Queensland coast is lighted. lighted. lighted within the Barrier Reef. I went very carefully over the charts of that coast with the captains of the vessels by which I voyaged, and with members of the Torres Straits Pilots' Association whom T met, and was supplied with a list of eighteen or twenty places where, I am assured, lights or beacons are urgently needed. A portion of that coast is not much better lighted now than it was twenty or thirty years ago, when the traffic was much less. and dangerous navigation is between Palmerston and Sandy Cape. Even the most experienced pilots are obliged to anchor for one or two nights, and sometimes in thick, hazy weather more frequently. This imposes a heavy charge upon ship-owners, and now that our trade is incieasing so largely, demanding the use of faster and bigger vessels, the necessity for more lights has become a pressing one. the recommendations to-day. There is to be a light near Cape York, and another close to Port Darwin. We cannot do .everything at once. gest that light-houses are needed at all the places to which I refer, because beacons would be sufficient in some instances. Some time ago a very valuable light, situated off the Proudfoot Shoal, was removed, and I have been informed by a pilot that, in consequence of its removal, three fine steamers have had narrow escapes within the last few months. that a light be placed there. tice has been to compel lighthouse-keepers to remain at their posts for a protracted period, and the isolation of their situation has often caused melancholia. This trouble can' be got over by giving frequent reliefs. I do not propose to refer at length to the taking over of the Northern Territory, because I have already been speaking longer than I intended to speak. But as the honourable member for Fawkner seemed to indicate that he favours a system of land grants in connection with the construction of railways there, I wish to say that I hope that that system will not be adopted. One of our duties is to guard against the monopolization of natural opportunities. The contention which has been advanced in opposition to land value taxation and measures of that kind has been that vested interests have become so gigantic that such taxation would in some cases amount to confiscation. member build railways there without the",55,Honourable Members Hear Hear

That question is not involved. Some honourable members seem to be unable to discriminate between sound business propositions allowing the greatest possible individual 'freedom, and State control and regulation involving the negation of the principle of individual freedom so necessary for the development of any country. I hope, at any rate, that no proposals will be submitted which will permit of the alienation of any territory acquired by the Commonwealth in such a way that the people's rights may be disregarded, and those very conditions brought about which, under similar systems, we have found it so difficult to get rid of hitherto. been the experience of land grant railways in other countries. Surely that experience ought to warn us against introducing the system in Australia. If we are going to promote white settlement in the Territory, I see no reason why we should not adopt the experiment of building its railways by white labour. If the necessary lines are constructed by white labour, a fair opportunity will be afforded of testing whether the country can be successfully settled by that means. Personally I believe that it can. The greatest evil that we have to fear in connection with the Northern Territory is the drink evil. So long as the white man there keeps away from the hotel, I think it is quite possible that he may be able to develop it without the aid of Asiatic or any other alien labour. employed upon the railway which .was constructed to Pine Creek? sured me that they were mostly Chinese. all white men. men in the Territory who did not seem to suffer from climatic conditions, but most of the women there did not appear to be of too healthy a type.

Before we talk seriously about developing the Territory with alien coloured labour we might very well try the experiment of constructing the railways which are necessary there by white labour, and of giving those who are thus employed an opportunity to acquire lands for the purposes of cultivation. There are one or two other matters to which I had intended to refer, but I do not propose to trespass upon the time of the House at greater length. Regarding the work of the session, I trust that the Government will exercise a little more care than they/ have previously exhibited in the preparation of their measures. When Bills are submitted to the House, I hope that We know what has they will be dealt with immediately, and that the practice of introducing them and of then withdrawing them temporarily and proceeding with the consideration of other measures will be discontinued. I trust, too, that we shall not witness the spectacle of Ministers bringing down Bills, laying them upon the table, and afterwards introducing amendments which are even more numerous than the clauses of the Bills themselves. I thank honourable members for the attention which they have given me, and I hope that I have not exhausted their patience. I trust that the feeling which has thus far been exhibited in the debate will continue throughout the session, so that we may part at its close with the kindliest recollections of one another. I had placed the matter of the Federal Capital last among the subjects upon which I had intended to touch during the course of my remarks, but, after listening to the observations of the honourable member for Lang, and recalling the position which has been taken up by the Premier of New South Wales upon this question, I wish, in making my initial bow to the House, to enter my protest against the ridiculous parochial spirit which is being fanned by certain members.

I was amused, during the Premiers' Conference in Brisbane, to note the querulousness exhibited by the Premier of New South Wales in regard to the non-representation of the States by their Premiers at the Imperial Conference. To my mind, that was about the worse note that could possibly have been struck. Surely the day has arrived when the people of this continent should be known as Australians, and not as parochial New South Welshmen, Victorians or South Australians. Concerning the Capital SiteI have no grievance whatever, although I am a New South Wales representative. But I do hope that the Government will make all speed to definitely determine this question. The Commonwealth Parliament has already done its share in that direction. I throw the blame for the present unsatisfactory position upon the New South Wales Administration, which failed to meet this Parliament in a fair and honourable way. I have not a predisposition for any site, because I have not had an opportunity of viewing any of them. Perhaps before the question is finally settled I shall be afforded such an opportunity. It seems to me, however, that a definite stand should be made against the Seat of Government being permanently established either in Sydney or Melbourne. I shall certainly vote against either of those cities being made the Federal Capital. compelled to do so if he respects the Constitution. the honourable member that an underground endeavour is now being made to make Sydney the Seat of Government.

My ideal of a Federal city is one built well within our territory, and possessing such a grand natural protection as our great Dividing Range w'ould afford. ber imagines that I am so parochial as to advocate the selection of a site there he is very much mistaken. Buti f , after an examination of the eligible sites, I were of opinion that Armidale was the best, I would certainly vote for it. I wish to see a site selected where all the archives of State may be kept, where the bullion of the banks may be put awaya site which may be held against any attack, and which might be surrounded by our land forces,even after a large portion of our coastal fringe had been taken by an enemy. We should approach this matter in a national spirit, and not in a parochial one. I was very much interested ini the remarks of the honourable member for Lang upon the question of defence. He raised the old shriek in reference to "" cutting the painter."" To me, it is most amusing to hear honourable members yelling-becaus e any man dares to criticise British administration-that he desires to ""cut the painter."" To my mind, the true patriot is a man who will make a fight to bring the laws of his country into harmony with what is just. I am loyal to the British peopleI am descended from them-and I feel that the greatest safeguard to Australia to-day is that the British flag floats over her, and that she enjoys the protection of the British Navy. orable member growling at? honourable member for raising the ridiculous cry that there are men here who want to "" cut the painter."" It is all very well to talk about the British flag, and the great protection afforded by the British fleet, so long as the world is at peace, but the day may yet come when Great Britain will be involved in an international war, when she will have to call that fleet to the centre of the Empire, and Australia will have to do a little for her own defence. Should that Personally, I object either to day arrive, how are we to make anything like a stand against the invading hordes of Chinese or 'Japanese?

404,Mr Foster,"I am growling at the subject immediately under consideration, I wish to say that to me the peculiar feature of this debate is the attitude of the Opposition. I was astounded to hear so mild a speech from the deputy leader of the Opposition. statements published in a section of the press, during the general election, that the occupants of the Ministerial benches were most outrageous people, and I at least expected in this, the first debate in the 'House in which I have taken part, to hear the Ministry severely castigated by the Opposition. Instead of that, however, I listened to a speech from the deputy leader of the Opposition, so meek and mild, that it might have come from one of the supporters of the Government who has a small grievance. Lang made a for more vigorous speech, but I was grieved as I watched the clock and saw a whole half-hour being devoted by him to a speech on the tri-party system. This three-party system seems to be a source of much trouble to the honourable member. To my mind, the real reason for the outcry is to be found in the fact that of the three sections in the House, the Labour Party possesses, and has possessed for some time, the greatest power. But we have placed in the hands of the people of the Commonwealth, an instrument by which they can determine this great question,, and it is to them we must look for a settlement. I am so optimistic as to believe that the time is rapidly approaching when the people -will definitely settle it by returning to this Parturned to this House a party with a proliament an overwhelming majority of the members of the party to which I belong. I was highly amused to hear the honourable member for Lang refer to the Labour Partv as Socialists. shall speak of the Opposition as the "" Anarchist Party."" Socialists ? is in office, honourable members opposite will find that they possess sufficient common sense to submit to the consideration of the Parliament something that is immediately practicable. They will find that tlw difference between the Labour Party and the Socialist Party lies in the fact that the former is a body of level-headed men, conscious of the great Tory opposition which confronts them, and fully aware that behind the Opposition and others who try to obstruct progress there stand two consolidated anarchistic bodies the large land monopolists and the big financiers. Government to quit? the Opposition. It will be time enough to describe the Labour Party as Socialists when a Labour Administration comes forward with a proposal to adopt Socialism. scribe themselves as Socialists. against that Socialism which means cooperation, but I do most emphatically protest against the absurd, farcical and ridiculous scarecrow put up by the leader of the Opposition and others, and labelled The honourable member for ""Socialism."" When I know that every Sunday in the Sydney Domain, what is known as the Socialist Party denounces the Labour Party as not being socialistic, I feel constrained to ask whether, in this matter, the Socialists themselves ought not to be regarded as the best judges. If a member of the party to which I belong declared that the Opposition were not free traders, who would be the most competent judges to deal with the assertion? This matter is one on which I feel very strongly. In view of the consternation with which the great financiers and land monopolists have viewed even the meagre proposals put forward for democracy at any time in its history, I often wonder what sort of panic would occur among them if there were reposal for the practical application of the principles of Christianity to every-day life. What kind of panic would take place amongst those gentlemen if , for instance, I think thatj'n future I it were provided"" Thou shalt take no usury."" Socialist say that it is better to give than to receive. that the honourable member -has heard much from the Socialists. As a matter of fact, there has not been in the House a Socialist Party to .tell him anything regarding its principles.

I am here to fight for immediately practicable measures-measure s that can be brought into existence within the next three years. Socialism may be a grand scheme to renovate humanity; it may be practical Christianity; but I am forced to realize that we must not waste the time of the House in dealing with mere dreams or ideals. If the aspirations of the party are immediately practicable, well and good; I shall be willing to support them. I take exception to the omission from His Excellency's Speech of any reference to the question of the consolidation of the States' debts. The recent Conference of Premiers in Brisbane was attended by the Treasurer, and I am sorry that a Labour Premier, instead of the acting leader of the Ministry, was not present when Mr Carruthers said that the States Governments were in a better position than the Commonwealth to deal with the debts of the States since they had States banks, because a Labour Premier would have undoubtedly replied at once"" Very good; we shall have a National bank and deal with them."" Sir spoke of savings banks. tutions. I also note that there is no reference in the speech to the taking over of the railways of the States. But while admitting that there seems to be a want of sincerity in many directions, I am faced with the pleasing fact that the piece de resistance of the programme for the session is the proposal for an effective system of protection. whole hog"" with the Government in establishing a good' efficient system of protection-on e that will make Australia self-supporting. This proposal has been dangled too long before the public. I might remind honourable members that I come into this Chamber displacing an old gentleman named Lonsdale who was an ardent free trader. In me the House sees the change from the old order to the new, and the new order is "" Australia for the Australians, whether they are born here or imported."" The only way to give effect to such a policy is to establish an effective system of pro-' tection, which will afford abundance of employment to Australians. When I hear in other States parochial squirmings against Victoria, I cannot help thinking that the chief cause of complaint is that Victoria, because of her previous system of protection, is in this respect slightly in advance of the others. starch trade, with its 30s. a week for married men. matter. The honourable member has referred to something which is of deep interest to me, as well as to-honourable members generally on this side of the House. We hear a lot nowadays of the new protection, and whilst I have not come into this House in the belief that I can revolutionize it, I feel that I may be able to assist those who have been so earnestly at work in the interests of democracy and help them to push that democracy a little further. I wish at this stage to pay a tribute to my .comrades of the party for the good work they have already done in the House. Why do we find in this Parliament to-day men who some years ago were Tories, standing up for the new protection ? Does not their attitude show that the Labour Party has been working with some effectiveness? Does it not show that men have been educated up to a recognition of JOHN FORREST Mr Carruthers the altered position of affairs, when we find even members of the Ministry agreeing with us that a system of protection such as that prevailing in Americaa system under which great industries primarily, totally or mostly in the interests of a class, the wealthy monopolists, are built up-is not what we need for Australia? That which we desire is, first of all, an effective Tariff, to enable the manufacturer to carry on his industry, and secondly, a system I am prepared to "" go the whereby we shall be able to insure to every, man or woman employed in that industry a fair wage for employment extending over a reasonable number of hours. I hope that concurrently with the passing of the Tariff we shall have the valued assistance of the majority of honourable members in securing a reasonable amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which will keep the lawyers out of the Court. I lived for two veirs in New Zealand, where I saw in ' operation an Act which provided that if one of the parties to a proceeding before the Conciliation and Arbitration Court objected to the presence of a lawyer in the case, he was not permitted to appear.

It is unfair to make such an insinuation. The Labour Party know that the only way to defend this country is to fill it with white men, and they are determined to bring those men here. But before-this is done, they are of opinion that Australians should have the first "" show"" of getting homes for themselves. Amongst Australians are men who have pioneered the way, not only for us younger men born on the soil, but for men who will come from the old country. It is not fair that there should be a land system under which preference is given to new comers over people who have toiled to make the Commonwealth what it is to-day. When the land hunger of Australian men and women is satisfied, then the Labour Party would throw open the gates and welcome Britishers-Englishmen , Irishmen, Scotchmen, Welshmen-and also the members of any white race, but not "" Chinkees"" or Japanese.

I did not visit it with other members of this Parliament recently, and was consequently unable to do any "" Rougemonting."" I have not, like the honourable member for Lang, ridden on an alligator, nor did I find cannons under a cairn. But I am not jealous of those who had these adventures. StillI am afraid that they did not see very much of the country, because the arrangements were such that their opportunities for doing so were very meagre. I should be willing to make one to go to the Northern Territory if facilities were given for a trip to it right across the continent. Such a journey would enable honourable members to see very much more of the country than they have yet seen. I am almost inclined to vote for the taking over of the Northern Territory by the Commonwealth in the interests of the defence of Australia, provided that the financial conditions are such as I can endorse; but I have yet to give the matter very careful consideration. To secure the development of that country it is necessary that we should have a proper geological survey of it, so that we may know what its mineral In my possibilities are. We know what Ballarat, Bendigo, and other mining fields have clone to attract and keep population, and it would mean a great deal to the Northern Territory if a good mining field were opened up there. discover one nearer home? Perhaps my honourable friend thinks that, because I am a member of the Labour Party, I am opposed to the investment of capital. My contention has always been that the investment of capital in mining is a splendid thing for the country, and I would always vote for the encouragement of such investment. I should like to see £100,000,000 invested in this country in speculative mining. Although many of us may live to see the day when it will be necessary to nationalize many manufacturing and other industries, none of us will see the nationalization of speculative mining. By speculative mining I mean mining for precious minerals, and I do not include iron and coal. The mining for iron and coal are industries which might well be nationalized to-day. But in regard to all industries, it is our duty to see that the men employed are paid decent wages, and required to work only decent hours, and that every safeguard is adopted for the prevention of accidents and injuries. That is what some honourable members refer to when they speak of confiscation. I wish to express my pleasure at the statement of the honourable member for Lang that he is opposed to the adoption of the land grant system for the making of railways in connection with the development of the Northern Territory. I voice the opinion of the members of the Labour. Party when I say that we are emphatically opposed to that system. I hope no such system will be adopted. For a new member, I have already occupied sufficient time. every member to give his opinions upon matters brought before this House, and, as I become more accustomed to parliamentary usages, and to the interjections of the members of the Opposition, I hope to give more effective service.

But contract earned £ 1 6 a week between them. there is a great deal of dissatisfaction with the administration of the Commonwealth worked twenty-five hours out of the Government, and I intend to mention one or twenty-four. two instances which give point to it. In my opinion, the complaints which we hear earned at contract work depends on the are largely due to lack of knowledge of the condition of the cane and the length of time conditions of the Commonwealth on the part worked. The point I wish to make is that of our legislators. When the sugar indusnumbers of men came forward and actry was being dealt with by Parliament, it cepted contracts at the old prices. Yet was agreed that a bounty should be given to this ordinance was passed which fixed the growers who employed white labour only, minimum price at 4s. That upset the whole but that, to obtain it, growers must pay a industry. It evidences a woeful lack of living wage. Of course, none of us desires to see men working for less than a knowledge living wage. There cannot be true prostry that this ordinance should have been perity while any class of the population passed when there were four different disdoes that. Therefore, exception could not tricts declared by the Department be taken to the provision to which I have referred.

The present ordinance with regard to wages is upon a thoroughly common-sense basis. the whole of the circumstances disclose a lack of a proper grip of the conditions of the industrya lack of knowledge which is to be seen in the conduct of Federal affairs generally. That is the cause of the dissatisfaction with and distrust in Federal administration which we are very sorry to know exists to-day. ample which was recently set by certain Ministers in travelling through our northern State will be continued. It is hopeless to expect sympathy between the people of the north and the Commonwealth Government unless southern residents do their best to get into touch with the conditions under which we live there. member must not forget that the first ordinance issued was at the iequest of the planters. The next matter to which I desire to refer is that of granting proposed bounties. I wish to speak particularly of bounties for agricultural products. The proposal previously submitted by the Ministry dealt specially with tropical agriculture. I think that the adoption of the bonus system is a dangerous one in principle. If it be decided to offer bonuses, they should certainly disappear at the end of a prescribed period. If an industry be worth fostering by means of a bonus, it should be an industry which in a certain number of years will be able to stand upon its own feet. I feel sure that the money proposed to be offered in the form of bonuses might be much better spent in procuring machinery which would be of assistance to producers. The idea which I have in my mind is one which has been adopted in the United States -that most progressive country-and which has proved of immense assistance in developing the different industries there. think there is what is called a Department of the Interior. Under that Department, there are a number of bureaux. For instance, there is the Agricultural Bureau which devotes its attention exclusively to fostering that industry throughout the Union, and which works in coniunction with the States Agricultural Colleges and Experimental Farms. It has a network of correspondents all over the world, whose duty it is to keep it advised of the movements of the markets as they He realized the force of their conaffect the producers, and also to keep it posted regarding any new products which they think might with advantage be cultiStill vated in their own country. All the information thus collected is published and broadcasted among the farmers, to whom it has been of immense assistance. If a similar department or bureau were established here it would be a ' far better means of encouraging agriculture and of enabling farmers to get into touch with those I hope that the exbranches of agriculture which might be most profitably followed by them than would the payment of the proposed bounties. Such an, agricultural bureau would, I hope, mark the first step towards the establishment of a Department of the Interior. In addition to the Agricultural Department, we might also have a Department of Forestry. It is true that the States Governments deal with forest administration in a very small and inefficient way, but I think the work might be better done for the whole of Australia by a central auI am aware of that. thority. There should be an office or bureau dealing with geology, and a Survey Department dealing with every branch of survey work throughout Australia. We know very little about the surface of our own country. I think it was the previous speaker who remarked that we ought to have a thorough survey of the Northern Territory before we undertake to settle it . The same remark is applicable to the whole of Australia. There are many portions of the Continent which are just as badly in need of a survey as is the Northern Territory. Then, to complete the Department of the Interior, we should establish an I m migration Bureau. We have recently seen the efforts which have been made to secure labour from the southern States for the sugar-growers in the north. There has, however, been no proper organization to undertake that task, and we should certainly have in the interests alike of the employer and the worker a Federal LabourI Bureau which would bring together those who want the work, and those who require the labour. The next matter to which I . desire to refer is that of defence, particularly in its relation to our cadet system. I understand that an honourable member proposes to submit a motion in favour of compulsory universal service, but I think that we ought to commence at the beginning. A t the present time our cadet system confines the movement to a limited",64,Honourable Members No Go On
445,Mr Austin Chapman,The honourable,65,Honourable Members No Go On
446,,"Mr ARCHERnumber of our school boys. The expense involved, prevents the greater number of them from participating in that movement. To my mind it is highly desirable that we should make it universal, and if we are to do that we must abolish all unnecessary expense. It is quite unnecessary for the boys to be uniformed for the purposes of being drilled and trained. Consequently we should allow the parents to provide, say, a khakee jumper which would be useful as , part of the lad's clothing, whilst the Government furnished them with dummy rifles which would familiarize them with the handling of weapons. The Government should provide short ranges for practising, a certain number of rifles, and also instructors. The cost to the people should be made as small as possible, and that could be brought about by the means I have indicated. All that it would be necessary for a boy to provide would be perhaps a ribbon for his hat. This is, I think, a far more important matter at the present time than is universal service. It is really the foundation of universal service. If we can train every boy at school to march-in fact, instil in him a taste for this kind of instruction-w e shall make a great step forward. The only other matter I wish to refer to is the proposal for the Commonwealth to take over lights and beacons. I think it is high time that it took that step. Queensland has, perhaps, the most extensive and most difficult coast to light. I am satisfied that three-fourths of the produce which is carried along the coast is the produce of other States. Yet the whole onus of lighting the coast is thrown upon Queensland. That is essentially a work which should be undertaken by the Commonwealth. No doubt some of us desire to see other matters of wider scope, such, for instance, as land matters, brought under the control of the Federal Government; but the time has not come when the people would be prepared to trust this Parliament with more powers than it already possesses. The only way in which that result could be brought about would be by every Federal Government endeavouring to instil confidence in the minds of the people, and by keeping themselves thoroughly in touch with the conditions of those who live in the far-distant portions of the Commonwealth. journed.
