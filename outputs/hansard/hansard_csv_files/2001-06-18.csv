It was the 100th anniversary of the creation of the department. The department, with justified pride, held a function to celebrate that. The motto of the department was ‘Achieving a just and secure society’. Indeed, they can have considerable pride in what has been achieved over a century of their work. I think the use of the word ‘achieving’ rather than ‘achieved’ was appropriate because we have a long way to go before we can really regard ourselves as having achieved a just and fair society. In particular in that context I wanted to make a few comments on this government’s policies in so far as they have affected access to justice. The first thing to note is a massive cut in legal aid. In 1995, for instance, the last year of the Labor government, legal aid was at $160 million. This year, by way of comparison, we are looking at only $114 million plus $5.1 million unspent from the previous year. One of the reasons it was unspent is confusion also introduced with a splitting of what is a federal or a state matter and the matter of whether the Commonwealth will be prepared to pay a matter, because they will not if it is now a state matter. So we are looking at $46 million in one year less but,",122,Measures Bill 2001 Government That Is Just So Out Of Touch We
289,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Jenkins) Took The Chair At 4.13 P.m.,,123,Representatives Main Committee
290,Mr Mcclelland (Barton) (4.13 P.m.),"The last sitting week was a significant week27790 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 if you add in a figure for inflation, in real terms we are looking at $67 million less on legal aid in just one year. In fact, if you project the eight-year period from 1996, from this government’s first budget, through to the eight-year period covering forward estimates, it will be a total of $402 million that is cut out of legal aid-$402 million of Australians’ access to justice ripped straight out of legal aid. When we compare that with the $500 million GST ‘in chains’ advertising campaign, it is just an outrage, quite frankly. So that is one issue. That in itself is putting more strain on our court system. Indeed many senior members of the judiciary have spoken as to why it is indeed penny wise and pound foolish not to provide a decent level of legal aid, because the blow-out in unrepresented litigants is simply causing cases to be longer, which in itself is adding costs to the Commonwealth by way of additional judge time, associate time, court officer time, transcript time and the like. So it is very much in the context of being penny wise and pound foolish. The other issue that I am finding as I am going around rural and regional Australia is the effect that the cutbacks have had on the Family Court’s budget. As part of the establishment of the Federal Magistrates Service, the government took out about $15 million over four years from the Family Court-roughly equivalent to the cost of funding judicial registrars, which by and large have been abolished or substantially abolished through the creation of the Federal Magistrates Service. This withdrawal of funds has had a significant effect. For instance, I was up at Coffs Harbour recently, and we have seen a complete closure of that registry, it being reduced to basically a filing registry on the morning of a court circuit that may come up there. The vacuum in funding for the Family Court has not been filled by the creation of the Federal Magistrates Service so, for instance, we have seen a significant cutback in the area of counselling. Again, that is very much in the category of being penny wise and pound foolish because Family Court counsellors have been so successful in resolving matters prior to litigation. In fact, we have seen in metropolitan areas that the number of counsellors has been cut from 101 to 81, which is a reduction of 20 per cent. However, the number of counsellors in regional Australia is even worse on a proportion basis. That number has been reduced from 22 to 16, a cutback of 27 per cent. If you follow this through with the reduction in counselling hours that have been provided to rural and regional Australia, you see they have also been cut back, by 26 per cent. In fact, distressingly, counsellors no longer visit the towns of Nowra, Orange, Parkes, Bourke, Lightning Ridge, Muswellbrook, Tenterfield, Glen Innes, Inverell, Ayr, Bowen, Emerald, Mount Isa or Griffith. The government, in place of that $15 million that has been cut out, has contributed about $1.7 million to assist in the outsourcing of counselling services. But just comparing $1.7 million to $15 million does not add up; clearly there is going to be a shortfall. It is very difficult for private counsellors-and many organisations are excellent, it must be saidbut, in the context of litigation where there is a need to provide children’s reports and the like and to advise parties to the counselling as to what the likely outcome is should the matter proceed to court, again that is not justification for cutting out these very successful counsellors from the Family Court itself. Regrettably, counselling at the pre-trial stage or at the pre-filing stage has now virtually been abolished as a service that the Family Court provides. Obviously, the community would say that, if you can help partners to a marriage resolve their differences before the break-up occurs, it is far better than seeing the trauma and the suffering that occurs in the family unit, in particular for children, during full-blown Family Court litigation. Again, it is very much penny-wise and pound-foolish not to provide proper counselling services, because we simply see knock-on consequences down the line in terms of child supMonday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27791 port services-the Department of Community Services in New South Wales, for instance-or, in worse-case scenarios, the police being called in to resolve situations of domestic violence. Frequently these disputes have been inflamed in circumstances where counsellors can have a role in helping the parties come to terms with the problems that they are confronting. There are also issues in this year’s budget regarding what appears to be a reduction in grants to family relationship support. It will fall from $31.4 million in 2001-02 to $26.1 million. We pursued this in Senate estimates recently, and it was explained to us that it was a result of an underspending of $5.675 million in 1999. But then again there were suggestions that the funding was for a contract services program, for the contact orders pilot evaluation and for primary dispute resolution. In that answer, the government seems to be suggesting that that $5 million was for one-off events that occurred last year. Whichever way you look at it, there is $5 million less in the area of family relationship support. I think the community is saying, ‘Whether they are one-off programs or not, the fact of the matter is that there has been a reduction.’ In terms of the whole area of the Family Court and the interaction with family support and counselling services, I also see a real potential cloud on the horizon that the creation of the Federal Magistrates Service is not going to be able to fix. Initially, when the Federal Magistrates Service was created, because they started the lists off, the lists were very short in terms of getting a final hearing. In those circumstances, it was not necessary for the federal magistrates to hear interim applications making arrangements most specifically in terms of residence and access to children. A real problem is emerging, because increasingly the magistrates are becoming busy. As I indicated earlier, with the creation of the Federal Magistrates Service virtually all of the registrars in the Family Court were made redundant or placed elsewhere. That has meant that the registrars have conducted these interim applications in the Family Court, which means that there is an ever increasing and indeed dramatically increasing list of interim applications. That is a real problem on the horizon, particularly in these highly emotive access, custody and residence matters, and is a real powder keg for aggression to develop and for children to be affected. I also note that the government has significantly contributed to that list blowing out because of its delay in replacing judges. There are several other areas in which this government have been found wanting. By way of a gimmick, really, they are proposing $6 million for a family law telephone service, despite the fact that many legal aid commissions operate extensive and sophisticated telephone advice networks across a range of matters, state and federal, including family law. In fact, of that $6 million only $750,000 will actually go to increasing the availability of legal services. What we will see with the balance is money spent, firstly, on consultants and, secondly, on Centrelink staff-not legally trained-providing, on figures given to us in the estimates hearings, only five minutes of advice to people, and that is usually going to be by way of a referral to another organisation, such as a community legal centre. Effectively, you are spending $6 million to duplicate a layer of services in circumstances where that money most certainly could have been much better spent on enhancing the resources of community legal centres, for instance, that operate virtually on the smell of an oily rag but provide invaluable assistance in so many areas, particularly in family law. With respect to that issue of community legal centres, I note that the Attorney-General, by way of a media release, has denied our assertion that there has been a reduction of $3.9 million in the community legal service budget for this current financial year. The government is spending now only $21.8 million. Again, we see the government coming back to the argument that the $3.9 million was for one-off programs last year. But that is money that has come out of the sector. By way of contrast, on 21 June 2000, the Attorney-General said to me in the 27792 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 Main Committee, ‘I would not sneeze at the $26 million that actually goes to those 126 CLCs because it is a very effective use of money.’ He did not say then that it was $21.8 million plus $3.9 million short-term, one-off funding; he was claiming that there was $26 million. So the sector is entitled to complain that $3.9 million has been taken out of their resources-in circumstances where they, as community organisations, have been required to pick up a tremendous amount of the work coming as a result of the cutback in legal aid to which I have referred. We have seen with this government a complete abandonment in so many areas, including in what was in place when they came to office in 1996-measures to assist middle Australians to access justice, for instance, by way of the disbursement fund of $10 million that Labor had created to assist middle Australians who were not entitled to legal aid to otherwise be in a position to defend or pursue their rights with the assistance of a fund to pay their actual disbursements. When you look across the board at what this government has done to legal services, we cannot claim to be, under this government, a just and fair society because, in so many instances, access to justice is quite irrelevant to people-they just do not have access to justice. In those circumstances there is a real risk of our legal system becoming irrelevant to an increasingly widespread sector of Australian society. That is something that we should all be concerned about. FRAN BAILEY (McEwen) (4.29 p.m.)-This Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2001-2002 before us today delivers on what this government has been focused on for the last five years. It delivers responsible economic management, a budget surplus, a $60 billion reduction in government debt, a $4 billion a year cut in government interest payments, low inflation, low interest rates and an unemployment rate that is at the lowest level it has been for many years. This government has recognised the fundamental importance of responsible economic management. Without it, the government’s ability to fulfil its responsibilities and to provide for and create an environment in which everyone has equal opportunities is severely limited. You simply cannot have good economic policy without good social policy and vice versa-they go hand in hand. Five consecutive budget surpluses have been used to reduce government debt. This has helped to pull down interest rates and to enhance private capital investment, labour productivity and economic growth. The budget surpluses that have been produced have also increased national savings and, in the long run, led to higher investment and living standards. I often say to people in my electorate that there is very little difference between the government budget and the family budget. If the family budget is weighed down by excessive debt, there is nothing for the extra things that families might want to do, whether that be taking a holiday, buying a new car or computers for the kids, or whatever. Government is in exactly the same situation. If government is weighed down by debt, it simply does not have resources to put into many of the social programs which are necessary. Under the previous government, irresponsible economic policy was taken to a new high. Under the ALP, Australia was living beyond its means and, in the process, it damaged the Australian economy. People must not forget how things were pre-1996 with record high budget deficits, $80 billion in government debt, high interest rates that crippled small businesses and severely penalised home owners, an outdated and unfair tax system and an unemployment rate which reached double figures. Make no mistake: if given another chance, the ALP will increased taxes, as their record shows. They are about big government, big spending, big taxes and big deficits, crowding out private investment, providing no incentive whatsoever for entrepreneurial and risk-taking activity, resulting in reduced real incomes and savMonday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27793 ings levels. Budget deficits have a detrimental effect on the economy because they result in higher government borrowings and inflation. Inevitably, this impacts on interest rates and has an adverse outcome with respect to private capital spending and investment decisions. Now that this government has decreased our debt, reduced interest payments and operated stable and responsible monetary and fiscal policies, it is possible for the government to concentrate on building on its social obligations. This includes putting more resources into building on our social capital and infrastructure-greater resources for education, health and welfaredelivering a social bonus to the people of Australia. A record $7.6 billion will be spent by the federal government over the next four years on vocational education and training programs. The federal government, with this budget, has recognised the importance of building on what has already been established in areas such as jobs pathways, numeracy and literacy programs, new apprenticeship incentives, job placement and education training. In total, the federal government will provide over $12.4 billion in 2001-02 to support schools, training and education. Federal government funding to government schools has also grown by almost 46 per cent between 1996 and 2002. Most importantly for my electorate, the government has signalled its commitment to providing first-class education and training opportunities for young people in rural and regional areas. On the question of funding for education, there has been one almighty scare campaign raised. At an AISV dinner which I spoke at in Melbourne last Thursday night, I had a very good example given to me. It is this: if you were to take a bucket and put all of the state funding for education into it and then put all the federal funding into it, out of every dollar that was extracted for education, 24c goes to non-government education. Nowhere could the example be made more clearly. It was a very good example to let people know in very clear and concise terms exactly what the funding position is for both government and non-government education. In 2001, we have 1.6 million young people in vocational education and training, and this compares to only 1.2 million when this government came to office. The number of young people in new apprenticeships now totals 300,000, and this is more than double the number of people in apprenticeships prior to this government coming to power in 1996. Despite running massive and crippling budget deficits, the ALP neglected these important areas of educational and social infrastructure. These appropriation bills will also provide an extra $2 billion for new apprenticeships, incentives for employers to take on new apprentices and extra incentives for those in rural and regional areas. I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that small business in my electorate really welcomes that. Giving more young people than at any time in the past the opportunity to learn new skills and trades and to set out on career paths in which they will make a productive and worthwhile contribution to their local communities is what these programs are all about, as well as of course promoting self-esteem amongst young people. This is vitally important in regional and rural areas such as the areas I represent, where many young people are often left with little option but to leave home and to travel to the city in search of opportunities. With this government’s focus on new apprenticeships, young people no longer have to do this. Employers in regional and rural areas will continue to be given important incentives to take on these young people, to provide them with skills and to give them a means of developing career paths for their futures. These appropriation bills also provide additional funding for the highly successful Jobs Pathway training and placement programs. The Jobs Pathway programs help to smooth the transition from school to work for young people aged between 15 and 19 by providing personal assistance that focuses on the skills and knowledge required to reduce their risk of becoming unemployed. The ongoing funding means that services will continue to assist up to 27794 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 70,000 young people annually from over 1,600 secondary schools around Australia, and I am proud to say that the secondary schools in my electorate are right in with this program and young people are benefiting. Schools in my electorate have welcomed the focus on vocational education. In particular, Mansfield Secondary College has participated in a vocational education and training project, with 16 students taking part and 15 signing training agreements after successful completion of the training. That is just one example across my huge and diverse electorate. I think having 15 out of 16 young people signing up and getting the benefit of that is an excellent outcome. Young people at risk of homelessness and other disadvantage will also benefit from an additional $16.8 million over four years though the JPET program. This funding ensures JPET will continue to assist young people until 2005, with a direct program commitment of $74.4 million over this period. In 2001, the number of young Australians in Jobs Pathway type training programs totals over 168,000. This compares with only 26,000 before March 1996. Nowhere is there such a stark contrast, especially with regard to young people, between what the Labor Party did when they were in government, prior to 1996, and what we have done. The proof of the pudding is in the eating, and nowhere will young people find better support than from this government. Once again, this signals an ongoing commitment-because of the funding going to the years ahead-and this has been able to be implemented only because of responsible economic management. Once again, if you are heavily weighed down with debt, you simply do not have the funds to put into these programs. This delivering of a social bonus, brought about by responsible economic management, is what government is all about. It is about delivering services on the ground to people. This government is also reinforcing its commitment to funding places for young people in regional higher education: $34.8 million is being made available to establish an extra 5,226 places for regional higher education institutions, once again recognising the fact that families want their young to have access to further education within their own regional areas. Prior to March 1996, the literacy and numeracy levels of teenagers in Australia were at an unacceptable level. Close to 30 per cent of teenagers were unable to read or write. This government will continue its commitment to the National Literacy and Numeracy Plan, and $36.9 million has been allocated to provide ongoing support for this. This program has been a resounding success, reducing the rate of teenagers unable to read and write from 30 per cent to 13 per cent. I think 13 per cent is still way too high, but just imagine the number of young people who now have a chance, who have the opportunity to get their foot in the door simply because they are now able to read and write. This is something which I am sure most of us take for granted, but without it you get absolutely nowhere. You do not get a foot on the bottom rung of the ladder unless you can read and write. I am very proud that this government has actually reduced that from the very unacceptable, high level of 30 per cent down to 13 per cent. The ongoing support for this program is going to see that 13 per cent reduced even further. That means, of course, that those young people will now get access to training programs. They are not going to drop out of school and they are not going to get into difficulty; they are actually going to have a chance in life, and that is what it is all about. These benefits really deserve bipartisan support. I think everyone would agree on the undoubted benefits of an educated society. I can only wonder why there has not been bipartisan and ongoing support for this program. If the ALP were to roll back the GST, which provides $5.7 billion to Victoria alone, I would like to ask how such funds could continue to be provided for such essential programs. Monday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27795 Information technology is also being utilised to provide educational opportunities for regional and rural Australia. These appropriation bills provide $34.1 million over five years to support online curriculum development. You have only to visit a little primary school like Jamieson in my electorate to watch young primary school students logging online to take part in science adventure programs. This is a very remote community in my electorate, and watching these young students is absolutely fantastic. This is what this sort of funding means. When you pick up the budget papers and you read that there is $34 million for online curriculum development, it does not say very much. But when you start to implement this program you can see the direct benefit, like the benefit that the primary school students in Jamieson in my electorate receive. I must say that I was very honoured to be able to launch that online science program just last year. It is fantastic that even students in remote areas in my electorate now have access to this technology. Last year the federal government announced the largest rural health package ever put together by a government. The regional health strategy is providing $562 million to increase doctor numbers and to provide better health services in areas outside the major city centres. It is interesting to note that prior to March 1996, under the ALP, the percentage of medical services which were bulk-billed stood at 58 per cent. In 2001, this figure now stands at 72 per cent, which once again reinforces this government’s continued commitment to Medicare and to bulk-billing. I must say, as a point of interest, that when we came into government there was not one place to access Medicare anywhere in my electorate of almost 15,000 square kilometres. TodayI am proud to say that people now have that access in pharmacies throughout my area for the very first time ever. People living in rural and regional areas and even outer metropolitan areas not all that far from the areas that the member for Jagajaga represents have now got access. I think that is an important contribution. I also think that the rebate for lifetime private health insurance cover-of course, non-existent under the previous government-is an important contribution. An issue which is of continuing concern to all of the people who live in the rural and more remote areas of my electorate is getting access to GPs. It is never an easy issue. What was done prior to 1996? Precious little. This government has put in place a whole range of incentive packages to make it much easier to get GPs into rural areas. Another area of great concern, especially for families, is immunisation. Immunisation rates have increased from a low of 53 per cent prior to 1996-it is really unbelievable to think that they could be as low as that, but in fact they were-to 91 per cent in 2001, and there is a target of 95 per cent. I think the target should be 100 per cent. I also think that there is a special need for GPs in rural areas. I certainly support looking at Medicare to take into account the extra time that GPs spend addressing the needs of patients from rural areas, and that is something that I will be continuing to push. But I think all of these measures, especially in the health area, have been absolutely fantastic, including of course the new measures in these appropriation bills for $104 million over the next four years to enable general practices to employ more practice nurses-a great measure for many areas like mine. Also, $43.4 million is being made available to help reduce the after-hours workload on rural doctors. There are also measures to tackle major chronic diseases like diabetes, asthma and mental illness. I will take a moment to place on record how absolutely appalled I was at the scare campaign run by ALP candidates with regard to diabetes. Nothing could be further from the truth. The scare campaign that was run was absolutely disgraceful but probably typical of many of the people involved. This government is reinforcing its commitment to fight diabetes by providing $50 million in funding to allow GPs to better manage patients with diabetes and 27796 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 to improve the prevention and early diagnosis of the disease. The study that formed the basis of these recommendations was actually begun in the area of Diamond Creek in my electorate, and I am very pleased to be able to say that the work done in my area has contributed to this. I see that time is running out and I still have a lot to say about these measures. No doubt I will have opportunities in other forums. I commend this bill to the House. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (4.49 p.m.)-The Howard government’s sixth budget takes Australia another step closer to one of the Prime Minister’s long held political goals-the destruction of Medicare. This Prime Minister’s strategy is to undermine Medicare by running down our public hospitals and, as we see day after day, pushing more of the costs of doctors and medicines onto patients. These policies, as so many Australians know, are resulting in the Americanisation of our health care system-a two-class health system, which Australians certainly do not want. The Howard government is running down our public hospitals by failing to fund them properly. In its first three years, this government slashed more than $800 million from our public hospital budgets. In its second term, hospitals have been squeezed because the states have been shortchanged when it comes to the proper indexation the Commonwealth was supposed to provide to the states under the Australian health care agreements. This budget does not have any new funds for public hospitals to attack the backlog in elective surgery, to reduce the queues in emergency departments, or to replace ageing equipment. According to the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, in some public hospitals: ... capital equipment has been allowed to run down to the point where it is creating serious clinical problems. Our public hospitals are finding it increasingly difficult to respond to the demands being placed upon them, and this government in this budget had no answers. Time and time again from the minister for health we get abuse, which we are all used to, and now we are finding exaggeration added to that. Just recently, on the national television program Meet the Press, the health minister was questioned as to why there were no additional funds or new funds for public hospitals in this year’s budget. He could not explain. He was stuck, so what did he do? He just pulled out of thin air the claim that the Commonwealth is giving $1 billion extra a year for public hospitals. If only our public hospitals were receiving ‘an extra billion dollars a year’. This is a totally baseless claim. It certainly has no basis in the budget papers. The forward estimates show that there is only a fraction of this amount to cover rising costs. The independent arbiter appointed to determine the proper indexation under the Commonwealth-state health care agreements has clearly demonstrated the extent to which the Commonwealth has been short-changing the states. This year alone, the Commonwealth has left the states $215 million short. It is not the Labor Party saying that; it is an independent arbiter who was chosen to sort out the disagreements between the Commonwealth and the states. This is no billion-dollar boost; in fact what we have seen is the screws increasingly being tightened on our public hospitals. The minister has yet again been exposed for his exaggeration. Either he does not know what is in the health budget, or he thinks it is okay to just make these untrue statements on national television. He certainly has an obligation as a minister to not distort the facts, particularly on such an important matter as public hospital funding, and he should come out and correct the record. Unlike this government, the Labor Party has public hospitals as its highest priority. Labor’s Medicare alliance is a document signed now by five Labor state premiers and all Labor opposition leaders, including our leader, Kim Beazley. It signals a new era of cooperation in health funding. It demonstrates that Labor can and will fix our health system. Monday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27797 The split in responsibility for funding our health system between the Commonwealth and the states has dogged Medicare for all of its time. It is one of the critical issues that we need to resolve so that our health spending is focused on the needs of patients, not on who is paying. There are hundreds of true stories documenting the human cost of not fixing these problemsstories of elderly patients being trapped in expensive hospital wards because the Commonwealth, particularly this government, refuses to provide the additional funding for muchneeded nursing home beds. Patients are forced to stay on trolleys in emergency departments for hours because there are not enough nursing home beds for those patients needing nursing home care. Labor’s Medicare alliance policy will fix these problems. People working in our public hospitals are frustrated because the Commonwealth-state funding arrangements will not allow them to focus on what they know is the most important thing-their patients’ needs. This government has no policy to solve this problem, and the Medicare alliance is Labor’s solution, which will enable a new partnership and a joint commitment between a future Labor government and all state governments. The Medicare alliance, most importantly, commits all levels of government to rebuilding Medicare over the next 10 years under new health funding arrangements that put the focus back onto patients. We are recognising that once we get the funding arrangements right we can get things right for the patient. We can reduce overcrowding and waiting lists because people who can be better cared for in nursing homes will be able to get a nursing home bed and will get the appropriate level of care. We can make it easier for parents with sick children, parents who currently wait hours in emergency departments because GP services are not available after-hours. We can stop the needless bickering between federal and state health ministers over who pays and start looking after people properly. It is a pity that the government does not copy Labor’s Medicare alliance policy in the way that it is trying to copy Labor’s Medicare after-hours policy-another policy which we announced last year. Any person who has been confronted with a medical emergency or who has been anxious about their child’s health knows how important it is to get medical advice when you need it. Unfortunately, we also know how hard, and sometimes how expensive, it can be to see a doctor at night or on the weekends. Labor’s Medicare after-hours policy will provide better medical help outside normal working hours. The policy has two parts-after-hours GP services, working with local hospital emergency departments and a 24-hour medical advice line staffed by trained nurses under the supervision of doctors. It will be a truly national scheme to make sure all Australians can access after-hours medical care. In his budget reply speech, Kim Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, announced that a future Labor government would allocate $55 million over its first three years to establish the 24-hour medical phone service. This $55 million will come out of the Howard government’s wasteful advertising and consultancy budget. The days-or, I should say, nights-of only being able to get a recorded message in a doctor’s surgery after-hours will be over. Medicare after-hours will be supported by a web site with comprehensive information. A book for parents will be distributed through chemists. The government proposal contained in this year’s budget is a very weak imitation of Labor’s Medicare after-hours policy. Unfortunately, this copycat proposal is not national and does not include a 24-hour phone advice line. It envisages a small number of clinics which certainly will not be able to deliver accessible services to all Australians. It is not surprising that Labor has the policies to fix our health system because, as Australians know, Medicare is Labor policy. The coalition lack any policies to strengthen Medicare because they want to continue the undermining that we have seen for the last five years. They do know that the great majority of Australians want Medicare strengthened. As the govern27798 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 ment’s popularity continues to go down, the coalition are certainly looking around desperately for health policies. In this budget we saw them stealing them from the Labor Party. I am sorry that the government has not agreed to accept our policy to dramatically cut the millions of dollars wasted on advertising and consultancies in order to fund desperately needed cancer services. This government wasted more than $500 million on advertising and education for the GST alone. In this calendar year, the Howard government is scheduled to spend $150 million on advertising. Over the last three years it has spent an average of $322 million on consultancies. One policy which Labor are very proud of is that we are going to cut the advertising and consultancy budgets and re-allocate some of this money into a national policy to fight against cancer. In his budget reply speech, the Leader of the Opposition committed $90 million in new funds coming out of the advertising and consultancy budget to mount a national fight against cancer. Labor’s policy to fight against cancer is aimed at cutting the number of people who develop cancer and further increasing the survival rate of those who have it. A prime ministerial cancer advisory panel will be established to develop national strategies and produce an Australian cancer plan in its first 12 months. We will also build a new national cancer alliance to link our scientists with cancer specialists. We will create comprehensive cancer centres to enhance treatment services. We will tackle the causes of cancer, the most notorious being tobacco. In 1999, 21 per cent of adult Australians smoked. Labor has set itself a target to reduce this to 15 per cent within five years. This will have a significant long-term effect on the number of people who get lung cancer. The funds will also enable a major melanoma screening trial in Queensland to be conducted and will begin the important bowel cancer screening trial. In addition, Labor will redesign the government’s cervical cancer screening program and create specific community based and outreach services that will better target women who are not using the current programs. Patient care is at the heart of Labor’s cancer plan, and the services cancer patients receive will be improved by reforming the hospital pharmaceutical system to make sure that patients can get specialist cancer drugs as outpatients at home. Clinical trials for new cancer treatments will also be boosted to allow Australian researchers to test the most promising new cancer treatments and introduce innovation into medical practice. Labor’s national fight against cancer is a further demonstration of the fundamental differences in priorities between Labor and this government. Money on advertising is the Liberal priority; for Labor it is increased services to fight cancer. The only plan this government has for Medicare is a not very secret plan to continue its dismantling, a plan it has been implementing via the back door for the last five years. We see started last night the latest $15 million being spent on private health insurance, just the latest example of this government’s spending priorities. The community knows that Labor is the only party capable of restoring Medicare and building it up to face what challenges are in the future. We are the party that believes in Medicare and we have the policies that will strengthen it over the next few years. Dr STONE (Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (5.02 p.m.)-I also rise to enter this debate and support the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2001-2002 before this Main Committee. I want to put on record the scope and scale of the domestic and global environmental issues that confront us this century and this government’s response, both in budgetary and in policy terms. First, on this, the day after World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought, it is important that we acknowledge that in 1998 people displaced for environmental reasons, for examMonday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27799 ple polluted water supplies, exceeded the number of those displaced by war, and it has been the same each year since. The Second World Water Forum held in The Hague in March 2000 estimated that by 2025 the number of environmental refugees could quadruple. On 18 April this year, environmental scientists in Boulder USA reported that a huge dust storm, originating in Northern China, had reached the US and was blanketing areas from Canada to Arizona. In March, the People’s Daily in China reported the season’s first dust storm, the earliest and worse in living memory. Erosion is, as we all know, related to vegetation loss and associated loss of soil structure and soil moisture. This is an ecological catastrophe, but water simply for human populations for drinking and sanitation is also of major global concern. Only 2.5 per cent of the world’s water is not saline, and of that some two-thirds is locked in ice caps and glaciers. In the next 20 years it is estimated that water use by humans will increase by about 40 per cent, with agriculture requiring 17 per cent more and industry demands rising by 20 per cent to 70 per cent. Only three per cent of the surface water in Russia’s Volga River Basin is considered safe to drink because of pollution from toxic waste, and only three per cent of the water from the Ganges is thought to be unpolluted. According to the World Water Commission’s report of 2000, water tables are falling by as much as a metre a year in many parts of Mexico, India and the Yemen, and by over 1½ metres in China, with water diversions in Central Asia having a particularly devastating effect on water quality and quantity and human health there. We know that Australia’s Great Artesian Basin is being seriously depleted. There are over 4,500 bores across this basin, and nearly 1,300 have ceased to flow because of unsustainable extractions and drop in water pressure. Eight hundred and eighty of the bores require urgent rehabilitation. Some of this water we know is hundreds of thousands of years old. We have estimated it would cost over $222 million to save 200,000 megalitres of wasted water per year, or nearly half of the current use, or should I say wastage, as much of it seeps across those dry desert sands. This is a huge cost, and the Commonwealth has helped to shoulder the burden through some $27 million allocated so far to help the states, territories and land-holders of the basin. The Commonwealth has also contributed over $200 million between 2000 and 2002 for inland water protection and rehabilitation of the environmental values of our inland waters. What sorts of problems are we countering and why are we entering into this partnership in funding with the states, local governments and private citizenry? In Australia the long-term flows from the Condamine-Balonne basin in Queensland have declined to approximately 45 per cent of the natural mean flow, which is a typical level of the flow reduction across the Murray-Darling catchment in New South Wales and Victoria. Most of the streams in the Murray-Darling Basin have experienced major flow related environmental degradation and consequent loss of biodiversity. This includes salinity, of course, loss of quantity and bluegreen algal blooms. In the Barwon-Darling River it is estimated that, prior to development, flows at Bourke were at about three million megalitres per annum. Flows are currently around two million megalitres per annum as a result of upstream water use, so about 30 per cent of the total flow has been extracted by the time the river passes Bourke. Until the mid-20th century, most of the significant new diversions of water from river systems was achieved by the construction of large-scale public dams for irrigation and urban consumption. As a consequence of these dams, flows in rivers like the Murray have been significantly reduced and we need to urgently review their downstream impacts and adjust environmental flows. At the same time, we also need to address the environmental flow needs of the Snowy River and the Murrumbidgee River. Flows in these three streams, of course, were altered as a consequence of the 1950s Snowy Mountains scheme. The Commonwealth is 27800 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 funding significantly the buy back of water saved to put into these streams for environmental flows. We shoulder that burden believing that, as a nation, all of us will benefit when we make those rivers run as they should. The New South Wales Department of Land and Water Conservation regard the Darling and its tributaries as already heavily impacted by water extractions. They also estimate that long term average diversions in the Barwon-Darling are 30 per cent above the levels set under the Murray-Darling Basin cap. When large floods come down it is estimated that the flow is reduced to 50 per cent less than would otherwise have occurred under natural conditions, as agricultural users take the opportunity the flood presents to fill massive off-stream storages. Queensland, no doubt reflecting its later stages of regional development in the remoter parts, has been slow in addressing water and vegetation management downand cross-basin consequences. The independent audit report pointed that out at the August 2000 Murray-Darling Basin Commission meeting. In particular, Queensland was singled out as the state which had the least appropriate water allocation management process, with inadequate consideration of down-basin impacts of additional water extractions, for example, in the Narran Lakes, a place of international significance for biodiversity values. We understand that, as a Commonwealth, we must help Queensland build its capacity to help its individuals understand what is at stake, and we must help that state, as with others, to set about producing the right sorts of management treatments. We are, of course, investing heavily through the Natural Heritage Trust to assist them to do that. The Commonwealth is leading the Murray-Darling Basin Commission in seeking the water reform practice that is required for all Australians to benefit. The government of the Northern Territory is now considering the concept of an intensive irrigated agricultural development in the Douglas-Daly Basin. Previously unallocated Crown land has been offered for sale as development blocks. The Northern Territory Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries has suggested that 45 per cent of the basin is not suitable for the development, but 20 per cent can be developed as agricultural land and the remaining 40 per cent could be suitable for pasture improvement. As a Commonwealth we are concerned to make sure that this does not represent for Australia a loss of something that is incredibly precious and irreplaceable, but rather represents balanced development and careful conservation. The Daly River Basin contains two wetland systems listed in the directory of important wetlands in Australia. There are a number of endangered and migratory species that could be affected by intensive agricultural development there. The impacts of clearing and water extraction, particularly ground water, concern us. We are aware of the potential to permanently damage this area. So the Commonwealth has funded five environmental flow projects to research aspects of the Douglas-Daly River system. These projects are all funded, of course, through the Natural Heritage Trust’s river health program. In Tasmania, there continues to be concern about the impacts of agriculture and the use of native forest and private land for low value production, like woodchips. In Queensland, the lack of vegetation management legislation continues to cause panic clearing in areas that may otherwise have been conserved, or should be conserved. In Victoria and South Australia, few native grasslands remain-and they need protection-and inappropriate firewood collection threatens many species. In Perth, Western Australia, the unsustainable use of ground water for urban consumption is just one of the environmental threats that that state faces. It is no wonder then that people within and outside governments are frustrated at the constraints on the Commonwealth when it seeks to set mandates and oversee the implementation of national standards for all aspects of sustainable natural resource management right across the country. At the time of Federation, it was clear that the new states did not envisage a substantial role for the Commonwealth in developing national environmental policy or standards, or in reguMonday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27801 lating the management and utilisation of natural resources across our vast continent. In fact, it was not until the 1970s that the first Commonwealth piece of legislation dealt with an environmental issue. At the turn of the last century, there was certainly very little understanding of the interdependencies of elements within an ecosystem so, not surprisingly, ecosystems were not regulated or managed in an integrated way. State government departments compartmentalised the management of forests, private and public land, soils, marine resources, wildlife, agriculture and water supply. Later, the regulation of air quality and noise abatement was similarly divided for policy development. The legacy of this earlier failure to understand the imperatives of managing in a totally integrated way lives on-even though the different state, territory and local government jurisdictions in Australia now understand that ecosystems cannot be protected and sustained, nor resource access equitably shared, unless policy and management are integrated. It is an absurdity, for example, to attempt to manage regional vegetation, sustainable agricultural production and the preservation of water quality with a silo mentality. But we continue to see examples of this right across Australia. The environmental issues that I have just described were all evident and well understood prior to 1996. Unfortunately, prior to the Howard government’s election in that year, there was no national commitment to providing environmental funding on a scale that would leverage significant investment by states and the private sector sufficient to make a difference. There was no concerted effort to look at the institutional arrangements that varied so much across states and that often hampered the coming together of the various stakeholders so that, together, they could manage in an integrated way. The Natural Heritage Trust, of course introduced by the Howard government in 1996-97, was the biggest environmental package ever seen in Australia. We saw $1.17 billion invested in over 10,300 projects to deliver into the hands of over 300,000 ordinary Australians the means to get to work to save our waterways, beaches, threatened species and productive farmland. In this budget we have provided an extension of $1 billion to the Natural Heritage Trust, extending for a further five years from 2002 the life of that great trust. We have also become the first government to address the very serious dry land salinity affected parts of the country. Some states-for example, Victoria, South Australia, New South Wales and Western Australia-have long struggled to find sufficient resources to address salinity within their territory. For some of them, there is still a need to build in the communities an understanding of what the salinity problem really is. The Howard government’s $700 million National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality, like the Natural Heritage Trust, leverages further state and private sector funding to address the land management practices, the revegetation and the biodiversity protection that is necessary to obtain or protect the long term sustainability of our natural resources. And they, after all, underpin our way of life, our economy and our culture. And, significantly, this government is reviewing the institutional arrangements, nationally and locally, in an effort to produce cross-jurisdictional cooperation, information sharing and adoption of best practice that comes with integrated action. The government has allocated $5.1 million over four years to extend the national pollutant inventory or NPI, which provides vital information to the community on the types and amounts of pollutants being emitted into the air, land and water. This community capacity building is being supplemented by an additional $5 million over four years to then tackle the removal of dioxins and dioxin-like substances from the environment. As well, in this budget this government provided $8 million over four years to improve fuel quality and vehicle emissions in Australia. We understand our task particularly in relation to the fact that Australia is one of the highest per capita emitters of greenhouse gases. We understand that each jurisdiction alone cannot 27802 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 tackle this issue; it requires a national approach. This Australian government, led by John Howard, has committed to the first national greenhouse office, and through its work the Greenhouse Office has stimulated some of the world’s most innovative research into nonfossil fuel energy. We have seen local councils pick up the issue of climate change and the need to work, individually as councils, through those problems. In fact, our councils have been some of the fastest to adopt practices in a program like climate protection change. To meet our international as well as domestic environmental obligations, this government has provided $217.9 million to meet the challenge of climate change, and another $212 million in 2001-02 to also maintain world-class weather forecasting and climate information development. We have a world-class service in the Bureau of Meteorology. It is a service that has included in it some 6,000 volunteers who daily help to keep the climate record of Australia. Those volunteers are being especially recognised this year as part of the International Year of Volunteers. It is certainly this government that has recognised a need for the Bureau of Meteorology to continue to be given the resources to upgrade its technologies and to maintain the excellence that it now has an international reputation for. I have been saying that, as a government, we understand that a significant level of financial resources must be put into managing the strategic development and the implementation of strategies to ensure that all our natural resource use in Australia is sustainable. We understand, too, the level of resources needed to inform and educate the public about the role that they can play. We understand the importance of research and we understand, in particular, our nation’s role as we work on the most significant environmental problems that affect us both domestically and as a planet. Human pressure on the land has been exacerbated by well-intentioned but disastrous policies. I began by talking about China. For example, in China a decision in Beijing in 1994 saw any crop land taken out of production for construction being offset by land reclaimed elsewhere in China. This so-called ‘reclaimed land for crop land’ was where the deforestation occurred and where the ploughing of previous grasslands occurred. Hence fast growing coastal provinces such as Quandong and Shandong, which are losing crop land for urban expansion, are paying other provinces to plough new land elsewhere to offset their losses. We have to make sure that that sort of situation does not arise in microcosm in Australia, where our coastal fringes are pushing into our inland areas with urban development. We must make sure that our urban development is never at the expense of degradation of the natural resource that, as I said before, we depend on for our economic foundation, our way of life and, indeed, the basis of our culture. We have to understand that, in Australia, we are living in a time where we need to make good the mistakes of the past. We are indeed only borrowing from the futures of our children. I am very proud to be the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage in this government because I believe we have committed the resources. We certainly have committed ourselves to working with the other stakeholders in this country, the other jurisdictions to-for the first time-make a significant difference in this country. I thank you. the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2001-2002 moved by my colleague the shadow minister for finance and administration, Lindsay Tanner. Without question this bill confirms the damage this government has done to the lives of low and average income earners through six HowardCostello budgets. The government’s desperate attempt to address this damage through panic spending and cynical vote buying is nothing more than admission of its failure, and a final insult to those who have suffered the burden and nightmare of the GST.",123,Representatives Main Committee
291,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (5.19 P.m.),"This afternoon I wish to support the amendments toMonday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27803 More than half the constituents in my electorate of Lowe are aged between 24 and 64 years and fall between the income brackets of $30,000 and $80,000 per year. They are the families that are the backbone of our country. Having fought hard to gain an education and move into the work force, these families are entitled to expect some support from this government. What assistance has the government provided to those who work so hard? The answer: next to nothing. After all the promises, this budget ignores hard working Australians. In fact, with all its meanness and trickiness, the Howard government has combined the punishment of the GST with silent tax thresholds and bracket creep. The impost of the GST on low and middle income earners-the people this government expects not only to carry out this government’s policies but also, somehow mysteriously and miraculously, to provide for their own retirement-has added to their cost of living, a cost unrelieved by the tax cuts and the incentive to join a health fund. The effect of the tax cuts and the health fund incentive was a cynical oneoff action swept away by the ongoing daily impost of the GST and bracket creep. Terry McCrann, in his article in the Weekend Australian of 2-3 June 2001, says: Bracket creep is real ... It is just as real an increase in tax as an excise or an explicit rate change ... and it hits every taxpayer-even those who stay in the 31.5c tax bracket. Crucially, it hits hardest those in, or moving into, the two top brackets with taxable income around $40000 to $80000 ... Low to middle income earners are the silent majority upon whom this government has built this sham of a budget. They get nothing from this budget except the unrecognised honour of paying more and more and more. Bracket creep revenue over the 2001-02 to 2004-05 financial years is estimated by McCrann, in the same article, to rise by an amount equal to the total rise in GST revenue plus the federal excise and other indirect taxes, a figure of some $7 billion. Without bracket creep this budget heads into the red. Crispin Hull, in an article in the Canberra Times of 2 June 2001, is even more precise when he says: The present Government has engaged in even worse humbug by imposing higher indirect taxes in the form of a GST and pretending to more than compensate by giving ‘cuts’ in income taxes. However, the figures presented in the Budget papers and other figures give the lie to this pseudo-generosity. He goes on to say: If compensation for this GST had been permanent and real, one would have expected a permanent reduction in the relative position of income tax as a percentage of total government revenue and as a percentage of gross domestic product. But what do we find? No such thing ... income tax appears to be creeping back to its pre-GST level ... In short, mug PAYE taxpayers are back where they were in 199899 ... but they also have to cop the 10 percent GST on everything they buy with their post-tax wage. The Australian Taxpayers Association, in its review of this budget, also comments on bracket creep starkly with these statistics: that, while total PAYG collections are expected to rise by 5.3 per cent, average salary and wage income is expected to rise by only 3.75 per cent. This increase in taxation for low and middle wage and salary earners is further compounded by the load shifting in the family expenses of education, child care, health and aged care from the public purse to the family purse. In education, this government has consistently favoured private education over public education-but, worse, within private education this government has heavily weighted its prejudice to the old category 1 end of town. Category1 schools under the REI scheme are advantaged under the SES scheme with a $1,000 per annum per student increase, as against the lower levels with less than a $200 per annum per student increase. Public schools, by contrast, will get the princely sum of a $4 per annum per student increase. Lowe has 20 nongovernment schools containing some 11,000 students. None is in the former ERI scheme 27804 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 category 1. Seventy-five per cent of those schools are in the Catholic education system. All but two of those schools are in the former ERI category 11. Of course, whether you choose a public or a private school, the GST is ever present, from the tuckshop through school books to school equipment. Labor says that all Australian children have, as a right of their citizenship, a claim to a fair share of the resources allocated to education in Australia. At present under this government, the children of parents at the big end of town are being quarantined in privilege whilst the children of lower and middle income Australians have to make do with the crumbs from the table. This government’s budget has simply subsidised the reproduction of privilege in this country at the expense of the children of middle and battling Australia. Recently released CPI figures indicate that education costs on a year to date basis rose 4.5 per cent, with the increase from the December 2000 quarter and the March 2001 quarter being 4.2 per cent. The year to date increases in secondary education were 6.3 per cent and in primary education they were 4.4 per cent. These are huge imposts on the family purse, particularly when the salary and wage incomes of these families rose by less than four per cent over that period. Education is the lifeblood of a knowledge nation. Labor says education must be whole of life; without it nothing else is possible. Education is the great fuel, the great renewable, by which we maintain and progress the Australian way of life and standard of living. The very life of our country as a society of people operating at above subsistence levels in the world is at stake. It is time education ceased to be the province of partisanship and became a national commandment. The other great impost on any family is health care. A recent survey reported in the Daily Telegraph of 28 May 2001 noted that over 70,000 people have exited health funds of which many are in the 30to 50-year age group. Moreover, the government’s incentive package to drive people into health funds has not yet relieved pressure on the public health system. The March quarter 2001 CPI figures indicate an increase in the health cost year to date of 3.9 per cent but an increase of 9.3 per cent in pharmaceuticals. So, despite large increases in expenditure by this government on incentives to join a health fund, low and middle income Australians have experienced further health imposts on the family budget, and many are seeking to relieve those pressures by once again exiting health funds and running their luck as before. This is the government that tells us there is no such thing as a free lunch. Clearly the exception to that rule is this government itself: this is another example of how this budget’s largesse is at the expense of something else or someone else. This is a government which sees its role as providing only the most minimal of social safety nets in health, education, child care, aged care and so on. If any publicly provided service or resource provided for more than that, then this government has shown a willingness, even an avid enthusiasm, for reducing that provision to the most minimal by transferring services and resources to the profit driven private sector to make sure the public sector cannot do more than provide the most minimal service. The recent corporate collapses, attributable to what can only be described as corporate delinquency, are instances of where the watchdogs, the regulators, have been reduced by a poverty of resources to do little other than watch. It is as if this government has told the lifeguards on the beach to put away their equipment, save for a pair of binoculars, a pencil and paper by which to observe the conduct of swimmers and to note the drowning as a matter of recordbut never to enter the water. This government’s ideology and prejudice driven social engineering are designed to drive middle Australia away from the community as the standard bearer of social services and resources to the market driven, fee demanding private sector. Monday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27805 Everyone knows the corporate sector is a risky and racy place. More and more of low and middle income Australians’ savings, either through investments or superannuation, are now used by corporate Australia. No longer can corporate Australia behave in the cavalier manner of the 1980s or the recent dot com frenzy. Low and middle income Australia demands now that corporate Australia conducts itself with a community obligation to protect and enhance those investments and savings. It demands that corporate Australia swim between the flags and that the watchdogs, the regulators, be forever vigilant in ensuring that they do. The people of my electorate of Lowe expect and demand better of government. They expect and demand that the community will make more than minimum public provision for health, education, child care, aged care, corporate conduct and rectitude. My constituents of Lowe want to know why, after five years and six budgets of this government, this country seems to be run no better than some hapless Third World country. In fact, the lack of accountability of this government for its conduct is matched only by the Pontius Pilates of the recent corporate collapses. Australians have had enough of the mean and tricky hypocrisy of the Howard government and its corporate allies. What has become blindingly obvious to all Australians is that this government runs two sets of moral codes: one for itself and its big end of town allies and one for the rest of us. Australians expect and demand better of themselves and of their governments. They know our country can do better and they are not happy with their country becoming an international pariah. So far this government has been a one issue per term government: in the first term, industrial relations and the war on the trade union movement with masked men and Rottweilers; in the second term, the GST and the promise that no-one would be worse off-a claim exposed by the recent Newspoll on the GST showing that 57 per cent of the population oppose the GST and 58 per cent believe they are worse off because of the GST; and, in its third term, the coalition only holding out on the promise of the sale of Telstra. What have the last five years of coalition government been for? Attacking working Australians through industrial relations changes, tax changes and the running down of social services and assets. There is nothing about where this country is headed or should be heading. Australia can no longer afford the coalition in government. The time has come for this government and its threadbare mean and tricky ideology to be brushed into the dustbin of history. Finally, all Australians want this government off their backs. This will occur when the election is held on 17 November 2001. 2002. I wish to record my support for this bill because of its focus on a group of Australians who deserve from us our regard and a respectful duty of care. I specifically refer to those older Australians who have worked and raised their families-often in the hardship of the world depression of the 1930s and in a recession or two in later decades-and who had fought or lost loved ones in World War II, Vietnam, Korea or the Malaysian conflict. These older Australians, some of whom are recipients of social security and some of whom are low income self-funded retirees, are Australians who have paid their own way throughout their lives. Many are of little burden upon government revenues and they continue to get on with their lives in a positive and contributory way. I welcome the 2001 budget because I believe it is a budget of honour and respect for all Australians, but especially for our older Australians. As such, it is a fitting budget for the year of the Centenary of Federation. It is a budget that pays tribute in sentiment and in dollars to those who, over the past 60 years or so, have-like our young men who fought on the Kokoda Trail-helped to defend our country during its days of danger. This budget also pays tribute to those who, over their lifetimes, have contributed to the many benefits that every Australian, whatever their circumstances, today enjoys in our great",136,Representatives Main Committee
292,Mrs Vale (Hughes) (5.29 P.m.),"I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 200127806 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 nation. No longer in the work force, they continue to contribute to the Australian community in a positive manner. They do this, for example, through their advice to and support of younger family members, helping them to cope with the daily stresses of life, or through other forms of volunteer community service that are often hidden from the public agenda but are essential to a healthily functioning community. This brings to mind a fine elderly couple who live in my electorate of Hughes, Mr Don Morrison, OAM, and his wife, Nita, of Engadine. Don, actively supported by Nita, has served on various voluntary community committees since the 1930s and was recognised last year for his lifelong service to his local community and to the RSL association. It has been a privilege for me to be a member of a government that, in five years, has steered our nation from a crippling national indebtedness, foolishly created by the opposition when it was in government, to a prudent budget surplus and with the inherited debt substantially paid off. Sixty billion dollars of Labor’s $80 billion debt has now been paid off in five years of sound economic management by the Howard coalition government. This has created interest repayment savings of over $4 billion a year. This is a significant achievement and one which has become a hallmark of the responsible financial management of this government. The coalition government has done this despite knee-jerk ideological warfare by the other parties and their cheer squads who oppose us in and out of parliament. It has been achieved during times of international financial collapse, especially in our own geographic area, and the economic woes of many of our key trading partners. The coalition government has planned for responsible economic management which, in turn, has provided the ability to implement caring social policy. This reasoned and responsible management was not undertaken without pain in some quarters, and there was certainly some screaming and gnashing of teeth by the opposition. But now the hard yards are almost over, and the work has been carried out to the point where we can now implement the care for those in our society for whom we are responsible and to whom we owe respect. Now we can prudently honour our elders, our widows and our aged warriors through the surpluses provided by previous federal governments in federal budgets through the exercise of tough economic restraint and which were implemented without fear of criticism but in determined pursuit of our national economic health. This is not a budget of empty promises to our senior Australians like the infamous 1993 l-a-w law election promises of the then ALP government; but it is a budget of benefits n-o-w for now. This budget is not just about dollars; it is also a tangible message of honour and respect to our senior Australians and their families. Focusing upon low income aged persons, the 2001 budget makes good policy sense. Australia is a greying community. The baby boomers of the late 1940s and 1950s are already beginning to enter early retirement. As our population ages and grows greyer, there is a growing burden upon the younger tax paying workers of Australia to support the elderly. This was one of the vital reasons that we needed a new tax system, so that the government could rely on the widest possible tax base to underpin our commitment to those Australians dependent upon government support. However, we also need to encourage a culture of self-sufficiency in retirement. This requires governments to establish the right precedents and to put in place the right incentives to encourage those in the work force to make prudent and sensible financial provision from their own resources for their retirement years. I believe this budget has begun that process and is sending out the right messages. This budget will have a positive and significant effect at the local community level. For example, I estimate that, in the electorate of Hughes, there are some 2,500 aged persons who are also low income, self-funded retirees who will be substanMonday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27807 tial beneficiaries of this budget. For them, an effective non-taxable threshold will soar from $6,000 to $20,000 for a single person and from $7,000 to about $32,000 for couples. Not only will those who do not exceed the $20,000 threshold not pay any tax but also they will not have to submit a tax return. For all who qualify, it will take effect in the current financial year-that is, it will be backdated to 1 July 2000. If they have been paying tax on any of their income during this financial year, they can look forward to getting it back. I estimate that in Hughes there are about 12,000 fulland part-time pensioners who will benefit from the non-taxable payment of $300 announced in the budget. The purpose of this payment is simple: it is a tribute given as tangible recognition of the contribution to the community made in the past by these older Australians. In my electorate, there are about 20 former prisoners of war of the Japanese or their widows who will benefit from the $25,000 ex gratia payment contained in the budget. Prisoners of war of the Japanese were not covered by the Geneva Convention and suffered a form of brutality that was of exceptional severity, even when compared to the general suffering and horror of war that non-POWs were called upon to endure. More than one in three prisoners died, either at the hands of their captors or through deliberate neglect. Most of us can recall seeing archive film of places like Changi and the Thai-Burma railway and the emaciated living skeletons who managed to survive and emerge from their ordeal of horror. There was also the infamous Sandakan death march which only a handful of the hundreds of Australians who began that forced march survived. Nothing in Australian life compares to that kind of suffering and sacrifice made in order to protect their fellow Australians from the very real prospect of invasion, possible massacre, certain occupation or ruthless exploitation. This $25,000 payment will also be a tangible thank you and tribute to the many wives who, when the war was over, spent many years looking after those who had been deeply scarred physically and emotionally by the brutality of captivity. There are about 300 British Commonwealth and allied veterans and qualifying merchant mariners in the electorate of Hughes who will now qualify for the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. During the Second World War, they were enlisted in the service of countries such as New Zealand, Britain, Canada, Belgium, France, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, the United States and the former Yugoslavia. These older citizens fought alongside Australians against the common enemy and their efforts helped our Australian democracy to survive. We owe them a debt of honour and our continued gratitude. I was especially pleased to hear on budget night that our coalition government would also end Labor’s discrimination against remarried war widows. This restores justice to widows who lost their husbands to wartime service, only to be penalised by later marrying again. Since the decision of the Labor government in 1984, for almost two decades there have been two classes of Australian war widows: those who receive their rightful entitlements and those who were denied what was due to them. This budget offers the nation’s deepest regard and respect to all our war widows. I applaud them, join with local members of Legacy and the RSL subbranches of Woronora River, Engadine, Liverpool, Helensburgh, Bundeena, the Heathcote Services and Citizens Club and the Sutherland United Services Club and salute this initiative on behalf of the war widows in our local area. Families in my area will also be pleased to learn of important initiatives within the health portfolio. In Hughes, there are about 15,000 over the age of 25 who already suffer or will suffer from diabetes. Half are currently undiagnosed. They will benefit from the $49.8 million over the next four years announced in this budget to improve the prevention, early diagnosis and management of this disease. It is estimated that up to one in three people do or will suffer from mental illness at some time in their life and that possibly more than 10,000 people in my 27808 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 electorate will experience a mental health problem in the next year. The budget provides $120 million over the next four years to help GPs provide improved care for those suffering in this way. It will enable greater access to psychological support for patients. This will be good news for families and friends as well. When this flow-on effect is taken into account, I have no doubt that this is one measure that will have a widespread beneficial effect within my electorate of Hughes and within other electorates of members from both sides. Asthma is a real concern for families in the Sutherland Shire. The electorate has approximately 13,000 asthma sufferers living in close proximity to two national parks. This important health issue will also receive budget attention. The budget will provide $48.4 million over the next four years for GPs to better manage this illness through a unique three-plus visit. I also note that the national cervical screening program and the incentives to GPs is worth $71.9 million in the budget. This will increase the number of women participating in this important women’s health program. I am sure it will be widely welcomed by all Australian women, including those in my electorate. The other major scourge afflicting young people is illicit and addictive drugs. As someone who has spoken often about the drug problem I was pleased to see the Australian Federal Police receive an extra $110.5 million in funding over the next four years. This will lift funding for law enforcement from $260 million when the coalition government came into office to almost $400 million in the next financial year. The runs on the board are impressive: over the past two years apprehension of offenders has increased by 30 per cent; illicit drug seizures are up 800 per cent for cocaine and 164 per cent for heroin; recovery of criminal assets is up 140 per cent; and the proportion of finalised cases referred to the legal system is up 70 per cent. These increases are no coincidence or accident. They have come about as a result of the tougher anti-drug policies of this government. These policies have led to the AFP setting up 10 specially trained mobile strike teams based in our major cities and involving 133 agents and specialists. They are having a quantifiable impact on the drug and underworld bosses, quite a number of whom are now locked away. I also welcome a sensitive article in the Daily Telegraph by journalist Anna Cock. She reported significant anecdotal evidence from families who had lost a member to suicide after a history of using the so-called soft and recreational drug, marijuana. I have raised the concerns of parents about this dangerous drug and the connection with incidents of suicides on other occasions before this House. Losing a family member to suicide is the most devastating event that any family could suffer. Unanswered questions remain for years to torment the family, and there is always the weight of an unbearable guilt. It seems to me that it is time we began some qualitative research into a link between marijuana and suicide. But until we can interview many families at such a sensitive time in their lives-after they have suffered such a tragedy-we are not going to get any closer to the truth as to the causes. Now is the time we should learn more about connections between illicit marijuana use and the mental health of our young people. I also note that the young people aged 15 to 24 in the Sutherland Shire have suicide rates higher than the national level. The failed economic policies and the high home mortgage interest rates that plagued Australian families for years under the previous Labor government have placed family relationships under enormous strain. The high interest rates led to many families losing their homes, and many of those families became homeless. For over 30 years the ALP has just shrugged its shoulders as family relationships have broken down and been destroyed by financial stress. Maintaining healthy, functional families is a priority of the Howard coalition government, and the record of low interest rates, low inflation rates and low unemployment levels enjoyed by Australian families since this government began making tough budget decisions in 1996 is Monday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27809 continued in this fifth budget. For example, many Australian families who qualify under the family tax initiative may qualify for a tax free threshold of up to $17,000, depending on the number and age of their children. The Howard coalition government has also recognised the importance of helping to maintain cohesive families. I am also pleased that this government is continuing its efforts to strengthen family relationships. In the 1999-2000 budget the government provided $6 million to fund marriage and relationship education services. It followed recommendations of the report, To have and to hold: strategies to strengthen marriage and relationships, from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, of which I am a member. This report pointed out that marriage breakdowns cost Australia up to $6 billion each year. By better educating people about their relationship responsibilities our government hopes to reduce some of the personal and emotional trauma associated with family breakdowns, both for the adults and for the children. I welcome and applaud the continuing initiatives of the Howard coalition government to support and uphold the families of Australia, which have long been recognised as the basic building blocks of our nation. However, I am mindful that there are other families in Australia who are in deep social crisis and desperate for our understanding and active support. I refer to those families-particularly the women, girls and, tragically, even female babies-in some of our remote indigenous communities who suffer silently and unrecognised by mainstream Australia. I refer to the report by the courageous academic, Boni Robertson, and her team of 50 other Aboriginal women, who toured outback Queensland and some parts of regional Australia. It noted horrific findings of rape and sexual abuse amongst Aboriginal girls, women and even babies as young as 17 months. I also acknowledge with respect Michael Duffy’s article in the Daily Telegraph of 16 June 2001, which faithfully covers this national tragedy. I actually brought this particular report to the attention of House last year, but I am afraid that report also met with silence. That is another reason I raise it again today: it is indeed the real tragedy of indigenous relations within Australia today. I stress that not all remote communities suffered in this way. Indeed, there are many indigenous leaders prominent in Australian society today who deny the existence of the sexual abuse and the murders and who turn their back on their own people. We spend our entire national consciousness, it seems to me, on worrying about past wrongs, but the real tragedy for Australia is this shameful inability-almost a national paralysis-to honestly face and deal with the proper protection of these women and children and help them cope within their families, within the terror of their daily lives. I ask two prominent indigenous leaders recently in the news what they have done to respond to the important report by Boni Robertson. I say, ‘What have you done, Mr Geoff Clark, President of ATSIC? What have you done, Pat O’Shane, to help respond to this report and to support these women and girls and babies? What have you done other than accept the fine accoutrements and high status of your office accorded to you by the wider Australian community?’ Unless and until you and others like you accept that there is a horrendous problem in some of these communities, and that some women’s lives are nothing but terror, and sit down with governments to seek ways to face and address it, you are both frauds upon your own people. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2001-2002, the story of one of my constituents, Mrs Usher, the wife of a veteran who has unfortunately passed away. She looked after her husband for the last 22 years of his life, a period of time in which he was on a pension from Veterans’ Affairs, but not a TPI pension because some of the disabilities he had were not directly attributed to",139,Representatives Main Committee
293,Mr Edwards (Cowan) (5.46 P.m.),"I want to relate to the parliament, in the debate on27810 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 his war service. Mrs Usher recently received a letter from the Minister for Veterans’ Affairsto ‘Dear Mrs Usher’-and I quote from that letter: You may have heard about the $300 one-off payment to Senior Australians that was announced in the Budget recently. You may have read about this payment in the newspapers or heard about it on radio or television. ... ... ... I am writing to let you know about action my Department is taking to make that $300 payment to you. You will receive an extra $300 on top of your usual Department of Veterans’ Affairs pension on payday 14 June 2001. The payment will be made to the same account as your regular pension account. The minister concluded by saying: Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I hope it clarifies what you may have heard about the $300 one-off payment. Mrs Usher thought this was great. She was after a new quilt for her bed and she went out shopping for one. She narrowed it down to a choice of two or three but, because she did not have the money, she did not purchase it there and then. That was fortunate for her because next morning she received a follow-up letter from the Department of Veterans’ Affairs: Following the recent Budget announcements, you received a letter from the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs advising you of an additional $300 payment which you would receive with your normal pension payment on 14 June 2001. ... ... ... The payment will not be credited to your account as previously advised. Officers from this Department have tried to contact all affected people by telephone over the past few days to explain how this occurred and to apologise. Please also accept my sincere apology for this error. So we have the minister pushing out the good news and leaving it to his department to front up when the bad news has to be passed on. I would have thought that if this minister had any decency whatsoever he would have written personally back to Mrs Usher instead of leaving it to his department. I call on the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs to come into this parliament and explain to Mrs Usher and many other veterans why this mistake was made. Unfortunately, we have a Minister for Veterans’ Affairs who has more front than Myers when it comes to photo opportunities but has a heart about as big as a caraway seed when it comes to the issue of getting up and fighting for veterans. I have got a couple of examples of these things, the first of which is found with an organisation called the CT Group. The CT Group are former SAS servicemen who worked on counter-terrorist operations over a period of time. Many of these are young men now discharged. Some of them are as young as late 30s or early 40s and are on TPI pensions. Many of these former soldiers do not qualify, however, for the service pension. They put up a submission, which was passed personally to the minister by the member for Curtin some 18 months ago. The minister has sat on that submission and has done absolutely nothing. A media release recently put out by Martin Hamilton-Smith MP, Member for Waite, says: As an SAS captain, Liberal MP for Waite, Martin Hamilton-Smith led the first group of SAS soldiers in operational counter terrorist duty. Hamilton-Smith was trained by the British SAS in 1979 and subsequently was involved in training and commanding the first teams. “The war in the late 1970s and 80s was not in Vietnam or Timor. It was fought in the capital cities and airports of countries around the world between Special Forces like the SAS and International terrorists.” “These men were on operational service. The Army made this clear to us all.”",143,Representatives Main Committee
294,Dear Mrs Usher,"Monday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27811 “Soldiers were on 24 hour a day, 7 day a week pager recall at a few hours notice for up to a year to deploy anywhere in the world to respond to a Qantas hijack, an Australian Embassy siege or any other terrorist attack or hostage seizure targeting Australians.” “These men were on notice to die for their country throughout 1980. Regrettably as a consequence of their injuries during this operational period many are dying 20 years later. It is not good enough. The Defence Force and the Government need to respond.” “This was more than hazardous training-it was operational service.” … … … “The Australian Defence Force knows that Counter Terrorist work was operational service, for a defined tour of duty to face terrorist conflict. We saw men shot dead, gassed, blown up, drowned and seriously wounded during this operational service.” I am going to come back to that situation in a minute but I really want to know why it is that the minister has not done anything about that submission. I want to know why it is that he has not given those former SAS soldiers the support they need and why it is that he has not helped them put their own submission together. The other example I want to use is the one which relates to the appalling treatment that the minister has handed out to TPI veterans. Not only is his treatment of them as individuals appalling but it is very obvious that this Minister for Veterans’ Affairs is playing wedge politics with veterans’ organisations. Firstly, he is trying to use the national RSL to lean on the TPI association and, secondly, he is trying to create division within that TPI organisation. It is called wedge politics and this minister knows exactly the game he is playing. For some time now many TPI veterans have been pursuing the government over what they see as an erosion of their benefits. The history of the issue is that there is some division in the TPI community, and that is recognised. That division comes about because, while there are some veterans who are well off, there are many others that are not, particularly those who have their TPI pension counted as income against Centrelink benefits. Some of those people are those former SAS soldiers that I spoke about. Part of that division came about when the national executive of the TPI association refused to listen to the rank and file. It ended with a vote of no confidence being passed in the minister and in the then national president. A new president was elected and despite being a sick veteran he has fought hard to represent his members and pursue their issues all to no avail. Indeed, this veteran organisation, made up of sick and disabled veterans, has had to do the work that this government should have done for them. This minister is on the record as conceding that the TPIs have a case but he has done nothing to help them develop their submission; worse, he has dudded them. In a recent letter sent to the National President of the Australian Federation of TPI ex-servicemen and women, he said this: As I said at our meeting, I see a case for carrying forward Proposal1 of your submission to remove VEA Disability Pension from being counted as income for Social Security purposes. This is an issue I would take up on behalf of TPI veterans and other disability pension recipients. This proposal has wide support across the veteran community and will require new expenditure of $27 million per year. When the budget was brought down, people from all over Australia were brought into a lockup, including the national president of the TPI association. He was brought in and read through the budget. There was not a single thing there for TPI veterans-not a single thing. There was nothing from the government in response to their submission and nothing in relation to the commitment the minister gave that he would move to make sure the Veterans’ Entitlements Act disability pension would not be counted as income for social security purposes. When this matter was in the Senate some time ago the ALP moved to amend it. The government refused to accept that amendment and they threatened to pull the Veterans’ Entitlements 27812 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 Act unless we relented. We did relent; the minister indicated then that it was a matter that would be dealt with in the budget. I regret that he has chosen not to do so. There are a couple of other issues that I want to relate to this minister. The first one is the payment to the POWs. It is a pity that it is not going to the prisoners of war in German camps. This minister is on the record as saying that he did not think the POWs should get compensation anyway. The second issue I want to relate is the nashos medal. Once again, this minister was on the record as saying that he was opposed to nashos getting a medal. He is obviously not the one who has fought for these issues; it has come about as a matter of intervention by the Prime Minister. The last thing I want to say relates to the series Australians at War. I watched the series the other night when it dealt with Vietnam. It was interesting how the whole program hinged around the veterans of Long Tan. It is a disgrace that this minister still refuses to allow the veterans of Long Tan to wear Vietnamese medals. This is a right he has granted to every other Australian veteran group or individual. He still refuses to allow the veterans of Long Tan to wear the Vietnamese medals that they were to be presented with. I think that is a disgrace. They will get them. It will not happen under this minister, but it will happen. Party would never have had the stomach to deliver as it rewarded effort and sacrifice. The budget Peter Costello gave Australia reflected the coalition’s belief that effort should be rewarded. This budget rewarded the self-funded retirees, those Australians who have put away for the rainy day, and saved the Australian taxpayer in the process. These are the people we should be rewarding. I am proud to be a member of the government that has made the decision to reward those who deserve to be rewarded. Just after the budget a man called my office and asked what was in the budget for him. He was a self-funded retiree and he had not heard of the benefits that he would gain from the budget. My staff said that on his income he would pay no tax next year and that, when he put this year’s tax return in, he would not be paying any tax this year either. Here is a bloke who was about to get almost $2,700 back in his pocket. He was pretty happy about it, as one would expect. But this man had a long memory. He remembered the last time he was promised tax cuts. ‘Is it l-a-w law?’ he asked. That is the legacy of the members sitting opposite. They have permanently scarred the trust of the Australian people. This budget helped return some of that trust not only by putting money in the pockets of ordinary Australians but by making sure they got the benefit of that money before the ALP could rip it from them. After all, if they can rip you off when it is l-a-w law, it is advisable not to underestimate them. The whole effort of the government has been misrepresented in various ways. I was pleased that the member for Lilley went so far as to suggest we were being too generous. Misrepresentation is one of his favourite devices but it did not work this time. That is why I particularly enjoyed the following exchange between the Prime Minister and the member for Lilley. It went: can you confirm that under your budget a retired married politician living on a parliamentary pension with a joint income of $80,000 per year will receive an ongoing tax reduction of $2,844 per year, or $55 per week, a seniors health card and a pensioners telephone allowance of $17.20 per quarter but that a full-rate pensioner living on $10,500 per year ... will get a one-off payment of $300? Prime Minister, how can you say your budget is fair? the Treasurer last night in relation to self-funded retirees and taxation. The member nods. Also, as I heard the question, it was in relation to a hypothetical example of somebody on $80,000 of income. The",144,Representatives Main Committee

Therefore, your example is wrong. It must have stung. In a similar vein, the Leader of the Opposition delivered his budget response, this time representing what a future Beazley government might do. He was in this place with his hand on his heart pledging not to raise income taxes. Who does these days? His, you should remember, is the party adept at raising wholesale sales tax. Who could forget the sterling effort of the Keating government just after the 1993 election? The Leader of the Opposition said that his budget reply presented choices to the Australian people. You heard it here first-I agree with the Leader of the Opposition. The Australian people have a choice between a party that raises taxes and a party that gives tax cuts. What the ALP never tell you about when they are doing their GST song and dance is the $12 billion in tax cuts that the Howard government gave PAYE taxpayers in the 2000 budget. Instead, they want to bore the public into submission about the GST mugging the economy. They are buskers with only one song to sing, and I can assure the ALP that the tedious refrain is grating the public. What else have they got? Nothing. They have nothing to sell to the public. We gave them the biggest tax cuts in history. Here is just a sample from the coalition’s ‘best of’ collection. In July 2000, there was $12 billion in annual income tax cuts and family benefits went up $2.4 billion. All six hidden wholesale sales taxes were abolished. There were cuts to income tax, capital gains tax rates and company tax rates, and $3.5 billion in export costs was removed. This has been reflected in the export boom the rural sector is currently leading. In 2001, there has been a lower tax rate on franked dividends. Full import tax credits have been brought forward from 1 July 2002 to 23 May 2001, saving businesses about $600 million a year. Capital gains tax relief for shareholders of listed investment companies means that the shareholder will benefit from the 50 per cent capital gains tax discount. Financial institutions duty has been abolished, thanks to the GST. Fuel excise has been cut by 1.5c a litre. Labor’s automatic fuel indexation has been abolished. Company tax has been cut again-this time from 34 to 30 per cent. I would like to remind the members who sit opposite that this government backdates tax cuts. Surely this is the only time any government has ever done this. The backdated tax cuts are a way of correcting the breach of trust the Labor Party has embedded in the psyche of every Australian. Treasurer Costello is to be congratulated for doing his bit to regain the faith of Australian voters in the promises of the people they vote for. There is little doubt that the self-funded retirees of Australia benefited from the 2001 federal budget. But, of course, they were not the only ones to have money in their pockets. The pensioners of Australia were also winners in the federal budget with the $300 pensioner bonus. As the Treasurer said: ... it wouldn’t be fair to cut tax rates for the self-funded retiree and not have benefits for pensioners. He went on to say: This is not a Budget that promises benefits in five years time. That is what restores people’s faith in politics. Contrast this with the Labor Party. I was interested to read the comments made by the shadow Treasurer on 2GB on 31 May 2001. Mr Crean was speaking with Philip Clark. Mr Crean was given the opportunity to come clean and let the Australian people know what he was going to do should, heaven forbid, he start working on the government side of the chamber. It was an interesting interview. Mr Crean had a touch of the Stephen Conroys about him, and those who listened to his effort ended up with waffle for breakfast. Mr Crean was obviously having flashbacks to when he was on this side of the chamber. We all remember the debt the Labor Party left us when they departed office and the pious promises that there was no deficit. Mr Crean, the Flashback Kid, obviously feels a bit of guilt. Here we go with Simon Crean and Philip Clark: 27814 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 promise that there will be a rollback. Why don’t you say right now, “Here are some scenarios based on what we’ve worked out. If the budget surplus is this, if it’s this, or if it’s this, here are three scenariosA, B or C-this is how rollback could work.” You don’t need to wait, you can do it right now. You can say, “This is predicated purely on the basis, of course, that these figures are right. When we get there we’ll have a look but that’s evidence of what we’ll do.’ Why can’t you do that right now? ‘Look, here’s what we’ll do if these figures are correct. We can’t tell until we get there whether they’re correct or not because the Government won’t release the figures. But this is what we’ll do’. We’re not even getting that from you. … … … ours to in a very large way.

These are scenarios only but this is what we’ll do based on what we find out in the books.’ You could do that right now. Rubbish! All the shadow Treasurer needs to do is take the budget and work his tax hikes into it to work out what he is going to have. It is not that hard. What will be interesting is which coalition initiative he wants to slash and burn. He might want to take the knife to the Natural Heritage Trust. The people of Hume would be eager to know if he intends killing this highly successful environmental initiative. In Hume, the Natural Heritage Trust has provided funding for a number of local projects, including the Yass area dieback revegetation project, Bushcare and Landcare in the Narrawa catchment, and revegetating the Jugiong Creek catchment. In fact, all corners of Hume have seen the benefits of the Natural Heritage Trust. The Upper Lachlan Catchment Coordinating Committee has been granted over $100,000 from the federal government’s Natural Heritage Trust to attack salinity. The Upper Lachlan Monday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27815 Catchment Coordinating Committee sought my support for this project and I was pleased to announce in March that they had been successful. I am sure they will be successful in attacking salinity in the area. The Upper Lachlan Catchment Coordinating Committee will target areas of high salinity priority, which have as yet seen little or no Landcare activity in the Upper Lachlan region. The Yass and Cowra district will undertake the same activity. Participating landholders will be offered technical advice and support as well as financial incentives for revegetation in recharge areas. The project aims to generate Landcare activity in these gap areas, to promote improved natural resource management practices and to raise community awareness and understanding of issues affecting productivity and biodiversity. The Natural Heritage Trust is one of those projects that the government has undertaken. When this coalition does lose an election, as is bound to happen one day, I fear the end of the Natural Heritage Trust. Under this government, however, the life of the Natural Heritage Trust has been assured for the next five years. Commencing in 2002-03, another $1 billion has been allocated to help communities continue to repair their local environments. The $1 billion I just referred to is in addition to the $700 million National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. That is, in addition to the funds generated by the interest on the $300 million, remaining in the Natural Heritage Trust reserve. There is little doubt in the minds of the people I have spoken to about the Natural Heritage Trust that the works they undertake have two effects. First, they provide an improvement to the problem they are fixing. Second, they restore the pride people have in their local environment, which leads to long-term care, way beyond the life of any individual Natural Heritage Trust project. Through the trust, community groups have been able to access more funding than ever before to create lasting solutions to local problems. Since the beginning of the trust, over $1.17 billion in funding has been approved for 10,300 projects, more than 300,000 people have worked to address the community’s environmental problems, 600,000 hectares of native vegetation has been replanted or rehabilitated, 15 million seedlings have been planted, 12,000 kilometres of protective fencing has been erected, 5,000 kilometres of waterways have been protected by the installation of fences and more than seven million hectares of land has been approved for purchase or added to our conservation estate. So far, more than 50 federally funded projects have been undertaken throughout Hume. This budget ensures these achievements will continue. Like the Natural Heritage Trust, Work for the Dole will forever be linked to the Howard government, and we are proud of that connection. Of course, Labor has never liked Work for the Dole. It must be the fact that it helps people get back into the work force and back on their feet. The success is proved by the fact that Work for the Dole participants have about an 80 per cent greater chance of landing a job than non-participants. So impressed have I been by the Work for the Dole projects in Hume that I brought Minister Mal Brough from Queensland to see the quality of the work and the benefits that have been reaped by the community and, of course, the participants. In Hume, projects have varied from work being carried out to restore the courthouse at Gunning so that visiting professionals and community groups have a place to work, through teaching people how to build web sites, to the reconstruction and running of a community radio station. These projects are developing skills and making a difference to communities and people. The men and women involved in these projects can rightly hold their heads high, free of any stigma that may be attached to unemployment. These men and women are making a difference. For that reason I am pleased to see that the program is being widened so that more people may benefit, specifically those aged up to 39 years who are receiving benefits. 27816 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 The Work for the Dole principle is mutual obligation. The theory behind it is that those who are receiving unemployment payments should make the most of their opportunities to participate in work and in the community. It must be said that many receiving unemployment payments make a contribution to their communities as parents, carers or volunteers. This is particularly evident in many of the rural communities I represent. When I was in Young a few weeks ago, it was inspiring to hear the long list of names being read out for that day’s Meals on Wheels roster. Those receiving benefits who carry out volunteer caring or parenting work will not be expected to participate in Work for the Dole, illustrating that the Howard government does not expect to place undue burdens on benefit recipients, merely that those in a position to contribute should contribute. It should be remembered that the aim is not to punish, as many of the bleeding hearts in the welfare industry would have you believe; this is about preparing for entry back into the work force. From July 2002 there will be an extra 30,000 Jobsearch training places. There will also be 16,500 more Work for the Dole places and 35,000 opportunities for community work over the next three years. I remind those who oppose the scheme that this is not for people the day after they have become unemployed, but for six months after they become unemployed. The chamber should be reminded that part of the aim is to help people before they become long term unemployed and it becomes harder to enter the work force. The Howard government has also initiated intensive assistance services for job seekers. These services will help the unemployed who have special needs, and may include referrals to literacy and numeracy training. Again, the aim is to help people re-enter the work force. With this in mind, intensive assistance may last up to 12 months if necessary. These programs and incentives are aimed at encouraging and assisting, not waiting and watching. I would like to make special mention of the support that this government is extending to Australian Defence Force cadets. In doing so, I must congratulate Dr Brendan Nelson on the work he has done in this area. The most obvious area of support has been the implementation of the Defence white paper’s recommendation that cadets receive a 25 per cent increase in funding, taking the annual funding to $30 million. But this is not the area that garnered the most media attention recently. It was not the fact that over 25,000 young people are dedicated to being cadets and will be receiving help from the government that will in turn help future recruitment into the Australian defence forces. None of that made headlines. You would have had to look hard to see anything about cadet initiatives beyond recent headlines like ‘Outcry over plan for cadets’ access to guns’ in the Sydney Morning Herald. The story in the Herald, taken from AAP, paraphrased comments from the president of Gun Control Australia, John Crook, that the teen years were a high testosterone period for young men, who should be kept away from anything that promoted violence. Coalition for Gun Control chairman, Roland Brown, was also paraphrased as saying that the move was a bewildering backdown for the government, which implemented national gun laws following the 1996 Port Arthur massacre. We will not dwell on why they were not quoted directly, because I think the more appropriate action at this point is to mention some facts that the anti-gun lobbyists have neatly forgotten to mention while they were busy pandering to the café set. One fact is that most of the 427 cadet units in Australia have maintained the use of weapons since 1996 when many, if not all, state school cadet units had their weapons withdrawn after the Port Arthur massacre. Only 28 per cent of the ADF cadets are private and public school cadets. Seventy-two per cent of units are community based and located either on ADF premises or in the community, and most private school cadet units have maintained the use of weapons under supervision. But, by the Monday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27817 way, the way the anti-gun lobbyists were talking you would think the cadets were being allowed to take guns home and walk the streets with them on weekends-not the case at all. In fact, it is interesting that Dr Nelson will oversee the timely reinvigoration of cadet units and their training in the safe use of firearms. ‘I have been a public advocate for gun control all my adult life. I would be the last person advocating or implementing anything that would contribute to us living in a less safe society,’ Dr Nelson said. It is a shame that the anti-gun lobby has seen fit to score some cheap political points but it did give us a chance to again witness the ignorance of which they are indeed champions. I would like to close by saying that the one reason cadets are becoming such a focus of this government is that at this point in time about a quarter of reservists were cadets and 22 per cent of full-time ADF personnel were cadets, including the Chief of the Defence Force, Admiral Chris Barrie. I thank you, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to make those comments about the appropriation bill tonight. served as yet the latest instance of a government in panic mode desperate to buy its way back onto the federal Treasury benches. We all know that a surplus of $14½ billion, projected two years ago, has collapsed to a figure of $1.5 billion, and today’s revelations in regard to aged care certainly put a further black hole in those estimates. Despite the budget effort, the coalition has offered no relief to ordinary families, to small businesses, to our vital public hospital system or to our struggling poorer schools. However, in the limited time available, I seek to speak about forestry and also defence personnel. The timber industry and timber communities were clearly short-changed in the budget, demonstrating that the minister concerned is unable to match his seeming proindustry rhetoric with genuine assistance. We all recall the embarrassing performance at the Timber Communities Australia conference where from the floor the organisation had to tell the minister that they are sick of the rhetoric, sick of the talk, they want money for people who are facing retrenchment and for people that need to be reskilled, and they are sick of excuses. The chest thumping during question time is all very well, but the industry will progress only with genuine financial assistance from the Commonwealth. To date, the industry has been kept afloat only by the funding that was set aside under Labor’s wood and paper industry strategy and under Labor’s forest industry structural adjustment package. I reiterate: the only money he is usually able to talk about is money committed by the previous government. I am not interested in his excuses about what Senator Hill is doing against him, how hard it is for him to fight within the cabinet, how many people are against him, what a heroic fight he has to wage. The reality is that his only financial effort so far has been to just continue the money that Labor voted. For more than two years, Minister Tuckey has been promising to help the industry through his so-called ‘action agenda’. When this was finally released late last year it contained only one extremely modest funding commitment-extra funding of $1½ million a year for the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation. The opposition, of course, supported the extra funding but we note this evening that that funding, for an industry that he says is so vital and for which he is such a major advocate, is worth only three days of government advertising-three days of funding to promote themselves and try to save their seats is devoted to this industry in this so-called much promoted action agenda. When I queried the absence of any further funding commitments in a question to the minister he replied on 5 March:",146,Representatives Main Committee
298,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Reid) (6.16 P.m.),"Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, the budget27818 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 The Government is in the process of developing the 2001-02 Budget. Details of funding for Action Agenda items are as yet unknown. That was the answer to question on notice 2339. Here we are actually debating the 2001-02 budget, and it contains absolutely no additional funding for the action agenda. In response to my demand for an explanation of this, the minister has been uncharacteristically silent. He might be out there in slinging matches with Minister Hill but he has been silent with regard to what has actually happened to this much vaunted promise. When my colleague in the Senate Senator Forshaw raised this at the Senate estimates the reply on behalf of the government stated: The action agenda is primarily a partnership between the industry and government, so government response to the action agenda should be looked at in the context of whole-of-government expenditureOne is entitled to ask: just what has Minister Tuckey been doing if all his department can refer to in terms of assistance to the timber industry is Labor’s FISAP program or to general road funding? It is thus little wonder that Minister Tuckey has spent most of his time recently talking about fisheries rather than forestry issues. He is obviously embarrassed that Labor’s funding for the timber industry was $39 million for WAPIS and $107 million for FISAP whereas he has managed to get cabinet support for extra R&D funding of only $1½ million a year. Indeed, not only has the government failed to come up with funding of its own for the timber industry, it also has an appalling record in actually spending the FISAP funding that Labor set aside to help the timber industry and those retrenched workers so that they would be able to cope with structural adjustment. Departmental officials-not the Labor Party-have confirmed that $78 million of the $107 million of FISAP funding remains unspent. This is completely unacceptable and it has been repudiated by the industry’s representatives. It has been condemned by every interested party in this field. Essentially, this minister continues to rely on technicalities and excuses, and he is preoccupied with fighting every state government around this country whether coalition or Labor. Since Minister Tuckey became minister 2½ years ago this is his record. In New South Wales the program was totally suspended from November 1998 until late last month. In Western Australia none of the funding promised in May 1999 has been provided, much to the consternation of the member for Forrest, Mr Prosser, who has spoken out recently to both the ABC and the West Australian. Turning to Victoria, only $3 million of the promised allocation of $11.1 million was spent in 2000-01. In Queensland the federal minister has refused to cooperate with that state government on both forest management and action to reduce excessive land clearing. Last month’s budget predicts FISAP expenditure of some $43½ million in 2001-02 to honour existing commitments to New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. I sincerely hope that the government will actually spend FISAP funding this year after the inordinate delays we have seen to date. It is totally unacceptable that the industry has been starved of funding because Minister Tuckey finds it difficult to work with his state counterparts. Half the time he is threatening to destroy their letters-to ‘shred them’. Equally, it is extremely disappointing that the budget contains no provision for additional assistance to the industry in Victoria, which is facing significant challenges due to the revised sustainable yield system that arises from the state’s five RFAs. Turning to defence personnel, the biggest issue facing the Defence Force at present is clearly the coalition’s inability to overcome the current personnel recruitment retention crisis. In last year’s white paper they conceded that the Defence Force would be 12,000 under Monday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27819 strength if its poor recruitment and retention performance continued. I remind the chamber that the white paper promised, at page 63: The government will take firm actionwhatever that is to ensure that that does not happen. More recently, the Auditor-General revealed that, in 1999-2000, 6,467 personnel left the Defence Force but, despite increasing the advertising budget-obviously a government preoccupation-by 112 per cent, the government managed to recruit only 4,043 replacement personnel. That is a net loss of 1,400. They can talk about cadets until the cows come home, but the unfortunate reality is that nobody from the government-least of all Minister Scott-can tell us just what firm action the government has in mind. All we are promised is a so-called defence people plan on top of the previously announced external review of ADF remuneration arrangements. I turn now to defence reserves. Thirteen months ago the government announced, with much fanfare, that the reserves had been allocated additional funding of $20 million. At this year’s estimates we found that the government has in fact spent only $2.7 million of that extra $20 million provided in last year’s budget, a mere 13 per cent of the extra money. This is despite the opposition’s support for the speedy passage of legislation to give effect to several of the announced measures. It is extremely disappointing that so few of the measures that the government announced last August for the reserves have actually commenced. This has not prevented the government from launching a major advertising campaign in yet another field over the weekend. In the meantime we saw the Auditor-General finalise the detailed audit for the defence reserves. That report contains the results and independent analysis of Defence’s personnel data on the Army Reserve, revealing that the Army Reserve shrank by 25 per cent between 1997 and 2000-from 23,875 to a mere 17,363. Even those overall figures disguise the question of how many individual reservists are left. In fact we learn that 12,841-or more than half of the Army reservists on the books in 1997-left three years later. This was a devastating finding for the government which has repeatedly said that the reserves would have to shoulder a greater share of our national defence effort. It is clear from the budget that the government’s rhetoric towards the timber industry and defence personnel is not matched by concrete measures or by adequate ministerial performance. The opposition will continue to pursue those aspects in the weeks and months ahead. Quite clearly, more is needed in the defence area than advertising campaigns and tete-a-tetes with consultants. The reality out there is that there is a significant problem with regard to accommodation and outsourcing-as the Peacock inquiry found-and a variety of other fundamental problems in the personnel sector which will not, I reiterate, be solved essentially by advertising campaigns.

299,Mr Lawler (Parkes) (8.00 P.m.),"I would like to start my contribution to the debate on27820 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 year in interest than they were only some four years earlier. Some interesting statistics show that in 1995 we as a nation, unbelievably, spent the same amount in interest as we did on schools and hospitals and in 1995 we spent nearly as much on defence as we did on paying interest bills. As a businessperson, I think any businessperson would say there is nothing particularly wrong with debt, particularly in business, because most debt is tax deductible, but in effect it means that, if you compare the nation’s debt and interest repayments to a business’s debt and interest repayments, we would really have to make a comparison of a business being in debt for $8 billion, because half of it being tax deductible means you are up for only $4 billion. But governments do not work like that. Governments are part way, I guess, between businesses and private people. When the Labor Party were in government they not only had a garage sale, sold all their assets and increased taxes but they still ran deficits. It is the government equivalent, I guess, of a private house running up unmanageable debt. We all see it in our electorate offices where people come in day after day and, by and large, when they are in financial difficulty, it is somewhat of their own making-sometimes not, but it comes about from uncontrolled spending, no matter how noble that spending might be. It might be spending on a comfortable home for the family or on a nice car, but if you sell your car and your furniture and spend the proceeds and still go and rack up more bills on your Mastercard to pay your Visa card, you just run into an untenable situation, which was the issue that faced this government when they came in in 1996. Sometime that kind of uncontrolled spending has got to stop, and stop it did in 1996. Was there pain? Of course, there was. Is there pain in a household when a household has to cut back and live within its means? Yes, of course, there is. Does everyone in the house agree what the cutbacks are or where those cutbacks should take place, even if they are particularly noble disciplines that that money is being spent on-perhaps dancing lessons, sports or extra tuition for the kids? Everybody does not agree where the cutbacks should be in a household nor have they agreed where the cutbacks should have been that were forced on the Australian government. But, as I said, stopping the spending was what it had to do. The ALP often make comments about this government collecting more tax than ever before. That is hardly surprising, since there are 800,000 more people working now than there were in 1996. The economy is expanding and interest rate cuts have meant more spending so it clearly stands to reason that if that is happening there is more tax collected. Having said that, I have always been a firm believer that, if you claim all the credit when things go well, you also take all the blame when things go poorly. But, clearly, if a country is in a reasonable economic position, it will perform more strongly than it otherwise would in good times and it will fare less badly in tough times. I would like to touch on a couple of things in the budget that relate particularly to my electorate. Clearly, there is not enough time this evening to go through the lot. One of the most welcome things that has happened in my electorate is that self-funded retirees have beaten a path to my door-as they did before this budget to tell me what needed to be doneto tell me, to their credit, that they recognise that their demands have been met. Increasing the effective income tax free threshold for self-funded retirees and pensioners to $20,000 for singles or $32,600 for couples was most welcome. By definition, I guess, this led to an increase in the Medicare levy threshold to that same amount. There has also been the delivery of the non-taxable lump sum payment of $300 to all those of pension age on the pension or part pension. One of the most welcome things was lifting the income limit for the seniors health card to $50,000 for singles and $80,000 for couples. In my previous life as a pharmacist, when the income limit was lifted before-actually it may have been the introduction of the seniors Monday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27821 health card-it was an extraordinarily welcome measure. I understand that an extra 50,000 Australians will obtain the card. For those who do not know, it is quite easy for someone who is a self-funded retiree on blood pressure medication or lipid lowering medication and, say, an ulcer medication to be spending of the order of $70 to $80 a month. That same person, in receipt of a seniors health care card, will spend of the order of $10 a month. It is therefore certainly a measure that is most welcome. Regional universities-and, obviously, the most notable regional university in my books is Charles Sturt University-have been allocated about 6,000 new regional places over four years. Speaking to both students and staff at the university based in Dubbo, which has already been promised another $9 million to expand their services in Dubbo-and they are halfway to the dean and he pointed out the importance of expanding the roll-out of regional universities. He pointed out that, even in the early stages of the Dubbo campus, there were 300 more people receiving a tertiary education from the western area of New South Wales than there would have been if the university campus had not been there. That is not counting students who would have relocated from Albury or Wagga to Dubbo-this was 300 people receiving a tertiary education who otherwise would not have received a tertiary education. There are 6,000 more places going to those universities, including Charles Sturt University. Obviously the motor trade was very excited about businesses being able to claim full input tax credits for the purchase of motor vehicles. One of the other most welcome things-perhaps it was more recognised in the country and less recognised in the city-was the just under $600 million over four years to upgrade the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. This has been of great concern to people not only in the rural and pastoral industries but also in the communities that rely on those industries for their well-being. It has been of great concern that the outbreak that occurred in England could quite easily happen in Australia. Since this government has been in, it has constantly been upgrading the Quarantine and Inspection Service, but this increase of nearly $600 million will go a long way to developing a fortress Australia, even though we cannot, of course, be anything other than ever vigilant. If this dreadful disease gets into Australia, the impact on our part of the world, in country New South Wales and country Australia, and therefore the impact on Australia as a whole, will be incredibly huge. I understand that the minister is looking at further measures to address preparation in the event of this ever happening. One of the great concerns of people in my part of the world is the proliferation of feral pigs. I understand that pigs spread the virus at something like 1,500 times the rate cattle do. That is certainly something that has to be looked at and addressed so that, if we are unfortunate enough to get such an outbreak, by having some control over the feral pig numbers we will be able to quarantine the area and more effectively control the disease. The strength of this government’s economic management has been brought to bear, certainly over the last six months, and the evidence is there for everyone to see. The Roads to Recovery package was incredibly welcome in my part of the world. In my first couple of years as the member for Parkes-and I point out that Parkes goes from Dubbo, Parkes and Forbes in the east right out to the South Australian border and up to the Queensland bordereverywhere I went in the remote areas of New South Wales we had thousands of kilometres of unsealed roads. In fact, on a recent trip, when I was heading out west, I left Cobar on Monday at lunchtime and arrived in Bourke on Thursday evening the same week, and in all that time. I spent about an hour driving on sealed roads. Everywhere you go in my part of the world the roads issue has been raised, despite the fact that the Leader of the Opposition believes that roads are trivial and unimportant. 27822 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 Since the announcement of the $1.2 billion by this government-which it has been able to do by managing the economy to the degree that it has-the comments about funding for rural roads have almost dropped off. The main comment has been not only that do we need that $1.2 billion-which, as well as delivering better roads, is going to deliver jobs in our communities-but also that we need it extended for longer than four years. There is not a council in the western division of New South Wales that would not support that. Another very practical announcement in the budget-which built on the previous budget, in which we spent just over half a billion dollars in new programs to address the shortage of medical practitioners in regional Australia-turns to nursing, which is also extremely welcome. There has been recognition that, while delivering doctors to the bush is important, there is also a critical shortage of nurses and allied health workers in the bush. Now $13 million over four years is going to improve access to undergraduate nursing education for rural and regional students. I understand that there will be 100 rural nursing scholarships worth $10,000 per year available for rural students studying nursing in rural locations. It is not only for rural students; it will allow others to spend their training and their formative young adult years learning in a rural location and those future members of the work force will clearly be far more likely to stay in regional areas. One of the less publicised announcements in the budget which is critical in one part of my electorate, in Broken Hill, is the commitment of $43½ million to improving after-hours primary medical care services. I am having a meeting in the next few weeks with various providers of health care in Broken Hill, including GPs, the area health service, the Royal Flying Doctor Service and some others, to address the critical shortage of after-hours GP services in Broken Hill. By being able to work together and to access funding under that federal government program, it is my belief that they will go a great way towards addressing the problem faced when getting medical attention in Broken Hill after hours. To a large degree, that load has been borne by the area health service. One of the other significant amounts of spending that the government has announced recently is in response to the Besley report and is going to be a huge bonus for telecommunications infrastructure in country Australia. Probably the most significant part of that announcement-and there were several parts to it-will be the delivery of mobile phone coverage to any town which has a population of more than 500 and about $50 million for improved mobile phone coverage. They are only two of the areas of improved telecommunications infrastructure but, again, they are most welcome and greatly anticipated by my communities. One of the important announcements in the budget for the electorate of Parkes was an increase in ABC funding. I understand that there will be an additional $71 million over the next four years as a result of this budget. We in Dubbo and in the areas surrounding Dubbo are anxiously looking to the ABC to open studio broadcasting from Dubbo, instead of delivering the service to the central western region from Orange, as it does now. When they broadcast from Orange, they have a huge area to cover news wise and a lot of the area misses out getting information. It is very important to the strength of rural communities to have a radio station that looks at issues locally and not from a greater regional perspective. Speaking about other things rural and the things that the government’s economic management has enabled us to do, I heard through the grapevine today that the Labor Party, through their minions on the ground in the electorate of Parkes, have been spreading, as often happens, false rumours about the flood assistance package, indicating that the money was all targeted at the electorate of Gwydir for the benefit of the Deputy Prime Minister. CanI say that the money that was delivered and is going to be delivered in the flood assistance package is absolutely critical to the ongoing strength of the economy in western and north-western New Monday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27823 South Wales. I have just called up on the Internet some of the details from the flood assistance package. In the electorate of Parkes there have been 810 successful applications so far. They are grouped in postcodes. In some of the areas where we cannot separate the postcodes, a further 500 are linked between Parkes and Gwydir. I assure anybody who is interested that the electorate of Parkes has been thoroughly well serviced by the flood assistance package. I get daily phone calls from farmers who have applied for assistance under this package. When they receive it, they come to me and say that they would have been out of their farm this year had they not been able to access that assistance. There is a bit of a misconception that this money has been targeted purely at farmers. From my perspective, the target was more rural communities, who are the beneficiaries of farmers spending this money, rather than the farmers themselves. Over the years, the Rural Financial Counselling Service has provided tremendous services to the farming community when they have faced tough years of drought and decreasing commodity prices, and they have done it again with the flood assistance package. There were many people on the edge of their seats, most welcoming the announcement that the government will provide $17.4 million from 2001-02 to 2003-04 to extend the Rural Financial Counselling Service’s program. At this juncture, I congratulate the Rural Financial Counselling Service that operates in the electorate of Parkes for the absolutely fantastic job it does in servicing its constituents, not only in the area of rural financial counselling but in the other areas that it has been asked to expand its services into-for example, providing assistance in setting up rural transaction centres. When it goes to do that sort of activity, its communication with the community allows it to teach the community how to access other programs which deliver great benefits as well. There are one or two more things I would briefly like to mention. One is the extra $1 billion which is going to be added to the Natural Heritage Trust and which is a top-up to the $1.5 million already committed in the 1996-97 to 2001 budget. There are any number of successful programs in my electorate that have been funded by the Natural Heritage Trust. Landcare, Bushcare, Rivercare and all these sorts of groups value add the money that is spent by the Natural Heritage Trust by adding in kind and giving the government-and therefore the Australian community-far more value for money than they would have done had it been a purely funded project which employed people to do all of the work. Finally, a very small measure in the circumstances of the budget-but, again, one that provoked a dramatic response in my electorate-was funding of about $600,000 to upgrade the Bureau of Meteorology base in Cobar. On the Internet it will provide updates, every 10 minutes, of weather forecasts in the western region around Cobar. To those who do not know western New South Wales and do not know much about rural communities, that may not seem like a very important announcement, but I assure you that the radio station operating out of Bourke told me they have received more phone calls about this announcement than any other in this budget or previous budgets. For me, they are the highlights of the budget, and they are able to be delivered because of the sound economic management of this government. There is no doubt that there have been some hard times and some tough decisions have been taken over the last few years, but we are now seeing the benefit of those hard decisions and the government is able to assist those communities in need when they need it without having to go to the Bankcard or the Mastercard to borrow further. broad budget aggregates.

The five great financial lies of the Howard-Costello government are, firstly, that it has cut government spending, secondly, that it has strengthened the Commonwealth’s financial position by reducing government debt, thirdly, that it is a low tax government, fourthly, that the GST is a state tax and, fifthly, that it has set new high standards in the presentation of honest budget documents. TonightI will examine the evidence in relation to each. The first is their record on cutting government spending. Yes, it is true that Howard and Costello made substantial savings in their first budget in August 1996. The subsequent events have shown that many of those decisions were unwise, as much for policy reasons as their unpopularity. That first budget improved the bottom line by more than $2.8 billion in the 1996-97 financial year. The effect of those decisions in the third out year was an improvement in the budget bottom line of $7.6 billion. They held the fiscal line until their second budget in May 1997 when they did some further tightening and Peter Costello declared that he had won the fiscal battle. He was so smug about it he lost focus on the need for continuing financial discipline. By the time of the 1997 mid-year review the fiscal gains he had made were being eroded. The next year was an election year and the year in which a new tax system was unveiled. Big promises were made and 1998 saw a loosening of the budget bottom line by $7.6 billion in the third out year. Governments usually stop spending after an election but not this one. It made new commitments costing $2.5 billion in each of the next two financial years. Now 2001 is another election year and they have looted the 2000-01 surplus of more than $1.6 billion. The budget spend in the new financial year will be almost $3.7 billion. But what is utterly breathtaking is the third out year cost of $7.3 billion for this year’s budget decisions. In this election year, as in 1998, they have made forward commitments that are equivalent to their best year of savings. But this time, unlike the election when they unveiled the GST, there is not even the pretence of a major policy, just a desperate scramble to buy votes. Adding the third out year in the net impact of the fiscal policy decisions table can approximate the ongoing cost of all of the new commitments made by this government. That calculation shows a net deterioration in the budget bottom line as a result of policy decisions of approximately $11.8 billion. That exposes the first great financial lie of the Howard-Costello government: that it has cut government spending. Occasionally the government’s poor position in the polls weighs on the Treasurer. It is at those times he lets slip that the other purpose of all of this spending is to deny an incoming government a sound financial position and the capacity to implement an alternative program. Far from being smart politics, it reveals the decadent psychology of a government that long ago ceased governing for the nation and is now governing for itself. 7KLVEXGJHWIRUHFDVWVDVPDOO FDVKVXUSOXV HDV\WR PDQLSXODWH EXWDGHILFLWRQWKH PRUH rigorous, and previously preferred, fiscal balance.

301,Mr Cox,"The first two of these tables update and correct versions that I have incorpo27826 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 prospects the concern is how little progress the government has made on fiscal consolidation while presiding over five years of strong economic growth. The 2001 budget numbers assumed strengthening Australian and world economies but the budget documents also carry a warning that the US economy may not achieve the growth on which Australia depends. Far from being in a position to weather a significant downturn, the budget is vulnerable and would move quickly and deeply into the red. The Treasurer’s current fiscal boast is to say that he has paid $60 billion off government debt. To be precise, if this year’s budget goes exactly to plan, he will have reduced government net debt by $58.1 billion by 30 June 2002. What he does not say is that he will have sold more than $59 billion of government assets to do it. Peter Costello is entirely dependent on asset sales for debt reduction-more than dependent on asset sales for debt reduction. Those asset sales are in two parts. The first is net proceeds from investments in financial assets for policy purposes. That means the sale of government equity in companies like the Commonwealth Bank and Telstra. They amount to $48.3 billion. The second category is the sale of non-financial assets, like telephone spectrum and public buildings, which amount to $10.7 billion. Together they total $59.037 billion, or a little over $900 million more than the forecast reduction in debt. Have these asset sales resulted in a strengthening of the government’s financial position? If the assets are sold at too low a price, or the government incurs additional costs in the future because it has sold an asset, then the government’s long-term financial position may be weakened. There are obvious examples where that was the case. The pre-eminent example is the sale of the first tranche of Telstra, which was substantially underpriced. Those shares were worth an extra $3.2 billion within minutes of listing, and an extra $16 billion a year later. That exposes the second great financial lie of the Howard-Costello government: that they have cut debt and strengthened the financial position of the Commonwealth. I also have a major concern that I have raised with the Auditor-General about the effect of the sale and lease-back of government buildings on future Commonwealth outlays. Next is the issue of the Treasurer’s characterisation of the GST as a state tax. Reading the budget papers it is as if the GST did not exist. The historical data presented in the budget papers does not include the GST. Why does the Treasurer insist that the GST is a state tax? By doing so he can present figures that show the lowest level of tax as a proportion of GDP since the Whitlam government. When you add in the $23.9 billion of GST, instead of 21 per cent of GDP in 2000-01, the result is 25 per cent of GDP being accounted for in tax. That is the highest tax to GDP ratio in Australia’s history. That exposes the third great financial lie of the Howard-Costello government: that they are running a low-tax government. Mr Costello even argues that he should be given credit against his tax take for some new outlays programs that accompanied the new tax system, but that is the Liberals’ big problem-they had to create so many outlay programs to try and compensate for the adverse effects of the GST that they became the biggest taxing and spending government in Australian history. How do you settle the issue about whether or not it is a state tax? You go to independent authorities-in this case, the IMF and the ABS. This specific issue is thoroughly examined in the ABS’s information paper No. 5517.0: Accruals Based Government Finance Statistics 2000. Chapter II.G of the IMF GFS manual provides a general guide for the attribution of tax revenues to non-collecting beneficiary governments, and sets out five specific rules for use in the attribution of tax revenues among collecting and beneficiary governments. The ABS has published an assessment of the GST against each of these rules to determine whether the revenue from the GST should be attributed to the states. Four of these rules are inapplicable, but the ABS found: Monday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27827 Rule 2: Tax revenues which a government collects and unilaterally earmarks at its discretion for distribution to another government should be shown as revenue of the collecting government and an intergovernmental transfer to the beneficiary government. So that rule is applicable. According to the ABS, the Commonwealth has the ultimate role in determination and distribution of GST revenue. On the basis of these IMF rules, the ABS found the GST is a federal tax and the Treasurer’s budget papers should have reported it as one. That exposes the fourth great financial lie of the Howard-Costello government: that the GST is a state tax. What is more disturbing is that that analysis came from the relevant independent statutory authority within the Treasurer’s own portfolio, and he chose to ignore it. Why? Because he wanted to conceal the fact that he is running the biggest taxing and spending government in Australian history. That exposes the fifth great financial lie of the HowardCostello government: that it has set new high standards in the presentation of ‘honest’ budget documents. 2002, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2001-2002 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2001-2002. It does not seem all that long ago since I stood in the Main Committee to discuss the benefits that the 2000-01 appropriation bills would have on my electorate of Forrest and the communities of the south-west. The 2000-01 budget contained major reforms on rural and regional health as part of the $562 million More Doctors Better Services package. This is already having a major impact on many communities in the south-west. Walpole and Silver Chain received a $750,000 commitment to increase health services out of the package. This has meant increased GP services from one day to three days per week; increased access to mental health services, podiatry care and physiotherapy services; increased access to occupational therapists; first-aid and ambulance training for willing community volunteers; increased home nursing and support for the elderly; and better access to aged care support to allow the elderly to stay in their homes longer. The federal government also announced as part of its 2000-01 budget new medical scholarships-the Rural Australian Medical Undergraduate Scheme, the Medical Rural Bonded Scholarship and the John Flynn scholarship-to help attract continuing or recently graduated medical students to rural areas. South-west students have already benefited from these scholarships. The best way to get professionals back into rural and regional Australia is by training those that grew up there and were basically living in the area, giving them opportunities to go back to work in the communities that they came from. The 2001-02 budget has continued to build on the solid gains made in health in the last budget and over the preceding years. The further strengthening of Medicare and the health system by committing an additional $900 million shows that the federal government does more than care about the health and well-being of people living in communities in the south-west and across Australia, and shows that the federal government acts on that commitment in a way which benefits all Australians. Little attention has been paid to the record funding that Medicare received in this year’s budget-an additional $750 million-which will help make Medicare stronger than ever by improving access to primary care services, boosting targeted funding for quality primary care and making medicines safer. The budget provides for an increase in patient rebates for GP services of $300 million over four years. By providing increased rebates for longer consultations, this measure particularly benefits patients with complex or chronic conditions who may need to spend more time with their doctor. The budget allocates $48.4 million over four years to assist GPs to better assist those with moderate to severe asthma.

302,Mr Prosser (Forrest) (8.29 P.m.),"I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 200127828 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 of whom I met during the Centenary of Federation celebrations, has asthma. I want each and every one of them to have treatment from their GP that is considered best practice. The ‘asthma plus three’ plan that this funding provides for aims to do just that. I have great interest in mental health and I am the patron of Pathways, a mental health services group based in Bunbury that does an outstanding job. I am delighted that mental health is the priority in this budget that it deserves to be with an extra $120.4 million in funding over the next four years to assist GPs to develop their skills in mental health diagnosis, care and treatment. A new Medicare benefits schedule item will be introduced for trained GPs to provide a range of non-medication based therapies. The government will also be supporting doctors to form links with other mental health professionals. Once again, the mental health package builds upon previous initiatives-including Beyond Blue, and the National Depression and National Primary Mental Health Care initiatives-which provide a range of care options for those 2.4 million Australians experiencing a mental health problem each year. Some 450,000 Australians have diabetes but do not know it, and an estimated 900,000 have this debilitating disease. I doubt there would be a member of this House who would not know someone or who would not have a member of their own family who is affected by diabetes. In recognition of this, an amount of $49.8 million over four years has been allocated to improve prevention and to provide incentives for GPs for earlier diagnosis of the disease. After-hours emergency care funding of $43.4 million, $71.9 million for increased funding for cervical cancer and $18.1 million for safer use of medicines is proof positive of this government’s genuine commitment to the health and well-being of all Australians no matter where they live. This budget provides $238 million for government schools, which is 87 per cent of the funding for specific schools initiatives contained in this year’s budget. There is no doubt that investing in our children and their education, health and well-being is one of the best investments we can make. I have been to many school assemblies recently and met with many students during the Centenary of Federation celebrations, on ANZAC Day and as part of my normal role in attending school assemblies and presenting honour certificates on school prize nights and the like. There is really a friendly and positive atmosphere at schools that was not there in my day. All the children I have met have been fantastic, the teachers are committed to providing supportive but challenging learning environments and each school has a strong community network and great resources. Key initiatives funded in this year’s budget include $143.5 million to strengthen government schools by returning funding under the EBA to develop students’ scientific, mathematical and technological skills as well as developing and building schools based innovation and supportive learning environments. Literacy and numeracy funding of $36.9 million over the years 2001 to 2003 will support the government’s keen focus on literacy and numeracy and the national literacy and numeracy plan. This plan has already seen a 13 per cent improvement in the reading ability of year 3 students across the country. Provision for additional resourcing of $99.5 million over 2003-04 and 2004-05 has been made. Schools do much for children but the most basic building block kids will need to get through life is to be able to read and to numerate. We take for granted the ability to read a good book, read signs, read mail and the labels on food on the grocery shelving. Yet there are many that cannot do these things. It is beholden on governments to resource schools so that they can focus on the basics-the three Rs. Online curriculum development has been given a boost with $34.1 million to support online curriculum development. This should allow schools to share world-class curriculum material. An amount of $46.7 million has been allocated to assist 70,000 young people per year moving from schools to further education, training and work. This funding maintains the Jobs Monday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27829 Pathways program, and I am pleased that those young people who need extra support in moving on from school will receive it. I also want to comment briefly on the $34.8 million for new places at regional campuses, with 670 new places on top of the existing allocations commencing next year. Last year both universities which have regional campuses in my electorate-namely, Edith Cowan University, which has a campus in Bunbury, and UWA, which has a campus in Albany-came to see me about research funding specific to regional universities, which excludes Western Australia as WA only has regional campuses. I took this up with the minister at the time and I am pleased to note that regional campuses have been recognised with this allocation of new regional places. There is no better way to keep our young people in regional communities than to educate them and to offer them opportunities in regional centres. It is a forward thinking government that recognises this. According to the Department of Employment, Training and Youth Affairs, although comprising one-third of all school students, students from remote and regional areas constitute only 17 per cent of tertiary students in Australia. I hope that ECU and UWA gain new places so they can offer more opportunities for young people in the south-west to learn and live in their own communities. Margaret River Senior High School, which I have discussed in this House before, has been an outstanding school. Margaret River has a retention rate for kids completing year 12-in WA that is the final year of schooling-which runs to upward of 92 per cent and an acceptance rate for university of 89.4 per cent. This is an excellent result and, for a regional school, truly extraordinary. The community is very closely involved in the school and they tell me that, when that year 12 generation of kids leaves to go to uni in Perth, a part of their community is missing and they do not feel complete. Not surprisingly after this level of support, when these Margaret River young people are by themselves at uni without the family and peer support that they had at high school, many struggle, despite being as bright and committed as their metropolitan counterparts. Consequently, many return home without completing their studies. This is not good enough. Universities need to examine their peer support structures, and I think the government needs to look at doing more in respect of youth allowance for young people from regional and rural areas studying at university. I am committed to ensuring that young people in the south-west have the very best opportunities and, more importantly, that those young people are in a position to take advantage of those opportunities. Their futures are our futures, and our south-west communities will need these young people to remain vibrant. Finally, I want to briefly touch on the boost in funding for our quarantine system. Coming from a regional area that relies on its clean and green image to trade on world markets, an image that gives the south-west and indeed Australia a competitive advantage when trading our produce, I know that to lose that would be disastrous. Whether it be the apple growers in Donnybrook, the home of the famous Pink Lady, concerned about fire blight, the table grape growers and the vineyards concerned about Pierce’s disease and the glassy-winged sharpshooter, or the many beef and dairy producers in my electorate concerned about BSE and foot-and-mouth disease, our entire community has a stake in protecting our borders from disease. Not only would an incursion of any one of these three diseases result in growers and producers suffering severe hardship because their produce has been affected; it would ruin our clean and green image, and you cannot put a value on that it is just priceless. Australia remains one of the few countries in the world free of fire blight and BSE, and it is important that we remain that way. This year’s budget provides an additional $596 million in funding for quarantine. It includes $5.7 million for AQIS up until 30 June 2001 to support extra measures introduced to counter the UK and European outbreaks of foot-and-mouth dis27830 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 ease; $281.4 million from 2001-2002 through to 2004-2005 to boost quarantine enforcement by AQIS; and $238.8 million over the same period for Customs to provide quarantine support services. This will have the effect of dramatically strengthening our borders and protecting our agricultural industry from exotic pests and diseases. A sum of $68.8 million has been identified to alter infrastructure at international airports and international mail centres as well as to cover ongoing surveillance costs at Australia Post. Risk management and preparedness arrangements for BSE and foot-and-mouth disease are being coordinated by a high level industry and government management group and have received resources of $1.2 million. Finally, half a million dollars has been allocated to purchase reagents which allow rapid testing of suspected foot-and-mouth cases as part of the surveillance program. These resources will mean the great majority of passengers will undergo physical inspection or X-rays, and this will be combined with an enhanced detector dog support unit. All aircraft containers will be inspected and cargo of quarantine concern will also be inspected. On top of this, all ships will be inspected with increased general surveillance. Sea cargo containers will continue to be externally inspected, and matters of quarantine concern will also be internally examined at mail exchanges by X-ray and detector dogs. Greater public awareness to better inform travellers will take place in both English speaking and non-English speaking countries. As an island nation, we are lucky that we have one of the greatest physical barriers to diseases, and so far we have been able to keep out many exotic pests and diseases. Our customs and quarantine officers and their detector dogs do a great job in protecting us from external threat. We all have a stake in quarantine matters, and it is important that customs and quarantine officers be resourced properly so they can continue to protect us and our clean and green image. I commend the bill to the House. that the Australian people will have before them later this year when they vote to elect a national government. Never before have the differences between the present government and the Labor opposition, the government in waiting, been so stark. This budget demonstrated the government’s total lack of vision and direction for taking this nation forward. It demonstrated that it is the big end of town that this government directs its policy initiatives towards and, most sadly, it demonstrated how totally unconcerned this government is with offering any assistance to those sections of the community that have been hit hardest by the GST. It was a budget that saw no priority in building a robust public education and public health system and no priority in reducing unemployment. It was a budget from a government that is all out of ideas and is resorting to cynical, vote buying policies before it disappears into the political wilderness. In contrast, this side of the House is a government in waiting-a government in waiting with a vision about where it wishes to lead this country, a government in waiting that will ensure that the most vulnerable sections of society are not left behind, a government in waiting that sees education, health, jobs and a fairer tax system as its priorities. National governments cannot pick and choose whom they wish to govern. They cannot select certain sections of society and favour them at the expense of others, yet this is exactly what this government has chosen to do through this budget. National governments must govern for all of us, and those opposite might do well to remember that statement. ‘For all of us’ might have been yet another throwaway line in an election campaign for the government, like so many others it has made, but for a Beazley Labor government it will not be. We move on to education. When the Leader of the Opposition addressed the Sydney Institute last week, he outlined how this nation is investing less and less in its education system and he outlined what some of the consequences of this trend are. The Howard government’s",161,Representatives Main Committee
303,Mr Wilkie (Swan) (8.45 P.m.),"The 2001 budget very clearly demonstrated the choicesMonday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27831 budget contains no measure that will address this situation. The only increased funding is to the wealthy category 1 schools. The Swan electorate has no category 1 schools. Therefore, not one student in the electorate will benefit from this budget. They will, however, benefit from the election of a Labor Beazley government. They will benefit from the $100 million more in capital funding to public schools and better teaching standards delivered by some of the 1,000 new teachers who will access scholarships to undergo training and the 10,000 existing teachers who will be able to access courses to build their skills. A Labor government sees a reversal in the stagnation of the year 12 retention rates as a priority. Rebuilding the university education system that this government has plundered in its five years in office will be fundamental to this plan. Larger class sizes, increased fees and ballooning HECS debts are a disincentive to students making important decisions about their future. Labor wants to help them with regard to making those decisions. Like the primary and secondary schools in Swan, Curtin University of Technology did not benefit one iota from the recent budget. Like its counterparts around Australia, Curtin University must generate more of its income from fee paying students because of reductions in public funding. The result of this trend is a focus on more popular courses, particularly in the business stream, and a focus away from the teaching and learning subjects that are fundamental to a well-educated knowledge nation. As class sizes grow, fewer books are available in libraries, less is invested in teacher training and the overall quality of tertiary education declines, all thanks to the Howard government’s reduction in investment in education. Students graduating are then hit with the Howard government’s double whammy: they have enormous HECS debts and, on 1 June 2001, their HECS debts went up another 5.3 per cent thanks to the inflationary effects of the GST. Fewer students are undertaking research degrees in science, engineering and technology, meaning fewer students are working on the development of new products and processes in these fields. Those who do make a start in these sectors find that the government’s reduction in R&D investment means they must look overseas for opportunities to pursue their endeavours. The Howard government has no vision to address this brain drain. In fact, it does not even acknowledge its existence. In contrast, Labor sees it as a fundamental part of its education vision. With all the advertising this government is presently targeting at Australia’s seniors, one might be forgiven for thinking that the recent budget actually contains some benefits for them. But it does not. Unlike the Howard government, Labor is not about cynical vote-buying through hollow promises. Its measures for seniors have some substance. Unlike the $300 payment to age pensioners, when Labor’s measures are put under scrutiny they will not suffer from analysis of the fine detail. Three hundred dollars sounded great for older Australians, except that it was $700 short of what they were promised last year. It also sounded great to other pension recipients until they found out that, if they were disability support pensioners, mature age allowees, Newstart allowees, carer payment recipients or wife pensioners, they were among the 350,000 people who the Howard-Costello double act had decided did not need GST compensation. The broken promises on GST compensation join the list of kicks in the guts to older Australians by this government. For seniors in aged care, Labor prioritises fundamental reforms to raise the standards provided. But this cannot be done with a minister who has disappeared into thin air and is too afraid to show her face because she knows that her appalling failures in overseeing this industry will be shown up. It will be achieved through identifying aged care as a priority and implementing strategies which form a long-term vision. Labor will repair the 27832 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 damage through the establishment of a national benchmark of care and an aged care ombudsman. As with aged care, Labor has prioritised repairing the damage done in health by this government, with a vision to implement innovative strategies aimed at improving public health. Labor would commit $90 million to a comprehensive strategy to improve the prevention, detection and treatment of cancer through a new national approach. In relation to Medicare, under the Howard government, the residents in Swan have had to travel to Cannington to stand in ever-increasing queues at the Medicare office. Labor says, ‘This is not good enough.’ More Medicare offices are a priority. I believe that areas such as Belmont and Victoria Park, where the shopping precincts have undergone significant expansion, should be supported by this important government infrastructure. Labor continues to believe fundamentally in the importance of Medicare and measures to ensure its continuing improvement. The Medicare after hours program would provide Australians with access to medical advice out of hours, reducing waiting times to consult a doctor at night and on weekends. The Swan electorate is home to Perth airport, which is an important gateway for tourism and business for the whole of Western Australia. Unfortunately, the residents of nearby areas such as Queens Park bear a heavy burden from this important facility. They live under the flight paths of the present runways and the children suffer in their primary schools from intolerable noise. Unlike residents in similar situations in Sydney and, I believe, in Adelaide, the government is providing no funding to install double glazing and other noise amelioration programs in the houses and schools. It is not practical to relocate Perth airport, but I believe it is both practical and a priority to provide these residents with at least the same relief as is provided in other parts of Australia. I also believe that we should not compromise the safety of all air travellers using Perth airport, and of residents living under the flight paths, by relocating air traffic control operations to Melbourne-a plan this government is proceeding with. For the high cost and minimal savings, there is no justification in placing the safety of so many people in jeopardy. It should be a priority to spend this money on noise amelioration measures. Small businesses and microbusinesses are the backbone of Western Australia’s economy and they are an integral part of the Swan electorate. Thanks to the Howard government, every one of these businesses has now been appointed a tax collector, without even being consulted. Every one of these businesses has had complex compliance procedures forced upon them. For Labor, the priority would be to reduce as much of this burden as possible so that the businesses are freed up to get on with what they do best-running and growing their businesses and generating employment opportunities for other Australians. Labor would allow businesses to submit an annual return instead of a quarterly one, and this is a measure that has been warmly received by small businesses in the electorate. The measures outlined today reinforce two fundamental differences between the tired government sitting across the chamber and the government in waiting on this side. Firstly, Labor has a vision about what it wants to achieve in government. It is a vision based upon important priorities for creating the sort of society that Australians want and identify with. Secondly, it is based on priorities that will ensure that a Beazley Labor government governs for all of us, so that all of us in society and not just the privileged few benefit from the prosperity of this nation. continues this government’s record of sound, responsible economic management-management that is careful, sensible and sustainable.

304,Mr Bartlett (Macquarie) (8.55 P.m.),"This budget does three main things. Firstly, itMonday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27833 sharp contrast to that of the former government. Thirdly, it addresses areas of need. Let me tackle each area in sequence. This budget is a responsible budget and is part of this government’s proud record of responsible economic management. This budget is the coalition’s fifth surplus budget in a row. This government is living within its means. It is delivering essential services and is doing so within the capacity to pay. Compare and contrast this with the former government, a government that ran five deficits in a row in its last five years, averaging $14 billion-that is, $14,000 million, a year. The former Labor government, outrageously, lived beyond its means and mortgaged the future of our children and grandchildren to pay for its profligacy and irresponsible spending. Not only is the coalition government living within its means but it is repaying the massive debt built up by Labor. Already this government has repaid $50,000 million of Labor’s debt. By the end of this year it will have repaid $60 billion of government debt. As everyone in this country knows, in its last five years alone, the Labor government ran up Commonwealth debt from $27 billion to $97 billion, an increase of $70 billion-an outrageous legacy of debt heaped onto the shoulders of the next generation. This government, by its careful management, has already managed to repay $50 billion of that debt. The other point that needs to be made about debt is that not only did Labor run up $50 billion of debt by spending more than it raised in revenue but it sold off everything that was not nailed down and still managed to increase debt by $70 billion. The third thing is that by repaying this $50 billion of debt-$60 billion by the end of this year-this government will be saving taxpayers that considerable annual drain on taxpayer revenue that goes in interest payments to service debt. When we came into office in 1996, $8 billion a year-that is, $8,000 million a year-of taxpayers’ hard earned money was spent just washing down the drain to pay interest payments on the debt that the Labor government had so irresponsibly racked up in its last five years. That annual interest payment has already been reduced from $8 billion to $4 billion. Now, because of this government’s sound management, we are saving $4 billion a year of taxpayers’ money. Instead of being wasted on interest payments, that saving is now able to be spent on schools, roads, infrastructure, health, defence and family assistance, on essential things that this country needs-not the legacy of debt but the legacy of sound, responsible management over five years of this government. Many other key indicators give evidence of this government’s sound and sensible approach to management. When we came into office, home loan interest rates were 10.5 per cent; they are now 6.8 per cent. The average mortgage holder with a mortgage of $100,000, as everyone knows, is saving over $300 a month because we have reduced the pressure on interest rates. We have reduced the pressure on interest rates because the government is not in the market borrowing massive amounts of money-$14 or $15 billion a year-and putting upward pressure on rates. That is the benefit of living within one’s means. Over Labor’s 13 years, home loan interest rates averaged 12.8 per cent. They are now 6.8 per cent-six full percentage points below what they were on average over the 13 years of Labor. This is a massive benefit for home buyers and a massive benefit for businesses borrowing money or running overdrafts. This is one of the benefits of responsible management. Look at unemployment figures: when we came into office, 8.6 per cent of Australians were unemployed; now 6.8 per cent are unemployed. Over 800,000 jobs-most of them full-time jobs-have been created under the government because of our strong approach to managing the country. Over Labor’s 13 years, unemployment averaged 8.7 per cent, peaking at 11.2 per cent in a deliberately created and heartless recession. The government are responsibly managing the country and, in doing so, are not just correcting the bottom line but providing real, tangible benefits for the average working Australian. 27834 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 This budget is based on a forecast growth rate of 3¼ per cent-further evidence of the proceeds of good management. We have a world that is going into recession. Most Asian economies are going backwards and the US economy is in a very shaky position, yet the Australian economy looks like it will grow at over three per cent in the next financial year. It does not happen by accident; it happens because the government provides the parameters, provides a sound framework and provides a confident environment in which Australians can invest, expand, produce and employ. Further, the outlook is for inflation to fall to the 2¼ per cent forecast for the next year. If you want to look at other indicators, look at our trade performance. We have an improving balance of payments outlook. In fact, we have an outlook that has the current account deficit at less than three per cent of GDP-a figure rarely achieved over the past 20 years. It is 2.8 per cent of GDP at the moment. Look at Labor’s record. Several times under Labor the current account deficit reached over six per cent of GDP, but the government have got it down to three per cent of GDP. Why? Because we have encouraged exports. Why? Because we have reduced $3½ billion worth of taxes for our exporters. Why? Because we have provided low interest rates to stimulate business investment. Why? Because we have had the Australian government out there forming strong deals with other countries and marketing our exports. This government is a government which delivers benefits for Australian consumers, benefits for Australian families, benefits for Australian businesses and benefits for Australian retirees because of its strong management of this country. Just look at the contrast. Quickly contrast the record under Labor with the record under this government. Under Labor, there were massive budget deficits, averaging $14 billion a year for Labor’s last five years in government. Under this government, for the last five years there have been budget surpluses. Under Labor, there was exploding debt-$70 billion of debt notched up in its last five years. Under this government, we have already had the repayment of $50 billion of debt. Under Labor, there was high unemployment. Under this government, there is falling unemployment. Under Labor, there were cripplingly high interest rates. Under this government, there are low interest rates. Under Labor, there were high, uncontrolled current account deficits. Under this government, there are low, controlled current account deficits. Under Labor, there were high and growing taxes. Under this government, there are tax cuts. There are cuts in income tax. Last year we had $12 billion of cuts in income tax. Last year we had a two per cent cut in company taxes-from 36 per cent to 34 per cent-and in just two weeks time there will be a cut of another four per cent from the corporate tax rate. We had removal of the wholesale sales tax last year and we will have removal of financial institutions duty from 1 July this year. This government’s record is one of which we can be proud and one which has really set up the future for our children and our grandchildren. Look at the alternative. Labor has already indicated the foolishness, impossibility, contradiction and hypocrisy of its approach. Labor is claiming on the one hand that it wants to roll back the GST, yet it is saying that it also wants to increase spending. We have had a number of speakers in here tonight already saying, ‘We want to increase spending on this. The government hasn’t spent enough on that. We want more money to go into something else.’ How in the world is Labor going to increase spending on everything that it can think of and yet roll back the GST and promise not to go into deficit without raising taxes? ber opposite wants to talk about cutting back our extravagance. I would ask the member for Swan: which government programs would you cut? Would you cut the $1 billion that we have allocated for the Natural Heritage Trust that is doing so much good for our environment?",166,Representatives Main Committee

The memMonday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27835 Would you cut the allocation of $23 billion extra for defence spending over the next 10 years? Would you cut the $900 million increase in funding for health? That would come to less than 0.1 per cent of total government funding. What you are suggesting is an absolute farce, and you know it is a farce. You want to increase spending. Which taxes would you raise? That is the bottom line. Would you double capital gains tax again? This government cut capital gains tax by half. Labor members opposite, would you double capital gains tax again? Would you raise income tax again? Would you raise the company tax rate from 30 per cent back to 36 per cent? Would you introduce a death duty? Would you raise GST? Would you re-introduce wholesale sales tax? Several of those things would have to happen if you were to continue with your policy. Labor has no future. It has been caught out with empty rhetoric, promises of grand spending and roll-back, with no way in the world to fund any of those promises. This budget does a couple of other key things. Besides continuing this government’s program of responsible management, it provides incentives in key areas to encourage, assist, motivate and reward people who look after themselves-firstly, by assisting people to get back into work. It is not about removing the welfare safety net; it is about encouraging and assisting self-sufficiency. We know in this country that the only way to get people off welfare is to give them incentives and assistance to stand on their own two feet. The McClure report made it clear that the best thing we can do to assist people on welfare is to help them get into employment. This budget does this. It continues the commitment to mutual obligation-the commitment that we have already seen in the very successful Work for the Dole program. This government is about active welfare, not passive welfare, not the debilitating passive approach of the Labor Party which further entrenched dependence. This government’s approach is about providing incentives and assistance for people to stand on their own two feet. This package allocates $1.7 billion over the next few years for Australians working together. There are a number of programs that I will not go into in detail which include: the Working Credit initiative, Jobsearch training and Work for the Dole, expanding places in literacy and numeracy training to remove those barriers that prevent young people getting into work, and more Work for the Dole projects, which Labor is opposed to. Labor fought us every inch of the way when we tried to introduce Work for the Dole, yet that scheme is working effectively in getting young people in particular off the unemployment queues, out of long-term unemployment and into work. not supporting his Work for the Dole projects. In my electorate, it is very effectively getting people off the dole and into work. One of my electorate’s Work for the Dole schemes has a board up called the ‘victory board’. On this board they list the names of people who were formerly on unemployment benefits who have gone on to full-time training or into employment. They are up to their fourth or fifth board with people actually getting jobs. Work for the Dole, which Labor opposes, gives parents assistance and encouragement to get ready to return to work as their children grow up. There are some 7,000 new disability employment assistance programs and a number of other programs to train people with disabilities to prepare for work, to provide assistance and rehabilitation programs and to give those people opportunities to get back into the work force. I do not have time to go through the details of the many very beneficial programs here in the third main area of the budget, which comprises targeted-and I have got to say in contrast to Labor-and affordable programs that will address key areas of need. The first is to reward retirees who have made an effort, worked and paid taxes all their lives and have put aside",168,Representatives Main Committee

308,Mr Bartlett,"It might not be in the Swan electorate. Perhaps the member for Swan is27836 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 money to invest wisely for their own retirement. There are a number of benefits here. This government for the last five years has been working to assist self-funded retirees. We raised the tax-free threshold some four years ago for low income self-funded retirees. This budget goes a step further: self-funded retirees receiving up to $20,000 will receive the full pensioner rebate that pensioners receive and effectively pay no tax. This phases out up to $37,840 for singles and some $58,000 for couples. Further, as well as raising the tax-free threshold, the seniors health card now becomes available for self-funded retirees: for singles up to $50,000 and couples up to $80,000-something the Labor Party never thought of doing-and there is the exemption of the superannuation assets for over-55s. A couple of weeks ago I was out doorknocking, as one is wont to do in a marginal seat. I was speaking to one gentleman about some of the benefits in this budget and, totally unsolicited, this self-funded retiree said to me, ‘You know, Labor never did anything for self-funded retirees.’ Labor never did anything for self-funded retirees because Labor’s approach is not to encourage self-sufficiency; Labor’s approach is to encourage dependency. This government is about rewarding, encouraging and assisting those people who want to make an effort and want to stand on their own two feet. There are many other benefits in this budget: the $300 tax free for people on full or part aged pensions; the benefits for veterans of a $25,000 tax-free non-assessable grant to POWs of Japan; the repat Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme benefits for people who served in the British Commonwealth allied forces and who have been in Australia for over 10 years; and the granting of the war widows pension to those war widows who married before 1984. Another very important benefit is the increase in defence spending and the strong commitment that this government has to rebuilding our defence capabilities, so badly ignored by Labor during their 13 years in office. This budget contains the first step in implementing the government’s strategy outlined in the defence white paper, $500 million extra this year. A 10year increase will see an extra $28 billion spent on defence. I firmly believe that one of the key responsibilities of any government is to ensure the security of its citizens. This government is committed to ensuring the security of its citizens by substantial ongoing commitment to increasing defence spending, with real increases of three per cent per annum over the next 10 years. This government is serious about this obligation. Other aspects of this program include an increase of nearly $600 million over the next five years for customs and quarantine. I could mention the increased spending for education, increased spending for health and increased spending for the environment. I just want to make a final couple of points about education. This budget delivers an extra $238 million for schools over the next four years on top of the increased funding allocated under the states grants bill earlier this year. This includes programs for literacy, numeracy, online curriculum, science, maths, technology, enterprise career education and the Jobs Pathway program. Eighty-seven per cent of these increases will go to public schools. Public schools by the end of this year will have received increases of 42 per cent in direct funding under this government. This year, public schools in New South Wales will receive from the federal government an extra 5.3 per cent increase in direct funding, yet the New South Wales government, which has prime responsibility for state schools, is only going to increase funding for its state schools by a paltry, miserable 2.3 per cent. The federal government is doing far more for public schools in New South Wales and, indeed, across the country than the state governments are doing, and certainly more than the Carr-Aquilina government is doing. Over the last four years in New South Wales the state government’s funding for public schools has fallen from 26 per cent of its budget to under 23 per cent. It is failing its public school students miserably. Monday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27837 This federal government is trying to pick up the pieces while the state government is letting the team down. Increased money for vocational education and training means a record $7.6 billion over the next four years. There is an extra $230 million for ANTA and extra funding for apprenticeships totalling up to $2 billion over the next four years. When Labor left office apprenticeships in this country were at a 30-year low. This government has worked hard to rebuild apprenticeships and traineeships in this country, reaching a record level this year. This budget delivers. It delivers responsible management. It continues to reward and assist those people who want to try to stand on their own two feet, and it delivers assistance and affordable funding to areas of need. (Time expired). to place on the record some of my thoughts on this 2000-01 budget. Unfortunately, like those opposite, our time has been limited to 10 minutes. I think there are 33 speakers on my side yet to speak on this budget, and it is rather difficult to examine the impact of such a budget in such a brief time frame. Given the propagandising of those opposite, the Howard government would have you believe that they govern for all Australians, whether they live in the sprawling conurbations of our five cities or in the large rural centres or in the small towns, ever decreasing in population, that dot our states and territories. Each of us in this place represents a unique slice of Australian life. Many electorates in the cities I guess could be overlayed and there would be little difference between any of them. But my electorate is unique in Tasmanian terms. It is different from the four other seats in that it has a real mix of inner capital city, broadacre public housing tracts in the city outskirts, a series of large middle-class dormitory suburbs and a number of quite small rural towns stretching out to the southern most extremities of this nation. The Howard government selectively chose to seduce sections of the Australian community with a real grab bag of budget delicacies principally to try to woo disenchanted voters back to the fold in the lead-up to the next federal election some time later this year. The Treasurer’s incessant diatribe in the House, matched frequently by the Prime Minister, would have you believe that the changes to the tax system have resulted in untold benefits to everyone in Australia, irrespective of where they might live. This government has obviously decided to target various sectors in the community and in this budget I think it has failed miserably to achieve that. It has failed in that expectations were raised and then dashed because the fine print was not explained to the population. Independent retirees and the so-called benefits that were supposedly to flow to them are one example of this explanation that was not made. How many electorate offices throughout this country received phone calls, letters and emails from frustrated and annoyed independent retirees who failed to understand why this Liberal government was excluding them from the pre-poll bag of goodies? When questioned about the gaps in the budget promises, the standard line was, ‘Well, you can’t expect to have everyone receive the benefit. It really was meant only for those of real pension age.’ The use of ‘pensioner’ rather than ‘aged pensioner’ in budget discussions and post-budget media saw a build-up in expectation that was ultimately dashed for so many in our electorates across Australia. I, like all of us, have taken calls from those on disability pensions and those receiving a carers pension who initially embraced the thought of receiving the $300 bonus payment. But there were the cynics and sceptics who vividly remembered the promise of the $1,000 payment and who were bitterly disappointed when they did not receive anything like that sum.",169,Representatives Main Committee
309,Mr Quick (Franklin) (9.15 P.m.),"I, like all those on this side, welcome the opportunity27838 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 The budget health money to encourage nurses and GPs into our rural towns is a part of the budget that I do applaud. But I can assure you that my country towns, after five years under this government, still desperately wait for the medical and dental services enjoyed by those in the large cities in this country. Bulk-billing doctors are now a dying breed and once again this health minister has not offered realistic remuneration for those GPs who toil in their suburban and rural practices. It is little wonder that we are seeing the insidious corporatisation of our medical practices and a decline in the standard of medical services. Veterans taken prisoner by the Japanese were finally recognised by the Australian parliament for the horrendous experiences they endured, and I will place on the public record the embarrassment that I faced when our government did little for these POWs. I congratulate the government for this payment but I wonder why they did not recompense in some way all the other POWs, for instance those incarcerated in Europe as a result of bombing raids or those captured in the Crete and Greek campaigns. There are 54 such survivors in Tasmania-men in their midto late-80s who endured inhumane conditions for 3½ years in Germany. There are probably just as many war widows of their mates. Jack Sheppard, 88, and Jack Doddridge, 83, spent 3½ years as prisoners of the Germans and received no POW bonus. I spoke to them both at the recent 60th anniversary of the battle of Crete on 26 May, budget week. Like true Aussie diggers who have been tested in all conditions, they accepted this government’s indifference to their hardship and suffering. They figure that their reply would be best served by voting against this focus group, poll driven government later this year. What really irked and annoyed so many in my electorate were the words of the Prime Minister that he would govern for all Australians. The constant cry from those opposite is of our 13-year term in office and the debt we left them. Supposedly they are the keepers of the sacred financial urn and profligacy is unknown to them. What hypocrisy! I do not get to watch all that much TV, Madam Deputy Speaker, but I can assure you that when I do during some moments of brief respite from this seven-day-a-week, God-knows-how-many-hours-aday job, the paid commercials of this government defy belief. Tens of millions of dollars are being wasted informing people of benefits they already enjoy-wasted money that could be channelled into more early intervention, family oriented schemes to name one thing that I really want to see funded by this and all other governments. I do not have the time and probably do not have the patience to get angry and upset over this government’s pathetic resolve to address the aged care issue. This is an issue that is facing an aging population in my electorate, as Tasmania has the largest proportion of ageing people anywhere in Australia. I will leave this issue to another place when time constraints are not so restrictive. As a former teacher in the state system for over 20 years, education and the impact on it by this budget really worry me. I do applaud Labor’s stated resolve to remove funding from the category 1 schools and to redirect it across the needy government sector to halt the decline in what was once a shining jewel in our education system. I do not dislike men on the opposite side of politics, but I can assure the House that I cannot abide the attitude and the focus of the minister, David Kemp. I look forward to the day when education will resume its pre-eminence in this place under a Beazley led government. This is the sixth Howard budget and hopefully its last. I look forward to sitting on the other side of the House later this year and watching as Simon Crean unveils a budget that ensures that all Australians benefit and that does not, as this budget does, attempt to seduce narrow sectional groups in key marginal seats whilst so many Australian families wonder what they did to be so excluded by this mean, somewhat sneaky and I believe, honestly, out of touch Howard government. Monday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27839 have seen for 30 years. It is responsible and pro-growth while delivering tangible benefits to all Australians and in particular to small business, pensioners and self-funded retirees. Older Australians, for example, will feel the benefit of the $300 payment we have promised to those on age pensions and to self-funded retirees of age pension age. In fact, that has already been delivered, with the money being paid direct to their bank accounts on pension day. The flowon effect of that on the economy will be immediate. As well as this we have the increase in the effective tax-free threshold for people of age pension age to $20,000 for singles and $32,000 for couples, and not only that it is backdated to the beginning of the present financial year, which will mean another windfall at the time of their next income tax return. This will mean a saving of up to $4,000 for couples each year from now on. The increase in the income thresholds for the Commonwealth seniors health care card, along with the extension of the telephone allowance and other concessions, will also be of tremendous assistance to many older Australians. This will mean over 3,000 more people in my electorate of Barker will be eligible for the seniors health care card. Small business benefit too. They will feel the immediate benefit of the full input tax credits for motor vehicles, which took effect from midnight on budget night. This move will slash business costs by over $600 million and boost motor vehicle sales. For example, on a vehicle for business purposes costing $35,000 last month, that would have meant a saving of $3,200. That is on top of the saving of $3,500 when we reduced the wholesale sales tax. We got rid of the 22 per cent wholesale sales tax and replaced it with a 10 per cent GST. On a truck rigwhich is very important in my electorate, because I think I could argue that in Mount Gambier we have more trucks per head of population than anywhere else in Australia-that would have cost $330,000 last month, the tax saving would amount to $30,000. This will be important for the whole motor industry in the electorate and particularly to the transport hub of the south-east. Of course, with our ongoing measures as part of the new tax system, truckies are effectively now paying only about 70c a litre for their diesel and, of course, their batteries are cheaper, their spare parts are cheaper and their tyres are cheaper because we have removed Labor’s 22 per cent wholesale sales tax. As well as this, the company tax rate, as we promised, will further drop from 34 to 30 per cent and both businesses and individuals will benefit from our promised scrapping of financial institutions duty. Rural and regional Australia will benefit from a $593 million boostthat is nearly $600 million-to strengthen the quarantine protection against diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease and other exotic pests and diseases that could otherwise threaten our livestock and agricultural industries and our clean green image. Other initiatives of importance to rural and regional Australia include a $147 million boost for telecommunications and Internet services, $104 million for rural doctors to employ practice nurses, over 1,800 more places in regional universities, $850 million extra for roads in rural and regional Australia-and I will get to how they affect my electorate a little bit laterand 100 rural nursing scholarships of $10,000 per annum. That is a very important measure. We have heard a lot about the shortage of doctors in rural areas, but I know many of those people who represent country areas also realise the problems with the shortage of nurses and the need to encourage nurses to come back to country areas and to practise in and provide a service to our local communities. The previous speaker mentioned the prisoners of war, and I thank him for his comments there. I think it is one of the most decent things that any government could do. While no amount of money will ever wipe out the horror that these people suffered, all Australian Defence Force prisoners of war of the Japanese, civilian internees and detainees of the Japanese,",171,Representatives Main Committee
310,Mr Secker (Barker) (9.24 P.m.),"This year’s Howard-Costello budget rates as the best I27840 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 or their surviving spouses-and that is a very important measure as well-are to receive a one-off payment of $25,000. Most, if not all, will have received this payment in their bank account already. I know of at least 13 surviving prisoners of war within my electorate and I feel sure that they will appreciate this assistance. These extra benefits can be delivered in this budget only because of the financial and fiscal responsibility of the Howard coalition government. We will still have an underlying cash surplus of $1.5 billion in the 2001-02 year and this will be the fifth surplus in a row delivered by this government. This is the longest run of cash surpluses in 30 years. By the end of this year, this government will have repaid around $60 million of the net debt left to us by the former Labor government in their last five years. The Labor government, in five years, increased our debt from $16 billion to $96 billion. They increased it by $80 billion. I think it is very interesting that it took us 90 years as a nation to accumulate $16 billion in net debt, and the Labor Party repeated that 90-year accumulation year after year for five years to take it up to $96 billion. As a result of the Howard government’s actions, we now have $4 billion less in interest payments. That accounts for about $11 million a day-more that we can spend on things like education, hospitals, roads and so on. It is money for jam; it is money that we get for nothing. The current account deficit is at its lowest for the decade. Inflation is expected to be just two per cent, and unemployment will remain at a low seven per cent nationally-and even less in the electorate of Barker, where many areas have less than one per cent unemployment because things are booming in my area. I feel honoured to represent such a forward looking and progressive community. This budget not only is financially responsible but also delivers some of the most generous concessions for older Australians that this country has seen. As I said, there is $300 immediately for pensioners, and the tax-free threshold for singles of pensionable age goes up to $20,000, compared with the $5,400 which was their tax-free threshold when we first came into government nearly five years ago. There are 3,000 more people in Barker, as I said, who are eligible for the health care card. There is $86.8 million allocated over four years for the restoration of war widows pensions. War widows who lost their pension as a result of remarrying before 28 May 1984 will have their pension restored. As I said, the company tax rate will further drop from 34 to 30 per cent. That is a result of what we can do with the new tax system. It was 36 per cent under Labor; we reduced it to 34 per cent last year and, as promised, we have reduced it to 30 per cent this year. The financial institutions duty has been scrapped, and there are all the other things I mentioned before. There is $5 million for restructuring rural and urban fringe aged care homes. Total aged and community care funding has increased to $5.4 billion, an increase of 77 per cent since the coalition came to government. It was $2.5 billion when we came to government, plus the extra for the care packages, and we have increased it in five years by 77 per cent. That is a huge amount in anyone’s terms. There is $17.4 million to extend rural financial counselling services. I know these services well. I have three of these counselling services in my electorate servicing the south-east and the Mallee and the Fleurieu Peninsula. They do a great job in helping farmers get over some of their financial pressures. Things are going very well agriculturally with the record lamb prices, and wool prices are the best they have been for about 10 years. Beef prices are also at record highs, and pork is doing very well-there is a great outlook for the pork industry. The wine industry, which is so important to my area of Barker, is doing very well. There is also $700 million over seven years for the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality, to be matched by the states. Priority regions will include the lower Murray in the south-east, which I have the privilege to represent. Monday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27841 The ABC is to receive $71.2 million of additional funding over four years, which is what it asked for, I might add. Thankfully, most of that will be spent in rural areas, where it is most needed. There is the abolition of the small boat and light plane radio licence fee. Government schools will get an estimated $238 million, or 87 per cent, of the funding for specific school initiatives in this year’s budget. As we heard in question time today, the Education Union have been spreading lies about funding from the government. In real terms, we have increased funding for education by 17 per cent over the five years since we came into government. That is 17 per cent more than the previous Labor government spent. In real terms, it is actually 26 per cent. In actual terms, taking inflation into account, we have increased education funding by 17 per cent. There is an extra $1 billion over five years to extend the Natural Heritage Trust. That takes us to spending of $3 billion on the Natural Heritage Trust in about 10 years. This is the greatest environmental program that any government has ever delivered for this country, and I see the benefits all over my electorate. Many areas have benefited from that funding in very important environmental actions. There is $275 million in 2001-02 as part of those Natural Heritage Trust projects. There is $83.8 million for Bushcare, $69.7 million for the National Landcare Program, $35 million for the Murray-Darling 2001 program and $24.4 million for Coasts and Clean Seas. All this is money that was certainly not spent under the previous government, and it is on top of the national salinity plan, where we hope to spend $1.4 billion over seven years. We are actually talking about close to $5 billion in spending on the environment since we have been in government, including what we are promising for the future. There is $212.5 million to maintain the Bureau of Meteorology world-class weather forecasting operations and services. That is very important to the farmers in my area. There is no doubt we will have a far more reliable service, and it is important that we keep up with the latest technology. There is $60 million for volunteer activities in the next three years. I am pleased to be wearing the volunteers badge as part of the International Year of Volunteers. I think volunteers are some of the most important people in this country because of what they do for us at no cost. They get pleasure out of it as well. There is $572 million for the South Australian public hospital system through the Australian Health Care Agreement, and there is $82 million for community sport over four years. There is of course $103.2 million allocated to South Australia for federally funded road projects in the year 2001-02, which is an increase of 18 per cent over last year’s figures. The Roads to Recovery program is very important to rural areas. It is not the waste of time or the boondoggle that the Leader of the Opposition was in the media suggesting that it might be. I have long championed the high priority this government is giving to the repair and maintenance of roads in rural and regional Australia. In my electorate of Barker, all council areas will benefit from increased funding, and I would like to detail what each council will receive. In fact, they are receiving about 118 per cent above what they were already receiving. The figures that I give are actual increases on what they were already getting. The Alexandrina Council, for example, will be receiving $308,000 next year and $1.234 million over the four-year program. The Coorong District Council will be receiving $440,000 extra and $1.762 million over four years. The Grant District Council will be receiving $227,000 next year and $909,000 over four years. The Kangaroo Island District Council will be receiving $248,000 over the next year and $991,000 over four years. The Karoonda East Murray District Council will be receiving $205,000 next year$819,000 over four years. The Lacepede District Council-which is now as of a few weeks ago called the Kingston District Council-will receive $160,000 next year, and that is $642,000 over four years. The Mid Murray District Council will be receiving $426,000 next year-$1.706 million over four years. The Mount Gambier City Council will be receiving $235,000 extra next year-$939,000 over the next four years. The Murray Bridge Rural City 27842 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 next year-$939,000 over the next four years. The Murray Bridge Rural City will be receiving $259,000 next year-$1.036 million over four years. The Naracoorte-Lucindale Council will be receiving $346,000 next year$1.386 million over four years. The Robe District Council will be receiving $74,000. This is a smaller council, and yet they will be receiving nearly $300,000 extra over the next four years. The Southern Mallee District Council will be receiving $252,000 next year-$1.007 million over four years. The Tatiara District Council-the one I actually reside in-will be receiving $365,000 next year-$1.460 million over the next four years. The City of Victor Harbor Council will be receiving $130,000 next year-$521,000 over four years. The Wattle Range Council will be receiving $375,000 extra next year-$1½ million extra over four years. The Yankalilla District Council-another smaller council-will be receiving $88,000 next year-$350,000 over four years. There is unallocated funding in South Australia which amounts to $3.75 million extra next year and $15 million over four years. You can see how effectively and how much money is being spent on maintaining and building new roads in the electorate that I have the privilege to represent. That is as a result of decisions by this government. Aged care has also done very well. There is an extra $203,900 that has been allocated to improve aged care and carer support services for Victor Harbor, Yankalilla and Goolwa, Kangaroo Island, Murray Bridge, Coorong and Mallee regions. Local projects that are receiving increased funding include $65,000 to the South Coast Carer Support Project, which will establish a structure where carers can achieve access to support by linking carers with other carers and improve access to information and advocacy. There is $17, 500 for the purchase and operating costs associated with a second vehicle to meet increasing demand for transport services to medical and other local services in the Yankalilla District Council. There is $60,000 for the Moving Further in the Right Direction project. There is $22,000 extra for the Country Dementia/Railway Cottage Program in Yankalilla. There is $24,400 for ‘Break Away’ camps and $15,000 to increase the hours of the Goolwa Heritage Club. There is $35,000 for the day care and home help program there. There is $95,500 for the Southern Fleurieu Health Service to extend the Aboriginal Aged Care Program, $60,000 for the Hills Mallee Southern Regional Health Service, $46,000 to the Carers Association of South Australia, $29,000 for the Coorong District Council for its Community Links Program, $10,000 for the Mid Murray Community Support Service, and $4,500 for the Southern Mallee District Council. HACC services allow frail aged people and young people with disabilities to remain in their own homes with the support of their family for as long as they wish. We have 45 extra places in outside school hours care and a lot of really good things for the electorate of Barker. (Time expired) Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (9.44 p.m.)-The 2001-02 budget must go down as one of the more unique budgets produced by a federal government. Not only does it blatantly attempt to buy the votes of a section of the community in a botched attempt which has already failed miserably but, worse still, the budget is a document that will be judged harshly for what it fails to do. On budget night, the Treasurer announced with great glee that this budget was in surplus to the tune of $1.5 billion. This is despite the fact that the budget surplus has been downgraded almost as many times as the government has done backflips. In fact, the budget surplus for this financial year is a far cry from the $14.5 billion surplus predicted by the government for the financial year in the 1998-99 budget. In addition to the disappearing surplus, this budget proves the following things. The much trumpeted personal income tax cuts have been grabbed back. The GST has had a disastrous Monday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27843 impact upon our employment outlook. Since the introduction of the GST, there has been a rise in the unemployment rate of 0.8 per cent-an increase of 84,300 unemployed. In addition, the budget has confirmed that Australians are now being forced to live beyond their means because of the GST and we have seen soaring levels of household and credit card debt. I turn to some of the specifics in the budget: firstly, the $300 one-off bonus payment. This budget measure is perhaps the most transparent of all the election bribes. It applies only to people receiving income support who are above the age pension level. The government estimates 2.2 million people will get the bonus. There are so many ironies associated with these paltry $300 bribes that it is hard to know where to start. Firstly, why will the government not pay the $1,000 the Prime Minister promised all Australians over 60? The budget could have afforded it and it would have gone some way to mending the damage done to pensioners since the introduction of the GST. Members will remember that around 40 per cent of people aged over 60 years of age did not receive any of the age savings bonus. Worse still, many older people had to suffer the humiliation of receiving a cheque for just $1. Secondly, a total of 83,750 Australians aged over 55 will miss out on the $300 altogether. This group includes the following people aged between 55 and pension age: disability support pensioners, receivers of mature aged allowance and Newstart allowance, care payment recipients and wife pensioners. In addition, hundreds of thousands of people on low incomes aged under 55 who struggle to make ends meet as a result of the GST will also receive no compensation. Immediately after the budget, my office was inundated by calls from angry people surviving on pensions who did not receive the $300. I had one woman tell me that she felt as though people on disability pensions do not exist in the mind of this government. Disability pensioners have been shifted off the unemployment ranks to improve the government’s official unemployment rate, yet they receive no comfort. More often than not they are parents trying to manage their disability and raise a family. It was therefore a great shock to them that they were overlooked for this bonus. They, too, have bills to meet. It is impossible for them to draw any conclusion other than that this government does not see them as a block of votes it can buy. The Treasurer described the $300 bonus as a payment which the budget can afford and which our older Australians deserve. Is the Treasurer saying that other pensioners do not deserve it? One of the most poignant stories I heard was from one of the carers in my electorate, Andrew Chryssafis, of Burwood, who cares full time for his frail elderly mother. He quit work 12 months ago to become her full-time carer. He is outraged that this government is discriminating against people in his position. He believes the government has totally misled pensioners. He firmly believed that the Treasurer’s announcement meant that all pensioners would receive the $300 bonus. He even rang Centrelink the day after the budget announcement and they advised him that he would get the $300 as he was on a full pension. Through the government’s advertising, Andrew has learnt that he is not getting this payment. Maybe the government is informing people-informing those who will not automatically get the payment. Andrew is dismayed by the discriminatory nature of the payment, by the government’s misleading information and the lack of recognition that all pensioners, not just the aged, are being hurt by the GST. My final comment on this one-off bribe is that it failed to do what it set out to do. Older people were not fooled. They see what the government has been trying to do. They see the bonus for the tawdry political trick that it is, and the government is foolish to believe that it has received any turnaround in support by including this cynical measure in the budget. 27844 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 The other group in the age bracket targeted by this government is that of self-funded retirees. The budget includes the extension of the Commonwealth seniors health card and the telephone allowance to some self-funded retirees. While these extensions are welcome, up to 120,000 self-funded retirees will miss out and those self-funded retirees aged over 55 up to pension age get nothing from the budget-no additional tax break, no concession cards and no telephone allowance. This group accounts for one in four self-funded retirees. The centrepiece of the government’s attempt to buy self-funded retirees has been the increase in the effective tax-free threshold for pensions and self-funded retirees of age pension age. However, it appears that only one in four self-funded retirees will actually benefit. So why do so few self-funded retirees benefit? It is a result of the age restriction income test. Most self-funded retirees will not receive any additional benefit from the budget line measure. Self-funded retirees under age pension age are automatically ineligible for the low income aged persons rebate and Medicare levy threshold increase. Therefore they get no benefit from this measure. Retirees over age pension age either receive no additional benefit because their income is too low, or receive no additional benefit because their income is too high. Consequently, there are many very unhappy self-funded retirees who feel they have been misled by the fine print of the government’s announcement. As I said in my opening remarks, the budget should also be condemned for what it fails to provide. Two of the most notable areas of neglect are the delay in implementation of the government’s new job program that does not actually start until September 2002, and the lack of spending on public education, TAFE and VET programs to equip our country with the skills we need to move forward. I would like to discuss tonight the government’s complete inability to tackle the aged care crisis. I cannot understand how the federal government could have framed a budget that was supposed to be full of goodies for older people yet neglected something as fundamental as aged care. This budget produced a $71 million cut from the aged care subsidies, which comes on top of a $90 million cut in 1999. The only additional money announced was $13.8 million for standards monitoring and complaints resolution, which is an ineffective attempt to tackle the symptoms of declining care standards, and a $2 million aged care communication, or spin doctoring, strategy. Yet there was not one single extra bed in this budget and this is despite the fact that as at 30 June 2000 there was a national shortage of 10,500 aged care beds. The most critical shortage of beds is in my home state of Victoria, where we currently have a shortage of in excess of 5,000 beds. As a result, waiting times for aged care in Victoria continue to grow. In 1997-98 just five per cent of Victorians assessed as needing nursing home care had to wait more than three months to find a bed; by 2000 that had blown out to 20 per cent. It is intolerable that one in five Victorians needing nursing home care are forced to wait more than three months for a bed. This puts immense pressures on families and on the Victorian public hospital system. In my electorate of Chisholm there is a brand-new facility in Ashwood where 60 beds lie idle while older people wait in hospitals desperate for a nursing home bed. The Cabrini nursing home has fallen victim to the government’s tardiness in providing the bed licences the facility needs to start caring for residents. The minister dodges the issue by counting in her bed figures aged care beds which have been allocated but are not built or operating. These are the phantom beds. They exist only in the imagination of Minister Bishop. Just to further illustrate the point, in the 1999 round Minister Bishop allocated 140 beds to an aged care provider in the Mornington Peninsula. Two years down the track the provider has yet to commence building this facility, so for two years there are 140 beds sitting idle, yet I have 60 brand-new beds in Cabrini without licences waiting for people. What sort of crazy system do we have Monday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27845 where 140 bed licences are handed out for beds not even built whilst we have 60 brand-new beds at Cabrini that lie empty? Not only has the government failed to provide any extra bed in this budget, hence putting pressure on the public health system, it has failed to provide any funds for public hospitals. All members in this chamber will be aware that our public hospitals are suffering under enormous strain. I do note that the budget includes a pale imitation of Labor’s medical after-hours policy. The government has also come to its senses and done a backflip on its earlier decision to include higher prices for essential items like syringes and glucose tests for diabetics. Unfortunately, people suffering from high cholesterol have no such reprieve and will have to endure high costs for cholesterol-reducing medicines. Kim Beazley’s budget reply provided a stark contrast with the cynical and misplaced priorities of the government. So Labor’s responsible approach to undoing the damage caused by this uncaring government is there for all to see. We have announced over 70 policies and the voters have a genuine choice in the upcoming federal election between the substantial ALP policies and the flimsy coalition bribes on offer. election and it is time for reflection as we look at the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2001-2002 second reading. It is always interesting to compare, having spent a little time in opposition, the luxury of not having to be responsible with the good fortune of being in government and spending two terms, I think for the good of the country, making considerable progress and, of course, tidying up Labor’s pretty messy scene that was left behind. The key to Labor’s approach to gaining office and storming the Treasury benches-as they would have us believe they will at the end of the year-really lies in their view that you can almost abolish taxation. Their view is that you can attack the GST and keep it, that you can have people believe they can be dependent on government and that, after running up the debt of this country to almost $100 billion, they could run surplus budgets and maintain low interest rate policies. We are all supposed to forget those good old Labor days of 17 per cent interest rates, 11 per cent unemployment, 30 per cent youth unemployment and New Work Opportunities with $180,000 per job outcome, $100 billion debt and so on. It is very interesting to recall that, even in the tax increases of the 1993 budget that Mr John Dawkins brought down, there was not one cent of compensation for pensioners-not one cent of compensation for those lower income people who drove vehicles that required leaded fuel. They suffered not only a significant increase in excise but also double the increase of those who could afford unleaded fuel driven vehicles. We have a pretty interesting comparison. Let us have a look at Kim Beazley on the GST. On2 August last year the Leader of the Opposition claimed the GST was to blame for the interest rate rises. On8 February this year the Leader of the Opposition claimed the GST was to blame for the interest rate cuts. On3 February, just a few days before, the Leader of the Opposition decided he should claim the new tax system would overheat the economy. Then on 7 March this year the Leader of the Opposition said that a new tax system had mugged the economy and delivered a king-hit, slowing it down. We have this schizophrenic Leader of the Opposition. On the one hand, he says that the GST will not allow the sun to rise and, on the next, that it is probably shining because the GST is there. The Labor Party, of course, will keep this terrible tax if it attains the Treasury benches. Let me go back to my theme about dependency and independence. Let me go back to hidden versus transparent. The problem the Labor Party has with the GST is that it is transparent. The old system was hidden and Labor could hide behind the increases. It slithered into office in 1993 with about 1,279 votes in something like eight seats. It attained the Treasury benches",173,Representatives Main Committee
311,Mr Wakelin (Grey) (9.53 P.m.),"It is quite an interesting time as we lead up to the next27846 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 and then raised taxes. The big difference between the coalition and the Labor Party is that we will tell you, before an election, what we are going to do and then we will go and do it. We will stand up to a fair bit of pressure to do what we think is in the best interests of the nation. The Labor Party will get into office-as it did in 1993, with the barest of margins-by attacking positive progressive policies and running scare campaigns. The Labor Party will then immediately raise taxation levels, not deliver tax cuts that are promised, run up the debt, and then say, ‘Oh, isn’t it terrible that the international economy has gone bad again.’ I am going to continue to talk about dependency and independence. The Labor Party do not want to face up to how you run a decent economy. Another little sleight of hand goes back a long time, back to the days of Bill Hayden and the issue of health expenditure and Medibank, as it was known. It became Medicare. Many Australians believe to this day that the Medicare levy pays for their health costs. The Labor Party would have you believe that it does. Let us have a look at what the Australian Taxation Office collects from the Medicare levy and what the actual costs are for health expenditure. This year the Medicare levy collects $4.9 billion and actual health expenditure will be $26.8 billion. In other words, the Medicare levy pays for 15 per cent of health costs. We see these crocodile tears from our political opponents about alleged cuts and lack of resources, yet the Howard government has spent greater resources on families, health, education, aged care, child care, roads, defence and welfare et cetera, as well as giving promised tax cuts-never has more been spent than on this whole range of social infrastructure. I come back to it again: the Labor Party would have us believe that you can cut taxes, you can have bigger surpluses, you can change the GST, you can have roll-back and yet you can still deliver all these services without fundamentally changing the economy. Of course, most Australians know that that is an absolute nonsense. Another area where I think Labor would not like to see too much transparency is in the area of Aboriginal welfare. One of the tragedies in this country is that we have not been able to deal with many of these issues as well as we should have and could have. Much of it comes back, I believe, to a dependency approach. There are some within the Aboriginal community now who are challenging that approach to welfare. I will give you just one very good example. It is quite remarkable to me how the whole system, once you get into this dependency welfare approach, does not give a fair result-I do not think that most Australians would judge that it was giving a fair result. In the Pitjantjatjara lands something like 2,000 people are eligible to vote at each election. Of those 2,000 Aboriginal people, over 90 per cent have their ballot paper filled in by an AEC official. To add to that, that region has the lowest informal rate of voting in Australia. Of course, I should add very quickly that 90 per cent of those eligible votes go to the Labor Party. The question has to be asked: are those people casting a very genuine and sincere vote when 90 per cent of those ballot papers are filled in by the AEC officials and they just about all go to the Labor Party? There is a serious issue around dependency, around an honest assessment and an independent frame of mind which makes a free and democratic vote. If we were to come to a lot of other issues, we could talk about telecommunications in regional Australia. At the 1998 election it was understood that Labor was very much interested in abolishing Networking the Nation. That is what I think is called ‘reprioritisation of policy and expenditure’. When Labor came into office in 1993, there was no customer service guarantee. There was very limited access to the Internet. In much of the land mass of Australia, there was no mobile phone service. Thanks to the Networking the Nation program, very significant parts of the regional population now have access to mobile phone services and to improving-not good enough yet, but improving-Internet speeds. We have broader band techMonday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27847 nologies, much of it due to the capital available from the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund. We have that available for significantly increased infrastructure funding within regional Australia. That came from the partial sale of Telstra. It again comes back to the fundamental question: where were Labor going to find the money? I do not think they had any intention, if they had been in government, of providing the sorts of regional telecommunications services that are now available in regional Australia. It comes back to: where was the money coming from? The reality is that those services would not be there unless the coalition government had implemented policies which had allowed that to occur. We come to matters of the environment. The environment has become increasingly important over at least the last 20 years. It has been very important to many Australians since Federation, but certainly as a community movement and as a reality in community life over the last 20 years it has become important that governments become involved. We now have the Natural Heritage Trust, and we had the Landcare movement, which was initiated in the Keating years and which was a very significant step forward for the National Farmers Federation and the Australian Conservation Foundation. But now we have an environmental policy which is based on real dollars-on billions of dollars worth of investment-to help improve the environment and to help to redress past serious degradation. Of course, we also have the issues to do with the Democrats, the Senate and all that which goes with our Australian Federation. Whilst mentioning the Democrats, it is probably worth acknowledging that they have to give themselves a badge, they have to find a place in the sun, they have to attract the voters to justify their place in the Senate, so they have to signify that they are different. But, as we all know, what the Democrats never have to do is actually govern. So we have a situation where people who have the luxury in this country of having less than 10 per cent of the voteprobably six or eight per cent of the vote-in many ways have far beyond that sort of proportion of influence on the outcomes within this federal parliament. I would say to the Democrats: it is time for you to come down from the Senate and-as Janine Haines did some years ago and as Senator Natasha Stott Despoja could very much do-offer yourselves to try to form some kind of useful, strong group in the lower house. It is very important that those sorts of decisions are made by the Democrats, and then I think many more Australians would take them much more seriously. It is just not good enough to sit in the Senate and luxuriate in the fact that you have all the fun but none of the responsibility. In terms of my theme of dependency and transparency versus hidden agendas and lack of transparency, regional people are very independent people. In my own electorate, there is very much an emphasis on export income. A lot of that transparency is made available to us by the fact that we are exporters-the world market simply keeps us honest. Of course, the seasons do that pretty well, too. I am pleased to report some pretty good rains in most of the region at this time. Harsh seasons, good seasons, world markets and variable commodity prices keep us all pretty honest and make the whole thing very transparent, but the trouble with the Australian economy and the nature of our parliament is that we still do not have sufficient respect across the board for that reality. It is so important that we acknowledge that the independence that these people from regional Australia thrive on, that they value, is in conflict with too much dependence on welfare and a taxation system, particularly the excise system very much loved by Labor, that has damaged our economy over the last 20 years. In concluding, I simply say that the media has an essential role in a democratic society. The time has come for all parties, all members and senators, to ask: is the media now too much a participant-it is a question that I suppose many of us ask ourselves-and not a simple reporter of events, and do we react to the media in a way which is not giving the best govern27848 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 ment to this country? We have two very dominant media owners, and we have a situation where the editors in this country are very superficial and do not commit to long-term analysis of issues, political issues particularly, in a way which is in the best long-term national interest. We, as a parliament, are going to need to be much more mature than we have been in dealing with this media phenomenon. I am told that, about 100 years ago, which of course was Federation, we had many people from the media in the parliament, even though the lower House had only half the number of members we have now. At the moment, we might have one or perhaps two amongst our ranks who could genuinely say they are from the media. That simply says to me that many of those people feel that they can probably help run the country more effectively from outside the parliament than from within. We really need to be a lot stronger if we are to be respected by our communities in taking the media on and not allowing ourselves to be manipulated quite as much as we have been in the past. spend, so little to show for it. That is how the 2001 budget ought to be summed up: no national purpose, no vision, no analysis, confused outcomes, no long-term investment, merely an incoherent synthesis of unconnected issues based only on reconnecting with a lost constituency. But, importantly, no connection with children or youth, no connection with families, no connection with working Australians, no connection with the unemployed or the underemployed, and no connection with people disabled or disadvantaged in any way. As I stated at the outset, the budget was a case of so much money and so little to show for it, and debate has been halved. With this government, that would be case, wouldn’t it-to halve the scrutiny of the budget and the time to scrutinise it here in this and in the other chamber? This budget has pillaged the coffers and dealt out the spoils in a shameless attempt to buy votes at the upcoming poll. There is not the slightest hint that the national interest was even a consideration in its formulation or that its market eyes were even cast past the electoral hurdle five months hence. Where is the money for the great and vital national building projects on which responsible governments focus? Where is the sense of national destiny which federal government budgets have the potential to portray? Where is the vision to secure our future in this region and the world? Sadly, very little can be remotely so categorised in this budget. Infrastructure needs are abandoned, public health will remain damaged and public education continues to be set up for failure. Public schools even failed to get one mention in the budget speech. Those people in my electorate seeking assistance for aged care and nursing home accommodation have been offered nothing. Still others, seeking to re-enter or enter the work force, are offered nothing but an increase-a promise of increased unemployment. And what did the Prime Minister say to those with high cholesterol and those who were suffering the debilitating and life restricting ailment of diabetes? He told them to improve their diet instead of relying on medication. Then he predicably backflipped on his plan to hit diabetics with higher charges, but only in the face of community protest-just what he did with petrol and what he did with beer. One of the most important responsibilities of every government is to progressively build the various sectors of this nation and to grow the nation, but what did this government do? In education, it rewarded the already privileged, it divided the education community and it made obvious its attack on public education. Stratifying and dividing education is a poor indicator of a strong democracy. In 1996-97 educational expenditure was 2.06 per cent of GDP, the only measurement that you can actually evaluate where expenditure in an area is going. In 2001-02 it will be 1.6 per cent-that is a 20 per cent cut. In health it reaffirmed its two-tiered",179,Representatives Main Committee
312,Mr Sawford (Port Adelaide) (10.13 P.m.),"The 2001 budget-so much money toMonday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27849 approach. Welfare beneficiaries again were operated upon by as much a policy of exclusion as anything. In transport, the litany of inactivity continued. A major factor retarding economic growth is the growth of transport infrastructure resulting in the inefficient and costly movement of goods-but we do get a freeway through the seat of Aston, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would be well aware. A responsible budget for this nation ought to be about nation building. One of the most important elements of that is the revival of the rail freight system, but what did the government do? It encouraged the further build-up of traffic on our roads by giving $600 million of taxpayers’ money to business to buy motor vehicles. That is, a large trucking rig will now be $30,000 cheaper, thanks to a cheque from the federal government. This $600 million is on top of the cost of abolition of the indexing of the petrol excise and the ongoing 27c per litre diesel fuel rebate. Since 1996, the federal government has spent $8 billion on roads and a mere $250 million on rail-most of that, fortunately, on the Alice to Darwin rail project, a project I support wholeheartedly. This year, just $26 million has been allocated for the development of our rail system, and that is an absolute disgrace. I have argued many times in this chamber for a relative increase in government expenditure on rail transport, and I was pleased to see the excellent article by Kenneth Davidson in the Age on the same subject. He points out that there are a number of rail projects that for a modest investment of $500 million could shift two million tonnes of freight a year from road to rail and deliver benefits more than three times greater than the investment made. Where did the information come from? It came from none other than a study done for the transport minister, the National Party Leader and Deputy Prime Minister, by the Australian Rail Track Corporation. To repeat the question posed in the article: where was the minister when cabinet cut sales tax on company cars and rigs by nine per cent? The ARTC report provided the government with the evidence that is needed to spend on rail reconstruction instead a good portion of the $600 million it handed to business with the sales tax cut. It is about time that a comprehensive study of the real cost to the economy of the lopsided history of public expenditure on transport in this country was undertaken. That study should take into account all the costs of road transport-the $10 billion plus subsidy that is given to road transport-including road trauma, road congestion, vehicle accidents, hospitalisation and the degradation of the urban environment, let alone the costs of insurance, freight and so on. That money is now headed into the pockets of the owners of interstate trucking companies and continues a familiar pattern under this government-the shifting of money and resources from public institutions to private pockets. This government has blown a $12 billion surplus in one year. That is what the government has done. That is all the evidence you need to convict the government of economic opportunism and vandalism. Its record as the highest taxing government in this nation’s history is its legacy. It also has on its report card record high foreign debt, record high household debt and record high credit card debt. It is also the biggest spending government in this nation’s history, although that in itself is not a bad thing-my concern is just where that public money has gone. The introduction of the GST saw the Australian people paying more tax than they have ever paid before. The government is just awash with money-so much to spend and so little to show for it. You would think that the government might direct some extra help to those sectors of the economy and to those in the community where help is desperately needed. For example, one group in need are the carers-a group that not many people in this parliament speak about-who dedicate years of their lives to the care in their own homes of aged and 27850 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 18 June 2001 disabled relatives. I recently put on record in this parliament the case of Slawka Gawlik who lives in my electorate in the suburb of Largs Bay. In a letter to me, she described the difficulties she faced caring for her aged mother at home and expressed her exasperation upon finding that the government’s aged care package failed her when she needed it most. Of course, there is nothing in this budget for Slawka and the thousands of others in a similar situation. I also raised in this chamber a couple of months ago the situation facing another constituent of mine, Mr Robert Burzynski of Ottoway, and the despair he felt in trying to find nursing home accommodation for his ailing father. Robert had placed his father on waiting lists at 26 nursing homes, one telling him that they already had 200 on the waiting list. Another constituent from Seaton came to see me earlier in the year. He has had to move 60 kilometres to Hamley Bridge, a country town, in order to be near his father who needed nursing home accommodation-the only vacancy after 15 months of trying. The minister’s own department admits that there is a massive shortage of 10,500 aged care beds across the country and predicts this will grow in 2002. Amazingly, not one extra aged care bed has been provided for. Further, $71 million has been cut from care subsidies. This is coming on top of the $90 million cut in 1999. As Jean Rosewell of the Aged Care and Housing Group said: The Federal Government must realise the situation is at a desperate stage. This budget is also a huge disappointment for Australian families. There is nothing in there to ease the burden that this high taxing government has placed on the family budget. It fails completely to connect with young people. Unemployment is back on the rise, underemployment is on the rise and the number of people outside of the labour market is on the rise. There is next to nothing in this budget to assist young people into meaningful training and work. The lack of jobs is a serious blight on our society. People in the government may rave on about Work for the Dole, but its success rate is appalling-one in six. This government refuses to acknowledge that we have a serious and endemic unemployment problem. Thomas Carlyle, a much wiser person than any of us here, once said that work is the grand cure of all the maladies and miseries that ever beset mankind. He is not far from the mark. Depression is now the second major disease to heart disease-it has overtaken cancer-in Australia. It is the second biggest disease in our nation. It is a shame for all of us. For job seekers, especially those who have lost their jobs, often through no fault of their own, this budget offers nothing. I talked in the chamber at length last year about the special problems and special needs of the middle aged unemployed on the back of a report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations on the issue. That report made various recommendations to the government to tackle the problem, but the lack of action in the budget indicates that the government has decided to ignore the problem. ‘Mean, tricky and out of touch’ was the quote attributed to the President of the Liberal Party as the way he described this government. This budget is a vindication of his perspicacity: so much to spend and so little to show for it. Too many modern corporations too often look for quick upsurges in quarterly earnings at the expense of long-term investment. It is not a great strategy and it predetermines one certainty-and that is failure. I remind the government of the past failures of the Pyramid Building Society, the state banks and the financial institutions of the mid-1980s. I remind the government of the current failures of HIH, One.Tel, Impulse, Franklins and so the list goes on, because that is what happens when you undercapitalise, you offer discount prices on goods and services and when the economy just takes a bit of a dive. Monday, 18 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27851 That is what will happen to this government that has failed to capitalise-it has undercapitalised education, it has undercapitalised health, it has undercapitalised transport and it has undercapitalised infrastructure. It offers discount prices on petrol, beer, company cars, transport rigs, some self-funded retirees but not others, some pensioners but not others, some POWs but not others and, of course, that lists goes on when the economy takes but a little dive as it is at the moment. So much was needed from this government in this budget-an investment in the long term, an affirmation of national purpose, national vision, of including people not separating people, not dividing people. Basically, when you analyse all the papers, so little was given except a miserly, openly transparent bribe to a lost constituency. But this government could not even get that right. Main Committee adjourned at 10.29 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: Higher Education Contribution Scheme: Tax Treatment (Question No. 1657) Ms Jann McFarlane asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 21 June 2000: (1) Do wage and salary earners with HECS debts who have elected to pay through the tax system have a component of this debt taken out each pay period which is paid to the Australian Tax Office (ATO) as extra income tax. (2) Does the ATO hold this contribution in the employers group tax account and during August each year, does it transfer the monies across to the HECS account in a single yearly transaction. (3) Does the ATO apply an indexation to the HECS debt at 1 June each year. (4) Does the indexation occur before the monies collected through the tax system in a financial year are deducted from the debt; if so, is interest charged on the sum already paid back through the tax system but not deducted from the debt. (5) Does the level of inflation determine the indexation rate. (6) Has Treasury undertaken modelling to examine the effect of inflationary pressures caused by the implementation of the GST on the cost of a range of student HECS repayments; if not, why not. (7) If so, what would (a) be the increase in the HECS indexation rate for each percentage increase in inflation and (b) this translate to in real cost per annum to the person repaying the HECS loan in the income brackets (i) below $22 346, (ii) $22 346 to $23 565, (iii) $23 566 to $25 393, (iv) $25 394 to $29 456, (v) $29 457 to $35 551, (vi) $35 552 to $37 420, (vii) $37 421 to $40 223 and (viii) $40 224 and above. able member’s question: (1) Salary and wage earners with a HECS debt, whose annual income exceeds the HECS repayment threshold, must have additional amounts withheld from their payments under the Pay As You Go withholding system. This system works in much the same way as the supplementary instalment deductions for HECS under the Pay As You Earn system until 30 June 2000. (2) and (3) Yes. These arrangements were introduced by the previous Government on 1 July 1994. (4) Additional amounts withheld for HECS during the year are not taken into account when indexation is calculated. They are credited to the taxpayer’s HECS account when their income tax return is processed. These arrangements were introduced by the previous Government on 1 July 1994. (5) Yes. (6) and (7) The introduction of the New Tax System was accompanied by a range of measures designed to compensate for the impact of the goods and services tax, including tax cuts worth $12 billion per annum. Aviation: Air Operators Certificates (Question No. 2454) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 26 March 2001: (1) For each of the past 5 years, how many Air Operators Certificates have been issued to foreign air carriers to permit them to operate into and out of Australia, and of these how many have been reissued. (2) How many approvals have been issued to foreign registered aircraft operating commercially within Australia, and of these how many are international freight operators. (3) For each of the past 5 years, how many foreign registered cargo carriers have been based at (a) Sydney, (b) Brisbane, (c) Melbourne, (d) Adelaide, (e) Perth, (f) Hobart, (g) Darwin and (h) Avalon Airports and in which countries are those aircraft registered.",182,Representatives Main Committee

(6) Can Australian companies own or operate foreign registered aircraft. (7) Are Australian companies owning, leasing or operating foreign registered aircraft subject to regulation by CASA. (8) Are Australian owned companies owning, leasing or operating foreign registered aircraft subject to Australian industrial and occupational health and safety laws; if not, why not. (1) As at 10 April 2001, CASA records reveal that there are 68 operators who have foreign aircraft Air Operators Certificates (AOCs). 1996 – 6 initial issue AOCs, of which 4 have been re-issued and are current. 1997 – 7 initial issue AOCs, of which 4 have been re-issued and are current. 1998 – 6 initial issue AOCs, of which 2 have been re-issued and are current. 1999 – 6 initial issue AOCs, of which 4 have been re-issued and are current. 2000 – 6 initial issue AOCs, of which all are current. (2) CASA advise that 80 approvals have been issued to foreign registered aircraft operating commercially within Australia, of which 5 are international freight operators. (3) CASA records reveal the following operators have been based in Australia in the following areas for the past five year period – Brisbane– Pacific Air Express, operating a Solomon Islands registered aircraft, Brisbane– Air Sophia, operating a Bulgarian registered aircraft; and Darwin– Safair, operating a South African registered aircraft.

(8) Like all Australian registered companies operating in Australia, Australian airlines are subject to applicable Australian industrial and occupational health and safety legislation. Goods and Services Tax: Surgical Shoes and Orthopaedic Footwear (Question No. 2494) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 2 April 2000: (1) Are surgical shoes and orthopaedic footwear subject to GST. (2) Has the Australian Taxation Office made a ruling that GST must be applied to surgical and orthopaedic footwear as they are not described as medical appliances under the GST legislation. (3) Will he change the legislation to allow surgical shoes and other orthopaedic footwear for people with disabilities to be exempt from the GST; if not, why not. (4) Do patients who purchase Australian-made surgical shoes and products presently have GST applied but patients who purchase American-made surgical shoes and orthopaedic footwear do not have to apply the GST. (5) Is applying the GST to Australian-made surgical shoes but not to American-made surgical shoes anti-competitive; if so, will he refer these anti-competitive aspects to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. able member’s question:",186,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice

315,Mr Costello,"The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honour(1) To be GST-free, medical aids and appliances must satisfy three criteria. First they must be listed in Schedule3 of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (the Act) or in the Regulations to the Act, secondly they must be specifically designed for people with an illness or disability, and finally they must not be widely used by people without an illness or disability. Item 41 in Schedule3 of the Act lists “surgical shoes, boots, braces and irons”. Surgical shoes and orthopaedic footwear are therefore GST-free where they satisfy these criteria. (2) The Australian Taxation Office has issued rulings indicating whether or not certain types of orthopedic footwear are GST-free under Schedule 3.
