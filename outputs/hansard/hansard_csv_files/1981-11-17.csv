These matters are not co-related. There is also no suggestion of a relief from taxation or a rethe Government's motion. I do so for a number of that there is a transfer of the burden, a transfer reasons. Firstly, this is an extraordinarily loose from Consolidated Revenue and the approprimeans by which the Government is seeking to apations which are made to Consolidated Revenue, propriate funds if, in fact, it maintains that this is to a limited number of persons on whom a fee is an appropriation of funds.

I use an extreme case as an illustration. It When the Government says that it increases the would be possible to bring in an Appropriation burden on the people, it increases the burden on Bill under which an amount is appropriated, as in some people, if the Minister for Education ( Mr this Bill, to cover the general appropriations Fife) applies the terms of the provisions which required for the running of the Administration. A have been deleted from the Bill. The only clause could be written into the Bill enabling the increased burden which could be involved is Treasurer or another Minister to vary those where the Minister imposes on the States an obliamounts both within the legislation and in total in gation to raise certain money as an offset to accordance with the wishes of the Treasurer or moneys which are already appropriated by this that Minister. In other words, if this is, in fact, Bill, which obligation is then deleted from the legislation which meets the criteria of the ConstiCommonwealth grants and, in fact, becomes an tution and with which the Senate is not able to additional burden on a section of the people.
