February by D r . EVATT the Government, especially its high taxation and drastic restrictions of bank credit, is causing injury to industry and production, both primary and secondary and is undermining the established national policy of full employment. At the same time, as a rcsuli of inflated prices and the Government's failure to restore the purchasing power of the Australian pound, special hardship is being inflicted on families dependent upon fixed incomes, Buch as social services and repatriation benefits, and the standard of living of wage and salary earners has fallen and is ftilling: because of its persistence in so injurious a policy the Government has lost the confidence of the country and is deserving of censure. the Navy and Mmister for A i r ) [2.31]. -As honourable members well know, the motion before the House is a motion of censure on the Government. Before1 deal withthc arguments that have been advanced by the Opposition in support of it , I want to say how very much we, on this side of the House, deplore the vicious, vitriolic and nasty attack made on the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) by the Wednesday, SO February, 1968.

1,Mr Mcmahon (Lowe,"Minister forhonorable meniber for Eden-Monaro( Mr terms of the motion if they are capable of Allan Fraser). Although this practice of character assassination is too frequently resorted to, we are fortunate to be able to say that in this House there are only two, or at most, three, members who engage in that miserable practice. While I listened to the honourable member for Eden-MonaroI well remembered that the. Prime Minister some time ago described him as a "" Uriah Keep "". As I listened to the honourable member yesterday I thought that a more effective description could not have been applied to him. The bile which poured out of this man's mouth, was engendered by personal jealousy of a man of great distinction and eminence and of great capacity and fluency. The honourable member, after having made his most unChristian attack, jumped into the pulpit and read us a sermon on the failings of the Government. ine of the story, told by Woodrow Wilson, of the parson who, in delivering a sermon on sin, said that he wanted it stopped, that he did not like it, because he did not sin. In exactly the same way, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro did not like what the Prime Minister has done simply because he was not concerned in the doing of it. I am glad to say that neither the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), nor the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell), was in the House, or stayed in the House, while the honourable member was making his speech. Let us examine this strange concoction compounded by the Leader of the Opposition. The sorcerer's apprentice never found himself in a more peculiar position. On second thoughts the right honourable gentleman must wonder what strange alchemy caused his formula to produce, not gold but dross, of banality and humbug. Upon examination, the motion reveals the strangest kind of inconsistency, illogical opinion and ill that matter. In fact, they deliberately considered criticism on the part of the Opposition. I invite honourable members opposite to examine the terms of the humbug and inconsistency on the part of motion and to take no notice of me. able members opposite to examine the them explicitly, I shall divide them thought, or if they are game to think. The Leader of the Opposition commenced by criticizing the Government because of its failure to sustain industry by its banking and credit policy. In effect, he said, "" Let us embark upon a policy of unlimited expansion of credit, a policy of inflation and depreciate the value of the f I "" . But almost in the next breath he said, in effect, "" What about the pensioners? Can we not do something to stop too much money coming into the economy and so suppress inflationary forces and save the poor pensioners ?"" The arguments of the right honourable gentleman were grossly inconsistent. He could never have imagined that his words would be turned against him as the strangest concoction of what are, after all, the simplest of economic facts. He reminded The same inconsistency has been obvious in the Opposition's policies since 1949. We remember the approach of honourable members opposite to the problem of communism. Every one of them was prepared to fight with blood and sweat in order to prevent the Communist Party Dissolution Bill from being placed on the statute-book. But when they met the real challenge, did they stand by their pledge? Did they stand firmly by their earlier statements ? They turned tail and voted in support of that measure. I refer now to their attitude to defence. They gave a pledge that they would support the Government in its .recruiting campaign. They declared that they would support a policy to defend Australia against aggression and to enable it to aid the cause of the United Nations. But what happened? When the Government opened its recruiting campaign not one member of the Labour party in New South Wales appeared on a recruiting platform. Honourable members opposite failed to honour the promises and pledges they had given to the Government on dishonoured them. This censure motion 'reflects similar the Opposition. The arguments that the Leader of the Opposition has advanced are neither practical nor logi-",8,Motion Of Censure Pomot
2,"Mr Mcmahon""","I challenge honorcal. However, in an attempt to deal withinto four sections. I propose to deal with only two of those sections, hecause I am sure that my colleagues will deal with the other two aspects. The paramount argument that the Opposition has put forward is that injury is being caused to industry and production, and unemployment is increasing as, the result of the restriction of bank credit and high taxation. The honourable member for Eden Monaro, who is a born plagiarist, adopted the words of his leader and said that the Government's policy "" amounted to conscription of labour through the financial and banking system"". The has effectively refuted that allegation. Is not consoription of labour part and parcel of Labour's socialist philosophy? Does the Labour party believe that a man who establishes a home has a. right to live in it with his wife and family? Honourable members opposite have never believed in that philosophy, 'fhey do not hold anything sacrosanct and, consequently, in their view, no one has the right to enjoy domestic bliss and happiness. I remind the House that the former Leader of the Opposition, the late Mr J. B. Chifley, made the following statement at a conference of trade unions in Sydney:5To guarantee can be given to anybody that tliey can stay put in a particular industry. It is realized that there will have to be transfers of works, and in many eases transfers of whole communities to other forms of work. The most any government can do is to see there is work for everybody. Why, then, does the Opposition criticize this Government's policy of diversion of labour from one industry to another when it is part and parcel of the socialist platform, that every one has to accept the idea of dictation and conscription of labour ? On that score, the Opposition's argument is completely fallacious and insincere. I turn now to the so-called injury that is being done to industry through the banking mechanism, credit restriction and oontrol of capital issues. I think that the House will agree that, in this matter, the Opposition stands on most insecure ground. Who is to be injured? Obviously it is not the employee, because, to-day, there are 40,000 unfilled jobs in N'ow South Wales. Mr MeMahon. not the wage-earner who will suffer because an examination of the relevant statistics shows that while prices rose by 19 per cent, in 1950-51, wages rose by 37 per cent, in the same period. 60,000 unfilled jobs. vacant jobs in New South Wales in mid-January. cannot logically contend that injury is being done to the wage-earner, because the known facts prove that the wage earner has not suffered and will not suffer under this Government's policy. I do not imagine for a moment that the Opposition is at all worried about persons who are engaged in rural production, because once again, an examination of the facts reveals that agricultural activities during the nine years that Labour was in office slowly but steadily declined. The paramount task of this Government is to restore incentive to primary producers, and, indeed, to restore efficiency in industry generally. If we accept the fact that the Labour party has on no occasion worried about the primary producer and the salary earner, we are driven inevitably to the conclusion that honourable gentlemen opposite have based their arguments in this debate on one factor alone, which is that there will he a slight transfer of labour from light or non-essential industries to essential industries. In truth, that is the policy of the Government. That is precisely what the Government hopes to achieve. We believe that we shall strengthen the productive mechanism and our economy by -diverting people from non-essential industries to such basic industries as agriculture, power, transport, coal, iron and steel. a basic industry? is not a basic industry at the present time. What dpes the Government's policy mean? If our policy succeeds, no injury will be done to industry, and the Obviously it is foundations of 'a secure .and prosperous",9,Opposition Membebs Hear Hear

10,"Mr Mcmahon""","In this context i teconomy will be laid. By a gradual process under a great leader, tbe economy of this country is being strengthened in its fundamentals. I hesitate to think that h will be argued that, if we are to build a strong economy, we need not, as the first step, make its foundations secure. Surely it will not be argued that the proper way in which to build a house is to forget the foundations completely and first to construct the garret or the roof. A house cannot be built by such methods, and, in the same way, a strong economy cannot be established unless the foundations have been securely laid. If this Government is given the necessary tenure of office, tiie economy will be completely different from that which we inherited from the Labour regime. I shall now examine credit policy and capital issues control. speakers, when they deal with those matters, reach the height of absurdity and nonsense. I sometimes wonder whether those honourable gentlemen when they dabble in strange media, especially in the medium of economics, bother to examine the relevant statistics, because it has been alleged that, due somehow to the restriction of credit, industry has been slowed down. I want to make it clear that the policy of the Government has not been to contract or restrict credit, or to fix a specific limit to credit expanmember for Eden-Monaro. I turn non sion with the resolution to go so far and no farther. All that it has done has been to keep a light rein on credit faciliattempt to show that taxes under ties to ensure that credit shall not be expanded too rapidly or too far. Proof of that can be found in returns of the Gommonwealth Bank which show that whereas at the end of June, 1950, bank credit amounted to £574,000,000, by December, 1951, that figure had i-isen to £798,000,000. £224,000,000 on £574,000,000 is approximately 40 per cent. How a policy which has permitted this expansion in eighteen months can be termed restrictive, must defy the imagination of any oue who is not addicted to Roget's Thesaurus as apparently the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is. Capital issues too have increased substantially. Figures that I have obtained from the Sydney Stock Exchange recently show that whereas during the last period of Labour government, capital issues totalled £57,000,000, by 1951 the total had risen to£111,000,000. That is quite understandable because who would want to raisecapital during a socialist regime?

Similarly, a taxpayer in receipt of £800 a year in 1944-45 paid £207 whereas in the current year he is being called upon to pay only £60. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro advanced the amazing argument that the basis of comparison should be not what the £1 purchases to-day, but what it purchased in 1944-45. The idiocy of that argument is that such a basis of comparison places Labour's taxes at double their real figure, and shows even more",10,Opposition Membebs Hear Hear

13,"Mr Mcmahon""","The figures that 1clearly that the taxes levied by this Government are infinitely lighter than those imposed by the Labour regime during the years that I have mentioned. Inconsistencies such as these reinforce my belief that Labour spokesmen do uot know what they are talking about. The subject of unemployment has been freely discussed during this debate. Surelyi f , as the Opposition has said, the Government's credit policy, capital issues policy, and public works policy are causing unemployment, the reverse must-also be true so that a reversal of those policies would reverse the trend. But, in fact, there is not any unemployment and there is little or no possibility of unemployment occurring except in one or two seasonal industries, such as the Queensland sugar-growing industry. .Unemployment in the technical sense in which the word is used certainly will not develop while this Government is in oflice. Members of the Opposition have shown very clearly, by their evasion of argument on one point, that they do not understand the nature of the strong economic trend that exists in this country to-day. Statisbreach. 'It has granted provisional tax tics show that the unusually severe inflation in Australia last year was caused by two factors. was the extraordinary high wool income and the second was the tremendous amount of transferred money, and speculation money, that came into the country. The amount of money that was earned abroad last year on the international balance of payments for current account was £84,000,000. In addition, capital transfers, which represented freo spending power brought into the community, amounted to £146,000,000. In the two preceding years capital transfers amounted to £259,000,000 and £148,000,000 respectively. That influx of money had a distorting effect on Australia's economy. This trend has now been reversed and it is semi-officially expected smirks upon their faces and an inclinathat the balance of payments this year will disclose a deficit of £400,000,000 and the people. There is every ground for that there will be no capital transfers. That is the most important financial development that has occurred in this country during the last two years. Failure to (recognize that fact exposes the ignorance of the Opposition and explains why it has not been able to support it3 motion of censure with logical argument* based on known economic facts. Australia's position to-day is exactly comparable with that of a man who had £500 to spend last year but who is in debt to his bank to the amount of £250 this year. That comparison illustrates the nature of the change in the financial situation of Australia which is gradually transforming the character of our problem to that of financial embarrassment. Instead of having an over-supply of money, we are now in a situation in which costs are the deciding factor. Limitation of time prevents me from discussing this subject at greater length. However, an examination of the arguments of the Opposition will snow uiat they have failed miserably. I have not heard one argument from the opposite side of the House that could withstand constructive criticism. In fact, the Government's budget is succeeding. Furthermore, whenever there has been any evidence of anomalies or injustices, the Government has jumped quickly into the allowances to wool-growers and others who have suffered from fires, it has The first increased the return to wheat-growers, and it has taken a dozen and one other measures to ensure that justice shall be done to all. There is every ground for confidence in this Government, and a radical change is taking place in the thinking of its critics. Only yesterday I asked my Caledonian friend, the honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Jack), what he thought about the matter. He has the reputation of knowing the Christian name of every person in his constituency. He told me that he Avould be perfectly happy to test the opinion of the people. So too would I . Let us see whether in a year's time the members of the Opposition will still have tion to challenge this Government to go to confidence in the Government. The motion will fail because it is illogical and inconsistent. I commend the Government's policy to the House. At a later date I hope to have an opportunity to describe in detail the achievements of the Government in the interests of the people.",11,Opposition Membebs Hear Hear
14,Mr Mcmahon.,"[2.56] -l n rebuking an interjector a few moments ago, Mr Speaker, you said that this was not Wonderland. I am wondering whether the Minister for the Navy Wonderland, for his speech was remarkable for its contradictions. He accused an honourable member on this side of the House of making a vitriolic attack on the Priine Minister and of repeating the words used by his own leader. almost immediately afterwards, the M in ister began to read a. statement that the late Mr Ohifley made some time ago, obviously forgetting that he was repeating what his leader had said at great length last night. Honourable gentlemen opposite, in an attempt to j u s t if y the should do. Hundreds of men in the actions of the Government, have quoted t.he words of the late Mr Ohifley about the shifting of employment or the transferring of men from one job to another. Merely to talk economics and to say that the Governinent has not increased taxes will not justify the Government's action in the eyes of the people. The Government will not dare to go to the country at the present time ancl find ont what the people a re thinking. About three weeks ago a man came to see me in my office in Adelaide. He was uot a Labour man. He came from the country. He asked me whether I thought the Government or the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) was likely to do anything in regard to taxation. He told me that he owned a couple of farms away out in the country, that he had had a pretty good year last year and that this year he was being asked to pay over £S,000 in income tax. I shall tell the honourable member for Canning( Mr Hamilton), who is interjecting, a little about the present Government and it3 ideas about, taxation and of how it is preparing its own supporters to meet their tax liabilities. whom I have referred said that he had invested some of his income for the good year in Commonwealth bonds. H'.e told me that he could not borrow money from the bank to pay his income tax this year and that he would have to cash his bonds, but he complained that for each £100 that he had invested he would now receive only £94. That reduction of the value of the bonds has been caused by the action of the Government in increasing the rate of interest payable on the last Commonwealth loan. member for Canning says "" What rot""'. If he reads the press he w ill know the market value of £100 Commonwealth bonds that were bought twelve months But ago. The man asked me whether I ctiought the Government would accept his bonds at their face value in discharge of his income tax liability, so that he would not lose £6 on each £100 bond. When I told him that there was no hope of that being done, he wanted to know what he country are in a similar position. There are only two members of the Australian Country party present in the chamber at the moment. They and their colleagues who are absent know only too well that what I have said about the Government is correct. In two years, this Government has reduced the f a it h of the people in the honesty of government. Two years ago, it saicl that it would reduce taxes. Let us consider what this Government has clone in connection with taxation. The Minister has quoted misleading figures, just as the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) did last night. There is an old saying that figures can be made to talk in any way that is desired. Supporters of the Government have been citing figures in a way that suits their own ends. Both the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy have stated that taxes payable by a married man with one child receiving £300 per annum during the war period amounted to £22 ISs. a year and that he now pays only 19s. To-day, in order to meet his living expenses, that man receives au income of £600 a year, on which he pays taxes that total £27 8s. In the days of The man to our extremity such a man received a little above the basic wage. To-day, although his living expenses have risen, he still receives little above the basic wage but is called upon to pay .higher taxes. Many men who received an income of £500 a year during the war period are to-day receiving £1,000 a year, but are no better off in consequence.

18,Mr Thompson,"The honorableman in receipt of £500 a year was £88 16s. To-day that man in receipt of £1,000 a year is called upon to pay £103 6s. in taxes. Yet the Minister has had the audacity to endeavour to hoodwink the people into believing that because taxation rates have been reduced, the Government has in fact lightened the taxation impost. Nothing of the sort! I am quite familial' with the Government's technique in this matter. During the last general election campaign I warned the electors of what was in store for them if the Menzies Government were returned to office, not only in connection with but also in connection with industries. Yesterday, the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Cramer) stated that many mushroom industries had sprung up in Australia, and that the present disruption of our economy was attributable to the 40-hour week, which was causing unlimited harm because of the condition of over-employment. vernment's answer to our charge. About threo and a half years ago a man in South Australia told nie that he had commenced the manufacture of butchers knives, pruning Australian steel. I subsequently visited his works and saw that he was turning our splendid articles. told me that he wanted to obtain more capital to expand his business, and asked whether I thought that he would be protected when similar goods began to be imported from other countries. I discussed the matter with the then Treasurer (Mi-. Chifley) who told me that while Labour was in oflice care would be taken to see that small Australian industries were protected. To-day, however, the non-Labour Government in office does not regard the industry that I have mentioned as essential. It is more concerned about the interests of big importers than those of manufacturers and business men in a small' way of business. The big importers are being assisted and protected in many ways. I have had considerable experience in the Parliament and can recall other periods of shortages of employment. I know of the methods that have been adopted by employers in the past to obtain contracts. I remember instances of manufacturers in the eastern States, Mr Thompson. where labour was plentiful, being able to undersell South Australian manufacturers and thereby obtain contracts in that State. Every encouragement was given to new industries during the regime of the former Labour government. In my own State cotton mills were established at places where they had never existed before, in which the manufacture of sheets, pillow slips, canvas duck and other articles that are so essential to the people was undertaken. I recall an occasion on which ra leading executive in a big cotton concern called on me during the Chifley regime and asked me wliether I could taxation, see to it, that the local cotton industry would not be swamped by Indian calico. He asked, "" Can we not get the assistance that we need? "" The Chifley Government assisted the local cotton industry by means of price subsidies which it continued to pay. But the position is different now. A few weeks ago I read in the press that hundreds of people in the very concern That is the Gothat that executive represented had been given notice of dismissal. The same newspaper contained an item that stated that Australia was bringing immense quantities of cotton goods from Japan and saws and the like from India. I know enough of economics and of the running of a country to be well aware that we have to import when we He export, because international trade cannot be conducted on a one way basis. I know also, however, that in these matters it is our duty to protect our own growing industries. The 'Government boasts about continuing the immigration policy that was established by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) when he was Minister for Immigration during the Chifley regime and among the people being brought to this country from Great Britain are weavers who have been trained for the work of the textile industry, yet it intends to permit heavy importations of textiles that will reduce the amount of work available in the Australian textile industry. We do not object to a proper import licensing system or to some control of capital issues, but we do object to the manner in which the Government is putting such controls into effect. It is of no use for honourable members opposite to offer as a defence that Labour, wheu it was in office, exercised controls over capital issues and imports. A man may have a razor, which is .a valuable article for shaving purposes, but that does not mean that he wants to use it to cut somebody's throat. The Chifley Government had the razor, but it used it for the correct purposes. Wliat this Government is doing is to use capital issues to cut the throat of the Australian textile industry, and not to get the best results for this country. It is attempting to put out of existence industries that it considers to be non-essential. I refer to such industries as those that the honourable membei' for Bennelong ( Mr of figures to suit himself. I say to the Cramer) growths. The Government has boasted about what it has done in relation to the housing problem. The honourable member for Bennelong said yesterday that he did not want the New South Wales Housing Commission to keep on building houses. He did not want money to be made available to that authority. He wants money to be made available in quarters in which there will be no power to counteract prices and control costs, so that good old private enterprise, for whose benefit the Government's policy has been designed, will be able to develop further. I know the position. I have no illusions about it, and have never had any illusions about it. To-day the Government is boasting that it is forcing people out of light industries into the railway services. But honourable members opposite do not explain that the railways and tramways services of this country have been able to augment their staff beeausu they have been recruiting labour in Britain. The Government is falsely using that augmentation of labour in the transport services as justification for its strangling of light industries. It claims that people are leaving those industries and going into employment in heavier industries and in the transport services. I. find it absolutely ridiculous to expect chat many people who work in light industries could tftke up work in heavy industries. The Government has called for more production. In my electorate mothers of families took jobs in industries and worked four-hour or six-hour shifts in textile factories in the evenings to produce more and help the family's finances. But they are not going to be allowed to produce much more now, becausesuch industries are going overboard. There will be no work for them. Many members of the Government have the illusion that that is the way to run a country. The honourable member for Bennelong referred to the capital issues -control exercised during the Labour Governrr.bnt's regime and attempted to compare s capital advances made then with the advances made under this Government. I think that he doubled one of the sets who is now in charge of the House, that it was under the controls that were exercised in a proper manner by the Chifley regime that many of our light industries were able to extend their operations. The Minister for the Navy said that the Government's policy had not compelled businesses to reduce their staffs. Then he said that the policy had resulted in men leaving certain industries and accepting work in the railway services and in essential industries. It seems to me that the Government is hard pressed to defend its policy. Members of the Opposition have been chided on the way in which they have spoken of honourable members opposite. Yet, last night the Prime. Minister( Mr Menzies) sneered at and cast slurs upon the Leader of the Opposition, a man who would not try to do such' a thing to him. The Prime Minister's speech reminded me of the period during which Labour was in office. When a censure motion was moved against the previous Government the present Postmaster General( Mr Anthony) used the opportunity it gave to cast similar aspersions on members of the Government, but never once did I hear our then leader, the late Mr Chifley, descend to address the then Leader of the Opposition as the Prime Minister addressed the present Leader of tlie Opposition lapt night. The Prime Minister may not have realized it, but if he had spent half as much time as he did in abusing the Leader of the Opposition he may have defended the Government better. There is an old saying, "" The lady doth protest too much, methinks "".",13,Opposition Membebs Hear Hear

He claimed that the Government had reduced taxation but the total amount of taxation to be collected this financial year will be pose of your profits by building up your more than double the amount collected last year.

It just took 20 per cent, During this debate I referred, by interof the proceeds. It did not explain to jection, to "" a hidden hand"" and some honourable members opposite laughed. TJnder the existing system of control of credit a person who has unsuccessfully endeavoured to obtain a loan from a bank does not know why his application has been refused. A hidden hand is directing certain industries to the wall and it seems to me that those that will go to the wall will be those which produce goods that can be imported from overseas by big interests which will make a huge profit on them. The Govermnent is encouraging this development in order to secure revenue. It bas budgeted for a greater expenditure than ever before and it realizes that if goods are brought from overseas instead of being made in Australia it will be able to collect duty on them. Honourable members of the Opposition are quite justified in complaining of the policy of the Government. I know the difficulties with which the Government is faced. During the debate the honourable member for Canning( Mr Hamilton) interjected concerning a system which the Labour Government had introduced. What is really bothering the Australian Country party to-day is that the Government has altered the system of averaging certain taxable incomes. Government likes to pose as a long sighted administration which carefully considers the advice of its economists. after the last war, men who had returned to civilian life and gone into business told tial sporting goods are now beyond the me that they had only a comparatively small amount of tax to pay in their first year of business because they had only to pay tax on their previous year's earnings in the Army, part of which was exempt from taxation. I warned them to make provision for the payment of a larger sum in the following year because they ilr. Thompson. would then have to pay provisional tax on the basis of the profits made during their first year of business. I said, "" You had better be careful that you do not disstocks or by putting in improvements, because then you will not be in a position to pay your tax when it falls due "". The Government certainly did not warn woolthe farmers what would happen the following year. Although some honourable members of the Government parties may have tried to do something of that sort, the Government itself did nothing. I do not want to argue about the merits or the demerits of discontinuing certain provisions of the averaging system, because such a matter is one solely for the Government to decide. However, I do say that if this Government had half the intelligence and foresight that it claims to have, it would have acted as it did twelve months earlier. It would also have advised the farmers as I have indicated. I should welcome a general election at the present time. Many people who used to vote for the Liberal party have recently voiced to me their doubts about the efficacy of the Government's policy. Only last week I received two interesting letters. One was from the secretary of a tennis club, and one was from a State tennis association. Botli correspondents asked me whether I could do anything about the 33^ per cent, sales tax that has been imposed on tennis rackets. It must be remembered that it is of greater benefit to young people to play tennis The in their spare time than to stand around street corners, and the Government would do well to direct its attenDirectly tion to the sales tax on sporting goods, particularly tennis rackets. These essenmeans of young people. When I say racket I mean the implement with which people play tennis and not the racket that the Government is engaged in. There are a lot of decent honest men among you able member must address me.",15,Opposition Membebs Hear Hear
20,Mr Speaker,"Order! The honorgood honest men on the Government side, and I do not desire to import any class antipathy into the debate. However, the interests and objectives of honourable members on this side of the House lie with the country and the people in it. Honourable members on the Government side are interested in the welfare of the country, but they also make sure that a special section of the people have their interests particularly looked after. Honourable members on the Government side do not wilfully champion sectional interests. Tbey do it by the general trend of their actions in this House. The Opposition desires that this motion be carried. Yesterday the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) asked what the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) would do if by some mischance the motion were carried and the Opposition assumed office. I shall tell honourable members what he woulcl do. He would carry out the policy of the Labour movement, and pull Australia out of the economic mess into which the Government has flung it. Every time Labour comes to office it finds it necessary to disentangle the country's affairs from the sorry state in which non-Labour governments have left them. Mention has been made of the Opposition attempting to cast doubts on the motives of the Government. I direct attention to the way the Government won the 1949 general elections. It did so by casting doubts on Labour's motives, and by a campaign of sneers and slurs. You cannot keep on doing that able member must address me. cannot continue playing the old game of trying to fool the people all the time. The Government may be able to fool some of them all the time, but most of them have awakened to the fact that Australia again needs a Labour government. The Labour party has never made rosy promises like those made by the non-Labour parties about increased production of food and expanding primary industries. The emptiness of the Government's promises has been shown by the published letters of wheat-farmers which have been to the effect that they do not intend to grow more wheat because of the high rate of taxation. able member's time has expired. The timing of the censure motion that has been moved on behalf of the Opposition is not entirely unexpected. It is not a motion of censure of the Australian people or of the national economy but of the Government and it has been brought forward on the last occasion it could possibly be of any use to the Opposition's political welfare. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has stated that the time has come to assess the consequences of the Government's policy. I suggest that this is the last time that the Opposition .can secure any advantage from the disturbance in economic conditions with which the Government is grappling. The time has not yet come when honourable members can see as fully and as clearly as they will do in the next few months the result of this Government's actions. Trends which are clearly discernible show that there is a growing appreciation among the public that great good to the Australian economy is emerging from the unpalatable actions that this Government has had to take in the teeth of fierce opposition. The Government is under censure on two main headings. The first is inflation. The second is the threat to what the Labour party has always claimed to be its own private invention-ful l employment. But the very essence of inflation is in the fact that too much money is drifting about in the community and too little production is being achieved. In such circumstances, money ancl goods reach a new equation. If goods are short, prices will rise and that ia precisely what has happened. The two ways out of this difficulty are to reduce purchasing power and to increase the production of goods but every appeal for an increase in the production of goods that has been macle by this Government has fallen on deaf ears. Inevitably the Government has found that it can no longer ignore the situation in the hope that the Australian people will see that all of",16,Opposition Membebs Hear Hear

The Government had to act and, if necessary, it had to use unpalatable methods to stop the drift in our economy. damage would be done to the economy and almost every individual in the community emerged from the war into a period of inflation. It was a circumstance which inevitably follows a war and it developed not only in Australia but in every country. war as a welfare state of the Labour Government's creation. party fondly imagined that it would lead the country for a century and it believed, therefore, that it was quite safe in using its unlimited wartime powers to introduce the basis of a welfare state. When this Government came into office, it found itself burdened with unlimited costs in the field of social services and with a staggering legacy of inefficiency and indiscipline in industry with which it is now attempting to cope. In the most important industrial State of Australia, the Labour Premier without any thought of responsibility for his action applied a 40-hour week to all State awards and then virtually intimidated the Commonwealth Arbitration Court into followiug suit. I am second to none in my advocacy of a shorter working week and higher pay when we can have one or both without a reduction of the standard of living, but we have gone through the five years since the end of the war having neither the one nor the other. We have the 40-hour week and wages have increased, but the standard of living has declined because production has not kept pace with demand. No one denies that full employment is desirable, but there can be a situation of over-employment such as that brought about by the introduction of the 40^hour working week when there was a war-time lag in the provision of goods and services. We have learned that overemployment is not an unmixed blessing. It has led to a situation regarding which we should not mince words. I am of the opinion that every one in the community, from the most humble worker to the most highly placed, has been busy exploiting the present economic difficulties Ur. FaArhall. for his own economic advantage. It has become a national sport for those in industry to talk about how little work they do for so much pay. Somebody has Otherwise irreparable to pay for that in higher prices and lower living standards. We must realize that inflation can be defeated not by acts would be hurt. Australia of Parliament, but only by individual action. We have reached a stage when award wages are no more than the point at which to begin bargaining. Wages have gone up and up, and because of the Australia emerged from the cumulative effect of labour shortages, power shortages and shortages of The Labour materials, production has declined in the same ratio as wages have increased. The effect of this has been to increase still further the gap between production and demand. There has been a tremendous turn-over of labour in every industry. New men are virtually valueless until they have received some kind of training. They stay in the job for anything from four to ten weeks and then, by the time they have acquired some skill and are beginning to earn the money they receive, they are off looking for a better job. am merely pointing out the consequences of such action to honourable members opposite who, apparently, have had little experience of these matters. If a. man works for three or four weeks without producing anything useful, the money he receives for producing nothing will eventually buy nothing. Its only effect will be to water down the currency. I am not now accusing any one in particular. As I have said, the net must be widely thrown. I am merely drawing attention to a set of facts in order to show that it was necessary for the Government to take urgent and, perhaps, unpalatable action. I do not object to any one trying to get more pay or to improve his position, but it must be done at a time and in a manner that will not adversely, affect the economy, or injure those unfortunate persons who, through lack of organization, are unable to take care of themselves in these difficult times. The fact will not be overlooked that many of the difficulties that confront us to-day result from the implementation of Labour's policy during the long period of the socialist reign, not excluding those",17,Opposition Membebs Hear Hear

27,Mr Fairhall,"I do not object. 1caused by the fostering, or at least the overlooking, of indiscipline in industry. We now have an abundance of non-essentials but We are deplorably short of every essential that goes to make a sound economy. There is something wrong in a country if there is no twinge of national conscience when it has to import steel from Japan. Are we not ashamed of the fact, that we have to import coal from India? Have we no concern for the industrial situation which compels us, in an attempt to bolster our failing transforeshadowed by the late Mr Chifley, port systems, to send men abroad to buy railway rolling-stock from Belgium, the whole rail transport system of which was torn up during the war, and when we ha.ve to blot the landscape with prefabricated houses imported from Europe when we have the resources to build our own homes, and lack only the incentive to use them ? We have been told that we may even yet have to import food. All of these importations are subject to rising prices ancl their cost must be met by the only people who can find the money, the consumers. If the consumers demand increased wages, and produce less, they must pay the higher prices and be content to live on a lower standard. The Labour party has raised its old standby bogy-unemploymen t and depression. I had some experience of the effects of the depression. Indeed, almost every honourable member experienced its effects either directly or indirectly. No one can seriously suggest that the Government is eager to see another depression in this country. Having regard to the tremendous shortages that exist in every aspect of that we are living in a man's worlda our economy, I do not believe that, for as far ahead as we can see, there will be any appreciable unemployment among our people. Last night, the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) cited figures that related, not to last year but to last month, which indicated that, throughout the whole of Australia there were only 2,646 recipients of thc unemployment benefit, and that of that total, no fewer than 2,300 were in Queensland where, due to seasonal occupation and drought conditions there must inevitably be some change of employment. Do the figures that were cited in the House to-day, showing the number of jobs that are' still waiting for workers to fill *'large-scale unemployment in this country in the foreseeable future? Inevitably, because we have a surplus of the commodities that we do not so greatly need, and shortages of those that we need most seriously, there must be a new pattern of employment in Australia. There must inevitably be some transfers of labour from one industry .to another. The methods used by the Government to accomplish these transfers in industry are surely less painful than were, those when he was Prime Minister, when he said that there would have to be transfers of whole communities. There is still preserved to the individual the choice of many jobs. If the Government, by its economic policy, has restricted the range of jobs in which a person may seek employment, it can justify its actions in so doing as being demonstrably in the public interest. We have drifted into these difficulties as the result of Labour's wholesale disregard of good business administration and the failure of the. average individual to honour his obligation to put in the equivalent of what he takes out of the economic system. We can get out of our difficulties only by the hard way. If the experiences of the last few years have failed to indicate to us that nothing is free, and that we can get out of the economic system only what we are prepared, to put into it, we have passed the point at which we. can learn anything, thi s country must wake up to the fact competitive world. The honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson) appealed for the protection of Australian industries. He also suggested that if we are to trade with other nations we must be prepared to import from them as well as export to them. That is fundamentally true. The honourable member went further, however, and said that by the imposition of prohibitive tariffswe must: protect every industry established in this country. What we have to strive for is the utmost economy in the use of our restricted man-power. A t this time we cannot afford to protect every inefficient or unnecessary industry that is estabradicate that there '-**» lished. The time will come when, happily, we shall be free of these restrictions, but that time has not yet arrived. The stock in trade of the Labour party is to destroy confidence. What would happen if that party should succeed in destroying the confidence of the people in the present Government's programme of economic rehabilitation which now shows signs of reaching fruition? Honourable members opposite are prepared to go to any lengths in order to bolster up their chance of regaining control of the treasury bench. If they should succeed, would there be merely restriction of opportunity of employment under a Labour government ? No. We would revert to direction of labour within a very short time and suffer just as the people of Great Britain suffered under a socialist government in that country. Would there be merely advisory and general directional control of industry? No. A Labour government would tie industry down to a three-year or a five-year plan. Would there be merely top level direction to banks on advance policy? No. TJnder a Labour government we should see repeated in this country the position that faced the Australian people in 1949 when Labour sought not to direct but to nationalize and, in effect, annihilate the private banks. productive ability. That development That would be the aim of any future Labour government. Of course, disquiet exists in industry to-day. These are uncomfortable times. There is a.n urgent need for readjustments, and whilst every one is in favour of readjustments so long as his individual interests are not thereby adversely affected, there is, nevertheless, real recognition in the community of the fact that what the Government js doing is not only necessary but also wise because it is laying sound foundations for the future development of our economy. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) shed unaccustomed tears for some of those with on the stock market. falling values on the stock market indicated loss of confidence. stock market is a barometer, not of political, but of business conditions, and it is most strongly affected by influences that have nothing to do with politics. There is nothing more nervous than money. It responds to all kinds of injur. Fairhall. fluences. The fact is that to-day the stock market is being affected as the result of policies that the Labour party implemented a few years ago. Honourable members opposite have not noticed that it is also being profoundly influenced hy the drought that has recently occurred throughout the country and which has caused a decline of production in not only primary but also secondary industries. In recent years, owing to the absence of competition, all sorts of secondary industries sprang up like mushrooms in this country. The textile industry, after labouring for many years to catch up with shortages that occurred a3 a result of war-time conditions, has now overtaken the lag and, necessarily, it must experience a hiatus in production. That development is evidence of the fact that under a Liberal government our economy at long last is attaining a new balance. The stock market reflects all these influences. Another factor that must be considered is that when money is cheap and plentiful a new influence in ihe person of the speculator appears on the stock market. The reduction of values on the stock exchange to-day does not reflect any loss of assets or any deterioration of our simply reveals that the stock market is getting rid of speculative influences upon which it is impossible to build a sound economy. It is a good thing that we are thus getting rid of the gambler because, this country cannot build its future on gambling. The Government inherited from the Labour party the wicked cost-plus system which has frustrated every effort to decrease prices and to increase productive efficiency. The position in industry has been aggravated by increasing lack of discipline with the result that contractors, who are ready and willing to tender, cannot do so because costs of investments materials and labour are increasing aud He said that the turnover of labour is abnormally high. When prices place a contractor between The a fixed ceiling and a rising floor he must inevitably be crushed. I am pleased to note that the miserable cost-plus system is now on the way out. We have learned that we cannot price ourselves out of the market and, at the same time, maintain progressive industries. All these factors are an indication not of lack of conon families dependent upon fixed incomes, such fidence but of tbe fact that under wise as social services and repatriation benefits, and careful handling by a progressive earners has fallen and is falling: because of Government our economy is now attaining its persistence in so injurious a policy the a new equation and a new balance upon Government has lost the confidence of the which it w ill be enabled to build for the country and is deserving of censure. future.

All of us realize current session that the position of those that this process involves a certain degree classes of persons to-day is much worse of temporary unhappiness. The honorthan it was in 1949 when the Labour Goable member for Port Adelaide suggests vernment went out of office. Whereas that the Government is pandering to big in that year their share of the national business. However, his colleague, the income dividend was 54 per cent., it is honourable member for Melbourne, does only 48 per cent, at present.

29,Mr Costa (Banks) [ 3 . 4 3 ],"there is a greater number of people out of work than the Prime Minister admitted. Denial of the right to work is a denial of the right to live. The Government's so-called disemployment policy is a repudiation of the promises that it made to the people in 1949 and repeated in 1951. The Prime Minister, in the policy speech of the present Government parties, in 1949, saidThe aspiration for full employment is no monopoly of the socialists. We are all human beings. Yeti t is clear that full employment is to be the socialists' election slogan. This is a false issue. We shall confidently devote ourselves to full employment and the avoidance of depression. The last depression arose from circumstances outside Australia. The right honourable gentleman claimed that unemployment is non-existent in this country to-day and that it is the policy of the Government to maintain f u l l employment. However, that claim is refuted by the following report which was published in the Melbourne Herald of the 7th February last:The Australian textile industry, employing 00,000, was facing extinction, Customs Minister O'Sullivan was told to-day. He was given the information in a statement by a deputation of textile employers and employees. The Minister was told thnt unemployment iu the industry had already risen to 0,000 and that thousands more were working only part time wliile tlie Commonwealth was allocating contracts for military clothing to Japan. Sydney wliarfs were jammed with thousands of pounds worth of imported textiles, with more to come, employers said. Importers liad not the credit facilities to to the following newspaper report on that take them from the wharfs and until they were cleared and sold there would be no further orders for Australian mills. Thc deputation said manufacturers could ->< get a contract from the Commonwealth for military supplies, despite the talk of defence preparedness. I advanced to the Government, not by the employees, but on behalf of the employers in the textile industry. The director of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures, Mr Latham Withall, has made the following statement in relation to the textile industry:Unemployment in the textile and apparel industries is increasing at the rate of about 1.000 operatives u, week. Tn addition another 500 operatives, a week in these industries arc froing on to part-time-24 to 32 hours a week. Finished stocks of woollen it nrl rayon and other textiles iuid clothing of all sorts arc from twice to six times the normal stocks held by producers. Mr Ooxtn. Some manufacturers report that they are holding stocks equivalent to six months normal sales, l f the present trends continue unchecked, it seems inevitable that many plants must be thrown out of production ancl tliat many businesses will ibe forced into liquidation. That statement was made by a representative, not of the Labour movement, but of the employers. The Victorian Chamber of Commerce has issued the following appeal, copies of which have doubtless been received by all members:WHY WEAKEN AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY? Wliat shall it profit a merchant if his store be stocked with low-priced merchandise from abroad if his customers, through local unemployment, lack the wherewithal to buy? The Australian merchant who purchases the imported .product at the expense of domestic goods is jeopardizing the Australian standard of living and imperilling his own future. Import what we must by all means, but do not bring here a single thing that keeps a foreign workman busy and an Australian workman idle. Australia's first duty is to the Australians. Unfortunately, the Government is not pursuing that policy. B y permitting the importation of Japanese goods, and by purchasing even Japanese cloth for Australian military uniforms, it is not observing the golden rule of ""Australia first"". The Government's credit restriction policy is having serious effects upon thc housing programme. I direct attention aspect:that tlie State Government would have to cut its home building programme by £2,800,000 before the end of June because of the Commonwealth Government's refusal to allocate more than £8,500,000 for home building. emphasize that those views were He said the State Government would have to cancel local contracts to enable it .to pay for homes now on tlieir way to Australia. "" The Commonwealth Government agreed, under clause 0 of the Commonwealth-State housing agreement to provide money to build homes needed in the State Government's The anticipated Housing Commission expenditure this year was £14,000,000. Faced with this outlay, the Federal Government repudiates its agreement with the State and proposes to find only £8,500,000 for New South Wales housing.

I suppose that the St. George and Sutherland Master Builders Association is an organization that normally supports the Liberal party, but its secretary has written to me the following complaint about the effects of the Government's credit restriction policy upon private home building:I have been directed to draw your attention to the fact that the Federal Government's credit restriction policy has already resulted iu a considerable reduction in home building, and there is no doubt that unless the restrictions are lifted, private home building will be practically brought to a full stop within three months. If it is the intention of the Federal GovernVan Dyke Brothers Proprietary Limited. ment to ensure an almost complete cessation of home building then tlieir policy will undoubtedly be successful. Buti t is a little difficult to reconcile this policy with the fact that at the present time the housing shortage is in the vicinity of 300,000 homes, and this deficit will continue to be increased by immigration and natural increase, while tiie home building programme is practically at a standstill. TJnder the circumstances, I am directed to ask that you give this matter your earnest consideration with a view to having the Federal Government modify their policy to allow of a reasonable amount of finance being made available to the public through the Building Societies and Rural Bank, &c. Approximately required, yet this Government's credit restriction policy, in addition to causing the dismissal of employees in the textile industry, w ill cause unemployment in the building trade. The position is becoming most serious. Vandyke Brothers Proprietary Limited, of Villawood, New South Wales, is the largest manufacturer of prefabricated houses in the southern production houses per annum. As a result of the Government's credit restriction policy, two-thirds of the company's staff were sacked two weeks ago. The company was simply unable to obtain credit to enable it to continue operations. Approximately 75 per cent, of the prefabricated houses which were made by Vandyke Brothers Proprietary Limited were ordered by the Commission and were allocated to coal mining and steel-producing districts with the object of encouraging additional workers to settle in those areas and increase the output of basic commodities. Some of the prefabricated houses were also supplied to the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority, and to various rural areas. That valuable source of supply of dwellings w ill no longer be available. I remind the House of two importaut considerations-thi s company employs Australian workmen, and the cost of each prefabricated house that it makes is £2,000. That project is to be closed down because the Government evidently prefers to import prefabricated houses at the cost of £3,000. are not as satisfactory as those made byfreight charge on each imported prefabricated house is £800. to sell its houses ? them because people are unable to obtain credit. If the cost of a house is £3,000, a worker is not able to obtain financial accommodation unless he can pay a deposit of £1,500. Does any Government supporter believe that a worker is able to provide such a substantial sum ? 300,000 houses are The position is ridiculous! The Government's credit restriction policy is also having a serious effect upon the activities of local government authorities. The instance which I shall cite is the Bankstown M u n icipal Council, because I am more familiar with that authority than with other local governing bodies. The Bankstown Municipal Council is one of hemisphere. Its annual the largest municipalities in Australia. is approximately 2,000 To carry on its programme of approved works during this financial year, it requires an amount of £475,000. The Australian Loan Council has already reduced that sum to £250,000. As a result of the Government's credit restriction policy, the council is able to obtain only £50,000 fro m the sources from which it has usually secured money in previous years. The annual revenue of the council New South Wales Housing is £167,000. . The Local Government Acr of New South Wales provides that the authority, in order to finance its works until its rates have been collected, may obtain an overdraft equivalent to 50 percent, of the total annual revenue.

The Bankstown Council buys electricity in bulk, and reticulates it to householders. In the Bankstown district at the present time, 3,000 houses and businesses have yet to be connected with power lines. The cost of each connection is between £45 and £50. Because the council is unable to obtain financial accommodation it is unable to undertake that work, and, consequently, people are being deprived of houses. In the same district there are also important defence undertakings and other essential industries, development of which is being hampered by the Government's credit restriction policy. I urge Government supporters to cross the floor of the House and vote with the Opposition in support of this censure motion. -Almost every Opposition speaker in this debate bas endeavoured to create the impression that the inflationary conditions from which we are suffering at present are peculiar to Australia. They know quite well, of course, that inflation is rife 1950, soon after it first assumed office until throughout the whole of what we know as the Western World, and what is even more significant, that the remedies with which other countries are seeking to combat inflation are similar to those that this Government is now applying. In other words, this censure motion is merely political stage play. That is clear from the weak efforts that have been made by Opposition speakers to justify it. They have resorted to destructive criticism of the Government's policy. Not one speech from the Opposition benches has been constructive, or has suggested an alternative policy. There can be no doubt that although the Government's plans to combat inflation have been in operation for only a short time, they are beginning to take effect. Honourable members opposite have chosen this moment, when the first reactions to those plans are becoming evident throughout the community, to launch their censure motion. They hope to capitalize on those reactions before the plans have had a real chance to work. Eecently a well-known economist saidYou cannot hope to change a long-established economic trend without hurting somebody. Now that the Government has heeded the urgings to "" do something "", and is, indeed, doing many of the things which it was pressed to do, the critics are once more vociferous. Every move which the Governnient has made has provoked opposition and criticism in the quarters most vitally affected. Human nature being what it is, that was only to be expected, though, after all, a government holding a recently renewed charter from the electorate is surely entitled to the full support of the community in all measures which it believes to be in the national interest. That expression of opinion will find an echo in the heart of every man who examines our present economic problems honestly. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) made one extraordinary statement. He said that the Government's action in taking money from the people by budgeting for a surplus was unprecedented. The principle of budgeting for a surplus is completely in accordance with accepted economic philosophy. In fact, it is an elementary principle of economic theory, and its soundness was acknowledged by the late Mr Chifley himself. The Leader of the Opposition also said that the Government had permitted the inflationary drift to continue from January, a few months ago when the 1951-52 budget was introduced. The right honourable gentleman knows well that, during the fifteen months of the Nineteenth Parliament, nothing positive could be done by the Government because of the hostile Labour majority in the Senate. All major measures were either delayed or rejected by the 'Senate, and it was not -until the Twentieth Parliament assembled and the present Government had a majority in both Houses that positive action could be attempted with any prospect of success. Such action was taken immediately. The first budget bf the Twentieth Parliament contained effective anti-inflation proposals. The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) said that the Government's economic policy was quite unsound. He did not elaborate much on that statement, but he claimed that the Government's policy would not curb inflation. The honourable meinber for Banks( Mr Costa) quoted the Director of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures, Mr Withall, in support of his arguments. I , too, shall",23,Opposition Membebs Hear Hear
36,Mr Swartz (Darling Downs) [4.0].,"quote Mr ""Withall, who, as honourable members opposite will agree, is by no means a kind critic of the Government at present. In a Canberra Letter issued towards the end of last year he expressed his belief that inflation was levelling off, and that by about October or November of this year a return to something like normal conditions could be expected. A somewhat similar opinion was expressed by Mr C. P. Pusey, director of the Australian Industries Development Association, who forecast the return of a buyer's market. Sir William Angliss said recently that there would be a fall of beef and mutton prices in the not-distant future. Support for certain other budget proposals have been given in the Bank of New South Wales Beview, a journal which has been cited as an authority by several Opposition speakers in this debate, including the Leader of the Opposition himself. The following is an extract from that publication:Tho. effects of these influences can he seen honourable member, the. housing industry in a redistribution of employment which is slowly unfolding. As yet it is not possible lack of financial support from the Austo measure how far thc change has gone or is likely to go. But there are many signs that basic industries and transport services, whicli the details of the housing programme in have suffered from acute labour shortages for several years, are now having less difficulty in finding staff. Greater concentration of labour and equipment on these industries is au essential part of any final solution of the problem of inflation in its widest sense. The honourable member for Burke( Mr made individual loans for housing Peters) and the honourable member for Banks spoke of thousands of unemployed in Australia at present. There has been frequent use of the word "" disemployment "", and unemployment in more industries in the immediate future has been predicted. I shall refute those arguments by citing figures provided by the Oommonwealth Employment Service. Those figures show that on the 25th January of this year, registered employment vacancies totalled 101,000 for the whole of Australia. References have been made by Opposition speakers to the transition of Labour with its resultant lack of choice. It is interesting to note that the Commonwealth Employment Service lists 6,000 jobs as being available in primary industries. That is probably a conservative estimate because the Division of Agricultural Economics recently gave the figure as 60,000. The manufacturing industries have 47,300 vacancies, the building and construction industries have 15,000 vacancies and the general transport industries have 12,000 vacancies. The last figure does not include approximately 20,000 vacancies in all railways services. The commerce and finance industries have 5,000 vacancies, all public administrations throughout Australia, including health and hospital services, have 8,000 vacancies, servioe. industries have 5,000 vacancies and miscellaneous services have 3,000 vacancies. The total number of registered vacancies in Australia on the 25th January, 1952, was 101,000. The honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson) had much to say about the housing problem, ' and his remarks were supplemented by the honourable member for Banks, who produced figures relating to the activities of the McGirr Government of New South Wales, in which State, according to the is in a state of collapse because of the tralian Government. I cannot discuss New South Wales alone, but I have, figures in relation to the overall situation in Australia. Apart from direct assistance given by this Government, the Commonwealth Bank during 1950-51 amounting to £4,S00,000 and loans to co-operative building societies amounting to £8,300,000. During the same year, this Government provided £21,600,000 under the terms of the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. Provision has been made in the budget for the current year for the allocation of £26,000,000 for the same purpose. The Government has agreed to subsidize, imported prefabricated houses to the amount of £300 for each unit. The budgetary provision for this purpose this year is £2,600,000. The Menzies Government has also provided, since it came to office, £41,000,000 for the construction of new houses and the purchase of existing homes under the War Service Homes scheme. It proposes to expend £9,500,000 during the. current financial year on its own housing programme. In all, it will provide approximately £60,000,000 for the purposes of house construction during the current year. This provision is distinct from advances that are made hy the Commonwealth Bank as an instrument of the Government. Those facts provide a complete answer to the two honorahle members who complained of a lack of effort on the part of this Government in relation to housing. Let us consider now the overall economic situation in Australia to-day. Vague references to actions of the Government have been made by various honourable members opposite, but no suggestions for any specific programme to improve our circumstances have been made by them. It must be obvious to everybody that, during the first half of the criticism of the advance policy that has current financial year, a considerable change has affected the extremely buoyant conditions that existed in the business world during 1950-51. The change has been caused by various forces which have resulted in a lower level cf business activity. Perhaps one of the greatest factors in bringing about this change has been the anti-inflationary budget of this Government. The main purpose of the budget, notwithstanding side-issues, was to deal with the problem of inflation. It embodied plans to combat inflation according to both a short term programme and a long term programme. Its provisionsare well known to all of us. the honourable member for Banks has said, The short-term programme increased taxation, both direct and indirect. The long-term programme provides for a budgetary surplus and the financing of all government works from income without recourse to the use of bank credit. The short-term plan had an immediate effect, and its results are already obvious. Notwithstanding certain hardships that may have been caused, it has tended to reduce the free purchasing power of the community so that the production of various luxury goods, which previously were being distributed in large quantities at the expense of the production of essential goods, has decreased considerably. We cannot yet foresee the final result of the Government's long-term plan, but we know that it is sound economic theory to budget for a surplus. The Government acted courageously, but wisely, in deciding that all developmental works and other undertakings should beMr SSuwrtt. financed from revenue without having recourse to the issue of treasury-bills. The Government's plans are heing supplemented by the activities of the National Security Resources Board, which is continuing to function effectively in the background. I am sure that no honourable member will criticize the efficiency of the board. Capital issues control, which was operating early in 1951 as a mere formality, was applied with full effect in August, 1951. It will assist the diversion of capital from non-essential industries to essential industries, principally our basic heavy industries. It is already working relatively satisfactorily. There has been considerable been laid down by the central bank and implemented by means of committees that operate in the various States. Members of the Opposition have said that this policy has had an adverse effect, not only on non-essential industries, but also on essential industries. If that be so, the blame should not be laid at the door of the committees that I have mentioned. I have had some experience in connection with these committees recently, and I consider that they should be congratulated upon the fair way in which, they' are handling their task. If some' essential industries have been adversely affected, as involved thc fault probably lies, not with the committees, but with the way in which the industries and banks concerned have submitted their cases. Whenever the matter has been brought to their attention and it has been indicated that it is something that affects an essential industry, they have been quite willing to review the situation. When it has been found that the statement is correct, they have not only reviewed the situation but have also granted the extended credit. The statement of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) last night that the credit advance policy has been operating humanely and in the best interests of the community is bome out by the f actsi I do not think' that anybody has any complaint to make about the special accounts system that was instituted by the Banking Act of 1945 and which is still in operation. I have not yet heard any adverse comment about the sums that were paid back from the. special accounts! to the trading hanks to cover the adverse trade balance of the last six months.. With, the problem of trade balances' is. wrapped up the vexed problem of a certain recession in the textile industry, to which reference has been made' on many occasions during thisdebate. During the first, half of this financial year,, we had an adverse trade balance of £215,004,000. During that period, our imports were worth £533,672,000, and our exports were worth £31S,66S,000. That brings to' mind the problem of the imports, particularly of textiles, that have been flooding into this adverse trade balance, we must remember eountry. In order to get a true picture,, that it is borne out by statistical records it is necessary to examine certain aspects of that matter. First, a buyer resistance that has been operating in most of the western countries has commenced to operate in Australia. There has been a. surplus of these goods overseas. Shipping has been made available and the goods have been arriving, in Australia in rather large quantities, with a resultant decrease of our funds overseas. The increased tonnage was obtained during the first six months of this financial year, ancl the goods came into this country during that period. As a result, large stocks of certain goods are being held in Australia. The stocks are above the normal quantities held, and in many instances, tliat has tended immediately to reduce prices-. That reduction has been accompanied by a buyer resistance to those goods. It is obvious that there are specific reasons for that buyer resistance. it is caused by the pressure on credit resources. That is fairly obvious to all. Secondly, rising, costs of essential goods and foodstuffs have affected household budgets to such a degree that people prefer to spend the major portion of their being part of their policy, presumably in incomes upon essential pommodities and, therefore, they do not buy these imported goods. At the same time, there has been a fall in commodity prices, principally the price of wool. That has had the effect of causing people to delay making purchases of textiles. They argue that if the price of wool falls, the price of textiles will fall also, and they decide to wait until tliey can buy textiles more cheaply than at present. Those three factorshave given rise to a buyer resistance to textile goods in Australia, with theresult that the tremendous volume of goods that we have imported is still being held in stock in. Australia. The fall in wool prices has an effect upon our economy. Therefore, it must be taken into account in considering the existing economic situation. We cannot expect that the present price level will"" alter substantially during the next twelve months. We cannot visualize an increase, and probably there will be a further decrease. In considering the present situation, in which we have an that in the season after a particularly good season, imports are high. If r . SPEAKEB -Order! The honorable gentleman's time has expired. rise to support the motion of censure. The honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Swartz) has adopted the policy of making a misleading and superficial analysis of the present situationa policy that has done so much to cloud the most important issue that confronts the people to-day. Nearly every honourable gentleman opposite who has spoken in this debate has mentioned some matter of economic importance, some rule of economic science, that is quite undoubted, and has flung it in the teeth of the Opposition, presumably in the hope that the Opposition would endeavour to deny it. We can say, first, that Honourable gentlemen opposite have followed that by quoting the Avords and actions of the greatest Federal Treasurer and Pi-irne Minister that we have ever had. They have quoted the words and actions of the late Mr J. B. Chifley as the hope that we would deny them. I say most emphatically that the Opposition has no idea of doing such a thing. Honourable gentlemen opposite on a number of occasions have stated, for example, that too much money is chasing too few goods. That is a popular theme. They have said that when too much money is chasing too few goods, prices will rise, and that to prevent prices from rising the supply of goods must be. supplemented. That is very true. It cannot be denied. There is",24,Opposition Membebs Hear Hear
37,Mr Joshua (Ballarat) [4.25],"Ianother method of preventing prices from rising, but the Government has definitely i ejected it as part of its policy. It has denied that prices control can be effective, despite the fact that it was effective mills, which I have had an opportunity for a long time during the last war. The Government has definitely refused to adopt that means of controlling prices. En the words of the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Eadden), it has resolutely turned its back upon prices control. I agree that the method of supplementing the. volume of goods available on the market is a good method of preventing prices from rising, but I point out that it is useless to state a broad objective and then to fail to institute the controls that are necessary to ensure the. attainment of that objective. The post-war reconstruction training scheme is the best example of what I have in mind. In the change from a period of war to a period of peace, it was necessary to have a plan and a broad objective, but it was necessary also to have control of all the men and women who were leaving the Services in order to ensure that each individual could be fitted into the economy of the country in a suitable manner. That was done most effectively. That is an example of the kind of control that is absolutely necessary for the attainment of a particular objective. Labour governments always instituted such controls. It was part of their policy to do so. They were backed by Cabinets which had the administrative ability to administer thc controls. The record of Labour in that connection is without parallel. The policy of the present Government is opposed to controls and because the Government has set itself out to abolish controls it has failed. For that reason, I support the motion of censure. The problem of controls needs to be is indicative of the difficulty that manuexamined if we are to offer constructive facturers are facing in trying to retain criticism. Menzies), the honourable member for a great deal of unemployment has Darling Downs, ancl the honourable occurred. member for Henty( Mr Gullett) asked what the Opposition proposed should be clone in order to set matters to rigbts. We the textile industry as at the 16th should look very carefully into conditions January the Prime Minister thought in the textile industry in this country to that he was up-to-date. day. I am obliged to the honourable memthe honourable member for Darling ber for Darling Downs for raising Downs has cited figures as at the the subject, and to other honourable mem26th January, but even those figures Mr Joshua. bers who have referred to it during the debate. In the Division of Ballarat there are half a dozen big textilemills and a number of smaller knitting to see working. Until a few months ago they were proceeding merrily. However, the position is vastly different to-day. In their stores are enormous stacks of manufactured goods awaiting sale. They have been there for some time, and the quantities are much larger than those normally carried. The quantity of worsted yarns on hand is 224 per cent, greater than the quantity usually carried, while the stock of woollen and worsted piecegoods on hand is 172 per cent, greater than the quantity usually held. The stock of mantles and costumes held is 190 per cent, greater than usual. Many other items also are heavily overstocked in mill stores. The mills are unable to sell their, goods. There are very depressing sights in the workshops and mills. Many spindles are motionless, and dozens of looms are silent. A large amount of expensive machinery is lying idle, and many people are unemployed. In a number of instances the mills have almost closed down. It is undeniable that within several months this prosperous industry has deteriorated into a state of collapse, and has great piles of manufactured goods on the shelves awaiting sale. It is a most depressing and desperate situation. Only a few highly skilled tradesmen have been retained in employment. In one mill sixteen mill tuners are now employed as weavers, in order to retain their services. Three of their most experienced mill hands have been given berths to New Zealand and have accepted good jobs in that country. This The Prime Minister( Mr their staff in the industry. In many mills In citing unemployment figures in However, are not conclusive, because of the rapidity seen. Some of their products were sent with which the situation is deteriorating. The downward movement which commenced some months ago is .gathering momentum. I have before me reliable figures which show that in a normal pay week the mills employed 19,271 personnel. In the pay week ended the 26th January only 15,295 persons were employed in the mills. That means that almost 4,000 textile workers are now unemployed. out of work. available that they have all been absorbed in other industries. occupied positions in the mills because the work was complementary to the main industry carried on in the district. Many of them have now returned to home duties because employment in the mills is not available for them. Many of the men who have lost their employment in the mills are seeking employment elsewhere so tliat they will be under cover for the winter. I understand that 30 men who were dismissed from one mill were offered employment by the Government in the motor trade at Geelong. I have yet to learn that the motor industry is more essential than the textile industry to the Australian community. We need to have a very deep and penetrating look into the Australian textile industry in order to obtain a clear view of it. This industry was established in Australia over SO years ago and is very efficient. It has grown as the population of this country has increased. The mills are equipped with good machinery and their staffs have been well trained. This training has involved an expenditure of thousands of pounds. As the population of Australia has increased so has additional machinery been installed and output increased. Not at any time previously have the mills produced greater quantities of goods for the Australian market than that market could absorb. The expansion of the industry has kept pace with the increase of population, which, I think, has been a very wise and sound policy. The quality of the Australian textiles is second to none in the world. At one mill I was shown the most beautiful cloths that I have ever to the United States of America, which has the most competitive and selective market in the world. They were accepted readily and sold, and so earned dollars for us. Further evidence of the quality of the Australian textiles and the efficiency of the Australian textile industry generally is contained in the Tariff Board's Beport on Woven Upholstery and Woven Furnishing Fabrics of the 15th November, 1951. An interesting experiment was carried out by the Tariff Board. It sent 35 pieces of Australian cloth to England to be examined and priced, and at the same time obtained samples from Many females the English manufacturers, in order to establish the cost of manufacturing them in Australia. The results were most interesting. Twenty-five of the samples sent to Great Britain were priced more cheaply in Australia than in that country. If we assess the .advantages shown by the goods produced more cheaply in England, and also the advantages shown by similar goods made in Australia, we find that it results in 72 points in favour of Australian goods compared with 17 points for goods of British manufacture. Of 26 pieces of cloth obtained from Great Britain and shown to the Australian manufacturers, eleven could be produced more cheaply in this country than in Great Britain. That country could manufacture fifteen slightly cheaper than could the Australian manufacturers. If we apply the same test to these goods it will be found that the Australian goods earned 3S points compared with 34 points for goods of British manufacture. Those figures speak for themselves and demonstrate the efficiency of the Australian textile industry. The fact that Australian products sold readily in the United States of America, on the most competitive market in the world, shows conclusively that there is nothing wrong with Australian workmanship. The Australian textile industry has not beeu over-extended. It does not produce an inferior article, or manufacture at a. high cost. It is an efficient industry which supplied Australia's requirements of uniforms, blankets and clothing for the fighting forces during the last war as no other country could have done and also helped to meet the requirements of our",27,Opposition Membebs Hear Hear

The introduced the subject of defence into the debate. The Government's policy of ruining this magnificent industry, which v/as so valuable to us in war time, is deserving of censure. ment ruining the industry? As I have said, the Government was prepared to supplement the supply of goods by imports. That was its declared policy. It was set out in the Melbourne Argus of the 31st January last, in an article which read in partThe Governnient has deliberately framed its a lot to say about people who talk about policy to stimulate imports as a counter to inflation. The Government is using its London funds, of between £300m. and £400m., to achieve this. much could be done to put the textile But the Government has no control over the position. It has not thoroughly examined the state of our local industries. Instead, it has applied a broad policy to achieve a broad objective, without first having examined closely the condition of established Australian industries. Its measures for increasing the supply of goods has led to the importation of millions upon millions of pounds' worth of textiles which is destroying our Australian textile industry. At present warebouses have an enormous quantity of textile goods from overseas that they recklessly ordered at a time when supply was difficult. They made their orders for ""delivery at earliest"" because at the time there was a great deal of talk about slow turn-round of overseas ships. But the shippers in the United Kingdom discovered tliat the shipping shortage was not as great as had been believed, and found 22 ships within the space of a few months to bring textiles to Australia. Those ships unloaded on to the unsuspecting merchants of Australia enormous quantities of textile goods which are now lying on the shelves of retailers and in the warehouses. Naturally the retail trade is refusing to buy Australian textile goods while it still has the imported goods on its hands. The House will agree with me that people who recklessly order enormous quantities of goods that are more than suflicient to fill market requirements should have their fingers burnt and pay for their folly. There is no reason why the employees in the textile industry, or for that matter the mill managers and shareholders, should suffer as the result of a reckless policy of importation. The wrong people are suffering for a policy of reckless importation, which has been encouraged by the Government. For that reason the Government should be censured. There is no doubt that this matter could easily be adjusted by the restoration of confidence in the textile industry and the country as a whole. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) had losing confidence and so creating the conditions conductive to depression. But he has not done anything about bolstering the people's confidence. It is obvious that industry into good order. The Government could place orders for materials and so keep the people in employment. It could also extend credit to enable millers to buy yarn for the workers to process. A credit policy should be used to restart languishing industries and the textile industry is now badly in need of restarting. In addition, the Government should prevent all further imports of woollen textiles and of all textiles which can be made efficiently in Australia, until such time as our Australian industry has been re-established. I support the motion. was interesting to hear the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Joshua) drag out the old story about prices control. I find it extraordinary that members of the Labour party cannot seem to remember that the Chifley Government submitted the matter of prices control to a referendum of the people, and that its proposals were overwhelmingly defeated. The people obviously do not want prices control, and, in any event, prices control is not the answer to the present situation. The motion before the House, pandering as it does to the most irresponsible elements of the community, reeks of hypocrisy. It is partisan in the extreme, and is",29,Opposition Membebs Hear Hear

Its distortions are numerous and are typical of the tactics that were employed in the campaign during the recent referendum on communism. I suggest that the only eulogy that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) will receive for his presentation of his case will probably be another honourable mention on Moscow radio. The motion is sheer political expediency, and all honourable members on this side of the House and, indeed, most of the people of Australia, are aware of the fact. Both in 1949 and in 1951 the people were informed of the nation's most urgent requirements. I refer, of course, to defence requirements and .counter-inflationary measures. The people were warned in the Prime Minister's policy speech of 1951 that they would be required to accept their obligations. I shall refer to the relevant part of that speech, which readsApart from increasing supplies by increased local production and importation, there are financial measures designed to lessen the pressure of demand upon limited resources. We have already put several such into operation. We have re-instituted capital issues control largely to discourage enterprises which are not adequately related to the vita l needs of the countiy. The Commonwealth Bank has given directions whicli will make the provisions of bank credit more selective. I have read that statement to the House in order to stress the fact that the Government's policy is not a bolt from the blue. The people knew that we had a definite programme, and it is that programme that we are carrying out. The speech continuedIn the new Parliament we w ill bring down a. Defence Preparations B ill to institute sucli needed controls as may be thought to be within the limits of the Commonwealth Constitution. We do not propose to rush into controls; we have an instinctive dislike of them. It is obvious to any thoughtful person that some controls have become necessary. I have referred to those passages in order to remind members of the Opposition that we are merly carrying out the policy on which we were elected to office. The speech continuedWe have, as a nation, pursued a policy of increasing costs by reducing the working week, by restrictive practices, by too much inefficiency, by hot competition in wages by vastly increased social services. I do not say that these are a l l bad things; some of them, on the contrary, are very good. But if we want them, we must pay for tliem. We cannot have our cake and eat it too. The passages from the Prime Minister's policy speech that I have read dispose adequately of the Opposition's contention that the Government's financial policy has been developed since we came into office. Does the Leader of the Opposition expect that the patriotism and realism of the Australian people will prove to be so low that they will not respond to the necessary call for everybody to play their parts in defeating the inflationary cycle? I have considerably more faith than he has in the good sense and willingness of the people to combat the present inflationary condition. The Leader of the Opposition referred at length to the subject of increased taxation and mentioned several reductions that the Chifley Government had made during its term of office. I should think it would have made reductions considering that it had the doubtful honour of having inflicted on the people the highest taxation ever known in this country. Of course, during that government's term of oflice Australia passed through a major war; but for a considerable time in the post-war period it failed to make substantial reductions of taxation rates. Under the Chifley regime a taxpayer with two dependants and a taxable income of £400 a year paid income tax of £53. At present he pays £5 3s. A taxpayer with a taxable income of £500 a year paid income tax of £88 under the Chifley regime while at the present time he pays only £14. A man with a taxable income of £800 a year used to pay £207 in income tax as compared with £60 at present. A man with a taxable income of £1,000 a year paid £293 compared with the £103 payable under this Government's taxation rates. The present rates of taxation in Australia are still considerably below the rates applicable in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. If the Government had failed to take the necessary anti-inflationary measures there would have been cause to complain but its desired effect. It is true that in certain circumstances it is causing some temporary hardship but this nation can take a little hardship. If it could not it would not be worthy of its araditipns. It was extraordinary to observe the Leader of the Opposition in the role of champion of the private banks. He must know that credit restriction is designed to prevent people from livin g beyond their means. He claimed that there is substantial unemployment in Australia and made great play on the word "" disemployment "". In the circumstances, "" disemployment"" is the correct term to use because there is no real need for unemployment. The Commonwealth Employment Service has thousands of vacant jobs on its register and nobody need be unemployed. Admittedly, we are passing through a temporary transition period during which a small percentage of people may become temporarily disemployed, but this w ill soon right itself. Several suggested ing for a depression The Leader of the Opposition to conditions in New South Wales. visited Pork Kembla went those of the Nebo coal mine owned by Broken Limited, Limited, Limited, Limited, and at each place I found that there was a great shortage of labour.

Kehwicls. there are healthy signs that indication of their confidence in the financial policy is having the future of Australia so let us hear no more nonsense about a depression. Australia has a limited labour force which is not sufficient to cope w it h its development. Would honourable members opposite suggest that in these circumstances non-essential industries should enjoy priorities equal to or higher than those enjoyed by essential industries? Of course not! Because of the Curtin-Chifley Government's policy of over-boosting secondary industry, Australia is faced w it h an acute food production problem. There is considerable imbalance between primary and secondary industry and, as a result, essential labour has been enticed away from country to city areas. The present policy of the Government was described by the Opposition as economic conscription. 1 f a i l to see that that term can be applied appropriately to the Government's policy. In any case, it is extraordinary to hear Opposition members accusing the Government of practising conscription of any character in view of the fact that their Opposition members have late leader, Mr J. B . Chifley, openly that the country is headadvocated the direction of labour and or a recession. said that, if necessary, he would transfer referred whole communities to various sites as I that was demanded by the labour last week and position.

45,Mr Kekwick,"It bas been most illuminating to bear every speaker on the Government side, from the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) down, extol economic control and suggest that the Opposition, which has advocated economic control in the past, is now opposed to it. The Labour party stands where it has always stood. We say that if economic justice is to be done to the great majority of the people there must be economic planning and a direction of resources. The important consideration is how those controls are to be exercised, by whom, and principally over whom. The subject matter of our motion is an accumulation of the ills of the last two years during which this Government has been in office. The Government assumed office in December, 1949, and perhaps it would be constructive in a debate such as this to recapithat period of relaxation that was tulate some of the promises which houorable memhers on the Government side have made in the past. These promises are conveniently summarized in an article written by Peter Davies entitled ""Inflation in Australia "" published in theSeptember, 1951 issue of the English magazine The Banker, in which Mr Davies gave a broad view of the picture of inflation and hoAv it affects various sections of the people. This Governinent came into office as the result of a lot of promises and because the preceding Labour government had had to do many things that were unpopular. Any government has to do unpopular things in these days. During the general election campaign in 1949 dishonest promises were made by the present Government parties. The Government now alleges that the Opposition is criticizing its policy, but is offering no alternative. The Opposition is entitled to criticize the policy of the Government because that is its function. The Government is entitled to govern, and we are entitled to be critical of what is done, particularly when it hurts the sections of the people that we represent.' It seems that, as always in times of economic crisis, or disemployment, the first section to be affected is that composed of the working people. There has been much talk about economic correctives, but little attention has been given to the individuals who are primarily affected by economic dislocation. I shall attempt .to show that the Government has not acted justly since October, 1950. As far back as that date, the Prime Minister called a conference to discuss economic ills and he then promised that his Government would take certain economic measures. Those measures included control over new capital issues. It is rather amusing to hear defence of capital issues coming from honourable members on the Government side because they removed that necessary economic control. Most of the damage to the economy that is now being felt was done during the period when those controls were not operative and many of the problems that are now facing the country are an accumulation that has arisen from sponsored by the Government. By October, 1950, when the Government had been in office for ten months, the position was so desperate that something bad to be done and a conference of experts tvas called. The Prime Minister then made certain promises which included control over capital issues, a substantial cut in publicworks expenditure, an increase of indirect taxation, a production drive, a savings campaign, economies in government administrative expenditure, closer supervision over bank lending, an excess profits tax and prepayment of income tax by wool-growers. Because certain interests were affected by those proposals, nothing was done and the position deteriorated until the following year. In August, 1951, a further conference was held in Sydney. At that conference the Prime Minister called for a review of all public works programmes so that labour could be diverted to the basic industries, a reduction of private lending, restriction of hire-purchase credit and control over new capital issues. For the most part, the economic faults that the Government deemed to be needing attention in October, 1950, still awaited attention in August, 1951. Now the sins of the Government have caught up with it and drastic controls are being suddenly imposed. Because the Government is applying controls so drastically and haphazardly, intense dislocation is being",33,Opposition Membebs Hear Hear
46,Mr Cke&N (Melbourne Ports) [5.5].,"caused to the economic system. That system .is extremely sensitive. It is not something with which anybody can play ducks and drakes. is carefully geared and there is not much mobility in it. Without labour there can be no production, and labour has not much mobility either. Workers cannot be taken out of the textile industry aud put into the machine tool industry because they have not the capacity or the training for the work. Neither can the capital equipment which is involved in tlie textile industry be removed to another factory. Last night the Prime Minister said that the Opposition had made much of the effect of credit control restrictions when, in effect, there has been an expansion of bank credit over the last six or eight months. That is perfectly true. Bank credit has been expanded rapidly during the period that this Government has been in office. Because of that overrapid expansion and the failure of the Government to deal with economic problems at an early stage, the impact of the Government's actions is having the marked effect on the community that is now evident. The inconsistency of the Government is shown by the way in which it has asserted, on one hand, that it is using the brake on credit while, on the other hand, it is expanding the volume of money in the community. In the issue of the Australian Financial Review dated the 14th February, 1952, a writer directed attention to that fact and statedIncome inflation has heen given a big fillip by the huge increase of £115,000,000 in there is a difference between the rate a.t Treasury Bills in the three montlis to the end which wages rise and the. rate at which of January. Treasury-bills are short-term loans from the banking system to the Government to community do not receive increases in tide it over a period when its estimated their incomes. They include pensioners revenue has not been received but it has and those on fixed incomes. Every rise expenditure to meet. The effect of of prices inflicts more economic hardship treasury-bills is to expand the amount of on them. For most of the community money in the community. When the wages are not increased until prices rise budget was presented to tie Parliament, because of the system of wage adjustthe Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) said ments. Immediately a wage increase is that there would be no further recourse granted, a new set of price increases by the Government to treasury-bills. The begins to take place, and the income of Government planned a surplus and by the wage-earner is always behind. Honorthat means purchasing power was to be able members on the Government side' drawn from the community. The budget suggest that all economic evils in the surplus was to be £114,500,000. Already, in the three months since the budget was presented, there has been an expansion It of money in the community by the Government by the issue of £115,000,000 of new treasury-bills. That shows the inconsistency of the Government. It is being heavy-handed in the case of one or two vulnerable industries and happy-handed with its own expenditure. The writer in the Australian Financial Review to whom I have already referred asked why an expansion of £115,000,000 in treasury-bills was necessary. He accounted for £25,000,000 by pointing to the difference between revenue and expenditure in the relevant period. Expenditure had exceeded revenue by that amount. Of. the remaining £90,000,000, £45,000,000 was covered by another of the financial frauds that have been perpetrated by this Government. That was the repayment of the £45,000,000 that was collected hy the 1\ per cent, levy on the wool-growers. As honourable members on this side of the House have already pointed out, the Treasurer's budgets are simply financial camouflage. He covers up to-day with an expected surplus to-morrow. When to-morrow comes he has to perform some other feat of legerdemain to get himself out of the immediate difficulty. The problem which faces the community and which this Government has failed to meet is the problem of inflation. Inflation would not matter much in the community if everybody's income rose as much as prices increased, but because prices increase, tensions have arisen in the community. Certain sections of the community are due to the vicious wagesprices spiral. The reverse -is the case because it is a prices-wages spiral, but again that is not the whole truth. Statistics show that most of the increase of money is going not to the wage-earning section the community, but to other sections. Certain people have been chided for quoting statistics, and I know that unless care is exercised the quoting of statistics English grey blankets may be bought for may be abused. However, the figures which I propose to cite are significant. They are taken from the ISth report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission dated 1951. The publication contains many carefully compiled tables which are called economic indicators. At page 21 of the report are certain statistics about the operation of banks. In Australia there are about 7,000,000 savings bank depositors, so that almost every man, woman and child in Australia has a savings bank account. In 1946, savings bank deposits totalled £663,600,000. We now come to the deposits in the trading banks. Of course, not every one has an account in a trading bank. Trading bank depositors probably number about one in every five of the population. In June, 1946, deposits in trading banks amounted to £627,000,000, a figure not so very different from the amount of savings bank deposits. However, by the end of June, 1951, savings bank deposits had increased to only £837,000,000, whereas deposits in trading banks had increased to £1,237,000,000. That seems to indicate that the accumulations of those who earn profits and put money aside in reserves increased far more rapidly than did the savings of the wage earners. For the wage-earner, his weekly pay envelope is the most important single economic factor in his life. With his wages he buys all the goods and services that he requires for himself and his family. When he loses his job, as many textile workers have lost their jobs recently, his income disappears. If he is out of work for four or five weeks he may have to expend his total savings of £50 or so in order to carry on. The (dislocation which has been brought about by the haphazard application of the -Government's credit policy is causing Mr Crean. tensions within the community. I quote the following from the Warrnambool Standard of the 9th February, 1952:The enormous increase iu imports of cheap textile goods to Australia during the past year has resulted in the putting off of approximately 30 men and a reduction of working hours at the Warrnambool Woollen Mill. On the preceding page there is an advertisement that states that all-wool 69s. l i d . a pair. Thus, while textile workers are being thrown out of employment, large quantities of textile goods are being brought into Australia. I do not say that there is anything wrong in importing English blankets, but there is certainly something wrong when people are losing their jobs because the product they make cannot be sold, whilst, at the same time, similar products are being imported from 13,000 miles away and sold in Australia. The present situation could very well give rise to antagonism between Australians who have been thrown out of work and the people of those countries from which goods are being imported, whether it be Great Britain or Japan or any other country. The Government has not indicated whether it believes the textile industry to be more or less important than some others to which, presumably, it hopes to divert labour. It is easy to use such terms as "" essential"" and "" non-essential "", but we should consider the individual worker or employer who is concealed behind the fagade of words. The effects of economic dislocation are felt most severely by the workers because they are least able to defend themselves. We on this side of the chamber are the defenders of the Australian standard of living. We stand for a policy of full employment. The Labour party is supporting this motion of censure because it believes that the Government has failed to do the job that it was put in power to do. It is not administering the country in the interests of the community as a whole. The Government has instituted a system of selective credit control under which private bankers will be empowered to choose between the big business and the small one, ancl to decide which shall he allowed to survive. If a banker has to decide whether A or B is to obtain an overdraft he will naturally favour the undertaking which is likely to be the better customer, and if A is a small business and B a big one it is almost certain that B will obtain the overdraft. If the choice is between the small corner store and the big department store, the small store will go to the wall. When the Chifley Government was in power banking legislation was passed the purpose of which was to protect the economy of the country. Now, the way in which that legislation is being administered by the recently appointed Commonwealth Bank Board threatens to destroy the standards which were so painfully built up during the years with the help of Labour governments. debate on the motion of censure directed against the Government's economic policy might have been of real value. Many people are worried and confused over the state of our economy to-day, and they might have been helped to a proper understanding of it had not the Opposition chosen to make of the debate a political slanging match. The attack on the Government will fail and the debate, so far as contributions from members of the Opposition are concerned, will not serve to throw any light on the situation. It may be of some help if a member who claims no special economic knowledge states in simple terms the position as he sees it, which is what I propose to do. When the present Government came into office an economic situation of great gravity existed. There were shortages of labour and of raw materials. Imports from overseas were not obtainable in sufficient quantities and there was, consequently, a serious shortage of goods for consumption. This was accompanied by a very heaA'y demand for goods. The release of vast savings that had been bottled up during the war, together with a very high national income from exports caused a great demand for consumer goods. These are exactly the conditions in which inflathey are discovered only by experience.. tion occurs. They were aggravated by a wage-fixing system, which is not in any way related to productivity; by the state of our basic industries-the deplorable and chaotic condition of the coal industry which in turn affected the steel industry so that it was working at only about 60 per cent, of its capacityby inefficiencies and bottlenecks in our transport system, of which the conditions on the waterfront are the most notable examples, and by the unrestrained activities of Communists in our industries. That state of affairs was bad enough in itself but it was very greatly worsened Avhen on it were superimposed three other factors, each of which is itself inflationary, but each of which is necessary and unaA'oidable. The first factor was the need to rearm quickly, a responsibility which had been grossly neglected by the previous Government. I need not elaborate that point. This Government took office knowing that it had but a very short time in which to prepare against the danger of a war over which ithad no control. The second factor was the need to continue the large-scale immigration policy initiated by the previous Government. We know that every immigrant who comes to Australia means an increased demand on our capital goods, and to that extent an addition to the inflationary trend, but if we are to hold this country Ave must continue our immigration policy. The third factor whicli added greatly to our difficulties was the need for the rapid development of our national resources through water conservation and hydro-electric projects such as the Snowy Mountains Scheme, without which this country cannot continue to increase its population or prepare itself to meet the dangers that lie ahead of the democratic world. In these circumstances Avhat could have any Government have done? The ansAver is clear. It had no option but to folloAv the best economic advice available to it. This Government folloAved the accepted economic theory of our time. Economic theories vary from age to age and from decade to decade. What is believed to be right at one time is rejected at another. There areflaAvsin the best of the theories, but The Government adopted the orthodox",34,Opposition Membebs Hear Hear
47,Mr Osbobne (Evans) [5.2s],"Thismeans of dealing with inflation. It adopted precisely the same means which the Opposition would have had to adopt had it been in power. What is the accepted economic theory? It is, first, that the pressure of demand for goods shall be relieved through increased taxation and credit restrictions and, secondly, that our very limited resources of raw materials, labour and capital goods shall be used in the production of commodities that are essential rather than those that are non-essential. This diversion of labour and materials is achieved by capital issues control and by the limitation of bank credit in some directions and its extension in others. This afternoon the Minister for the Navy( Mr for the. economic policy of the GovernMcMahon) very logically pointed out that the Government's economic policy is a policy not of restriction but of direction. He demonstrated to the House that both capital issues and bank credit havo been greatly expanded in the last two years but that the direction of credit and capital has been altered. I have frequently heard the argument advanced that if shortage of goods is a cause of inflation, increased production of all goods should be encouraged, or, in other words, that all restrictions of capital issues and credit should be removed so that the maximum production of goods in short supply may be achieved. In short there should be a reversion to a free economy and the removal of all controls. I -believe that such a policy could have been adopted in 1946. It was adopted in the United States of America after the war with great benefit to that nation. In 1946 it would have been possible for the Ohifley Government to relax controls very considerably and to bring about a revision to a free economy, which would have given strength when the demands for rearmament came upon us. tunately that opportunity was missed. But by 1950 it was no longer possible to adopt such a policy. In the first place, the pressure of inflation was so great that it would have been possible to remove controls and revert to a free economy only at the cost of sending countless ordinary people to the wall. Secondly, there was no longer time in which to Mr Osborne. do so because reversion to a free economy would take at least two years to become effective. The Government knew well that it had very limited time in which to prepare this country against the threat of war. What could any Government have done in these circumstances except follow the course which this Government has followed? That is why the Opposition attack yesterday ancl to-day has been so ineffective. The basis of its criticism involves the acceptance of theories in which it does nqt believe. Honourable members opposite could have followed a very different course. They could have acknowledged the necessity ment and have examined its operation critically and constructively, pointing out its deficiencies. They could have made a constructive attempt to make it work. What did they do? Dishonestly and cynically they adopted the outlook of an eighteenth century Liberal and denounced as an interference with freedom everything that the Government has done. With their suggestion of depression they played on the people's fear. HadI been a textile worker forced for the time being to find another job, I should have derived no comfort from the words of Opposition speakers in this debate. My natural fears would only have been aggravated by them. HadI been a primary producer compelled to pay a very heavy bill for provisional tax, instead of being helped to understand why the country is in its present position, and why the Government has had to adopt these measures, I should have been only further confused by the statements of honourable members opposite. The Opposition has been guilty of a cynical and dishonest attempt to us tremendous arouse the fears of other people for the basest of party political motives. UnforHonorable members opposite could have examined critically the operation of this policy because, as we all know, there is room for such criticism. The times, urgent and difficult as they are, have demanded drastic remedies, and the ultimate results of some of these remedies are not yet clear to us. Many of us are naturally concerned about the present position of the textile industry. Importers' orders, delivery of which would normally have taken up to eighteen months, arrived within six months as the result of additional shipping suddenly becoming available -Consequently, importers are experiencing difficulties in meeting payments; and they will have difficulty in disposing of the. goods immediately. For this reason they have been obliged to cancel orders with Australian mills. It is obvious that for the time being the industry is in a serious position. However, its difficulties will be rapidly resolved because it will be impossible for importers to continue to import textiles at the present rate. Sufficient foreign exchange is not available for that purpose and, in any event, other factors responsible for the abnormal volume of imports recently are no longer operating. I believe that if the industry closes down to any degree the present surplus of textiles will be followed by a shortage. This oscillation of supply and demand could be dangerous. There is undoubtedly cause for concern. But what purpose does the Opposition serve by merely condemning the Government for its approach to the problem ? All of us realize that difficulties arise in the administration of government policy in matters of this kind. The retail trades have been experiencing a difficult period from which they are now emerging. For tlie 'time being the restriction of credit for housing has led to an alleviation of conditions in the building industry which has been accompanied by increased productivity within the last few months. However, in the not distant future orders will fall off for a period, and I hope the Government is giving attention to that possibility. If honourable members opposite were to address themselves to factors of the the people to understand clearly the kind that I have mentioned, they would make a worthwhile contribution to this debate. They could examine with profit the position in the heavy industries which must be encouraged in the interests of our defence effort. Some of those industries have for the time experienced a falling off of orders and some of them are temporarily in difliculties. Honourable members opposite should examine matters of that kind instead of ignoring the real problems that exist in this country. T51 Australia is not yet out of the wood. Inflationary pressures are still operating. At the same time, we are to a large degree dependent upon economic conditions abroad, over which we have no control and which vary widely and rapidly. There is an oscillation of supply and demand in Australia which must have serious results if the problem be not solved. It is inevitable that during the coming months many people will be inconvenienced and that some will suffer hardship. However, I believe that the Government is honestly and courageously following the only course that is open to it. I am certain that if it does not continue to do so with courage and vigour great hardship and even disaster will rapidly engulf us all. This censure motion has failed. TLe Opposition has shown itself to be unrepentant and, indeed, unaware of the large contribution that past Labour governments have made to the present state of affairs which we deplore. Honourable members opposite have trifled with and have ignored the real problems that confront us and have shown themselves to be completely incapable of understanding or dealing with them. The honourable member for Evans( Mr Osborne) has claimed that the censure motion has failed. That is a matter of opinion. The people are best qualified to judge whether the Opposition has succeeded, or failed, in presenting this motion, because in. the final analysis every phase of governmental activity directly affects them. The honourable member for Evans suggested that the Opposition should deal with the substance of the motion in simple terms in order to help issues that are involved. However, he merely indulged in economic shibboleths and dealt with matters that were not related to those embodied in the motion. The motion is drafted in simple terms and the primary issue that it raises is equally simple. Has the Government carried out the promises that it made to the people? Hasi t done certain things which in themselves have caused an uplift of the standard of living in the community? Has it kept its promises with",37,Woollen Mill Reduces Staff Hours
48,Mr Cremean (Hoddle) [5.45],"respect to full employment ? Has it put value back into tbe £1 ? If any Government supporter can answer any of tbose questions in tbe affirmative, bis imagination is greater than his knowledge of practical affairs. The acid test in this matter is whether the Government has justified its existence. Is it carrying out its job? My colleagues and I rightly contend that it has failed most abjectly. The people, who will eventually be called upon to pass judgment upon it, will confirm that opinion in no uncertain terms. The honourable member for Evans said that the Opposition's attack upon the Government had been ineffective. Honourable members on this side have confined their remarks to the motion before the Chair. Unlike supporters of the Government we bave not wandered on by-paths economic theories. general election the Government parties promised, first and foremost, that they would restore economic equilibrium in this country. To use their own expression, with which we are now all too familiar, they promised to put value back into the £1. Let us look at their sorry record. Has the Government honoured its promise to put value back into the £1? In this matter I shall rely upon opinions expressed not in Labour quarters, but in a document that was issued recently by the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures. points out that whereas in 1949 the value of the £l was 13s. 2d. and the basic wage was 125s., the basic wage to-day has increased to 210s. but the value of the £1 has decreased to 7s. 8d. That is what concerns the people. When this subject is discussed, they do not wish to be diverted by the shibboleths that have been mouthed so frequently by Government supporters during this debate. They are alarmed about the reduced purchasing power of their Pensioners are anxiously what necessaries of life their miserable weekly moiety will buy. People who are in receipt of fixed incomes are asking-and they have not yet received a reply-what the Government is doing to restore value to the £1. During this debate, honourable members have failed even to touch upon those vital points. ilr. Cremean. Credit restrictions and the tariff policy are causing a series of diversions and recessions that will affect the productivity of the country, and strike a blow at full employment. The honourable member for Burke( Mr Peters) and the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) have referred to the serious position that has developed in the textile trade. Even at the risk of indulging in repetition, I propose to support their remarks, because the Government's policy of credit restriction is causing a depression in that industry. But before I present figures in relation to this subject, I point out that the effect of governmental policy was felt in the textile trade even before December, 1951. Indeed, monthly production totals in certain fundamental sections of it show a marked decline, and expounded outmoded which is attributable to the reduction of During the last labour in many departments of that particularly important industry. For instance, the monthly production of towels and towelling decreased from 171,000 square yards in October, 1950, to 98,000 square yards in December, 1951. The output of ducks, drills and jeans, which are an important product of the textile trade, diminished in the same period from 1,434,000 square yards to 1,228,000 square yards. The production of woven cloth, in the manufacture of which Australia's staple product;-wool is used, decreased from 9,670,000 square The document yards in the October-December quarter of 1950, to 8,140,000 square yards in the corresponding quarter of 1951. The speech of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) was a curious mixture of vituperation, insult, and evasion. He studiously avoided the word ""unemployment"", and referred to workers who have been dismissed from the textile industry as the result of the Government's credit restriction policy as money. "" disemployed persons "". That is a new calculating term in the language of working people, who have always considered that a man or woman who has no job is unemployed. The Prime Minister stated that disemployed members of the textile industry were, being absorbed in more essentia] industries. Therefore, the House will be interested in a series of figures supplied to me by a competent authority in the textile trade. One textile mill in northern Tasmania has been compelled, as a result of the Government's credit restriction policy, to reduce the number of its employees from 34 to 17. The right honourable gentleman doubtless describes the dismissed hands as disemployed persons, but he may be astonished to learn that they have not obtained employment in essential industries that are engaged upon defence work. Five women returned to their homes and three went into domestic service. Two males went to the mainland in search of work; another retired; one went to assist on a 'bus route; one found employment in a boot factory, one in a paper mill, one in a brewery, one in the retail trade, and one as a "" useful"" in an hotel. Not one of those seventeen so-called disemployed persons found a position in an essential industry. so? The contention advanced by members that disemployed persons will eventually find positions in essential industries is not supported by facts. The textile trade is decentralized, and many mills have been compelled to reduce their operations to one shift daily. When I was in Goulburn recently, I happened to be talking to the manager of a textile mill, and I asked him for information about the occupations in which disemployed mill hands had found jobs. He replied that some of them were employed in the railway refreshment rooms, some had gone to work on farms and others had drifted to already overcrowded Sydney. The policy of this Government is producing those results. The textile trade means a great deal to Australia. The root cause of the slump in that industry has not been lack of efficiency in the trade itself, but is most aptly described in the submission of a deputation from the trade that recently waited upon the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator O'Sullivan)We do feel, however, that the credit restricemployees displaced from what the Gotions introduced hy the Government last year vernment considers to be non-essential as a counter to inflation are one of the main contributory causes to unemployment in the industries have been re-employed in industry.

The resnlt was that not only manufacreduced by 18 per cent, in Victoria, South turers but also the trading community was Australia and Tasmania in the last six knocked completely off-balance and had no opportunity to introduce counter organizations. The effect of the Government's policy is evident. Men and women who have been working in textile mills are now disemployed. During the economic depression of the early 1930's, they would have been called "" unemployed "", but the Prime Minister described them as "" disemployed "". The Government consoles itself with the thought that those men and women will eventually find jobs in essential industries. That view is immediately disproved by the facts. I propose to cite examples of what is happening in the woollen and worsted section of the textile trade in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. My information relates to 41 factories in those States. The total number of persons employed in that section of the trade in Victoria at the 30th June, 1951, was 11,567. By the 14th December of the same year, the number had diminished to 9,562. The figures for South Australia for the corresponding period are 868 and 644 respectively, and for Tasmania, 1,577 and 3,307 respectively. Sitting suspended from. 6 to 8 p.m. this Government's policy has done nothing to restore economic stability. One of the main planks of the platform of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party at the 1949 and 1951 elections was the promise to restore the purchasing power of the £1. The Government has failed signally and dismally to do tliat. Statistics show unmistakably that the value of the £1, far from increasing, has deteriorated to a record low level. The Government's credit restriction policy has caused unemployment in industries which provide a living for large numbers of Australians. It is all very well for the Prime Minister to speak glibly and oratorically about the "" disemployment *' and subsequent re-employment of labour.

I come now to a statement that was made during tbe debate this afternoon by a bright young member of the Liberal party-the party that was to resuscitate this country and whose members were to be distinguished by their erudition, diligence, and knowledge of things political. I refer to the honourable member for Paterson( Mr Fairhall), who, in the course of his inspired remarks, claimed 710,262 lb. In other words, due to this that conditions in industry to-day, includGovernment's customs tariff policy and ing the go-slow policy and under-production, were a legacy of the cost-plus system tiles have increased threefold. As a conwhich had been introduced by the Labour Government during the war years. With the greatest humility I point out to the honourable member that the cost-plus system Avas introduced in 1939, when the party of which he is such a supine follower was in office under the leadership and they feel their position just as much of the present Prime Minister( M i . Menzies). So great were the abuses of that system by members of the employing class, who, of course, are the handmaidens of the Liberal party ancl the Australian Oountry party, that a parliamentary committee known as the War Expenditure Committee was appointed to make investigations. This so frightened one organization in Sydney which was engaged in war contracts that it immediately refunded £160,000 to the Government. I repeat that the cost-plus system was introduced not by a Labour government, but by an anti-Labour administration.

54,Mr Mcewen (Murray,"Minister forwhich is the alternative to the present Government takes such a course and promotes a debate upon Australia's economic problems, it is incumbent upon that party to produce a constructive alternative policy to that which it is attacking. The Opposition has notably failed to do 30. Had the censure motion been designed to provide an opportunity for the ventilation of the grievances of tbe textile industry, this debate would have been on its proper basis. Labour's case, in this debate has rested entirely upon those grievances. It is clear that the Opposition is seeking merely to board the escalator of public irritation by exploiting the troubles of particular sections of the community, notably the textile industry. It is trying to gain a little kudos for itself. Surely the responsibility of the Labour party is higher than that! Its conduct has revealed that it is engaging in pure party politics. On second thoughts I withdraw the word "" pure "". It is trading on the troubles and the irritations of sections of the people and it has disclosed its lack of good faith by failing to come forward with a constructive policy to replace that which it is attacking. It is bankrupt of ideas. There is a serious economic problem of course, and the combined wisdom of all of us is needed if it is to be solved. But we have had no contribution to its solution from the Opposition. This problem is expressed in high prices and shortages of goods, which cause a progressive shrinking of the purchasing power of the public. Our difficulties were aggravated by the situation in which the Labour party left the affairs of the country when it went out of office. I shall not argue that all of our problems are the outcome of Labour's administration. In fact, later I shall enumerate various circumstances for which neither the Labour party nor the parties that are represented on this side of the House have any responsibility but which have an important bearing upon our general economic problem. That problem was seriously aggravated by the emphasis that the former Labour Governinent placed upon its policy for the centralization of secondary industries. Driven by its trade union masters, but nevertheless willingly, it neglected the interests of our great agricultural and food industries, encouraged a rapid capital expansion and steadfastly refused to face the need for dollar borrowing in order to aid that capital expansion. Restrictions were imposed on imports in this land where our whole economic problem arises from shortages! The Labour Government even maintained restrictions against imports from the United Kingdom and the channels of trade were freed only when this Government came to office. How does Labour answer these charges? N'o attempt has been made to do so during this debate. All that honourable members opposite can talk about is the irritation in the textile industry. The Labour Government neglected Australia's defences during its post-war term of office to such a dangerous degree that this Government has been required to concentrate much of its energy upon the rehabilitation of our defence organization. The urgency of the task of rectifying our defences has forced the Government to impose tremendous pressure upon the nation's resources of man-power and materials. In all fields of production there was an obvious lack of drive under Labour's administration. Yet concurrently an all-time record was established in the granting of easy credit facilities. All of these factors aggravated our economic condition and overshadowing the whole tragic situation was the Lahour Government's criminal neglect of the nation's food and agricultural industries. Labour's regime was characterized by prodigality of administration and the multiplication of departments and sub-departments. Tbere was also a steadfast refusal to fact the fact that industrial disturbances were eating into our economic structure and that, to an overwhelming degree, they were the outcome of Communist planning. That is why this Government inherited difficulties of the greatest magnitude. Because of Labour's maladministration, we are now confronted with a situation in which tbe purchasing power of the volume of money available in the community far exceeds the quantity of the goods and services that are available to be purchased. Reduced to its elementary form, our situation compares with that of two men at an auction who have plenty of money in their pockets and who are determined to buy the same article. Naturally, the price of that article soars. The problem is just as simple as that. Of course costs must soar when we have 8,000,000 people, seven governments, and countless instrumentalities and companies all furnished with excess money and bidding against each other for labour and materials that are in short supply! That is the substance of our economic problem, but it has been aggravated by factors that are beyond the control of any government. I ievel no accusation against the Labour party on account of those factors. There has been a carry-over into the post-war period of the tremendous injection of war-time credit that was administered to our economy in order to help to finance the most expensive war effort in history. available for expenditure because the goods that are needed are not available. The presence of that money is exerting a constant pressure on commodity shortages which is reflected in higher prices. Are we to bury our heads in the sand and refuse to recognize the fact that a 40hour week will produce fewer goods, either with men or machines,' than a 44-hour week would produce and that, consequently, prices must rise? This Government did not introduce the 40-hour week. The Labour Government did not do so either, but it sent its agents before the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration to urge its introduction. gentleman opposed to the 40-hour weekl factor that has contributed to our difficulties. The happy circumstance of f u l l employment and high profit making has resulted, as every one of us knows from personal experience, in some measure of decreased diligence on the part of employers and employees and, to that degree, in a lowering of efficiency. approach. A government could decide None of us wants to correct that reduction of efficiency by altering the circumstance of full employment, but let us face the fact that full employment contributes to the problem of higher costs. There are other factors that we cannot control. We want to buy jute, tea, rubber and oil. No Australian Government can dictate the prices of those goods. They are fixed overseas and we must pay those prices or go without jute, tea, rubber and oil. It is of no use to blame this Government for those increased costs, and I certainly do not intend to blame the Labour party for this factor in our inflationary problem. There are factors that no Australian government can deal with. To pretend otherwise will get us nowhere. The tremendous additional subtraction from our man-power and material resources as an outcome of the Korean war and the international tension that has followed it has imposed an additional inflationary pressure upon this country. Immigration is another factor, l t is only in circumstances of calamity, and only occasionally in a century, that millions of people are brought to a state Tremendous sums are still of mind in which they are willing to uproot themselves and go to the other side of the world. It is our happy opportunity in Australia to-day, availed of first by Labour, to select, from amongst those millions, hundreds of thousands of people who will add to our population. We are doing that, but we must face the fact that it is from Australian man-power and Australian resources that we first have to provide the accommodation, food, clothing and services for the new immigrants. Immigration is an element in our inflationary problem with which perhaps we could deal, but, by common national consent, we agree that it is better to suffer temporarily the consequences of immigration than to alleviate our problem to the the honourable extent that we could do so by terminating our immigration programme. I come back to the point that our problem is very largely one of the nation. Governments and governmental instrumentalities are outbidding each other for limited manpower and limited resources. If we are not content to do nothing, there are two broad approaches to the problem. There is the direct physical that if there is a shortage, some government instrumentality shall decide who shall have what is available. A government could say that if there h a shortage of men to fill all the available jobs, some government instrumentality shall say to which jobs men shall go.",42,Woollen Mill Reduces Staff Hours
55,Mr Rosevear,I s,44,Woollen Mill Reduces Staff Hours
56,Mr Mcewen,"I say that it is athat course at the last general election. Labour has not done so. Labour is silent upon that matter. I am saying that if we decide that we cannot allow the position to drift, there are only two approaches. One is the direct physical approach. We can say to the people, "" Fill in the form; get in ihe queue; get your permit; get your permission to produce "". It was the leader of the Labour party who propounded that policy. Dr. Evatt sought a constitutional amendment ter must not refer to an honourable member by name. the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) who propounded that policy. The right honourable gentleman, on a famous occasion in .1944, saidTo-day, with the enormous development of industry and industrial organization, corporate control and fmnnce, there is no longer a f u l l youths, the dairying industry should offer right in every person to choose his own vocation in life. That is the socialist speaking. That is the dictator speaking. The solution of Labour is to establish the dictator, the bureaucrat. Labour says that he will tell people what jobs they must go to and decide who shall have available goods. This Government, realizing that the permanence of bureaucracy and the possibilities of favouritism and corruption are inherent in direct controls, rejects that policy. Labour, which in ail its previous utterances has embraced that policy, to-night is silent upon it. It has never revoked the policy. The only alternative approach to the problem is flexible physical or monetary control. That is the choice of this Government. Control of that kind lends itself to the utmost flexibility. bureaucracy is permanent. It can be modified overnight in the light of experience. It can be dissolved overnight when the need for it no longer exists. T do not suggest that Labour would do nothing to attack this problem if it were in office. Labour has shown what it Avould do. It would establish the bureaucracy to deal with the problem. Tbere has heen a notable silence by Labour speakers upon all these points, about which they were so voluble when Labour was in office. The Leader of the Opposition, speaking of an acknowledged shortage of labour and touching upon the question of the transfer of labour, has said that the only way in which to encourage more essential industries is to make employment more effective by providing more attractive conditions in essential industries. What did he mean by that statement? A newspaper advertisement published by the ""Victorian Government offered youths of nineteen years of age employment with the Victorian railways at £15 a week, with overtime. There is a shortage of labour in the dairying industry. According to the recipe of the Leader of the Opposition, if we want to transfer labour to the dairying industry we must make conditions in that industry more attractive. Presumably he would suggest that if the Victorian railways are offering to pay £15 a week to nineteen-year old them £20. The recipe of the Leader of the Opposition wouid result inevitably in a doubling of the price of butter. Inherent in it is an aggravation of inflation to an unprecedented degree. This problem cannot be solved by ignoring it. We say that it sliould be solved not by direct means but by flexible, impermanent monetary policies. We say that while unrestricted finance is available to the non-essential industries and the tightest form of prices control and deterrents is imposed upon essential industries there will be a shortage of essentials. The policies that we propound are policies for encouraging essential industries by credit facilities and for not giving opportunities of easy credit to non-essential industries. Those policies are It is impermanent, whereas already achieving some result. I am quite closely connected with the fruit canning industry. For the first time in years, there is evidence of an adequacy of labour in the canneries. Is that wrong? For years past, it has been my experience to be appealed to each year by the dried fruit industry for immigrants to harvest the crop at Mildura.

65,Mr Pollard (Lalor) [8.35],"Whil epromises that were made to the electors of this country during the general election campaign by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) and the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. To-night Government supporters look miserable and dejected. They are conscious that tbey have been sadly led astray. More important, they are conscious of the fact that, two years after their having come to office, the electors of this country are completely disillusioned .and have lost faith in them. One section of the coalition Government, the Australian Country party, has sat tight throughout this debate. Only two of its supporters have addressed the House. I understand that the debate will be concluded by the closure at 11 o'clock to-night. Therefore it will .not be possible for more than one or two members of the rank and file of t.he Australian Country party to address the House. They are aware that their association with the Liberal party in the joint Government of this country has brought nothing but disaster to our great primary industries. During the last twelve months the press, in its editorial and other columns, has rightly drawn attention to the progressive decline of food production in Australia, as a result of which a serious situation has developed overseas in respect of our trade balance. According to this morning's Sydney Morning Herald, in the last eight months our overseas trade balance has diminished by more than £300,000,000 and the view is expressed that if that rate of decline is maintained we shall be in serious trouble before long. I must give credit to those members of the Liberal party who have seen fit to take their courage in their hands and offer some defence of the Government policy in connection with the serious shortage of food in Australia. Unfortunately, however, their references contained very serious inaccuracies. The honourable imember for Bass( Mr the Government, fie has charged the Kekwick) has stated that there was a progressive decline of food production in this country during the period of nine years that Labour held office prior to the advent of the present Government. I refer the honourable member to the journal of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics of October, 1951, which, at page 182, sets out statistical information in relation to primary products in this country during those years. Almost without exception, during each year in that period there was a very substantial increase of the production of almost every type of food. The fact of the matter is that the food position is now so desperate that the supporters of the Government have to rely on the broadcast of these proceedings to try to justify, in the eyes of the people, the present state of affairs. There has been a serious decline of food production since 1949. Isi t any wonder that the primary producers are apparently not exerting themselves as much as they did formerly? Many theories and reasons for that situation have been advanced. We have heard various economists state many points of view. We have been told that there is not sufficient incentive for primary producers to exert themselves and produce all that their land is capable of producing. I believe personally that there is ample incentive for them to do so, but I also believe that since this Government came to office primary producers have been so startled by the grave uncertainties about thei ifuture that they are discouraged enough to go easy and not produce to the extent to which they undoubtedly could produce. That is, of course, not the full story. It is true that great difficulties exist in connection with primary production. Let us look at the uncertainties that face primary producers and at the false promises that the Government parties made at general elections, which they have not been able to translate into effect. In the first place the primary producers have heen told in no uncertain manner, with the support of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, who in Opposition is a raging lion and in office, after he has sold out his party for a portfolio in a Liberal administration, is an apologist, what they may expect from Labour party to-night with irritating the people in respect of the various problems with which they are confronted. The parties opposite promised that if they were put into office they would give the wheat-growers a very rich incentive indeed to produce more. They said, "" If we become the Government we shall make up to you, the wheat-growers, in respect of stock-feed wheat sold in Australia, the difference between the home-consumption price, or the found cost of production, and the export parity price. The amount of stock-feed wheat consumed in Australia is between 35,000,000 and 40,000,000 bushels a year. in the policy speech. other side of the House says that it was not stated in the policy speech. Let him read the Prime Minister's policy speech, because what I have said is there stated clearly and unequivocally. It was, in my opinion, a stupid promise, and obviously I am not canvassing for votes when I say so. The Labour party did not copy that promise or attempt to outbid it. But, stupid though it was, that promise led the wheat growers to believe that the parties now in office would give them something. Two years and three months after that promise was made it ha.3 not been honoured. In substitution thereof we have the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture using coercive tactics against the State governments by saying to them. "" If you will increase the price of stockthat ratification when he was in opposifeed wheat to the stock feeders by 2s. a bushel we shall give the wheat-growers a bounty of 4s. Id. a bushel from the Consolidated Revenue Eund "". A partial performance of the Government's promise, but conditional on its being able to coerce the States! The payment of 2s. a bushel would, of course, raise the price of bacon, eggs, milk and butter. ber supported that proposal. ber for Riverina( Mr Roberton) can have a "" go "" afterwards. I supported the proposal because I wanted the wheat growers to receive a bounty of 4s. Id. a bushel. Riverina is very articulate on this matter. It is quite true that in the circumstances we supported the proposal to provide a payment of 4s. Id. a bushel, but we did not support the proposal to increase the price of feed wheat supplied to stock feeders by 2s. a bushel, because no legislation concerning it came before this Parliament. What happened ultimately was that because of the impossible situation caused by the Government's evasion of its responsibilities, one State government left the growers in the lurch. The Government of Western Australia refused to enact legislation to increase the price of wheat for stock feed by 2s. a bushel, with the result that for the. first time in the history of wheat stabilization as a post-war policy we have a crack in the plan and the impossible situation that in all the States except Western Australia 12s. a bushel is paid for stock-feed wheat whilst in Western Australia the price is 10s. a bushel. I do not know whether the Government is even paying the bounty in all States, including Western Australia, or whether, by virtue of the failure of one State to enact legislation to increase the price, the whole plan has broken down so that the wheat-growers are not even receiving the 4s. Id. a bushel. That is one thing that has led to the disillusionment of the wheat-growers, but let us look at the matter from another angle. Everybody knows that a Labour government ratified the International Wheat Agreement. In his criticism of tion the honourable member who is now Minister for Commerce and Agriculture pointed out that there was no method by which the International Wheat Agreement could be made legally enforceable on the parties to it. That was perfectly true, but it has eventuated during the three years of the agreement that the signatories to it have faithfully honoured their obligations, and undoubtedly will continue to do so. TJnder these circumstances there no longer remains any need for the Australian Government, under the control of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, to withhold repayment to wheat-growers of the contribution tax of 2s. 2d. a bushel on the respective pools The honourable member for that was collected from them to be held temporarily by the Commonwealth. The unnecessary and unjust withholding of that repayment has caused dissatisfaction among growers.",46,Woollen Mill Reduces Staff Hours

69,Mr Pollard,"The honourable memI turn now to the subject of wool sales. Everybody knows that Labour governments were responsible for the participation of Australia in the great Joint Organization scheme, and also that, due to fortuitous world circumstances, the wool purchased by the Curtin and Chifley Labour Governments, which placed an obligation of £50,000,000 on the taxpayers, was ultimately sold at a profit of £84,000,000 or £85,000,000. Everybody also knows that the Curtin and Chifley Governments promised the wool growers that these profits would go to them. Every wool-grower knows that to all intents and purposes the whole scheme is wound up and that there is available for distribution to them an amount of £63,000,000. The growers have already had an amount of £25,000,000 distributed to them by the Chifley Government, but this Government is still withholding the balance although it is physically and legally capable of distributing it. Its refusal to distribute this money has caused disillusion and disappointment to growers. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has been playing a game here over the last twelve months. When asked questions about the distribution of this money he has said that due. to the fact that certain people have taken legal action against the Government in respect of sales of wool through dealers, the Government is not able at this juncture to distribute the money. Fiddle-de-dee! The Minister knows full well that the amount of money involved as far as dealers in Australia were concerned does not exceed £2,000,000 and it would be possible for the Government to distribute £50,000,000 among wool-growers at any tick of the clock. Those are the things that have annoyed the wool-growers. We have a similar state of affairs in relation to the dairying industry. Faced with the difliculties of obtaining State co-operation the Government dithered about for a long period before it dealt adequately with the industry's problems. It mishandled those problems and not only failed the industry but also, by virtue of neglect, inflicted severe hardships on the consuming public. The Government should be severely censured for that neglect. Those are some of the causes for the dissatisfaction of primary producers. They are not simply questions of increased prices or of breaches of faith. Let us look also at the latest, and possibly the most serious, irritant that the primary producers have had to cope with. The Treasurer made provision in his last budget for a change in the tax system known as the averaging system, which applied to the primary producers. That system has applied to primary producers since 1922 when it was introduced because the incomes of primary producers varied more substantially than those of any other section of the community. Now, after a year of freak incomes, the Government has deprived primary producers in receipt of a taxable income of over £4,000 a year of the benefit of the averaging system. In that year of freak incomes men who, for twenty years, had made only the basic wage, made £5,000 and £6,000. The farmers at Barellan recently carried a resolution condemning the abolition of the averaging system. In the year preceding the year of freak incomes an advance tax of 20 per cent, was placed on the incomes of wool-growers. That is the type of action that has caused a substantial lack of confidence in the Government on the part of primary producers. If the Government discontinues such practices it will, within a measurable period of time, find that a substantial increase has taken place in primary production, even if there is no increase in prices. The Minister for Commerce and Agrimembers of the Labour party with not being constructive. One cannot be very constructive in 25 minutes. But in what way have Government members spoken or acted constructively? I have illustrated the Government's failure to honour its policy. Has the Government formulated any concrete policy in order to increase' production ? If the Government has a change of heart and removes some of these injustices there will be an increase in production. If this country is to continue to export substantial quantities of products the Government will have to take its courage in its hands and, with the co-operation of the State governments, put into operation a",48,Woollen Mill Reduces Staff Hours

I do not care whether the Government prepares a programme for 25,000 or 50,000 farmers provided that it takes some action to allow thousands of land-hungry young Australians the same access to the land as was allowed to the returned soldiers of the two world wars. The Government should abandon the stupid intention that was announced by the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Holt) to place new immigrant settlers on the land while there are thousands of landhungry Australians. Both city men and country men with the necessary aptitude are hungry for the same sort of opportunity as the returned soldiers were given under the wise policy of the Chifley Government. Surely a policy of that sort would result in a sufficient increase of production to provide for the requirements of our growing population. . The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has a flair for making inaccurate statements and I hope that I have a flair for assimilating facts. referred in disparaging terms to the 40hour week. He does not like the 40-hour week, which was also referred to in disparaging terms by the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett). able member does not like it either. Among the members of the Australian Country party and the Liberal party there is an antipathy the 40-hour week. The Minister said that the Chifley Government its agents into the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in order to support the 4.0-hou.r week. That statement is completely untrue, as the Minister knows, and I challenge him to produce evidence to support it. Personally, I would have sent officers to the court in order to supits lowest ebb in Australia during a port the application. But the policy of the Government was to furnish the court with factual evidence. Accordingly, I >.squested the then Director of the Bureau Afr Pollard. of Agricultural Economics to furnish to the court a completely factual statement on the position of farming industries in Australia. I informed him that under no circumstances should he show bias or express an opinion for or against the 40-hour week. I throw back in the teeth of the Minister the untrue statements that he made. I hope that the electoi'3 will realize that years after the 40-hour week has been established as a sound economic policy they have in this House a gang of people so hostile to progress and the interests of the workers that they still kick hard against the application of this great reform. The 40-hour week has not lessened production but has brought to the Aurtralian people a great deal of happiness, better health, and more contentment. I advise the Government to remove the doubts and uncertainties that it has created, to distribute justly and legally the moneys owed to the primary producers, to honour its policies, and to play the game. I hope that the Government will not engage in a policy designed to encourage wheat producers to reject the continuation of a wheat stabilization plan in the same way as it discouraged acceptance of the proposed wool plan. able member's time has expired.

72,Mr Holt (Higgins,"Minister forencountered the worse depression of its history. They talk about a developing pool of unemployment. They should be authorities on unemployment, because it was due to Labour's mismanagement in 1931 that the number of people unemployed in Australia reached the enormous total of more than 500,000. The Labour party realizes that it has lost, I believe for a very long time to come, much of the support that it used to rely on from the trade union movement. The Labour party knows that this Government would not have been able to attain office had it not secured the votes of tens of thousands of trade unionists, not only at the general election of 1949, but also at the general election of 1951. In the latter general election, although the Government lost a small amount of ground in country electorates,, it more than made it up in the industrial electorates. Consequently, the Labour party, knowing that it has lost that useful support, has been trying desperately to shake the confidence of the wage-earner and the working man in this Government. The Labour party is now looking for support in other directions. It now claims to be the champion of our great primary industries. That is indeed a new-found love. I listened carefully to the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) who is the Labour party's authority on our primary industries. He told us that we need 25,000 more farms. He should know something about that matter, because at the end of Labour's last eight years of office in Australia, although there were 1,500,000 more people in Australia than at the beginning of the eight years, there were 42,000 fewer workers in our rural industries. That is the sort of situation that we found when we assumed office. We also found alongside the depletion of man-power in our rural industries a reduction of the number of workers in the hasic essential industries such as coal and steel. Moreover, the basic trade unions were riddled with communism which the Labour Government had done little to combat. Then, while we were engaged with that situation along came the Korean episode. I shall not attempt to go over the ground in that connection, because the Korean episode was ably dealt with by my colleagues. Undoubtedly, no government has ever had to face a more complex problem. The Opposition, with an utter recklessness which would be condemned in almost every other English-speaking country, has attempted to shatter the confidence of the Australian people not only in the Government but also in the stability of our economy. I hope to demonstrate to the Australian trade unionists and wage earners the falsity of the propaganda of the Opposition. I shall not ask them to accept my own words, I shall quote authorities that they will recognize as men who are in sympathy with them and who know something, of their problems. After we had been in office for about a year, one highly respected official in the trade union movement, Mr Gil. Hayes, the secretary of the Boot Trades Union, returned to Australia from a visit to the United States of America. His return was reported in the Melbourne Age of the 24th August, 1950. The report reads, in part, as follows:Mr Gil Hayes said . . . Australian working conditions were the best in the world and far in advance of those in America. On the ISth January, 1952, almost two and a half years after this Government took office, the Melbourne Age reported an interview with the .Secretary of the Transport Workers Union, Mr Cheney. I quote the Melbourne Age because honourable members opposite consider it to be a respectable newspaper. Mr Cheney had returned from a visit to Europe and Great Britain. The report readsThe standards of Australian workers are. far in advance of those of workers in Britain and throughout Europe, according to the Secretary of the Transport Workers Union( MrW . H . Cheney). Some considerable time after this Government assumed office, the United States Department of Labour, through its Bureau of Statistics, conducted a survey of the twenty leading industrial countries in the world to determine how the purchasing power of the hourly earnings of workers in industry could be compared in terms of food. Of the twenty countries surveyed, it was demonstrated tha . 1the Australian worker could purchase has enjoyed conditions of f u l l employmore food for one hour's work than could ment, Australia has still had a very much a worker in any other country of the more favorable experience than other world.

78,Mr Holt,"T he total in Victoria isreduced last week by six. Tbose figures show that there is not any catastrophic trouble in Victorian industry. In the State of South Australia three persons are registered for unemployment benefits. Four are registered in Tasmania and 49 in Western Australia. It is time that the honourable member for Dalley and his colleagues found a sense of balance in relation to this situation. The general employment figure is being watched very carefully because I do not deny that there has been some quite significant drop in the number of work vacancies that are registered in Australia. This Government has accepted the obligation that I believe to be the proper obligation of any civilized government to ensure that there are sufficient and adequate opportunities for work available to its people, so that any man who is willing and able to work shall not be denied an opportunity to do so. I say to honourable members opposite and to any persons outside the Parliament who may try to spread the poisonous statement that this Government seeks to establish a pool of unemployed that it is a wicked and malicious lie. That is proved by the policy that has been administered by this Governanent in two and a half years of ofilce. It is not possible to maintain indefinitely a situation in which there is such an overflow of employment that senseless competition arises between employers for available man-power. That point was economy should not run along in a groove, reached last year when 140,000 work unresponsive to the changing wants of the vacancies were registered with my own people department and they did not represent tively to changing circumstances, f u l l employthe total for Australia. The absurd ment can be achieved only at the cost of using situation led to employers competing for resources in relatively unproductive and labour and snatching bodies from each wasteful employment. other in the hope that they would gain Earlier, at pages 5 and 6, the white paper some commercial advantage. What was statesthe effect in the basic industries ? Governments of the States and, in particular, tain such a pressure of demand on resources the Labour governments of the States, that, for the economy as a whole, there w ill be sought to maintain a cock-eyed sort of a tendency towards a shortage of men instead prices control policy on a partial basis. of They singled out the essential industries will he at work; some people will be away and essential occupations and made the from work because of sickness, some w ill be price-fixing arrangement apply to them; taking a spell between seasonal or periodical but the rest of the field of industry, which employment, some will be in the process of they deemed to be unessential, was left offering clear of that treatment. The obvious employment has been achieved, a decision to thing happened. The industries which were subject to prices control were placed at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for labour which was attracted to the less essential industries. The result has been aptly described by Professor Sir Douglas Copland as "" a milk bar economy "". The Government had to remedy that situation which starved food-producing rural areas and basic secondary industries of labour. Throughout this debate I have waited to hear one honourable member on the Opposition side say what the Opposition would have done in those circumstances. Would they have let thc country drift until it was in a depression worse than the one into which they pushed the country in 1930 ? What is the Opposition's remedy? Let honourable members opposite tell the House and the nation what the Labour party would do to deal with a situation like that which confronted this Government in the middle of 1951. Abundant opportunities for work are still offering in Australia. I invite honourable members opposite to study one of their own white papers on full employment in Australia. Many passages make reference to this question. On page 9 of the white paper headed "" Full Employment in Australia""-and I remind honourable members that this document is an official paper expounding the policy of the Curtin and Ohifley Governments and was' published while they were in office-ther e is this passageI t is essential that a f u l l employment and to technical progress.

I come now to a matter which has received a good deal of attention during this debate. I refer to the condition of the textile industry. Much has been said, and more could be said, about the predicament of the textile industry. The Government, when its restriction plans wero put into effect early last year, did not single out the textile industry. We order to decide whether a motion of cenhave never regarded it as unimportant. sure against a government is Warranted, Indeed, the Government has done everyit is necessary to examine the state of the thing in its power to encourage the estabnation to-day.

80,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [9.25],"I nof the Government, that the economic position of Australia to-day is infinitely worse than it Was in 1949. The country is faced with economic collapse unless there is a change of government. Members of tie Government have chided the Opposition with changing its policy. They say that we used to believe in economic controls, and in the proper regulation of the economic life of the country. Our policy has not changed. Our complaint is against maladministration which is bringing the country to disaster. Government .supporters bave spent much time talking about what happened years ago. The people of Australia are interested, not so much in what happened years ago, as in what is going to happen in the future. The Minister for Defence( Mr sents. Members of the Government have McBride) admitted frankly that the Government hoped to divert resources into the defence industries, and to divert manpower into the defence forces. The Government proposes to do this, not by appealing to the patriotism of manufacturers and businessmen, or by appealing to Australian men to join the armed forces, but by a process of economic conscription. Small struggling manufactures who have established themselves in industry are to be ruined by the wrongful use of credit restriction, and they are not to be compensated. opposite complain that the Communists would confiscate private property, but what else is it but confiscation when a government uses economic controls to destroy industries without paying compensation? Honourable members opposite say that they do not believe in the regimentation of man-power in industry, or in conscripting men into the armed forres, but the Minister for Defence is more frank than most, of his colleagues. He stated openly that the Government proposes to force men out of industry because at present there are not sufficient enlistments in the defence forces. The people of Australia will be interested to learn the Government's intention. Government supporters, in attempting to fortify their arguments, have quoted from the remarks of two men now dead, the late Mr Chifley and the late Mr Curtin. They have suggested that those two Labour Prime Ministers believed in economic conscription because Mr Murray, M.L.A., has also been interOhifley once said, when speaking in support of a policy of full employment, that it might not be possible always to provide a man with employment in the district in which he was living, and that he might have to go somewhere else to get work. In a country like this it is only natural that some men must go into undeveloped districts, but it was never intended that they should be conscripted and made to go into such places. ""We intended to make the conditions of employment so attractive that men would go willingly into the undeveloped areas. I do not charge this Government with being inactive. It has been very active in the interests of those whom it repreclaimed that they are faced with a grave defence problem, and that the Chifley Labour Government left the country defenceless. There has been much talk of defence in general terms, but no one has attempted to explain on behalf of the Government the expenditure of millions of pounds, most of which has been squandered on alleged defence measures. The Government has put a few eighteen-year old youths into camp, but it proposes to destroy an important defence undertaking;-the Glen Davis project for the proHonorable members duction of oil from shale-simpl y because there is no profit in it for somebody. No one pretends that at Glen Davis a large proportion of our oil requirements was being produced, but the industry could have been expanded. There are other valuable shale deposits in Australia. Other countries produce oil from coal but despite the fact that we have the richest oil bearing coal in the world nothing has been done to exploit it. Did the Government develop the Glen Davis project as a vital defence industry? Not at all. It intends to dispose of that, great national asset. How does it propose to go about the disposal? It is now inviting interested persons to submit offers for the plant. For months past a brother of the Minister for the Navy this building and in Sydney in an endeavour to secure advantages over other persons who are interested in the purchase of the plant. The Honourable T. viewing members of the Government in",54,Stook Position In The Textile Industry
81,( Mr Mcmahon) Has Been Lobbying In,"an attempt to advance his own interests in the acquisition of this great asset of the people. Similar action was taken by the Government in relation to the disposal of its shares in Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Proprietary Limited. Are honourable members aware that Mr workers but also manufacturers and TJtz, who was commissioned by the Government to dispose of the Commonwealth's interest in that company, is a member of the sharebroking firm of Horden, TJtz and Bode and is also a member of a secret organization which has no responsibility to the people of Australia-the finance committee of the New South Wales branch of the Liberal party. The Government is sending out telegrams to its wealthy supporters relatthe day following that on which the ing to the projected sale of other assets of the people. Honourable members opposite would like to destroy Trans-Australia Airlines and dispose of the Commonwealth Shipping Line, notwithstanding the fact that both of those activities to apply-the newspapers stated that the are of the greatest importance to our defence structure. These are the people who talk about their great poncern for the advancement of Australia. Let us examine our internal position 30 that we may judge whether or not this Government has failed in its task. Wc all know how prices have soared in the last two years. What remedies has the Government proposed to cure the evils of inflation? It says to the workers in industry, ""Let the workers accept wagepegging and we shall have price-pegging "". Why does it not contemplate thc pegging of profits? For a long time members of the Government referred to the need for the introduction of an excess profits tax. The very fact that such a tax Minister for Labour and National Service was contemplated by the Government is evidence that excess profits were being obtained by the great wealthy people of Australia. the proposal solely because of the pressure brought to bear upon it by its wealthy supporters. Australia want our economy to be restored to a stable basis. When honourable members opposite talk of wage-pegging they should first be prepared to put wages on an equitable basis. They have said that basic wage increases have been largely responsible for our present difliabout the Soviet? culties. Some members of the GovernMr Ward. ment and their sponsors outside the Parliament advocate the abolition of the system under which the basic wage is adjusted at quarterly periods. The last increase of 9s. in the basic wage in New South Wales astonished not only the businessmen who expected a very much greater increase. Despite all the statistical evidence that may be adduced to show that the basic wage increase of 9s. was intended to .compensate the workers of New South Wales for increased costs, I am still of the opinion that it was a "" doctored "" decision which bore no relationship to the actual increase of living costs during the preceding quarter. On determination of the new basic wage was announced, long before the increase was received by the workers-it was announced a week before the date from which it was price of large packets of breakfast foods was to be increased by 4d. and that tbe price of jam was to be increased by from 4d. to 8d. a tin. Thus, before the workers received the increase, it was being taken away from them. The Government may count upon the co-operation of trade unionists and the people generally only if it treats them fairly. One Government supporterI think it was the honourable recently that we had reached the limit in the provision of social services benefits and that no extensions of such benefits could. be granted. What is happening to the recipients of social services benefits in this period of mounting inflation? It is all very well for the to cite statistics to show that people in Australia are better off than are those in other countries when, in fact many of our The Government dropped citizens are struggling to exist. The honourable gentleman has said with great pride and satisfaction that the position of The workers of the people of Soviet Eussia was the worse of all. In every comparison he makes between the position of Australians end that of other peoples, he invariably says that the people of Soviet Russia are in a worse position than any other. If that is so why does he worry What we are concerned about is what will happen to",55,Stook Position In The Textile Industry
82,Member For Henty ( Mr Gullett),"sai dour people if inflation is permitted to continue unchecked. In the press to-day it is stated that on the lst July the price of butter is to be increased to 3s. 8d. per lb. This Government has said much about putting value back into the £1, but because of its inaction, value is continually opportunity exists for the absorption oozing out of our currency. We do not have to arouse fear in the minds of the people; it is already there. They know that anti-Labour governments are eager to see another depression hit this country. The honourable member for Paterson( Mr Fairhall) referred to indiscipline in industry. He wants to put the workers in their places. That is the attitude of the anti-Labour forces inside this Parliament and outside it. In a newspaper article the financial editor of the Sydney Morning Herald referred to the advantages of another depression. While he admitted that a depression would bring about widespread unemployment aud great misery among our people he said that it would also result in greater efficiency in industry and greater production from the workers. Mr L. H . McLeod, president of a district council of the Country party, is reported to have saidThe country will not get back to normal until there are eleven men applying for one man's job. That is the attitude of the anti-Labour parties throughout the Commonwealtb. Honourable members opposite are delighted when they hear that a man has been dismissed from employment because they realize that their policy is beginning to bear fruit. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) said that there are only 2,800 registered unemployed persons in Australia. It is obvious that the Ministers cannot agree among themselves as to how many vacant jobs exist in Australia. The Minister for Defence of ancl that the number is 40,000. To-night, the Minister for Labour and National Service has told us that the number is 92,000. Ministers are bandying figures about in au.attempt to delude the people. I should not be astonished to find that there are only 2,S00 registered unemployed persons in Australia. Is it not rather strange that even 2,800 persons should be unemployed at a time when, it is claimed, there are more that 90,000 vacancies? Surely, if the position has been accurately stated, of the 2,800 registered unemployed. I have frequently sent men to the oflices of the Commonwealth Employment Service in search of work. Many of them have told me that the employment officers have informed them that no suitable employment was offering for them. In these circumstances why should men worry about registering for employment? Despite the fact that the purchasing value of the £1 is very much lower than it was when the unemployment benefit was instituted by a Labour government, the benefit still remains at 25s. a week or 33. 7d. a day. A married recipient is paid an allowance of 3s. for his wife and 8d. for each child. An unemployed person is not entitled to benefit until he has been out of work for seven days. Under present-day conditions, the benefit is practically worthless. As the honorable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) has said, anybody who is in touch with Australian affairs knows that unemployment is rapidly growing. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture to-night when he said that certain industries which were formerly unable to obtain a suflicient number of employees now have an abundance of workers offering for employment. The New South Wales Transport Department, which was understaffed for years, is now turning down applicants for employment. Only to-day I was advised by telephone that Australian Consolidated Industries Limited gave notice of dismissal to 1,000 men who are employed at its glass-works at Waterloo. In many country districts timber mills have been compelled to close down. vacancies is between 50,000 Honourable members opposite, if they wish 60,000.

They have been forced to close down as a result of the Government's restriction of credit for housing which has curtailed the demand for timber. Consequently,, the mills cannot dispose of their products. One can",56,Stook Position In The Textile Industry

85,( Mr Mcewen) Admitted That That Is So,"see exactly what the Government is planning to do. The Prime Minister, in trying to excuse the Government, said that whatever policy the banks were pursuing it was not the responsibility of the Government. He said that the directive underwhich the banks were now operating was given in 1950 and that it had not been changed in the meantime. What has happened to the National Security Resources Board? The Parliament has not been furnished with any reports about the deliberations of that body or about what it is doing. We were told that it was constituted in order to classify essential, less essential and non-essential industries. Why does it not publish its classifications in order that those who are engaged in industry might know where they stand. The Government through the Treasurer Arthur Fadden) has arranged secret conferences with representatives of the private banks to which no representative of the Commonwealth Bank was invited. Dr. Coombs, the Governor of the bank, was excluded from those secret conferences because the Government believes, as many of its supporters have said repeatedly, that as he was appointed by a Labour government he is, therefore, a socialist. The Prime Minister said that honourable members were hearing a lot of wicked nonsense with respect to housing. He added that private banks could advance up to £3,000 for the construction of a house and up to £3,500 for the purchase of an existing house whilst, at the same time, the Government had made advances societies. When I interjected that, in fact, work. While this Goverament is destroyadvances were not being made for home construction the right honourable gentleman, who is responsible together with the other members of his government for the conduct of affairs in this country, said that it was the banks' own concern whether they accepted business and made advances. While the banks are occupying a privileged position families are being denied proper accommodation. How can the Government expect to make effective defence preparations unless the community is contented and the people are given the opportunity Mr Ward. to live in their own homes and to rear their families under decent conditions? To-day, 8,300 families residing in emergency housing settlements are living in tenements and humpies vvhich are not fit for human habitation, but the Government evidently believes that that position is satisfactory. Over 28,000 families arc waiting for emergency accommodation, yet the Government is curtailing housing programmes. All State governments, not only Labour but also anti-Labour such as the Victorian Government, are complaining about the action of this Government in cutting down their works allocations and compelling them to curtail their housing programmes. The State governments regard such action as repudiation on the ( Sir part of this Government; and so it is, because the States were encouraged to undertake housing programmes and to assist industries to provide prefabricated houses. I quote as an illustration the case of Van Dyke Brothers Proprietary Limited, of Villawood, which is one of the largest companies in Australia engaged in the production of prefabricated houses, which was encouraged by both this Government and the New South Wales Government to increase production. Consequently it stepped up production to 25 prefabricated houses a week. Already ita production has been reduced to ten houses a week and it has now been asked to reduce its output to seven houses a week. That restriction has been forced upon it as the result of the policies of this Government. That company has been compelled to dispense with 200 of its 350 employees who to co-operative building were previously engaged on this important ing this essential industry it is talking about what it is doing to encourage the importation of prefabricated houses. It is to the lasting discredit of the Government that it is destroying an essential Australian industry whilst, at the same time, it is encouraging the importation of prefabricated houses by subsidizing such Australian importations at the rate of £300 each and admitting such houses free of duty. The timber industry as a whole has been severely hit as the result of the policies of this Government. I repeat that many country mills have already closed down whilst others have been compelled to reduce their stafis. At the same time, the Government has been urging, the timber millers to provide relief for those who suffered loss as a result of the recent bush fires. Those fires damaged large tracts of timber, which must be cut as soon as possible if its value is not to be lost completely. appealed to millers to cut and store tliat timber. Ye.t it is destroying the home market upon which the millers, depend. The Prime Minister also said that the Opposition was recklessly eager to convince the people that there is an economic crisis in this country. ""We do not have to convince the people of that fact because they already know that such a crisis exists. The right honourable gentleman, during the whole of his speech, did not say one word about putting value back into thc £1 or about the dreadful Communists who, Government supporters have been telling us for months, have been responsible, for holding up production -Vice-President of the Executive CounI wonder whether the visit of representatives of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to this country has anything to do with the Government's policy of causing a depression. It is rather interesting to recall that soon after we had a visit from overseas bankers on a previous occasion a depression occurred in Australia. The representatives of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development are shortly to arrive in Australia and we find that the Government is now doing its depression. In order to ascertain tbe degree to which Wall-street has dominated the policies of this Government we need only recall what has happened to the film industry. ATI honourable members are aware that in the past Commonwealth and State Governments have been encouraging the establishment of the filmproducing industry because they recognize the great propaganda and advertising value of such an industry to Australia. However, after a British film company embarked upon operations in this country and the venture promised to succeed, it was destroyed by the limitations that were imposed upon it by the Capital Issues Board. Consequently the Australian market has now been left wide open to exploitation by American film interests. The Government talks about conserving dollars when, at the same time, it is doing everything to make it difficult for Australia to obtain dollars. Unemployment is growing and all The Government has classes of pensioners are in a desperate plight. It is significant that the Government has declared that, regardless of the degree to which the cost of living may rise, it will not adjust social services benefits to help these unfortunate people to make ends meet.

The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) has played the record of class hatred whenever he has taken up the time of this House, and, indeed, the record seems to have cracked recently as he harps on the word "" hate, hate, hate "". The honourable member has the temerity to lecture us about defence. He is the man who suggested that we should confer with Hitler during the last best to bring about another war. He saidInstead of ea/rying on this stupid conflict an effort should be made at the earliest moment to summon a conference of tlie major nations for the purpose of ending it. When the whole of the free world was combating Nazi-ism, the honourable member for East Sydney was the man who suggested that we should confer with Hitler. When he spoke about defence, I recalled an epic occasion in this House. We were seeking to protect the outer bastions of Australia. Tens of thousands of valuable Australian lives were lost in New Guinea.

Tn 1938 he s a i d It is amusing to hear people say, "" We will not give up New Guinea"". To these people I would say that if it should become necessary to defend our mandated territories they should defend them themselves. Tens of thousands of valuable Australian lives were lost, and Australian blood was spilt in New Guinea in halting the southward drive of the Japanese. Yet this great warrior, this great protector of Australian standards said, ""Let the people in the mandated islands defend themselves"". The only thing that the honourable member has not trotted out from his stock-in-trade is that which discredited him. I refer to his statements about "" the Brisbane line "". The honourable member was suspended from ministerial office by his own Prime Minister, and a royal commission was appointed to inquire into his allegations. He had an opportunity to give evidence. The brave honourable gentleman ran away, and claimed parliamentary privilege for his statements. Yet this man lectures us about the defence of this country. Obviously he carries on exactly the same technique as those with whom he associates-the old Communist technique of uttering the cry of "" recession "", and of engaging in character assassination. He picked out individuals, and sought to smear their character. The honourable member is surely a case for a psychiatrist. ThereI leave him, because he has not contributed anything of importance to this debate. I now have something to say about the leader of this rabble Labour party (Dr. Evatt), who has moved this motion of censure. The Labour party seeks to make capital out of every little weakness that it may exploit in the people who have been brought to a sense of responsibility regarding the position in Australia. I have recently returned from London Opposition members interjecting, glad that Opposition members welcome me. They certainly would have experienced a sense of frustration had I not returned. In London, some of the old customs still prevail. For example, the rag-picker still wanders in the streets,, and picks up from the garbage tins bits and pieces that interest him. He may not like Opposition members interjecting, honourable gentlemen on my left to give the Vice-President of the Executive Council a reasonably fair hearing. Since he has been speaking, there seems to be a concerted objection to his remarks. Opposition members perhaps are entitled to their objections, but should keep them to themselves. rag-picker may not like silk or brocade, but when he picks those materials out of a garbage tin, he makes them his stockin-trade. ""We have a comparable set of circumstances in this debate. The Leader of the Opposition has become the political rag-picker in this country. Let us examine how he wanders from dustbin to dustbin, seeking what he can find to take unto himself as his stock-in-trade. First he goes to the bankers' garbage tin, from which he picks out a piece labelled "" credit restriction "". He says, "" AhI Credit restriction "", and seeks to make it his stock-in-trade. Let us examine credit restriction. The right honourable gentleman certainly should have some knowledge of that subject. Did not he, while he was a member of the Chifley Government, seek not merely to restrict credit, but to nationalize credit when the Labour Government attempted to nationalize the banking system? That was not a matter of restricting credit. It was definitely nationalization of credit-complet e governmental control of credit. Much play has been made upon the expression "" credit restriction "" during this debate, but the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) has pointed out that the average monthly advances between June, 1951, and January, 1952, have increased by the extraordinary sum of £134,000,000. The Leader of the Opposition, who sought to pin the policy of credit restriction upon the Government, found that he was up against facts which proved that he had taken into his stock-in-trade a rag which had no value. Therefore, he moved quickly to the capitalist dustbin and picked out taxation. He said, "" A h !",59,Stook Position In The Textile Industry

The honourable member for East Sydney has tried togloss over them by saying that they reis not so. When Mr Chifley told a trade union conference at the Sydney Town to do.

93,Mr Ward,Economic conscription!,62,Stook Position In The Textile Industry
94,Mr Eric J. Harrison,"Labou rLabour is convinced of the need to control man-power and to direct workers as if they were mere chattels. It seeks also to control credit by making the banking system the plaything of politicians. No economy could stand up to such interference. that the statements of the late Mr explain how it would obtain the money Chifley, the Leader of the Opposition, people of Australia realized that when they threw the Labour Government out of office at the general elections of 1949. We have discussed the inflationary trend during this debate. Honourable members must be aware that the inflationary spiral did not spring up overnight. It could, not do so. The late Mr Chifley was well aware of its existence, because he said in the Prahran Town Hall on the 16th April, 1951The return of a Labour Government would not cure the inflationary evils. It would mean hard work, great political courage and perhaps fairly drastic measures with the cooperation of the trade union movement to achieve that goal. At Cairns, on the 2nd April, 1951, he saidTo end inflation would need more than control of prices, and Labour, if elected, might will never place their trust in a governhave to do some unpopular things to arrest inflation. Unpopular things such as conscription of labour and the conscription of credit! The statements that I have quoted expound the true policy of the Labour party, and that is why I have had difficulty in understanding the statements that have been made by members of the Opposition during this debate. In view of the unequivocal pronouncements that prominent members of the party have made on other occasions, I am convinced that honourable members opposite are now engaging in mere political opportunism and are using the stuff that has bean dragged from the garbage tins by the political rag-picker for his stock-in-trade. Honourable members will recall that, soon after the Menzies Government came to power, additional great responsibilities were thrust upon it as a result of the outbreak of war in Korea. It was forced to reconsider its entire financial policy because it was aware that the Korean conflict might spread and engulf the world. Every responsible government in the democratic world had to take steps to put its eountry in a state of preparedness. Therefore, Australia's defence expenditure has been increased since 1949-50 by approximately £150,000,000 a year. The Opposition has not yet attempted to that is needed for social services and other unavoidable commitments in addition to the vast sums that must be expended to provide for the nation's security. It has criticized taxation increases. Had it been in power, it would have had to raise additional taxation. It has criticized credit control. Had it been in power, it would have nationalized credit. It has criticized the transfer of labour. But its members would introduce conscription of man-power.

100,Mr Clark',"I merely quoted a stateadvantage, as he is well fitted to do, the contents of that tin. I leave him among the garbage that he has thrown about the House. He is in his element in such a setting. The issue that is before the House is a motion that has been submitted on behalf of the Opposition declaring that the Government lacks the confidence of the Parliament. The Government has lost the confidence of the people, and therefore it deserves the censure of the Parliathe refuge of the scoundrel. I do not ment. The Prime Minister has declared in a most buoyant manner that the Government will defeat the motion to-night hecause it has the necessary majority at its command. RutI am sure that, if the people had an opportunity to vote on this motion, the result would be different from that which the right honourable gentleman has anticipated. Two factors are essential to productive activity and prosperity in the community. One is an ample supply of credit with which to finance developmental works and promote employment, and the other is public confidence. By withdrawing credit from essential business undertakings, the Government has established a fear complex that has been responsible already for unemployment and loss of public confidence and that is leading to the destruction of prosperous industries. The Government cannot regain the confidence of the people by applying its present policy. As the motion that we are debating declares, it is causing injury to industry and production, both primary and secondary. Australians remember the economic depression of the 'thirties and they are justified in fearing the outcome of this Government's activities. Pensioners were recently granted small increases of their social services benefits, months to obtain orders from the Comand the Prime Minister has said in this House that he has no intention of granting any further increases until the next budget is presented to the Parliament in September. But tbe cost of living has continued to increase rapidly and pensioners and many other Australians in receipt of small fixed incomes are suffering great hardships. The prices of commodities generally have, risen so steeply that such citizens are unable to buy more than is essential to maintain a bare existence. Mr Clark. The Government's policy has caused insecurity of employment and consequent economic fear amongst workers and housewives. Unemployment is increasing apace. As the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) pointed out, 1,000 employees of one company alone have been given notice of dismissal. We have been told that sacrifices of this sort must be made in the interests of defence. It is sometimes said that patriotism is know whether the Government is using the plea of defence necessity in order to cover its failings proper statement. neglected by this Government. The small arms factory at Lithgow is one of the major defence establishments in this country, but the men employed there are working now only four days a week. On one day in each week they cannot work at all because no electric power is available for the factory. That is an example of the manner in which the Government is carrying out its defence programme. Defence preparations, if they are to be undertaken, should be undertaken on a scale sufficiently great to justify the transfer of labour and the unemployment that is occurring in some industries. The Government will find it difficult to explain what is happening at Lithgow. As a result of its policy, many industries of an essential nature are closing, although they have brought much wealth and prosperity to this country. I am informed that one of the leading firms that manufactures khaki drill for servicemen's uniforms has been endeavouring for many monwealth, but without success. The Government has placed orders for khaki drill with Japanese manufacturers, and this firm has had to discharge a considerable number of its employees because it is unable to keep them fully employed. The Government is giving employment to Japanese and refusing to give employment to its own people. We are told that that is being done in the interests of defence. Food production is an essential part of a defence programme. During the last",63,Stook Position In The Textile Industry
101,Mr Anthony,That is a most im,64,Stook Position In The Textile Industry
102,Mr Clark,"Defenc e has been sorelywar, Australia was called on to undertake the major task of producing food for its own population, for the American forces in this area and for the British fleet in the Pacific. It was called upon also to export vast quantities of food to Great Britain to meet the requirements of the people there. Before our defence programme can become effective, we must ensure that our food production potential is sufficiently great to enable us to meet not only our own requirements of food but also those of Allied forces and of people in other parts of the world. The Government has failed hopelessly to discharge its duty in that respect. The food production position is going from bad to worse. Unemployment in country centres is increasing. Labour is not being fully utilized for food production. The Government is solely to blame for that state of affairs, to which its lack of policy for 3,500,000 acres. The number of persons increasing food production has given rise. Milk and butter have been rationed in New South ""Wales this week. Australian housewives are faced with a further diffiwhen the Chifley Government was in culty in obtaining sufficient of those compower, there were 13,800,000 acres under modities to meet the requirements of their families. There is talk of importing butter from New Zealand, but Australia should be able to supply all the essential foods that our people need. The position in relation to food production is this year. During the same period, exeven more serious than the people believe it to be. During the last two years, we have had outstandingly good seasons, but if drought conditions were to occur now we should be forced to ration bread and meat unless we ceased to export flour and meat. The Government is charged with the responsibility of making enough food available to meet the requirements of the Australian people, of continuing to export food to Great Britain and of maintaining our export trade so that we shall have a favorable trade balance and thus be able to pay for the things that we need to import from other countries. If we fail to produce sufficient quantities of food to enable us to maintain our export trade in foodstuffs, we shall be short of many articles. The position in relation to rural production is fast deteriorating. In 1938-39 there were 253,536 rural holdings in Australia, but in 1950-51 there were only 243,626, a decrease of approximately 10,000, although during that period the area of holdings increased by about 43,000,000 acres. The point that I am attempting to establish is that the Government, instead of putting more people on the land, is acquiescing in a policy of the establishment of large estates and of fewer people being on the land. Small holdings are being acquired by large land-holders, and that is having an adverse effect upon rural production. I believe that the Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony) himself has bought a number of holdings. Previously they were in the hands of several people, but now they are in his hands only. In 1938-39, 23,400,000 acres of land in this country were under crops of various types, but in 1950-51 the figure had fallen to 19,900,000 acres, a decrease of engaged in rural industries also decreased during that period. The production of various foods has fallen. In 1947-48, wheat. In 1951-52 only 10,200.000 acres are under wheat. There has been a decrease of 3,600,000 acres. The production of wheat has fallen from 220,100,000 bushels in 1947-48 to 166,700,000 bushels ports of wheat have fallen from 131,600,000 bushels to 77,700,000. We have heard a lot from the Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony) about, butter production, and about what Labour failed to do in that connection and what should be done. During the last two years, while this Government has been in office, butter production has decreased considerably. In 1949-50, 173,000 tons of butter were produced in this country, but in 1950-51 only 164,000 tons were produced. Butter exports fell from 81,000 tons in 1949-50 to 55,000 tons in 1950-51. Supplies of butter to the Australian people have been maintained only by reducing butter exports. By reducing our exports we have lowered our trade balance by more than £200,000,000 and consequently have weakened Australia's stability. Furthermore, we are reducing the balance of funds that we need for the purpose of buying essential commodities in other parts of the world. I have before rue figures in relation to food production for the first six months of this financial year, and a similar period in 1950. The production of butter declined from 96,500 tons in 1950 to 76,900 tons in 1951. from 25,400 tons in 1950 to 5,700 tons in 1951. Indeed, our export of butter is rapidly becoming negligible. In addition, we are now on a rationed allowance of only 50 per cent, of normal supplies. I believe that a further decrease of production is imminent. I shall now refer to the production of milk during a period that this Government has been in office, compared with a corresponding period in 1949 when Labour was in office. For the six months ended 594,200,000 gallons of milk was produced, compared with 685,600,000 gallons in the corresponding period of 1949. A considerable falling off of production has been evident also in relation to meat. There was a serious decline of meat production in 1950-51, under an anti-Labour government, compared with the production in 1947-48, when Labour was iu office. Exports of meat have decreased by more than 62,000 tons a year since the present Government came into office, and the position is deteriorating rapidly. Production of eggs and potatoes, also, has declined alarmingly, and the quantity of eggs exported has decreased considerably. The Commonwealth is entirely responsible for the administration which affects the welfare of the commercial life of this country. At a later stage of my remarks I shall compare what was done by the former Labour Government with what is being done by the present Government in this connection. deterioration of food production has been due entirely to lack of provision of finance by this Government. It has dillydallied for two years and has done nothing to help to remedy the position. Indeed, it is not now doing anything to remedy the existing sorry state of affairs. the lack of transport facilities and good The figures that I have cited are indicative of its failure in this regard. It has not yet put forward any feasible plan to arrest our declining food production. Mr Clark. There was stable production on a very sound basis under Labour's administration during the war years. What Labour did then could be done by the present Government, upon which rests an obligaExports of butter decreased tion to ensure an adequate supply of food for our people and to maintain theexport of food to Great Britain. It also devolves on the Government to ensure a sound food potential in the event of war, which it forecasts might come. Through the agency of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Eesearch Organization, much could be done to improve food production in this country. Breeds of stock suited to early maturity, and with qualities that would withstand local pests and drought conditions, could be imported. Much could be the 31st December, 1951, done to improve our pastures and to provide for stock feeding on a major scaleI n the United States of America much has been done during the last four or five years to increase meat, production by pasture improvement and by the grain feeding of cattle and sheep. Unless the Government endeavours to promote the proper grain feeding of stock in this country it cannot hope to increase the production of meat products. The Government should assist primary producers to obtain mechanical equipment. The labour problem was much more difficult during war-time than it is to-day. The former Labour Government assisted primary producers to obtain equipment so as to save labour and to improve crop production. For instance, machines to sow and harvest the potato crop were imported. Such a machine had never before been seen in this country. The production of food could be substantially increased also by the importation of tractors and other farming equipment. Proper transport facilities should be provided in what is The known as the channel country in the corner where the back portion of New South Wales adjoins the borders of western Queensland and South Australia. There is a considerable number of cattle in the channel country which cannot be brought to market because of roads. If a good road were constructed from Bourke to the channel country, motor trucks could bring in the stock and thus increase the supply of meat for the people of Anstralia. Additional amenities and homes should be provided in the outback country areas in order to encourage more people to live there 'and to engage in food production. Substantial roads should be constructed in the outback. There has not been a sufficient allocation of money by the Commonwealth for the provision of roads in country areas, because of limited finance. The Commonwealth is entirely responsible for this state of affairs. I contend that all the proceeds' of the petrol tax should be. applied to the improvement of the roads of this country. Much work requires to be done also in connection with water supply and conservation, which are seriously languishing. At present, 1,000,000 gallons of water a day is being carted to Broken Hill. The Commonwealth is not assisting that city in any way. ""Water is also being taken to Cobar by train. Application to the Commonwealth by other towns in my electorate to carry out water supply projects have been rejected, and they have had to cancel orders for pipes and other equipment. The people there are now faced with the necessity to cart water in bhe near future. If the production of food in this country is to be increased it will be necessary for some of the large estates to be cut up. The Government's slogan should be '""Use the land or lose it "" , because, in effect, the Government is a trustee for the large estates. 'The land should be made available to landhungry farmers who are prepared to engage in food production. Only by putting more land into production and providing proper facilities for the farmers can the production of food he increased. When I entered the Parliament in 1934 the cry was that public works could not he carried out because money and credit were not available. To-day the Government maintains that public works cannot be carried out because there is too much money in the community. When is it expected that urgently needed public works will be undertaken? able member's time has expired. [ Quorum formed.'] While the honourable member for Darling( Mr Clark) was speaking about a decline of production, his mistaken statements were themselves leading to a decline of the attendance of honourable members iu the chamber. He ended his speech by contending that the Commonwealth should cut up large estates and so put more men on the land, although he knows ful l well, as do all his colleagues, that the Commonwealth has no power to do any such thing. He surely has not forgotten that the people tossed out of office the party of which he is a member because it wanted to obtain such power by means of the nationalization of our banking system. New South Wales has a Premier who subscribes to the same policy as that followed by the Opposition here, which is a policy of endeavouring to force people who have developed rural properties to disgorge them to the Government at prices determined by the Government. Some of the iniquitous practices adopted by the people whom the New South Wales Government employs to acquire such properties would cause any decent man to hang his head in shame, but it does not cause such a reaction in members of the Opposition. The honourable member went on to speak about the drift of people from the land and the decline of production that has resulted from it, but he knows as well as does everybody who has studied the position that one of the major causes of the decline of our rural population has been that primary producers have been unable to obtain the materials and equipment necessary for the efficient conduct of their properties. Poultrymen are still crying out for wire and other necessary materials, which they have a terrific job to obtain. Butter producers are also sorely in need of essential materials. The Government is doing its very best to acquire such materials, even if it has to import them at high prices. It is utterly fantastic for the honourable member, who is a member of the Labour party, to criticize the Government on connection with the butter position in New South Wales. Why did he not exhibit fairness and honesty by criticizing because, not so very long ago when this Government made the first real attempt to",64,Stook Position In The Textile Industry

In 1947, when the present Opposition party was in office, it established a enough ? committee which recommended that a certain price be paid to butter-fat producers. minority as well as a majority report. The majority report recommended a return to the producer of 2s. 2£d. per lb. but the minority report, which was drawn up mainly by government employees, recommended 2s. per lb. The government of the day, in which the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) was Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, accepted the minority report. In 1949, when the same committee recommended that the butterfat producers should receive a further sublast night could be more aptly applied sidy, the same government resolutely and vehemently refused to pay that subsidy, and tried to pass the onus to the State Ministers for Prices. However, its insincerity was disclosed by the fact that, about opposite have harped on the textile inthree days before the general election that was held on the 10th December, 1949, the Labour Prime Minister, Mr referred to the Government's credit Ohifley, stated that 2$d. per lb. would be paid to the butter-fat producers, but only until the end of December. But that little trick did not achieve its purpose, because many supporters of the Labour Government failed to secure re-election. One of the first acts of the new Government was to ; endeavour to give a decent standard of living to butter-fat producers. We are not claiming that what we have done so far is perfect, but it at least is a move in could not obtain before because of shorthe right direction. The honourable member for Darling also talked about Labour's wonderful food production plan in war-time. He omitted to say that in 1943 we had to import wheat, barley and oats from North America within three months of the then Minister for War Organization of Industry, Mr Dedman, saying that we had sufficient wheat here to last us for Mr Hamilton. another twelve months. Do we want to go back to that kind of planning? The honourable member then went on to speak about roads in country areas, but he knows full well that since this Government has been in office it has doubled the amount of money made available to the States for road works. member consider that that amount is one moment that it is, but at least this The committee presented a year it is twice the amount that the Chifley Government made available in its last year of office. This year we made £16,000,000 available compared with the £8,000,000 made available by the Labour Government in 1948-49. If the sales of petrol increase, and there is a consequent increase of petrol tax revenue, that amount could be raised. The adverbs that the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) used to the failure of the Opposition to make out a case during this debate, because it has failed dismally, miserably and abysmally to do so. Honourable members dustry and .prices control, and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), when he submitted his motion of censure, restriction policy. I shall deal with those subjects also. The honourable member for Evans( Mr Osborne) dealt very capably this afternoon with the subject of the quantities of textile goods now available for sale in this country. We all know why those great quantities are available now in Australia. It is an ill wind that blows nobody any good. I am certain that the housewife to-day is very happy to be able to obtain textile goods that she tages. Certain sections of the community are making themselves heard on the subject of imported nylon stockings. I say most definitely that if the importation of nylon stockings will improve the quality of the similar product made in this country, then let us bring some in. It is an abounding disgrace that a woman may spend her money on a pair of locallymade nylon stockings and have to replace",67,Stook Position In The Textile Industry
105,Mr Luchetti,Does the honourable,68,Stook Position In The Textile Industry
106,Mr Hamilton,"I do not say forthem a da.y or two later because of their poor quality. Sometimes, in fact, the quality of such locally-made stockings is so poor that they do not last for longer than a few hours. A few years ago women could huy stockings knowing that they would last for at least a reasonable time. Labour governments in the States have not been able to come to any unanimity in respect of prices control; As the Premier of Tasmania has said, prices control alone will not cure inflation. Yet no Opposition member has said that prices control and wages control must go hand in hand if we are to attack inflation by this means. The Minister in charge of prices in Queensland stated only a few months ago that his Government did not want the Australian Government .to control prices. The Queensland Governnient preferred to exercise that control itself. If Opposition members intend to harp on the subject of prices control, they should reach some unanimity among themselves. The Leader of the Opposition, in introfor Maranoa( Mr Brimblecombe). ducing this mattor, said that drastic restrictions had heen imposed on bank credit by the Governinent. I propose to state, as the Prime Minister did last night, the Government was using credit restricthe restrictions that are applicable under the Government's policy. Insofar as primary production is concerned, banks are permitted to advance up to £15,000 for the purchase of a property for use in the production of food and a further £5,000 may he secured in order to obtain additional land for the production of food. When requested .to make nioney available for the purchase of real estate on which an intending buyer does not propose to live thc banks have been asked to advise the client to seek accommodation elsewhere. Apparently, because of the operation of that restriction bank managers have told their clients that Commonwealth policy is responsible for their rejection of applications for advances in all instances. As the Prime Minister said, that provides them with an easy way out. A few years ago, if they considered that a client's security was insufficient when he asked for a loan, they would have said, ""No, we cannot meet you"". But they now have an easy way of avoiding that statement by saying that the 'Commonwealth will not allow them to make the advance. As the Prime Minister pointed out, the Government does not instruct bank managers what to do. It has laid down the policy and the banks ean carry it out if they wish to do so. The banks are permitted to advance up to £3,000 for the erection of a house, plus £500, if necessary, to purchase the land on which the house is built. They can also make additional advances if the circumstances warrant their doing so, but they have been requested to keep advances for the acquisition of houses within the £3,500 limit. A bank may make advances to people in order to pay tax after it has investigated each individual's position. I know of cases in which money has been made available to farmers for that purpose. I have here a copy of a Queensland newspaper, which reports that bank managers have explained to the press that they are prepared to make advances to farmers to enable them to meet tax commitments. These remarks were made by bank managers in the electorate of the honourable member The Leader of the Opposition said that tions as a means of conscripting labour. WOuld the people of Australia rather have that system or the system that the right houorable gentleman propounded at the Summer School of Political Science in Canberra in 1944 when he said that no person should have the right to choose his own vocation? When the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Erio J. Harrison) referred to that statement, the honorahle member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) said that the right honourable gentleman had not made it. I have here a book entitled, Post-war Reconstruction in Australia, the preface to which statesThis volume contains the five papers, and the discussions on them, which were read before the Summer School of the Australian Institute of Political Science at Canberra from the 29th to 31st of January, 1944. During the discussion that took place at that conference Mr Guinane is reported to have saidThe right of a man to choose his own vocation in life is the one right that raises a man above the brute level of the animal. When the Leader of the Opposition spent before Bepatriation anomalies eame to deal with that statement hy Mr had also been corrected and there was a Guinane, he said, according to the report greater increase in the construction of at page 287 of this publicationMr Guinane spoke of the characteristics in this country. The Australian area under which distinguished man from the beast and wheat has decreased from 13,880,000 appeared to liken his fate to the right of a acres in 1947-48 to an estimated man to choose his own vocation in life. There 10,550,000 acres in 1951-52. The Leader are a lot of other differences between the man and the beast. One is intelligence and common of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) said that sense. To-day, with the enormous developthat decrease of acreage was due to high ment in industry, corporate control and taxation. I point out to him that taxafinance, there is no longer a full right in every person to choose his own vocation in life. The honourable member for Port Adelaide in this House that it is not principally ( Mr Thompson) claimed that this remark taxation which is reducing our wheat had been passed in war-time. But the acreage but it is the lack of machinery fact that the Leader of the Opposition and plant to make wheat production wanted to apply the same principle in profitable. There is nomore soulpeace was illustrated by the last sentence destroying joh than to try to proin his contribution to the discussion duce food with worn-out and obsolete which reads as follows:That cannot be achieved without a Comshortage monwealth plan and by means of Commonmembers opposite have deliberately tried wealth legislation and we must have the power to do it. The people would much rather have the a fear that they will be penalized if they disemployment that has been referred produce more wheat. I was amazed to to in this debate than the system ihat read an article in the Sydney Daily Telewas propounded by the Leader of the graph of thc 15th February, whioh Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition alleged said that a decrease of primary production due to the imposition of excess taxation had taken place.

Some of the leaders of the farmers arc saying the same thing. I have no objection to the farmer going in for sheep or anything else so long as he is using his land. But Mr Pratt said that they were growing oats and wool and raising fat lambs and sheep because those products paid better than wheat. I must point out that if the farmers are going to raise fat lambs and produce barley and oats and get more for such products, then they will certainly have to pay higher taxes in the lump sum. They will be caught because of the provisional tax system. The sole reason for the reduced acreage of wheat can be traced to the actions of the last Labour Government. That Government should have introduced the American and Canadian schemes in their entirety, but it would not ask the farmers to estimate their incomes as is done, in those two overseas countries. Therefore, the farmers got the worse of the agreement. The farmers are financially embarrassed because of the operation of the sysbem, and not because of the taxes. The averaging system affects 28,000 farmers out. of 300,000 and it must be remembered that it is a two-edged sword hecause when their incomes fall they will pay at a high rate on a low income. si ble member's time has expired. putT l i a t the question be uow p u t .

121,Mr Haworth (Isaacs) [11.22],"1receive adequate supplies of white sugar because of the existence of a large fruit canning and processing industry in that State. The Colonial Sugar Eefining Company Limited, which refines raw sugar in Victoria as in the other States, promised that supplies would be improved, but nothing has been done, and the position has gradually become worse. In Victoria there is now an absence of white milled sugar, whereas there is more of such sugar in other States than is needed. In New South ""Wales, the quota is now 125 per cent, of the normal grant, but in Victoria it is impossible during the fruit processing season to get white sugar at all. This is a great embarrassment to those engaged in the canning industry, and also to housewives. Various reasons have been advanced for the failure of supplies of white sugar m Victoria. We have been told that it is due to lack of shipping. At another time the excuse has been lack of machinery, and later has been scarcity of labour. The latest excuse is the number of holidays, particularly at Christmas time. of raw sugar in Victoria, and the Colonial Sugar Eefining Oompany is negotiating insurance to an amount of £500,000 to cover its holdings. The company, in reply to numerous protests against the present deplorable state of affairs, has promised to increase the 1946 ration to 100 per cent., but this will not meet the needs of Victoria, because the canning industry has expanded considerably since 1946, and more sugar is now needed than the company has offered to make available. The constant scarcity of white sugar in Victoria calls for some investigation, particularly at this time when proposals for increasing the price of sugar are under consideration. If it is right that the growers should receive a higher price, it is surely right that the consumers should receive fair treatment from tbe growers and from the other parties to the sugar agreement. Something should be done to ensure the equitable distribution of white sugar among the States. I ask the Government to ensure that sufficient white sugar is made available to meet the needs of the canning industry in Victoria as well as those of the people generally. I regret that it is necessary for me to emphasize once more the danger to the timber industry in Australia arising from the possible importation into this country of the timber pest known as the sirex wasp. At last one supporter of the Government has heen impelled to give more definite information on this subject than I was able to do. I am pleased that the honourable member for New England( Mr Drummond), who is interested in the timber industry in New South Wales, is alive to the danger represented by this imported pest. When I first raised this matter many months ago, I pointed out to the Minister concerned that the sirex wasp was considered to be the world's worse timber pest. I said that it had already affected the cultivated forests' in New Zealand, a fact which was causing some concern to the New Zealand Government because of the very large amount of money invested in those forests. I pointed out that there was ample evidence that timber being imported into Australia from northern There are tremendous stocks Europe was infested with sirex wasp. It appears that the only persons alive to the danger were those officials in Victoria who insisted that the cargoes should be fumigated in order to prevent the pest from getting ashore in Australia as it had done in New Zealand. Besides our native forests in Australia we have vast tracts of cultivated forests. I thought that when a committee was appointed to investigate this matter it would not take long to collect the available evidence, most of which would be of a scientific nature. Little evidence of value could be collected in Australia because of the lack of knowledge, even among our forestry officials, concerning this pest, which is not native to the country. About six or eight weeks ago I was informed by the secretary of the committee that it intended to take evidence in Sydney and in centres in Queensland. NowI learn from the reply to the question asked by the honourable member for New England that the committee is at present on a jaunt to New Zealand. While the committee has been making these extensive and far-flung inquiries, the dangers that I pointed out to the House",72,Sugar Timber Waterfron T
122,Mr Eoseveab (Dalley) [11.25],"some time ago liave become manifest. Huge cargoes of timber have arrived in Australia badly infested with .the sirex wasp. One firm alone, as thc honorahle member for New England( Mr product. They have nothing to do with Drummond) has mentioned, received 100,000 super, feet of timber which was badly infested with this pest. If the Government did its duty, it would arrange for the infested timber to be burned. The cost of fumigating the timber on its arrival in Australia was borne, not by the importers of the pestiferous timber, but by those unfortunate persons who had bought it. Furthermore, the timber did not comply with specifications relating to size. The Government should recall the committee and instruct.it to submit an immediate report covering its investigations. No advantage could be gained by the committee from an extensive tour of Australia. Australian forestry officials cannot speak with authority regarding this pest because it is foreign to this country. WhatI fear is that, unless immediate remedial action is taken, our cultivated forests will become infested as the cultivated forests of New Zealand have been infested. To permit the committee to go on a jaunt all over Australia and to extend its operations to New Zealand is to treat this very serious ma tter as a joke. The committee could have obtained all the information regarding the pest that is available in Australia by examining the scientific reports on it which are in the Parliamentary Library. If the committee wanted evidence of the effects of the pest in New Zealand, it could have obtained reports from the New Zealand Government without travelling to that dominion in order to obtain oral evidence. Now that the honourable member for New England has raised this matter there is a possibility that other honourable members will do so at the behest of their constituents. I trust that the Government will take immediate action to recall the members of the committee ancl to instruct .them to furnish a report without delay and without fur thei' expense. . [11.35] -In case the remarks of the honourable member for Isaacs( Mr Australian waters with large cargoes of Haworth) may be misunderstood, I wish to make it clear that the sugar-growers of Queensland are in no way responsible for the shortage of refined sugar in Victoria. The sugar-growers do everything possible to provide adequate supplies of the raw the refining process. The Queensland Government takes over the raw sugar, which is refined by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited under an agreement with that Government. The company has established refineries in each State. There has been some difficulty in the company's refinery in Victoria which has resulted from poor quality coal and the difficulty of securing adequate labour. The growers have endeavoured to meet the position by sending to Victoria a special raw sugar which is suitable for use by consumers. Samples of the special sugar were .made available through me to all Ministers and to all honourable members who represent Victorian constituencies. The growers have supplied 13,000 tons of this special sugar to the company for distribution in Victoria daring the shortage. Ample stocks should be available to household consumers as well as for manufacturing purposes. It is entirely wrong for any one to suggest that growers may be withholding supplies of refined sugar in anticipation of a price rise. The State Government and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited handle the refining of sugar, so no sinister action can be taken by the growers. The shortage of sugar in Victoria is purely a local matter which in no way is the responsibility of the sugar growers. I make these statements in order to clarify the position in justice to the sugar-growers of Queensland. I desire to make a protest on behalf of the Melbourne branch of the Waterside Workers Federation at the action of the Government in abolishing the CargoClearance Committee in that port. Thecommittee has done a very good job over a long period in clearing the approachesto the wharfs and in getting rid of congesbad last year, when many ships arrived in all kinds. Whatever may be the cause of the trouble in Melbourne-and it must be",73,Sugar Timber Waterfron T

124,"Mr Bernard Corser (Wide Bay) Tion On Wharfs, Which Was Particularly","largely a matter of difference of opinion between tbe representatives of tbe Melbourne Harbour Trust and tbe representatives of certain Commonwealth departments on the committee-the abolition of this committee will not aid in the solution of problems that arise in the port of Melbourne as the result of the arrival of large cargoes from overseas. I understand that a certain degree of congestion is arising again in Melbourne as the result of the disbandment of the committee. I was in Sydney during the Australia Day week-end and had an opportunity to see just how badly things were around the wharfs in that port because warehouses were closed and customs officials were not in attendance to deal with manifests whilst other persons who also had a part to play in clearing cargoes were absent. At the same time, the wharf labourers were working three shifts daily in order to load and unload cargoes. In Melbourne, the Cargo Clearance Committee was composed of representatives of the Melbourne Harbour Trust, the Department of Trade and Customs, the Department of Shipping, the ""Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, the Transport Workers Federation of Australia and representatives of several other bodies. On the 31st January last MrH . E. Clarke, the secretary of the Melbourne branch of the Waterside Workers Federation, received a letter from the Minister for Shipping and Transport (Senator McLeay) in these termsI liave been advised that tlie Melbourne Harbour Trust has undertaken to deal with any congestion which may arise in the future in the Port of Melbourne. I have directed, therefore, that the Cargo Clearance Committee, which previously functioned under the chairmanship of the 'Secretary of my Department, Mr C. H. McFadycn, should now be dissolved. The marked improvement in the conditions in the port brought about by the Committee was due very largely to the co-operation of the member organizations and I wish to thank you for your part in this achievement. Mr Clarke, believing that his union had been badly done by, replied to that letter as follows:Bear Sir, T have to acknowledge receipt of your communication of Slst ultimo wherein you advise that the Cargo Clearance Committee is now dissolved. 1 am completely at a loss to understand your decision to disband this Committee. However, I do know tliat you attended a secret meeting at the offices of the Melbourne Harbour Trust at which various bodies interested in waterfront affairs were represented. I have no doubt that you have allowed yourself to be influenced by decisions made at this meeting. Your own communication condemns your very action. For example you say this, and I quote:"" The marked improvement in the conditions in the port brought about by the Committee was due very largely to the co-operation of the member organizations and I wish to thank you for your part in this achievement."" How can you expect me to accept your decision to disband the Cargo Clearance Committee as being a genuine attempt to improve conditions in this port. As a matter of fact it can only result in shipping delays, slow turn-round of vessels, muddling and chaos. Again, how is one to reconcile your attitude wibh that of a brother Minister, the Minister for Labour and National Services Mr Holt. Mr Holt asks for closer co-operation between employer and employee, between management and industrial leaders and on the other hand you destroy an organization whose achievements in this regard are unquestioned. How can you expect results from a committee which, for example, does not include representatives of tlie Australian Stevedoring Industry Board, the authority solely responsible for the allocation and dispersement of all waterfront labour requirements, the bigirest single factor in thc expeditious handling of shipping. I can only conclude by condemning your action as being a retrograde step and one not worthy of the Minister for Shipping in a Federal Government. The Cargo Clearance Committee under the guidance of its chairman, Mr 0. McFadyen, the very able secretary of the Department of Shipping and Transport, has done a remarkable job in clearing up "" bottle-necks "" in the port of Melbourne. Shed congestion was reduced to a mini mum, and prior to January of this year it was many months since ships had been held up waiting for berthing accommodation. During January, 6,165 waterside workers were sent home without work because of shed congestion. That represented the handling of 52,320 tons of cargo or eleven vessels with f u l l cargoes. Representation on the committee included everybody who has an interest in ships ancl shipping and co-operation was splendid, its discussions being candid ancl open. It would appear that a most effective authority has been sacrificed for political reasons to the detriment of the port of Melbourne and its subsequent development. Unfortunately, there has been a clash of personalities and incompatibility of temperament between representatives of the Melbourne Harbour Trust and some Commonwealth departments, and as a result the assistance of the waterside workers and transport workers in clearing the port is no longer wanted. The Harbour Trust is to do all the work. I am afraid that it will not do it successfully. ment should again seek the co-operation of the Victorian Government in order to see whether something cannot be done to re-establish the Cargo Clearance Committee. I have no time for State-rightcrs regardless of where they may be found. If the Victorian Government is blameworthy in this matter, the Australian Government should place the blame on it. Any government that will not co-operate in speeding up the turn-round of ships is doing something that is detrimental to Australia. The Minister for Shipping and Transport should not allow decisions of a State body to influence him. Because the Harbour Trust refused to co-operate, the Minister should not say, in effect, "" ""We cannot get any co-operation and, therefore, the committee no longer exists "". The Government should take up the matter with the Victorian Government. Wherever cargo clearance committees do not exist they should be established. We cannot afford the luxury of having ships unnecessarily idle or dawdling around the coast. We hear a lot about delays in shipping. The workers are often blamed for such delays but, invariably, they arc due to congestion on the wharfs. most of the main ports the waterside workers have been working three shifts on every Sunday and every holiday both unloading and loading vessels. I urge the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) to persuade his colleagues to see the point of view of the Melbourne branch of the Waterside Workers Federation, because I am certain that if it is given effect we shall have no more reason to complain about congestion on the wharfs than we if r . Calwell. have had cause to complain during the last twelve months. [11.48] I wish to refer to the statements that the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) made with respoct to the sirex wasp. My attention was directed to this matter by a former member of the timber trade, who, in order to oblige a friend, arranged for the importation of approximately 100,000 super, f t . of pine. The specifications in respect of that timber indicated that it had to be of certain proportions and free from infection by sirex wasp. Unfortunately The Governwhen this shipment arrived it was found to be literally riddled with the pest. Apart from the fact that it did not conform to specifications, it was very poor stuff to which a good deal of bark adhered, although the specifications provided that it should have no bark. However, that was a matter for the person who imported the timber. The specimens which I saw were, I believe, and I am assured, representative of the whole. They were riddled with the pest, and the whole consignment had to be fumigated. In those circumstances, it appeared to me to be necessary that steps should be taken to protect the great timber industry of Australia from the introduction of what I have reason to believe is a most destructive pest which, so far, we have been able to avoid. The timber industry of Australia is most important; we have valuable softwoods as well as hardwoods. When whole shipments have been sent here by apparently unscrupulotis shippers, in this case from the neutral country of Sweden, it appeared to me that the matter should be brought to the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator O'Sullivan). InI supplied him with a sample of the type of timber which was specified, and indicated in the consignment notes and bills .of lading. I supplied him with specimens taken from this particular consignment, and I am pleased to be able to say that he assured me that he was raising the matter with the proper authorities in Sweden with a view to appropriate action being taken. I have no doubt that he will see to that matter, and that this kind of thing does not happen in future. The only appropriate action that should be taken with such a consignment is either",74,Sugar Timber Waterfron T

Interior, upon notice1. Isi t a fact that of a total expenditure of almost £20,000,000 in New South Wales on war service land settlement the direct Commonwealth contribution is approximately £500.000, or less than 3 per cent.? 2. Why docs the Government demand a voice in soldier settlement matters of the State out of all proportion to its financial contribution? the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Thc Commonwealth contribution to war service land settlement in New South Wales to the 31st December, 1951. totalled £020,221 in addition to the cost of £300,000 for rural training in that State. These amounts represent the cost of direct benefits to ex-servicemen settlers and are not repayable. On the other hand practically a l l the expenditure of £20,000,000 by the State of New South Wales comprises an investment in property on which the State receives rent in repayable advances to settlers on which interest is collected. 2. The State of New South Wales, at conferences in 1945, elected to undertake the settlement of ex-servicemen in that State under its own laws relating to land settlement. The Commonwealth has never attempted to restrict the State's activities in this field but has properly reserved its right to confine its own contributions to only those proposals which are on terms and conditions similar to those adopted in other principal States. This right was recognized by all States and was written into the agreements executed by the Commonwealth and all States. The Commonwealth has not demanded anything. It offered certain sums of money for certain purposes. I have objected to being an indirect but involved partner with the Statei n methods of settlement, which are the State's prerogative, but do not apply in any other States. terna l A f f a i r s , u p o n notice1.

The total borrowing programme approved by the Council for the States works programmes including housing amounted to £225,000,000 for the present year. Although this is less than the amount sought by the States, it is £00,000,000 greater than their approved programme last year. It is moreover very much in excess of the maximum amount obtainable from the loan market, and it was only made possible by the offer of the Commonwealth to make good from iis own resources any short-fall between loan raisings and. the approved loan programme.",77,Answers To Questions
