9,Sir William Mcmillan (Wentthan Those Involved In Granting Bonuses To,"to take over more and more of the States services. For instance, with the consent of the States, we have the right to take over the railways, and we might also, assume the control of their funded debts. But, in adopting the proposal to grant bonuses for the establishment of the iron industry by a State Government, we should be reversing this wholesome principle. It is proposed that £250,000 should be granted by -us in order to create a new service in one of the States. There is no authority in the -Constitution to justify us in granting money for the purpose, of creating a State industry over which we should have no -control. -admits that we have the right to grant a bonus to a private individual. because we could control it to some extent in that case. A private individual would cany on the industry only as long as it paid, and he would bear any loss that might be incurred, but we should have no -control over the business if we once handed it over to a State Government. If the iron industiy were established as a State concern in New South Wales, it might be conducted under conditions that would render it impossible to enter upon the same business in any other part of Australia; but there is no reason why we should with Commonwealth money foster an industry of that kind against the principle of equality of trade. I would point out to houorable members who hold free-trade views, thafc this policy of granting bonuses is associated with a scheme for the imposition of ad valorem duties. Some honourable members believe in bonuses pure and simple, but the policy of the Government is that the moment the iron industry has been established as the result of the bonus system, heavy ad -valorem duties shall be imposed fco keep it in existence. Therefore, I warn honourable members who profess free-trade principles, that thej' would not be voting for bonuses pure and simple, but for bonuses coupled with protective duties of a, highly objectionable, cliaracter. I hope the committee w ill reverse the vote previously recorded. It in any form, and especialfy to bonuses of was then generally understood that the States would have cheerfully acquiesced in the proposal. We are now, however, dealing with this question in the .'light of the fact fchafc the States will have nothing to do wifch it at present. The Government have in this matter displayed very bad judgment. W h y should we have been called upon to waste week after week in the discussion of proposals which were not embodied in the Government policy, and for which there is no urgent need? When the Prime Minister issued his manifesto, the principle he enunciated was "" revenue without destruction."" The Tariff was to be framed primarily for the purposes of obtaining revenue, but ifcs incidences were to be such thafc they would not harshly interfere with existing industries. Our State finances are still in such a position fchat no man can thoroughly understand them, and yet the Government ask us to vote £250,000 for the purpose, not of maintaining a struggling industry, but to encourage the establishment of an absolutely new enterprise. The proposal is unYes; timely, and should, on this account alone, be rejected. What right have we, until we know how our finances will stand, to vote £250,000 away-whic h will involve the raising of revenue to the extent of £1,000,000? Where is the money to come from? We might be committing ourselves to an expenditure which would seriously cripple our finances. It has been strongly urged on the one hand that we should dispense with loans, and endeavour to construct necessary public works out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and yet, at the same time, the Government propose fco give away £25.0,000 to establish an industry which, in spite of all bonuses, may prove a rank failure. We have no right to adopt either the original or the amended proposal. Apparently we have no responsible government here. I have asked the Minister for Trade and Customs if he intends to stand or fall by the proposed amendment, but I can get no answer. Are we to be told that the Government, if defeated, will pass the Bill even in an emasculated form ? If so, Ministers will not be discharging their duties according to the first principles of political honour. Are they prepared to father in another Chamber a measure of which thej' do not approve 1 If they do not disapprove of it , why should they seek to recommit it 1 As I have said, I am entirely opposed to the bonus sj'stem which certain Tariff arrangements are the complement. Further, I am strongly averse to any attempt to introduce a system of socialism which makes an enormous departure from the main principles of the Constitution.

11,Sir William Mcmillan,"country at the last general election, and I -do not believe it would be favoured by the majority of the people. Mr. CONROY (Werriwa) I think the position taken by the honourable member for Wentworth is a sound one. It might be urged by some honourable members that it is useless to seek for any promise from the -Government, because it would be impossible to rely upon them for any length of time. First of all they introduced a Bill which was intended to assist in the estabUshment of the iron industry by means of private enterprise. The committee, however, amended the Bill so as to provide that bonuses should be offered to State Governments only. This was a complete reversal of the Government policy, but Ministers led honourable members to believe that the alteration was just what they desired, and they cheerfully adopted it. Now they have changed front -once more, and are asking houorable members to upset the work already done. Is not that a wonderful position for any Ministry to assume ? Should the purpose of the Government in recommitting this Bill be defeated, do they intend to resign? Do they propose to stake their official existence upon the result of their action ? Anybody who knows thein knows that in their vocabulary the word "" B ill e t "" is spelt very differently from the word "" Bill,"" and consequently will not suspect them of cntertaining any such serious intention. If they are defeated upon their present proposal, we shall still find thein hanging on to their billets. Perhaps, we may even witness the spectacle of the Minister for Trade and Customs rising to declare that, despite what has happened, the Government are quite prepared to swallow whatever the committee choose to .present to them. Many reasons were given by the acting leader of the Opposition why honourable members should vote against the amendment. Having considered the matter very carefully, I cannot see my way to abandon the position which I previously took up in this connection. I have consistently opposed the bonus principle. I oppose its application to private individuals upon the ground that we have no light to assist any class at the expense-of the rest of the community. Oh the other hand I claim that no State is in need of the pecuniary help which we should afford it by the passing of this Bill. The least powerful of them is quite able to struggle along without any such aid. My 42 n 2 object in voting as I did upon a previous occasion was to insure that private individuals should not receive this artificial encouragement. The more I study the mattei' the more I am convinced that, owing to the very scant deposits of iron ore throughout the Commonwealth, this is an industry which should be controlled by the State. Evidently if it were placed in the hands of one or two private individuals it would be sure to develop into a monopoly. The same arguments which apply to the State ownership of railways are equally applicable to the State control of the iron industry. Honourable members should recollect tliat there are not more than one or two big deposits of iron throughout the Commonwealth. many more than that. deposits of true commercial value. Afte r closely examining the matter from all points of view, it seems to me highly undesirable that any private monopoly should be created in connection with the production of iron, and therefore I do not intend t c reverse my previous vote. That vote was given for the express purpose of. defeating this Bill. My imagination did not then depict the depths to which the Ministry are prepared to descend. I did nofc realize that, though the ""whole purport of the measure might be changed, they would still be prepared to accept it as their own. I never dreamed that Ministers would be ready to proceed with the Bill in a form absolutely different from that in which ifc was introduced. I should like to know how any honourable member who supports ""the clause as it stands can, at a later stage, turn round and say"" I voted in favour of granting a bonus to the States for the production of iron, but, because that proposal was defeated, I am now prepared to offer the same encouragement to private individuals."" I shall vote for the amendment; but, liaving done so, it will be impossible for me subsequently to favour granting a bonus to private individuals. The Ministry seem to be pushing this measure forward without rhyme or reason. Originally they fixed the date upon which it should come into operation as the 1st July of this year. That date has now passed, and because the Government saw that ifc was otherwise impossible to get the Bill through the House, they have given a reluctant",17,Bonuses For Manufactures

13,Mr Conroy,"There are not manyassurance that if it be carried they will possibly allow a day or two to elapse before they make it operative by proclamation. The object of providing for its enforcement thus early is to prevent people in other parts of tlie world from knowing that any encouragement is to be offered to private enterprise to engage in the production of iron. This knowledge will thus be confined to one or two firms who happen to be acquainted with what is transpiring here. The Minister for Trade and Customs has affirmed that he is almost certain that one or two firms will embark upon the undertaking. As he has seen the prospectus which they have issued, I should be glad if he would inform honourable members of the estimated cost of production as it is set down in that document. That information has been, carefully concealed from us. It has only to be pointed out to the Minister that there are one or two individuals who are prepared to engage in this enterprise, and he immediately becomes alert and eager to push any measure through this Chamber. second man in the committee who would make that statement 1 there is one who thinks it , including the honourable and learned member himself. thousands who believe it .

I was pointing out that no man is consistent in declaring that he is in favour of granting a bonus for the production of iron to the States exclusively, and afterwards affirming that he is willing to grant the same encouragement to a particular -individual or set of individuals. Minister for Trade and Customs himself made one declaration upon this point ou Friday last. Having affirmed that he is in favour of granting a bonus to the States, which is equivalent to collecting money from the people and handing it back to them, how can he consistently declare that his words had no reference to the people of Austraha, but were limited to the. members of a particular syndicate? These are the people of whom the Minister was thinking, and so far as language goes, seeing that there are probably more than one in the syndicate, he may be perfectly right in speaking of "" people."" But the Minister did not say from how many people the money had to be taken, and the. passing of this Bill will make the taking of the money none the less robbery. WhereverI find robbery, legal or otherwise, I shall denounce it, because I am against all injustice and oppression. The pity is that we too often find men who are skilled in tlie law using their abilities, not to uplift, but to degrade the people; and there is no doubt that the intent in the present instance is. to take from the whole of the commumity in order to give to individuals. I should be swerving from my duty if I did not oppose such a proposal, and I intend to fight this B ill at every step. I shall vote against the amendment proposed by the Government, and for the Bill as it now stands; and I trust that maijy honourable members intend to do likewise, so tliat we may have the pleasure of seeing what the Government will do in the event of a defeat. None but a prophet can tell what action the Government, may take under the circumstances, because they seem to be I must insist upon guided by no principles of honour or reason.

It behoves honourable members to vote steadily keep Ministers to their professions in favour of such a measure.

Owing to having to leave the House earlier than I expected, I had no opportunity of hearing the speech of the Minister for Trade and Customs last week, but on looking through the remarks which the honourable gentleman then made, I confess I cannot, place very much reliance on the Canadian statistics as published in tlie Year Book of Canada. The Minister made a strong point by comparing the returns of 1900 with the returns of 1901, but I do not think tliat one line of figures, which forms the basis of the Minister's argument, is very trustworthy. The Chamber of Commerce, As to production the Minister will, I think, acknowledge that the statistics from 1SS4 down to 18S9 or 1900 do not indicate the success of the bonus systeni. 1900' very encouraging, and the later figures much more so. declension of exports between 1885, the is not a declarayear in which bonuses first became operative, and 1900.

If there be a cause in existence for twelve or thirteen .years for the non-production of successful results, and the statistics show good, results in one year only, there must be some unknown factor to explain the apparent success of that one. year. If bonuses were in existence from 1884to-1900, and the statistics indicate failure, then the apparent success in 1900. must be dueto some other cause or causes. And we need not go very far to find the cause.

Surely if this Parliament frames a law under which a bonus can be given to a particular firm-o r we will say to six firms, one in each of the different States-that would be ultra vires of the constitution ; because it would be granting a preference to particular persons as against others. It would not be an uniform law. Similarly, if this Parliament frames a law which can be taken advantage of only by a State-whio h is really an individual in regard to our policy-it must be a violation of at least the spirit of the Constitution and probably also of the letter of it. I , thereCustoms be carried, we shall then have bhe fore, think that it is a mistake for those who have advocated the payment of bounties to States, to insist upon that policy. It may be a logical policy to prevent monopolies, but it is unconstitutional, and is open to the possibility of a great amount of political pressure from the States. Some State representatives will be trying to strengthen themselves relatively by comparing themselves with the .Federal Parliament and federal politicians ; and it will be found in the future that some State politicians will be standing on the ground of the pressure they are likely to bring to bear upon federal members, with a view of getting this bounty system extended for the benefit of the States. That is a vicious element to introduce into our policy, in addition to its unconstitutionality. Besides, we are not compelled to aid the States in this way. If a State wants to give a bounty to a particular industry, it can ask permission from the Federal Parliament to grant that bounty. relief. to give a bounty to an industry it can do so with the permission of the Federal Parliament. Andi t is a far more equitable course for a State like Tasmania-so well represented by my right honourable friend, Sir Edward Braddon-for the Legislature of such a State to grant a bonus to one of its own industries, if it wishes to do so. If the policy is a good one, we shall be glad to see it result in benefit to Tasmania; aud, if it is a bad one, the other States will not have to pay for an experiment which can benefit only Tasmania. intended some weeks ago, when this We must frame a general measure was discussed in the House, to say something in regard to its general principles. But I was too late for the second reading debate, and then I supposed that I had missed my opportunity.. This occasion gives me' another chance to say a few words on the general principles affecting the measure. It appears tome, in the first place, that the question is very much complicated by the situation which has been brought about in consequence of the amendment carried at the instance of the honourable member for Bland. Because, I take it, that if the amendment now proposed by the Minister for Trade and Bill before us in the position in which it originally stood, so that every honourable member will have the opportunity to say "" yes "" or "" no "" to the general principle of granting bonuses to private firms or companies. either to a State or to companies. able gentleman has nob very clearly announced his inbenbion bo bhe committee.

He knows that my object is to negative a more objectionable proposal than the one he has put into the Bill. BecauseI would infinitely rather see a bonus paid to private individuals than see -one granted to a State; for the reason that the granting of bonuses to States appears to me to open up an avenue for the worse form of political corruption, both in the working of a grear, enterprise of the kind proposed, and in creating a sort of channel through which unprincipled politicians could work all sorts of political purposes, by enlarging upon it and making it a sort of outlet for helping the employed and other classes who might assist them politically. But the question is not to be decided by figures such as have been mentioned by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn. Prom the free-trade point of view, it cannot matter what has been the result of Canadian experiments. point of view, a bonus to private individuals is as objectionable, on principle, as bonuses to States. The only thing we have to consider here, as free-traders, is whether iron is a commodity upon which we may fairly collect revenue for the purposes of the Commonwealth and of the States-whethe r it should not be included in the ordinary category of commodities upon which we have to collect from £8,500,000 to £9,000,000? My direct ""purpose, then--whic h may be pursued iu an indirect way-is to try to kill the Bill altogether, because I say, in the first place, that it is distinctty opposed to free-trade principles. BubI also say that it is opposed to the policy of the Government themselves, for the reason that, as the acting leader of the Opposition has pointed out, the policy laid down by the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth at Maitland was this"" We do not intend to protect industries; we ""are going to collect revenue."" But we never heard a word at Maitland a'bout the Government collecting a million of money more than was wanted for the Commonwealth and the States, in ordei to devote £250,000 out of tliat million to paying bonuses either to the The honourable ancl Sbabes or bo privabe individuals.

Therefore, if in bhe fubure bhe revenue of bhe Commonwealth does not show a surplus as it has done in the past, an extra million must be raised from Customs in order to get tbe £250,000. And for what ? Not bo prevenb bhe desbrucbion of industries, but to create entirely new industries in the Commonwealth. Has, bhat policy ever been foreshadowed by the Prime Minister, either at Maitland or elsewhere ? Honourable members will recollect what an amusing difliculty the right honourable gentleman at the head of the Customs department experienced when, during his speech upon, the Tariff, he was endeavouring to prove to the House that the object of the Government was really to collect revenue, and how now and then the truth came out of him and we found him warming up to the subject of protection. But the part he was playing, whateverhe might have felt or might have desired, was thisFrom that "" We are merely seeking revenue by means of tin's Tariff."" There is a complete reversal of that principle, because the Government are not merely seeking revenue, but they are deliberately taking four times the amount involved by bhis Bill out o£ revenue, and taxing, the people to the extent of another£1,000,000, in order to obtain £250,000 to give a-way bo assisb certain individuals or certain States to embark upon a particular industry.

My criticism of bonuses to private industry is this : that even from the point of view of the protectionists, fche proposal is premature. Wc must remember that it was only in January of last year that, for the first time in the history of Australia, the whole of tliis Commonwealth was offered as a market to this particular prise. We know that for years past attempts have been made in New South Wales to open np this industry. have been approached in order that a contract might be offered for a very large supply of railway iron, and whenever the persons interested have been told by free trade Ministers that this enterprise stand upon its own merits, they have always replied in these terms-"" We are shut out of Victoria by their Tariff. We are shut out of Queensland and South Australia and Mr Bruce Smith-. every other State in which railway iron is required for State railways."" Bnt in January of last year the whole situation was altered, because by the introduction of Inter-State If the State undertook this enfree-trade the whole of Australia wifch its population of 4,000,000 became a market for the enterprise. MrA . McLEAN I do nofc think that Victoria charged a duty upon railway iron. rails in Victoria. posed such a duty! That was the answer given by Mr Mitchell, dangerous who, as' many New Soutli Wales members know, was endeavouring to start the indusUpon these grounds I certry in that State. His answer was that he was shut out of the other States and had Moreover, the States have only the limited market of New South NotwithWales. MrA . McLEAN He had not read his Tariff. honourable members to know that, when I had the honour of filling the position of Minister of Worksi n New South Wales, Mr Mitchell, representing a very large iron industry, approached the Government and astonished-if made this practical proposal. He pointed out that when the Government bought their railway iron in England, they had to pay shipping charges, insurance, and the cost of Turning to the cartage of the railway iron to the particular industry, part of the Statei n which it was required. He made the suggestion tliat the Government should undertake to buy from a prospective company 150,000 tons of railway iron afc a price equivalent to the English cost, with shipping, insurance, and cartage charges added. The Government considered the proposal and offered to do what was asked. Mr Mitchell took some time to conentersider the matter, and he actually went to England for the purpose. The answer then came to the Government that, if they Ministries there would give the company a 10 per cent, advantage, they would accept the contract and startfcheindustry in New South Wales. It ended in nothing, but it satisfied me that there is no necessity for a bonus at all. must As the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Treasurer are aware, there was a firm or syndicate in existence many months ago, dealing with the New South Wales Government, who were prepared to take a",24,Bonuses For Manufactures

63,Mr Bruce Smith,"It may interestcontract for the railway iron required for the New South Wales railways upon much better terms than those now proposed by giving them a bonus. Seeing that it is admitted that in New South Wales there are very large iron deposits, and an unlimited quantity of coal, and seeing that only about eighteen months have elapsed since the market of the whole of Australia was thrown open to this industry, it is certainly premature that the Commonwealth Parliament should now be asked to tax the people of the Commonwealth to the extent of £1,000,000 in order to give this artificial support to an industry which we have no reason to suppose will not come into existence by natural means in a reasonable time. On free trade principles, therefore, I . am opposed to bonuses to private enterprise, and I am also opposed to bonuse| to States. The question is-Ho w can I , as an individual, effect my purpose best? As I have already said, it has been suggested to me as a member of the free-trade party that, by voting against the Government on this particular proposal to rescind the amendment of the labour party, the Bill would be made so objectionable, from the Government point of view, that Ministers would abandon it . If the Minister in charge of the B ill had told 'the committee that such was the case, I should have voted dead against it ; but inasmuch as it appears to me that the Minister is prepared to act either way in order that he may get his Bill for a bonus, or get some enactment within the very general order of leave which he has at the head of the measure-sinc e it seems to me that he is willing to take either a State bonus or a private bonus, I think I shall effect my purpose best by voting with him in order to rescind the proposal for a State bonus, and retain the hope that, when the general bonus to private individuals again comes before the committee, I shall have an opportunity of negativing that, also. I shall vote with the right honourable gentleman who has moved the rescission of this amendment, not to help him. but with a view to defeating his Bill., When this question was before honourable members some months since, in the form of Division YLv. of the Tariff, I delivered a speech in which I endeavoured to show that this particular industry required no protection whatever, and that consequent^' I should not think of voting in favour of a bonus. For many years past I have had opportunities for considering this question which many honourable members have not had, and I have gone into the subject pretty fully. I have already stated that I was in the confidence of the late Mr Mitchell, who had this project in hand, and who had obtained from the New South Wales Government the promise that, if he established the iron industry in the State, they would purchase from him the whole of the State requirements in the shape of iron rails, for a price equivalent to the ruling price abroad, plus freight and other charges incidental to importation. Mr Mitchell, however, failed to establish tlie industry. He was not certain at the time that he would be able to secure from the other State's a sufficient number of orders to make the enterprise profitable, but he believed that under federation-whic h was then in the air-h e would be able to establish it, and that with Inter-State free trade it would not only be able to standalone, butwouldbecomeaverythriviugundertaking. I have heard nothing from the Minister to cause me to believe that there was any tiling unsound in the arguments which I brought forward upon the last occasion ; but all the arguments advanced during the long and instructive debate which took place then have been passed over by him without notice. The right honourable gentleman, however, referred to some statistics of a rather doubtful character which appear in the Canadian Yea/r Book for 1901 Buti t is stated there that the figures regarding the consumption of native.ore are only approximate and subject to revision, and a significant note is added to the effect bhat the ore used was imported very largely from foreign counbries likewise, a greab deal of ib being broughb from Newfoundland, which, as honourable members know, is nob parb of the Dominion of Canada. When the Bill was originally in committee, I supportedthe amendment moved by the honourable member for Bland, which added to clause -3 the proviso which the Minister now wishes to rescind. I voted for that proviso in order to throw upon the Government the responsibility of giving encouragement to State socialism. It was not part of the policy of the Government, as announced at Maitland, to give encouragement to Sbate socialism, and I naturally supposed bhab bhe addition of bhe proviso bo the clause would cause them to drop the measure. But, true to his characteristics,",25,Bonuses For Manufactures
64,Mr Henbywillis (Robertson)!,"the Ministei of Trade and Customs has 1 stuck to the Bill. I admire the man who will stick to his measures, but I should not admire the Minister who adhered to a measure which provided for the establishment of collectivism in connection w t h the iron industry. Although a great deal might be said in favour of the establishment of the iron industry by one of the States Governments, the people have not asked fOF an application of the principle of State socialism in that direction, and until there is an agitation, in favour of it in all parts of Australia, I do not think we shall be justified in taking the course provided for in the Bill. My reason for voting for the proviso was that I considered that tlie most effective way of defeating the bonus system., a system to which I think; all free-traders are opposed. We, on, this side, are now revenoietariffisbs as a matter of necessity; but I hope that the time is not far distant when I shall be able to vote strictly according to my principles, in favour of free-trade as it was understood in New South Wales and exists in Great Britain. Of course, whilerevenue-taritfism is necessary, I am prepared to stick to my party in supporting it. But, as a f rae-trader, I think I shall be doing, my duty in assistingto retain in this Bill a propoly by a duty, which, on the first revision viso which will render it unacceptable to tliose for whose benefit it was introduced. All the autliorities upon the bonus system whom I have been able to consult are agreed that if a bounty oi; bonus is paid for the estabbhe faeb bhat bhe original bomus! was equal lishment of an industry, and a portion of the customs receipts are applied for tlie purpose, the bulk of tbe community, rich and poor alike, contribute in proportion to their appetites. I contend that if a definite sum of money is to be given for what the Minister calls the ""sufficient establishment"" of this orany othei industry, it 1 should be levied by direct taxation, and the people who benefit most from the establishment of the industry, tliose who have a large stakei n the country, should pay for thab benefit in proportion to their wealth, rather than in proportion to their appetites and the size of their families. It is only by voting for the proviso in the clause that we can at the present time accomplish our object of wrecking bhe bonus sysbem for which the Bill provides. If bhe Bill were passed, the people Of New South Wales would contribute 4s. of the 12s. per ton, or £83,000 of bhe £250,000, which ib is proposed bo JI/)-. Henry Willis. pay for the production of pig-iron, puddlediron, and other raw material set out in class 1 of the schedule, while Victoria would contributeabout another third, and the remaining four Sbates of the Union the balance. If the establishment of the iron industry were likely to prove of equal value to every State in proportion to its population, something might be said for the proposal in the B ill ; but there are not more than two States, and, as pointed out by the honourable and learned member for Parkes, in all probability only one, New South Wales, in which bhe iron industry is likely to be esbablished. That being so, the fact constitutes a strong, argument in favour of putting aside the proposal. But the Bill does not provide only for the granting, of bonuses. A bonus is to be given which, at the beginning, will equal approximately 20 per cent, of the value of the iron produced; but at the end of five years it is to cease, and its place is to be taken by an import duty upon iron of 10 per cent., which is apparently to remain for all time. No doubt there are protectionists who might be found to support a 10 per cent, duty upon iron, but would any one support the establishment and retention of a monoof bhe Tariff,, would probably be raised to 2.0 -or 30 per cent % A very plausible argument for the raising of theimport duty from 10 per eent. bo 2.0 per cent, would be to 20 per cent, upon tlie value of the iron produced-, that the industry was still in its infawy, and bhat it employed thousands of men who would be thrown out of employment if. more protection were not granted to it .

66,Mr Henrywillis,"I have beenbeen said, but I know the object of the interviews, and I had experience of the lobbying which took place last year. The provision which tlie Government now -wish to rescind was deliberately agreed to by the committee, and it must be inferred from the action of the Government that they .are. of opinion that it should not be retained in the Bill, the proposal being no part of their policy. That being so, they will be justified in dropping the Billi f the amendment of the Minister is negatived. Surely the Government will not adopt the decision of the third party in this Chamber as theu policy, and if the committee do not reverse the decision previously arrived afc thei'e will be no course open to them but to drop the Bill. The Minister stated that he was induced to ask the committee to reconsider their decision by the attitude assumed by the States; but no other result could have been expected. allowed to remain, private enterprise is not likely to be encouraged, because it will be open to one or all of the States to embark upon the manufacture of iron at any time, and to bring their unlimited resources to bear against any private competitors. This would prevent capitalists from investing at least £500,000 in plant for the establishment of ironworks. An investment of this kind would in its turn involve the further expenditure of millions of money, and give employment to thousands of men. Some honourable members may ask why the States should refuse to avail themselves of the bonuses proposed to be offered. In the first place, there is very little likelihood of any State besides New South Wales being in a position to establish the industry, and that State would derive no material assistance from the granting of a bonus, because she would have to contribute very largely to the maintenance of the system. Moreover; the Ne.w South Wales Government is independent of the Federal Government, and as States Ministers are very jealous with regard to the'Federal Government, we can easily understand their dismissing the proposal with a shrug of the shoulders. If New South Wales desired to establish the iron industry she could do so with greater advantage by remaining independent of all aid from the Federal authorities. Under the bonus system proposed by the Government she would have to contribute one-third of the outlay involved by the system, and as it is unlikely that the impecunious States will be able to bear their share of the .expenditure, a further fairly heavy burden will probably fall upon the mother. State. Therefore New South Wales would have the advantage of only the Victorian contribution of one-third of tlie cost. This would be equivalent to 4s. out of the 12s. per ton proposed to be granted for the manufacture of iron. If New South Wales were to establish ironworks entirely on her own acounfc, she would lie -able to obtain her own materials where she chose. She might, for instance, obtain supplies of hematite, which is required in the manufacture of pig iron, from New Caledonia. Upon this subject George Griffith, in his work, In an Unkncnc-n Prison Land, says :If the proviso is At Prony, not only the rocks and the boulders,, bnt the very sands of the shore themselves were of iron-sometime s pure, bufc as a rule containing from 85 to 90 per cent, of the metal. Millions of tons of it are lying round the shoresof one offchefinestand safest natural harbors in the world. A thousand miles away are tbecoalfields of New South Wales. Since it pays, fco ship copper aud iron from Spain, mid even Soubh America,fcoSwansea, one wouldfchinkifc would pay to ship this to Newcastle: However, fchere it lies, waiting, I suppose, for some one to make fortunes out of it. That is the finest deposit of ore in tliese southern seas, and would be extremely valuable to New South Wales. Freedom to draw upon the resources of New Caledonia would be worth more to New South Wales than 4s., or even 12s., per ton bonus.. Probably this is one of the reasons which actuated the New South Wales Government in intimating that they had nointention to avail themselves of the provisions of this measure. Sir John See, in his reply to tbe 'Minister for Trade and Customs, said:I desire to inform youfchafcmy Government havegivenfchefullest considerationfcofchematter of fche establishment of ironworks ancl works of a kindred character, and are of opinion that such should be carried out by private enterprise rather than by the Government offcheState. I might addfchatwe favour both a duty and a bonus, and should be glad to support any action taken hy the Federal Government in regard thereto. That is a very courteous reply, and such ! as one would expect from the Governj ment of an important State like New1 South AVales. even more emphatic in his statement to Parliament. , believe ifc. As free-traders we are fully prepared to learn that the protectionist Government of New South Wales is in favour of a protective policy in regard to the iron industry. They know that if pressure were brought' to bear upon them to establish the iron industry as a State concern, they would be at liberty to act quite independently of the reply which they have forwarded. As a free-trader I am opposed to the bonus system, and I wish it to be understood that I think that the Bill should be made unacceptable to Parliament, and that the most effective way of securing its defeat is by retaining the proviso. The responsibility in this matter must rest upon the Government, and they must stand or fall by their policy. I do not think that the way in which I intend to vote should be interpreted to mean that I am an advocate of State socialism. In Australia, however, there are very many State socialists. They are to be found upon both sides of this Chamber, and in the ranks of the most conservative in other parts of the world. The very conditions which prevail in Austi'alia tend to make a man a State socialist in many directions. Ifc is not long since the Honourable Sir William Hareourt was asked whether he did not 'favour the municipalization of certain services in England, fco which he replied"" Gh, now we are all State socialists."" To a certain extent I think we are all State socialists, because we not only favour the municipalization of such services as gas, water and sewerage, fuel and ferries, but we have deliberately enacted that our railways, tramways, telephones, and post-offices shall be under the direct control of the State, a form of State socialism which very few of us would be willing to abolish. be considered upon its merits. ifc werefchewill of the people that the production of iron should be nationalized I do not think that in bowing to it one would have to swallow much more than he has done in the direction of State Socialism. But if we give a bonus of 20 per cent, upon fche production of iron to private individuals, ! See was the probability is that, at a later stage, an attempt will be made to increase it to 30 per cent., and. thereby increase the railway I can quite freights to farmers and other primary producers. orable gentleman knows much better than I do what is asked of Parliament upon occasions. I can quite conceive of this Parliament being requested afc some future period when the Tariff is under revision, to increase the bonus proposed to be granted under"" this Bill, and I think that the advocates of such a proposal would be able to make out a plausible case by urging that the encouragement whicli had been afforded the industiy was insufficient. But I should like to point out to honourable members fchat the possibilities of the iron trade in Australia are enormous. The ordinary requirements of the States themselves are considerable. For example, in connection with fche railway which it is proposed to construct between Kalgoorlie ancl Port Augusta, besides the steel rails required, pipes will need to be laid along the whole routea distance of 1,000 miles. Then the consumption of iron in the construction of tlie transcontinental railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek will be enormous. I am convinced, from correspondence which I have had with ironmasters in England, that capitalists are quite prepared to establish this industry in Australia without any encouragement being granted to them in the way of protection, provided they are guaranteed the trade of the several States. Knowing tliat, I am perfectly satisfied that ironworks can be profitably established here without 'any artificial aid. My parliamentary experience, and my observations of the working of a protective system extending over many years, convince me that if we once establish this industry by granting a bonus to private individuals, that bonus, in the form of a protective duty, will not be withdrawn from them in my lifetime, or in that of the Minister The money that would be paid by the people would amount to millions sterling, and their annual _ contributions would pay the interest upon millions of bonded debt with which they are now ""so heavily weighted. If the iron industry is native to Australia, then ifc can be established in our midst without any artificial aid. Not a single",27,Bonuses For Manufactures

72,Mr Henry Willis,"The right honargument has been adduced to show that it is not native to the Commonwealth. Indeed, there is everything to prove the contrary. The facts that in this young country an enormous demand exists for iron in various forms, and that we possess every metal required in connection with its production such metals, for example, as wolfram prove conclusively thafc fche industry is native to the soil, and requires no protection whatever, though it may need some encouragement in the way of 3 guaranteeing. to it the trade of the several States. If the Government would interest themselves to the extent of inducing the States fco give their trade for a certain number of years to any particular firm embarking upon this enterprise upon the lines laid down by the present leader of the Opposition when Premier of New South Wales, the industry would secure all the encouragement that ifc requires, and the people would benefit to a great extent. Moreover, the iron industry in Australia enjoys a high measure of natural protection, inasmuch as the freight charges upon imported iron, as I learn from the expert who recently came to Australia from London, range from 17s. 6d. to 20s. per ton. Honourable members have been informed that pig-iron is brought out as ballast, and that very little freight is paid upon imported iron. I have ifc, however, upon the authority of the expert from London, that the freight to Western Australia is 17s. 6d. per ton, whilst to the other Statesi t is 20s. per ton. ber contrasted oversea freights with local freights 1 that the Minister has referred to local freights, because ib seems to me that the rails and pipes required for the great trunk line which is projected from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta might advantageously be taken to the latter place, thus saving the i cost of 200 or 300 miles of railway haulage, as compared with that which would be incurred if they were taken to Eremantle. Similarly, in connection with the proposed line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, it would be wise to send the rails to Port Darwin, inasmuch as the Pine Creek railway is only 145 miles in length, whereas Oodnadatta is 688 miles from Adelaide. As New South Wales is the Statei n which this industry is most likely to be established, honourable members will recognise that the local freights would be a very small consideration as compared with the natural advanbages which bhe industry would enjoy by reason of ibs geographical position. I would further point out fchat much of the iron ore used in Great Britain is imported from Spain or South America, whilst the wolfram comes from other parts. Altogether, the oversea carriage referred to by the Minister is much greater in England than it would be if we had to import our ore to a very large extent from New Caledonia. is that it should be brought from Tasmania. the expense would not be greater to bring it from New Caledonia. Off the coast of Queensland there is an island which is composed largely of wolfram. That wolfram could be landed in Sydney at a much lower cost than that for which wolfram is selling in England at the present time. We have everything thafc is required in connection with the iron industiy, including the iron ore, wolfram, limestone, and coal, in very close proximity bo water carriage, which is bhe cheapest; form of carriage available, and bherefore we enjoy nabural advanbages which do nob exisb bo bhe same exbenb in England. These advanbages are such bhat bhe indusbry can be esbablished in Ausbralia wibhoub any artificial aid whatever. These are some of the reasons which will induce me to confirm the vote that I gave upon a previous occasion, and to side with those who favour the retention of the provisio in the Bill. I believe in freedom of commerce as far as possible, and I hope that my vote -will be the means of setting aside this measure, seeing that the object of the Government in recommitting it could only have been to. induce honourable members to reconsider their previous decision. If the committee will not reverse their previous decision, we may reasonably expect the Government to cast the Bill under the table, and I shall be very glad if that course be taken. I feel that I ought to say a few words explanatory of the vote I am about to give.

I voted for the amendment of the honourable member for Bland, being of opinion that if a bonus had to be given it -was preferable to give it to a State rather than to an individual. changed. We have had the distinct announcement without exception, that they will not undertake fche enterprise. more definite or unmistakeable than the pronouncement of Sir John See, who, in addition, has distinctly stated, in response to queries in the Parliament of New South Wales, that his Government have made up their minds to have nothing to do with the establishment proposal before us is therefore not free from difficulty to one who, Uke myself, does not believe in bonuses, but has an anxious desire to see the industry started. industry could and would be started even without the aid of a bonus, and if we vote to retain the clause as at present, in view of the expressed intention of the States Governments, we shall not only kill the proposal for a bonus, but also prevent the possibility of outside persons undertaking the for no private company would venture on such undertakings with the menace of a State bonus over them. If the Governments will not undertake the enterprise, the least we can do is to leave fche way open for private individuals. capital is already at hand, and everything favours the undertaking by private enterprise afc an early date. At any rate we have now an adequate market, and the possibility of production on a competitive scale; and to maintain the clause at present would simply mean the shutting out of any chance of the establishment of tlie industry, even without Mr Joseph Coo!;. maintain my own principles at the later Whilst listening to stages of the Bill, and resist any proposal to kill the enterprise while trying to k ill the Bill.

80,Mr Watson,"Certainly ; because Iprepared to now accept the compromise of giving two years' priority to the States. We ought to have some indication of the presentMinisterial attitude. some doubt as to whether the States were likely to undertake the iron industry, I was inclined, in the first instance, to fix a period during which they might have preference of claim for the bonus. Since that time, however, we have had the fullest information on the subject. his willingness to make such a compromise .af ter he got the information from the States. f i promise of tliat sort were made, there is no doubt that an attempt ought to be made to fulfil it ; but the position has been properly and strongly put that such ii provision would, amount to a sort of threat that private enterprise might at any moment be exposed to competition with a subsidized State Government. I am inclined to think that the better course would be not to introduce a limitation of the kind. It would be useless and open to objection as a standing menace to private individuals embarking on the enterprise. sufficient explanation for the Minister to say that the promise was given to the honourable member for Bland before it was known that the Government would have a majority of six in the division just taken. Now that the voice of the Committee is in favour of the Government no more need be said. Perhaps if the debate continues a -little longer, the Minister may be able to tliink of some other reason than that I have indicated, or he may change his mind with the -same readiness he showed a few minutes ago. Then again, on two occasions last week the Minister said he was in favour of giving bonuses to the States. If he is in favour of that policy, how can he favour giving bonuses to individuals'( I trust that any honourable member who voted i u favour of State bonuses will be careful to give his reasons before he departs from that vote and supports a proposal enabling the bonuses to be granted to private individuals. Iron is fche raw material of over twenty trades. Are we to tax the twenty for the benefit of one"" The proposal of the Minister is not only to tax them in this way, but, in addition, to impose a protective duty of 10 per cent Iron is more largely 42 u used than is any other material, and the very fact of imposing this duty will tend largely to discourage manufactures. But I do not think there will be much backsliding from amongst those who are in favour of the State as opposed to private individuals undertaking the iron industry. Let honourable members look at the energy the Minister has displayed in connection with this question. Look at the way he has spoken to his brief! Bufc he has nofc ventured to state his reason for changing his opinion on the question of the manufacture of iron by States or individuals. This is the man who originally came here with a character for I do not think so. If standing up to his opinions. Apparently, in his view, standing up for one's opinions means only standing up for them when there is a majority in their favour. My objection to the clause as it stands is that we are asked to give a bonus to a set of individuals, and not one, word of argument has been adduced in favour of it. The Estimates are nob yet before us, and we do not even know wherefchemoney is to come from. Mr BBjOWN (Canobolas) I do not wish to be unfair or uncharitable, but it is remarkably strange to see the Minister for Trade and Customs in the new guise of champion of private enterprise when the other night we heard him so eloquently claiming that the manufacture of iron was a proper subject for governmental control. He then pointed out tliat his only difliculty was to know whether the States Governments would take the matteiin hand, and he said that if he were assured that they would, no member of this House would be more ready to give them that opportunity and tc assist them in every way than he would. Now the Minister is asked whether he will give the States the reasonable period of two years within which to consider their position. Up to the present the matter has not been seriously considered by the States as States. A hurried decision has been arrived at by different Governments for the time being, but though they control the affairs of the States to-day they may be gone to-morrow. Because of that opinion the Minister ranges himself under the banner of private enterprise, and is fighting, not for what he professed last week, but for a set of private capitalists.

119,Sir William Mcmillan,"The rightpeople of the Empire. I shall explain that. We passed a resolution here the other day, and the Government gave its countenance to a proposal by which private individuals would have an opportunity of starting an industry of this kind. That course was taken on the good faith of the Government in the passing of a certain part of our Tariff, and yet the very Government who proposed this have turned round and accepted an absolutely different principle, and have thrown over those people who attached some importance to the faith of Ministers. What are we to expect from responsible government if no one can know what the intentions of Ministers are ? The best thing we can do now is to negative the whole clause, and let the B i ll be at once destroyed. That is the only proper course to pursue. I do think that my honourable friends of the labour party ought really to accept the opinion of this House upon the matter as so far expressed. pend this proposal for a year, or for two years, we shall practically be attempting to legislate for the next Parliament. If a year is proposed we shall be then under the shadow of a general election. What private enterprise in the world would attempt to undertake an industry of this kind under those circumstances t I say we are trifling with the whole thing from beginning to end. Let us decide upon one tiling or fche other, like responsible people, and not make ourselves the laughing stock of tlie outside public, as we are doing. I hope no attempt' will be made to interfere with the vote which has been taken. I intend ' to vote against the clause altogether, in order to save time and have the Bill put under the table. enough for the honourable member for Wentworth to talk of accepting the vote of the committee ; but those of us who desire to go a little but of the beaten track in political movements find it rather an unwise thing to accept the vote of the committee, because we do not quite know how soon that vote may be changed. opinions of some honourable members are concerned, they have changed very considerably within the last few weeks, and the Minister has changed his opinion within the last few minutes. I understood that he was going to stand by the proposal he made last week. who voted with him. ber for Melbourne had been in his place, and had heard the proposal the right honourable gentleman made last week, he would understand that it was that the States should have priority of claim to the bonus for a period of two years. derstood that. forward another proposal which, from the point of view of those who desire to see the States given an opportunity of going into this industry, is not worth a snap of the finger. What opportunity is afforded to a minority that may exist at present in a State to become a majority in favour of entering upon this enterprise in twelve months' time 1 There would not be time even to shift a Ministry, clinging limpet-like to their seats, in that period. We cannot expect tlie people "" So far "" is good. of New South Wales, of Tasmania, or of If we susany other State in which coal and iron are found togetlier, fco give an expression of opinion upon this subject, except at a general election, and no general election is due in any of the States likely fco enter upon this industry for tlie next two years. Unless we allow a few years during which we may get an expression of opinion from them, it is utterly useless to put forward any such proposal as the Minister now indicates that he is willing to agree to. So far as I am concerned, therefore, I say that I have no option left but to vote agaiust the B ill and the clause. I say, at the same time, that I am prepared to vote for such a proposal if sufficient time is. given. I think the honourable meniber for Kennedy ought to persist with his amendment seeking to enact a period of two years within which priority shall'be given to the States. Any less period than that is of no value. Two years is even too short, but 1 am satisfied that we cannot expect any definite expression of opinion on this subject to be obtained from New South Wales in less than that time. The present So far as the State Ministry is not likely to take the matter up until tlie pressure of public opinion is strong enough to induce them to do so.

126,' Mr Watson,"The Minister'now putsmost recently by the Minister is quite different in spirit from that put forward last -week, -when the right honourable gentleman spoke a second time upon this subject. The Minister proposes now to give twelve months' priority to the States. The minimum period spoken of last week was two years; the period of one year is inadequate. what surprised at this reversal of attitude on the part of the Government. It is difficult for honourable members to understand where they really are. W it h regard to the proposal to give the States priority for a period of two years, I would point out that those who support it say in the same breath that there is not the slightest chance of the States taking advantage of it . trary. ber said there is no chance of a general election taking place in either New South Wales or Tasmania for two years to come. election would take place within two years. formed by the Governments of those States that they have no intention whatever of taking action towards the establishment of. the iron industry as a State monopoly. Is there any likelihood that their-attitude will be changed until. there has been a general election ? within less than two years. It has taken a shorter period than that to convert other Governments in regard to other reforms. not be forced until there has been an election. The sooner we have a decided opinion from the Government in regard to this matter the better it will be for all parties. On a previous occasion, when a provision similar to that now submitted by the honourable member for Kennedy was before the committee, those who now advocate it refused to accept it as a compromise ; they would have nothing less than the complete control of the iron industry by the States Governments. I am amongst those who have no fear that the persons employed in this industry would be injured if it were undertaken by private enterprise, since Parliament can always control the conditions under which it must be carried out; but why do the Government blow hot and cold upon tliis matter ? I voted for the excision of the proviso because I believed that the Government would abide by the decision of 'the committee, but we had hardly arrived at a decision before they went back upon their own statements. Their action has been unfair to their supporters and to the committee generally. and Customs stated last week that he wasin favour of this proposal. Sir MALCOI.SI McEACHAKN --Certainly nofc. that the Government would stand by the clause as it was originally introduced. We have been informed by the Minister that the States Governments refused point plank to take steps for the establishment of the'iron industry. We know that many honourable members voted for the pi ovision, not because they are in favour of it, but because they wished to defeat the Bill, and if the Government are not now going to stand by the clause as it was originally introduced, I shall refuse to countenance the We have been incontinuance of the present farcical proceedings, and, although I have told my constituents that I am in favour of granting bonuses for the establishment of the iron industry, shall vote against the Bill. honourable member for Moira has rightlydescribed these proceedings as farcical. I never knew a Minister to trifle with a committee as the Minister for Trade and Customs has trifled with this committee. If he had had any intention of supporting a proB u t their hands canposal for the giving of a preference to the States Governments for any period, he would not have asked the committee to excise the proviso added to the clause on the motion of the honourable member for Bland, but would have moved the addition to it of words which would carry out his intention.

Then the division took place upon the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Bland, and it was carried against the Government by 25 votes to 12, or a majority of 13. How does our position to-night differ in the slightest degree from that we occupied on the 19th June? reconsidered the question, and have decided to take a different course. N cisely the same as it was ? There is no doubt about it . We were opposed to the absolute limitation of the bonuses for all time to the States, but we were in favour of a preference being, given to the States for a limited time. Upon both these issues we were beaten, and we had time for further con-r sideration. What did we do when we-were defeated ? We reported progress immediately after the amendment was carried against us. Since then we have obtained further information on the subject, and our first objeit was to remove the amendment propused by the honourable member for Bland, and carried against us. move it if a preference is to be given to the Statesfor. a, period of two years. raised in different ways, and we are similarly raising them now. AVe have succeeded in removing the proviso inserted at the instance of the honourable member for Bland, and we nowfind ourselves face to face with a proposal, for which we ourselves voted on the L9th June, giving a preference to the States for a limited time. I admit that there are now stronger reasons for rejecting, tliat amendment than existed some time ago. I have mentioned these, and 1 have pointed, out the further evidence we have witli regard to the unfavorable attitude of the States. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN orable member said it was-fatal. I went so far. as that, although X spoke strongly. On .Friday last I saidIf'the States are willing to undertake this work, let us give them a reasonable period in which to do so, but do not let us conserve to themfchelight for allfcime,and give the private individual no chance. That statement was made in the early part of my speech. istei' had said that the States would not entertain the idea. What is the use of giving them an opportunity of doing something which they say tliey will not do ? may be done in the future. There may be a change in the attitude of the States at any time, and, in view of the wide division of opinion upon this subject, it is only fair that we should endeavour to meet the views of those who believe that there is a likelihood of the States embarking upon the enterprise. I should not be treating the committee fairly if I refused to give an opportunity of the character referred to. I have previously indicated that it is not our intention to bring the bonuses into force immediately, because it is inexpedient that we should play directly into the hands of any particular individuals.

He was one of those honourable members who endeavoured to assist us in doing that which we are now proposing to do, namely, to give the States, by way of preference for' a certain period, a chance to earn the bonus. The honourable member did not hold then, because the proposal was negatived when he voted for it -and that was only six weeks ago-that it was hjs duty to support the exclusive application of the bonus to private in The right hondividuals. I do not think that and I stated them again to-day. ber has shown by his vote to-day, for which we thank him, that the attitude we have adopted in resisting the limitation of the bonuses to the States, to the total exclusion of all private enterprise, is tlie right one.

165,Mr Kingston,"The honourable memask the committee to give fair consideration to this mattei , and to recognise that tlie attitude of the Government has been consistent and just throughout. Minister has quoted from Hansard, but it will be apparent to lionorable members when . tliey have the report of the Minister's speech in their hands that on the occasion to which he has referred he wasspeaking, not of his intention, but of his belief. He said that he "" believed "" that the States should conduct such enterprises as that proposed in connection with the establishment of ironworks, and he suggested that we should give the States a chance to do so. That is what he had always said, but in his hand at that particular moment he held a sheaf of telegrams, which he read later, and from which it appeared that the States had not the slightest intention to take advantage of the provisions of the Bill. Therefore what 1 the right honourable member then said with regard to his intention had reference to his past intention. when he spoke was that the whole matter should be left to private enterprise. The right honourable gentleman has referred to his utterances on Friday afternoon, but when honourable members have an opportunity to read the Mansard report they will see that there is not one line of the context that will convey the impression, that the Minister was then in favour of giving the States one or two years in which to make up their minds. When we pleaded for time, he pointed to the telegrams as conveying the final decree of the States, and he said in so many words that the Sbates had no intention of going on with the enterprise. In the face of that does the Minister mean to tell the committee that on Friday afternoon he was in favour of giving the States an opportunity of reconsidering the matter ? I am sure that when the pages of Hansard come into the hands of honourable* members they will see how utterly baseless such a contention is. The Minister represented that the States had left him in such a position that he had no option but to declare in favour of granting bonuses for the encouragement of private enterprise. Now he has the hardihood to tell us that he has not changed his mind. What was he fighting for ? Why was he so anxious to recommit the Bill? There was no necessity to recommit the Bill if he had held his present view all throughfchepiece.. I utterly deny that the Minister has treated the committee fairly. I have seen a number of extraordinary gyrations on the part of Ministers, but I am sure that no honourable member has ever witnessed or read of anything equal to the last performance of: the Minister for Trade and Customs. The honourable member for Wentworth has referred to the Government as a committee to record the votes of honourable members, but we do not want even a committee. All we require is a sort of automatic push or pull machine into which we can place our motions and then count our votes. There would be, at least, some stability in such a machine. member want ? what the Government is now proposing, but what guarantee have we that they will not proceed upon another tack by this time His intention to-morrow? Our position is not to be altered by charging some honourable members on this side of the House with inconsistency. Some honourable members who supported the Government to-day did so for the same reason that actuated them in voting against them on a previous occasion. They wished to k i ll the Bill, and they were perfectly consistent, and were perfectly within their rights in voting as they did. We do not want the Bill, which has been introduced by the Government for its o^yn purposes. The Government have posed as the guardians and saviours of the people, and have professed to be anxious to provide work for the unemployed, and to give private enterprise a chance, but when private enterprise had a chance the Government basely threw it over. I am sure that if any member of the syndicate interested in this matter could be permitted to express his opinion regarding the attitude of the Minister, he would use terms a hundred times more harsh than any employed by us. He says that the attitude of the Government to-day is the same as it was upon the 19th June last. That is utterly untrue. ber must withdraw that statement. draw it , and say. that the statement of the right honourable gentleman is not borne out by the facts which I shall place before the",38,Malcolm Mceacharn Th E Right Government Had Thrown I T Under The Table

186,Mr Isaacs,"The writer shows thatrun no risk, as a Commonwealth, in seeing that fche States have the .same opportunities as are given to private individuals. It is misleading to say that we are going to benefit private individuals. primary object is to benefit the people of the Commonwealth as a whole, and if we can only do that by giving inducements to private enterprise as well as to the States, wiry should we be deterred from taking that course? Why should we deprive ourselves .of great benefits merely because some of our citizens may derive advantage? I hopefchafc,whatever happens, we shall nofc by any slip or accident prevent the development on this continent of an industry khich is the mother of fche arts and the source of most of the sciences. the Minister in charge of fche Bill has not given his final ultimatum upon the question under consideration. I am glad to know tliat he is disposed fco.consider fche request thafc has been submitted to him, and I hope that he will be able to gee his way to consentfcofchewhole of fchafc request which, under the circumstances, is not an unreasonable one. The honourable and learned member for Indi has pointed out the great importance of the iron industry, and the desirableness of doing everything within reason to encourage it. I . agree with him as to its importance, and I am desirous of taking such a course as will permit of its development on lines that I believe will be in the best interests of the Commonwealth. We have nationalized our railway systems, and the States Governments are the great consumers of iron. Therefore, I hold that it is necessary that the Commonwealth should nationalize the iron industiy, and take in hand the work of producing iron from native ores. If the Government simply limit themselves to the mere production of the iron that is required in respect of railways and defence equipment, they will effect a saving in regard fco very extensive works. Buti t is also within the right of the Commonwealth to endeavour to produce iron, not only for its own special requirements, but for general consumption. Therefore when the question of expending the taxpayers' money arises, and one has to choose between granting bonuses for the purpose of assisting private industry and expenditure through State or Federal channels, as the case may be, I prefer to give my support to expenditure under the supervision of the State or Federal Governments. I should prefer to have a proviso in the Bill limiting the bonuses to the States, so thafc they should not be made available Our great fco private enterprise. I should be willing to let that stand until such time as the people of the States indicated through their Governments that fchey were nofc prepared as States, to take up the iron industry. ThenI should be agreeable to withdraw any opposition I might have offered to private enterprise taking the matter in hand. But the Minister has asked the committee to rescind the decision deliberately arrived at, and has succeeded in carrying what he desired in that respect. The right honourable gentleman cannot, however, shut his eyes to the fact' that with respect, to this matter we have a very strange combination. On the previous occasion votes were cast against the proposal of the Government with a view of defeating the Bill, and in the hope that ifc would be dropped. Bufc, asfcheGovernment were not prepared to drop their proposals, the ground has been shifted. A number of votes have been recorded for fche Government thafc were cast against them previously. I want fco know whether the Minister for Trade and Customs expects those votes to carry him through ? If so, I venture to prophesy that when the next division takes place he will find that some of those honourable members who previously supported him will vote against him. That conclusion is warranted by the tenor of several of the addresses that have been given. Possibty, the Minister hopes to counteract the loss of votes in that direction by the support he gains from the labour corner. I want to see the iron industry established under State supervision. Bufc as fche proposal which I support has been defeated I have ' to face the new position that presents itself. A t the outset, I ask the Minister whether ' he is prepared to insert the two. years' proviso II f so, I am willing to support him in his proposal. But, if he insists upon the twelve months' provision, I consider that he will be simply holding out an invitation to the Statesfchafcwill really mean nothing whatever. I will give my reasons for that opinion. The Minister tells us that the States Governments have indicated fchat they are opposed to undertaking the iron industry. But so far as I can read the communications fchat have been received, they are really opposed to taking it up at present.",43,Malcolm Mceacharn Th E Right Government Had Thrown I T Under The Table
187,Mr Brown (Canobolas),"I hope thatany way ; they hold out no hope. gentleman says that the States Governments do not qualify their statements in any way, but the impression conveyed to my mind by the communications was that the States Governments were not prepared to take up the industry at present, and that they preferred to see it taken in hand by private enterprise, and supported by Tariff preferences, as well as by bonuses. But I want to invite the Minister's attention to this phase of the question. The New South Wales Government now has in hand the matter of the expiration of the pastoral leases of the northern division which fell in about a couple of years ago. The question is awaiting legislation in respect to future treatment. That legislation waspromised last session, buthad to give way to other legislation the States or by private enterprise. dealing with thewestern division of the State, which occupied the greater part of the time. The promise made by tlie New South Wales Government to the people is that this new comprehensive legislation upon the land question shall be the subject engaging the attention of ParUament for the corning session. It is well known that tlie land question in New South Wales is very difficult and intricate, that to deal with it requires a whole session, and ""that there is great difficulty in compressing its consideration even within the limits of a session. up that question it practically means that the whole of the time at the disposal of ParUament will be occupied for the coming year. It is customary for Parliament to prorogue about Christmas, and not meet again until about May. How, therefore, can the New South Wales Parliament be expected to take any effective step with.regard to the iron industry within the next twelve months? years' limit is -fixed it will give the-people reasonable time to express -their opinions. Further, I should like to remind the Government that within two years this Parliament will have gone to its masters, who, in the meantime, will have had an opportunity to say whetlier those who voted for State enterprise or for private enterprise being assisted in this way meet with public approval. I am prepared to support the two years'"" proposal, and what is more, I am prepared to assist the Minister in carrying his measure if it be adopted. I am not in the position of being a false friend to the measure. I undertake to give the B ill my The right honourable support light through if the Minister accepts this proposal. member talks of the two years' period, does he mean for the establishment of the industry ? which a State shall have the right to take the work in hand, and within which to satisfy the Commonwealth Government that it seriously intends to establish the iron industry. If , at the end of two years, the States Governments intimate that they do not intend to pursue-the work, -I am prepared to let it be done by private enterprise. But I want the people of the States to have a fair opportunity of saying whether they want the iron industry to be carried on by For the reasons I have indicated, twelve months is not a sufficient time within which to get an expression of opinion upon this subject from the. people of New South Wales, whilst two years would, I think, be a fairly reasonable time. If the right honourable gentleman insists upon limiting the time to twelve months, I feel that the greater part of that time will have passed away before the State Parliament will have completed the important work Of land legislation at present .pressing upon ifcs attention. Even if ifc desires seriously to face If a State Government takes this question a session in which it can be dealt with cannot be convened before the twelve months is up, and that will be used as an argument against dealing with it at all. All I ask is, that the people of the State shall have a reasonable opportunity to express their wishes on this matter, and that we shall not be tied down to expressions of opinion received from persons who are Premiers toButi f the two day, but who may not be Premiers tomorrow or in a little fcime hence. If a period of two years is provided for, I shall assist the right honourable gentleman to cany the Bill. Buti f he refuses that, the position I have to face is whether an insufficient time, like twelve months should induce me to support it , or whether ifc would be wiser to knock the Bill out and leave it an open question until we can deal with ifc with a greater amount of information as to the feelings of the people upon the subject than we have at the present time.",44,Malcolm Mceacharn Th E Right Government Had Thrown I T Under The Table

I made. withdrawal of the honourable member, but if he looks into the matter a Uttle more he will find that it is necessaiy for him to go still further back. to know exactly the attitude the Government take upon this amendment. A t one minute we are told they are going to agree to it and at the next that they are not. They now appear to be trying to find out from the committee in some mysterious way whether a provision for two years' time can be carried against them or not. Surely Ministers should be able to say what they 1 intend to do 1 Is the right lionorable gentleman going tosfcand by his proposalfor twelve months? Apparently, if he finds that there is not quit? a sufficient number to carry the proposalfor two years, he will urge the proposal for twelve months, and if he finds that there wUl not be a sufficient numberfcocarry thafc proposal he will-throw it over also-jus t as before, when he discovered that he had six votes to the good, he found thafc no explanation was needed as to why he changed his opinion. I may be discussing a proposal for two years when the Government, in order-to -save appearances, will accept one year eleven months and twenty-seven days. The Minister appearsfcobe quite indifferent as to -the fate of the Bill, provided he can retain the appearanee of carrying some -measure which will come under the same -heading. Honourable members who are supporting this proposal for a two years' preference for the State, argue, first of all, that 'from the very nature of it the iron industry would be practically a monopoly, and it should not therefore fall into the hands of private individuals. If it is in the nature of a monopoly, that is no doubt a sound argument in support of the contention that the -States should take it up, but the Minister says that he has certain replies from the State Governments, and that they are not going to deal with ifc. It is for this reason the right honourable gentleman proposes to hand it over entirely to private individuals. Honourable members ask for a period of preference for the States, and from their point of viewT do not think the two years asked for is .too long. It will be some months before any State Parliament can discuss the. subject and decide whether or not it will deal with it . If the State Parliaments decide to deal with it, some months will necessarily elapse before I acknowledge the the . undertaking can be got into working order. That is a sufficient reason for asking for a period of two years. There is another argument in 'favour of the proposal in the fact that within the next two years general -elections will take place in two or three of the'States, and it maj' be that a State ParUament which at the present time refuses to deal with this matter will then be ready to deal with it . Another argument may be adduced on behalf of the Commonwealth Parliament itself. When the Commonwealth is being asked tavoteaway a very large sum of money-without authority from'the people and without in any -way .consulting the electors, it is only-right that some care should be exercised. Let honourable members look at the effect upon the men who are engaged in the foundry and machine trades for which iron is the raw material, if the industiy falls into the hands of private individuals who determine to make 'the most of the monopoly they will have. If the State conducted the industry arguments could be brought to bear to show why the price of the raw material, pig-iron, should be kept as low as possible. In that case other-States would bring arguments to ""bear upon the particular Statei n which the industiy was being carried on. They would be able-to point out that in the interests of the men engaged in their machine shops and foundries it was absolutely necessaiy tliat their raw material should be-kept as low in price as possible. I can leave it to the committee to say whether, if the industry were in the hands of a private company, those engaged in the trades to which I have referred could go to the company and say, ""This iron which you manufacture is the raw material for industries employing twenty men where you only employ one."" The answer would be, "" We are established here under an Act of Parliament in which it I was promised that bonuses to the amount of",45,Malcolm Mceacharn Th E Right Government Had Thrown I T Under The Table

I think these people would be entitled to contend that a succeeding Parliament was, to a. certain extent, bound by the agreement made. Holding that view, it is perfectly clear that, though I am strongly opposed to the Bill, I must try to insist upon a delay that will give time not only to one person, but to a great many persons to come in and take advantage of its provisions. Let me give another argument which must appeal to those who hold that private enterprise should undertake this work.

There being no expression of dissent, I withdraw it . bane) I do not wish to unduly prolong the debate, but there is a principle involved in the action of the Minister for Trade and Customs this afternoon which does not commend itself to my political intelligence, and I therefore, wish to say a few words on the matter. On a former occasion the honourable member for Bland carried an amendment restricting the granting of bonuses to the Governments of States, and this afternoon, after a debate which has extended over some days, the Minister succeeded in rescinding that amendment. Now, however, we are asked to consider another amendment which, though different from, is very similar to the proviso which has just been struck out, ancl the Minister has swung round as quickly as a gale at sea, ancl proposes to accept what the committee thought they had decided, when agreeing to his amendment this afternoon, not to accept.

It must be remembered that this is not a Parliament of a State, but a. much higher political body.

A great principle is involved. The Ministry ask us now to vote for what they were originally opposed to, and therefore I think it is about time thab some of us retired from our present position, as supporters of the Government. ' We have given the Ministry consistent support, and have very frequently abstained from expressing our opinions in order to facilitate business, and many of us find it difficult to comprehend the action of the Government in ignoring the existence of their followers. A spirit of tyranny exists amongst Ministers worse than that which characterized the Cissars. The Emperors of Rome did take some of their supporters into their counsels, but the Ministry treat their followers with scorn. Mr G. B.

224,,"It is not for the Mr MACDONALD-PATERSON I have been very successfully managed in deed ; and so far as tramway management is concerned, I think that any comparison between the private and State-owned systems in operation in Melbourne and Sydney respectively must result in favour of the latter. No tramway enterprise in Australia has been so successful as that of Sydney. tramways return only 3 56 per cent, upon of whether the people desire that another the capital outlay. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The honourable the establishment of ironworks shall be member seems to think that the' Sydney left to private enterprise. To that extent tramways are not successful because they we are bound to consult the people in each only return 3'56 per cent., but he must adof the States.

If the tramways return purely protective purposes, as being opposed more thansufneient to pay the interest on the to the spirit of the Constitution. The money borrowed for their construction, and bonuses now proposed are nothing but the afford cheap travelling facilities, and tend converse of tlie protective duties provided -to improve the value of suburban properties, for in the Tariff; and if it is -wrong to tax they must be regarded as successful. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN There is no analogy between providing travelling facilities and establishing the iron industry. Mr G. B. EDWARDS It is rather late in the day to debate the abstract question of State versus private enterprise. I firmly believe that the whole world is progressing in the direction of the State control of all works of general utility, and I do not regret that this principle is being extended, because so long as we develop in that direction slowly enough, no danger need be apprehended. The manufacture of the iron is an enterprise upon which tlie State Government might fairly embark. U p to the present time, private capitalists have not entered upon it, and as we all -wish to see it established, we might legitimately trust the States to undertake it . By adopting the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Kennedy, we shall, I believe do good in all directions, and I cannot see why the Government should oppose it . The Minister has told us that he has no objection to the States entering upon .this industry, and his only reply ,to those who were content to leave the matter to the States was that the States Governments had intimated that there was no immediate probability of their taking the matter up. Upon this ground, and no other, he declined to restrict the enterprise to State control. It must be admitted, however, that the replies of certain Premiers who hold ofiice at present cannot be taken to represent the voice of the people. If we allow the States two years in which to make socialistic experiment shall be made, or that stitutional difficulty might arise if we taxed others in order to provide the necesI t is in the sary money. I protested at one time the people of one State in order to secure -the establishment of the manufactures in another, it must be equally wrong to impose protective duties upon all the States for the benefit of the manufacturers of Victoria. Another advantage of the proposal wbich we are now considering is, that if we allow the -States two years within which to decide whether they will embark upon the manufacture of iron, we shall probably not be called upon to provide the funds necessary for the bonuses for at least another year. This delay will enable us to make more suitable financial arrangements than would otherwise be possible. The Government have supplied us witli no data upon which we can determine whether the circumstances of the Commonwealth will enable us to pay these large bonuses. A t any rate we might well defer tlie consideration of this measure for one or two years. I cannot understand how, in the light of his previous utterances, the right honourable gentleman in charge of the Bill can oppose an amendment in the direction of placing the iron industiy under State control. H he is sincere in this matter he will surely agree to allow a reasonable time to. elapse within whicli pressure can be brought to bear upon the States' Governments to induce them to take up this work.

I have done what I could for the purpose of making the position of the Government as clear as is the noonday sun. Any honourable member who has been in the Chamber during tlie debates upon this question must agree that we left no room for doubt that above all things we desired to .witness the early establishment of the iron industry. That was the chief object which we had in view. We did not fail, to indicate that we should prefer to see the industry established by a State on behalf of all its people rather than by. any company, which, however large, could not hope to rival the State industry in extent or in the area over which the benefits of the concession would be distributed. ""Does any honorablo member suggest that we did not speak plainly in that connection ? I knownothing whicli I have omitted to do, and which could have been done, to insure the successful passing of the Bill upon those lines. I ask the honourable member for South Sydney-and I do not speak in the slightest degree with intent to leave any cause for regret-wha t is his position iu regard to this matter? practically reproaches us with the fact that the Bill is not in the best shape. That is the reproach which he ventures to cast upon the Government of the day. I tell him that it is not our fault; it is his. to-day he advocates, and in each instance he voted against it. Herei t is recorded in black, and white, on the 19th of June, page 13941 of Hansard. Upon the division which took place as to whether a preference of two years should be given to tlie States to undertake the work if they so pleased, the Government supporting it and doing all they could for the' purpose of carrying it , we find it recorded that the vote of the honourable member for South Sydney was cast against us. * Mr G.<B. EDWARDS -That is right. as a quotation, but is it right when the honourable member rises in his place and 43 J? 2 reproaches us-as he has done to-nightfor not moving in a certain direction? I say that the fault, at least, is his. We tried to do so weeks ago, and he did his best for the purpose of preventing our desires from being carried out. Similarly as regards the question of confining the Bill to the States. We voted against that proposal, and he voted in favour of it . Under such circumstances, how does it lie in his mouth to reproach us. The honourable and learned member for Brisbane has said that the Government have turned round, and that he cannot conceive of any reason for it. Of course he cannot if he is absent from the Ohamber and does not know what is going on. We have not held caucuses, and I do not know that I believe in them. vernment are not going bo tyrannise over me. to tyrannise.

MrM c DONALD ment will be carried and that honourable members will not allow themselves to be whipped into line for the sake of certain people who specially desire this concession. I understand that if the amendment is carried it may interfere with certain individuals who have almost floated companies to carry on this industry. Mr BiicCE SMITH -Floated them in their own interest. MrM c DONALD people floating companies in their own interest; probably I should do the same if I were in their position. Buti t is not a proper thing to do; and the passing of the Bil l at the present moment will only assist those people to float their companies to greater advantage. If a company had been formed, and were prepared to carry on the industry straight away, I do not know that I should have objected so strongly; but neither the Federal Government nor the States Governments ought to grant concessions to assist people in floating companies to greater advantage. I gave a fair illustration the other night, which I think can be borne out by the honourable member for Melbourne. The Chillagoe concession was the means of enabling certain individuals in Melbourne to make a considerable amount of money, leaving the "" babj to be nursed "" 7 by others. The Chillagoe syndicate could not have made the thousands of pounds they did had it not been for the concessions from the Government, and similar results will follow the granting of the concession now proposed. Mi'. KINGSTON have suggestions made, in regard to letters written by Ministers to honourable members, and I cannot understand why such allusions should be made by tlie honourable member for Kennedy. Surely Ministers have a right to communicate with whom they please. Does the honourable member suggest that the letters were such as ought not to have been written ? References of the kind should not be made unless the documents are produced and some charge formulated.

The reason the honourable member has not made a charge I do not object to is that he cannot do so. I never held conversations with honourable members, or wrote letters of which I have reason to be ashamed ; and it is too bad that such conduct should be indulged in for the purpose of discrediting Ministers.

It is nofc fair to recommit clauses involving large questions of principle which have been debated hour after hour, and I shall divide the House on the proposal to recommit clause 151.
