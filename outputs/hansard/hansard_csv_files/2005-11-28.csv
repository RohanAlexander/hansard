Details follow: (a) (i) Community attitudes to trade survey conducted nationally by a random telephone survey of 1,200 people aged 18 years and over in capital city and non-capital city areas. Specifically, the research explored community attitudes and perceptions about: the contribution exports make to the Australian economy and to own standard of living; awareness of various organisations; awareness of the services Austrade provides; the importance that a government organisation like Austrade performs its role; whether recall seeing/hearing media reports about international trade; whether small, medium and large businesses make a major or minor contribution to Australia’s total exports; the effect of trade on jobs in Australia; the importance of trade to regional and rural parts of Australia; whether “free trade” is good or bad for the Australian economy; attitudes to “Free trade agreements”. The results of each survey help to refine key messages, target groups and advocacy campaigns in relation to general trade outreach and advocacy of new policy directions. (b) (i) Cost of the consultancy was $35,080. (a) (ii) Website useability testing, six one-on-one sessions to test the design and architecture of Austrade’s website.

(b) (iii) The cost of the consultancy engaged to conduct the survey was $25,780. (a) (iv) Client Service Improvement Study (CSIS). In 2004, Austrade commissioned an external research agency to conduct a study of client satisfaction with Austrade’s export services. This is called the Client Service Improvement Study (CSIS). This is in addition to the EMDG research and it should be noted that Austrade clients are only included in the sample pool for one piece of research to ensure that Austrade does not overburden clients with research requests. The objectives of the study are to: Obtain client satisfaction ratings for Austrade (overall) as well as for each of the Austrade offshore regions and individual posts Determine the key drivers of client satisfaction Ensure that the feedback received from clients aligns with standards set in the Client Service Charter Identify specific service deficiencies that can then be analysed and used to provide insight into Austrade’s future performance. The study included a component focussing on satisfaction with Austrade’s New Exporter Development Program (NEDP). In addition to the above the objectives of the NEDP research is to examine the following: What services were provided to participants in the NEDP Performance against agreed deliverables Program participants’ success rate in achieving exports Rating of the experience at each stage of the Program Coaching given to clients and export readiness Value, if any, of market visits Follow up to the Program What participants expected from the Program and what they valued about it; conversely what frustrated or disappointed them Characteristics of participating businesses. (b) (iv) The Client Service Improvement Study was contracted at $142, 735. (a) (v) Service Offering& Brand Positioning Research. In 2004 Austrade conducted research on our service offering and brand positioning. The research was designed to cover three separate but related areas of interest: How well does Austrade’s recently developed segmentation work in practice? Do clients and potential clients prefer the new presentation of services that has been prepared for them – and can clients in different segments easily see which services are relevant to them? Preliminary work towards developing a new positioning statement for Austrade. The research consisted of in-depth interviews with exporters and potential exporters in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. Both users (current and lapsed) and non-users of Austrade services were included, with users being drawn from both the mainstream and NEDP client lists. The research was conducted in early May 2004.
