WereI to allow the honourable member to proceed, I might be put in an awkward position, because he might conclude with a perfectly legitimate question, though one not really designed to elicit information. Very often questions are asked which are not prompted by the desire to obtain information, and such questions should not be asked. I shall be glad if the honourable member will say straight out what it is that he wishes to know. the attention of the Prime Minister has been called to the inconsistency of these -gentlemen in advocating the cessation of party warfare the honourable member' is proceeding to ask are not permissible. When a member founds a question on a newspaper report, it is very often difficult for me to divine what he really intends to say. I 1 have warned the House on several occasions that questions such as this should not be asked. As a matter of fact, I do not think that questions should be founded on newspaper reports, and if the practice continues, I shall have to put a stop to it. I have allowed, as far as possible, legitimate questions for the eliciting of information, but I must prevent the asking of questions of the sort now being asked. WEST TAMWORTH POST OFFICE.

German concentration camp, and found that every statement that had been made to me in regard to it was correct. There are 1,300 prisoners interned there, and ©very man is provided with a new, warm overcoat. What is more, there is a surplus stock in the racks waiting for other prisoners who may be sent there. The lack of uniforms at the Liverpool M i l i tary Camp is general. Some men who have been in camp for two months have had only the clothes they were wearing at the time they enlisted. They have been training and doing the ordinary work of the camp in these clothes, w it h the result tliat their garments have speedily become almost unfit to wear. I was assured that many of these young fellows had been unable to go home to say farewell to their parents or .friends, because they could not appear before thera* decently clad. One man assured me that ho had spent nearly £ 2 0 on clothes which he had been compelled to wear since he had gone into camp. He had been there over two months. ber mean to say that he had worn out £ 2 0 worth of'clothes in two months? that he had been in camp for four I saw months. A t the Redfern railway station, a few weeks ago, I met a young fellow whom I have known for some years, and who told me that he was leaving for the f r o n t with the 13th Regiment two days later. When I inquired why he was not in uniform he said, "" I have no uniHe replied' that most of them form, but we have been told that uniforms w ill be issued on the morning of the day upon which we embark."" He told me that he had been in camp six weeks, that he had never handled a rifle in his life before he enlisted, and that way to enhe had not undergone any rifle practice since he had been in camp. No ammuI f tlie Government want nition, he said, was available at the butts, and no blank cartridge was obtainable to demonstrate to the men how to fill the My informant went magazines of their rifles. This young fellow told me further that there were only t h i r ty rifles available for 500 men for training purposes, and that they were of an obsolete pattern, so that any in struction given to the men regarding the use of them would be valueless when they received the Lithgow rifles. That statement was confirmed by scores of men upon my visit to the camp. Men also I paid a visit to the told me that some of the rifles coming from Lithgow are defective, inasmuch as the screws attached to the "" sights,"" which regulate the distance you desire to shoot at, were becoming detached and lost, thus making one of the most important sections of the rifle quite useless. This lack of rifle practice constitutes th© gra'vest charge against the military authorities. I am bringing forward this matter, not in any party spirit, but in the interests of the men themselves. It is almost criminal to send away these boys before they have received th© necessary rifle practice.

60,Mr Fisher,"I know what I am speakaxe now leaving as reinforcements, and if they are to be useful as reinforcements they w ill not be able to stop at Egypt, but must go direct to the front. One of my complaints is that there have been sent away as reinforcements men who have been in camp at Liverpool for only a week. If the authorities wish to send seasoned men-o r men who have had some degree of practice-as reinforcements, why should they not select those who have been longest in camp, and who have had some training, instead of calling for volunteers from men who have been in camp for only a few days? Continuing my investigations, I found that the huts which are being erected for the men a€ Liverpool, while a big improvement in many respects on the tents, are really no improvement in the direction of conserving health. They are too draughty. The floors of these huts, which are laid on brick piers, have a space of from 1 foot to 2 feet beneath them, and since they are laid down in sections, openings arc l e ft through which the draught comes up. The men are provided only with a waterproof sheet and three blankets for bedding, so that honourable members can understand the discomfort which they suffer and the liability to catch cold under which they labour. Fogs are very prevalent at Liverpool and colds are common. men consists of chest and throat troubles. These huts do not protect them from such complaints. The men in their spare time are fillin g in the openings in their huts in order to t r y to keep out the draught Hundreds of cases of pneumonia and kindred complaints have gone through the hospital, and numerous deaths have resulted. I would earnestly suggest to the Department the necessity of supplying the men in camp with mattresses. Straw is cheap enough, and straw mattresses would add to the comfort and protection of the men. in the making should be pampered and coddled, b u t we must take into consideration the fact that many of the men in camp have gone there direct fro m good homes, and that they have never had to rough it . One of the first considerations of the Government should be to insure tlie health of the troops. These men at Liverpool Camp at present are not receiving the consideration they deserve. Owing to the draughty character of the huts those A lot of these troops occupying them are liable to catch cold even more readily than would be the case if they were under canvas. Considering the hardships and suffering which lie before them, we should at least make our lads decently comfortable while they are learning the work of a soldier. Each of these huts is occupied by forty-six men, and I find that no provision is made in them for the storage of bread. Bread is issued every night, and lies exposed in the huts all night, without even a partition between the bread and the men who are sleeping there. The Government should consider the desirableness of applying to our military camps some of the provisions that the various State Governments apply to ordinary employers of labour, to protect the well-being of their men. I ask the House to consider the difference between the treatment of the Germans at the concentration camp and our men at Liverpool. I found that those interned at the German concentration camp had everything possible to make them comfortable. They had straw mattresses and decent bunks, whereas our men at the Liverpool Military Camp say anything apparently is good enough for them. They say, "" We are treated not like men, but like dogs."" ment to make. The principal sickness amongst the the truth in repeating what is said in the camp. do a lot to encourage recruiting! Mx.

A want of system also prevails in connection with the hospital arrangements. It is said that men are asked to line up at 6.45 in the morning, and if they are not in the ranks at that hour they cannot .be seen again by a medical man u n t i l evening, they being called upon to do their ordinary duties during the day.

When a man is not sick enough to go into hospital, and is given a prescription, the first thing the chemist asks is, "" Where is your bottle ?"" Naturally, the man replies that he has no bottle; and he is then informed that he cannot have any medicine until he produces one.

We have plenty of fully-equipped Australian doctors, and some of these ought to be placed in charge. I should now like to refer to the matter of the horses. Last week I asked the Assistant Minister of Defence a question in regard to 1,200 horses having been left at the Liverpool Remount Depot without feed, and the honourable gentleman practically admitted the fact. Here we have horsesa living asset of £30,000-lef t without feed. A t Liverpool the horses are tied in an enclosure, the ground of which is as bare as the floor of this chamber. The animals receive a few handfuls of feed per day, but as no nose-bags are available, these have to be improvised. Until very recently there were no halters, and I was informed, on reliable authority, that some horses had to be tied up with string. cotton ? question, and is not a subject for unseemly levity. The men of t i e 12th L i g h t Horse, who left recently, were compelled, after asking in vain for halters, to purchase some out of the money privately subscribed to provide comforts for the troops; and they had difficulty in getting What a refund. A t the same time, I am in formed that at the Ordnance Department there are halters galore, and that their non-supply is all due to red-tape, with which the place is reeking. It does not seem to matter how urgent the need, weeks may elapse before it is supplied. In order to show how wasteful the Department can be in some directions and fighting penurious in others, I may point out that, though a water main passes within a few yard's of one hospital, and could be connected with the institution at a cost of about £ 5 , the authorities have been paying a contractor 15s. a day for months past to cart water to this hospital. They can waste money in this direction, but they have no money to spare in order to provide medicine bottles for the troops.

Before the authorities erect any mora huts at the military camp they should certainly go to the concentration camp, and take a leaf out of the books of the authorities there.

Advices, dated 25th March, stated that everypositions in order to discharge their duty thing possible was being* done by the United States Ambassador at Berlin for the inspection of camps and relief of prisoners. The correspondence shows that British prisoners, witb a few notable exceptions, have been treated with studied cruelty.

The major stated, on the authority of a French priest:"" The German soldiers kick the British prisoners in the stomach, and break their A t the German conguns over their backs.

115,Mr Orchard,"Notwithstandin g thethe type that they represent. They have proved their worth on the heights of Gallipoli . The officers of whom I speak are about to take the places of officers who have sacrificed their lives there, and who, by their fearless daring and dash-assisted by their gallant men-hav e made one of the most glorious pages in the eventful history of our Empire. The officers who are about to go to the f r o n t are men who have been engaged in various professions and businesses, and naturally a good many details in connection with their private affairs require to be attended to before they leave Australia. It has been generally understood that the military authorities have been in the habit of allowing them ample time to complete these arrangements. cently an order was issued under which these officers are required to appear at 10 o'clock in the morning before the Commanding Oflicer at the Camp, and to state their reasons for desiring leave. If the reasons advanced are satisfactory, passes are issued under which they are permitted to leave the Camp. But at the gates they are stopped by a sentry who examines their passes before they are allowed to proceed. On reaching the bridge, another sentry is encountered, and the .same procedure is.repeated. On the day -of my visit to the Camp an officer chanced to be leaving it in a cab, with the result that nearly the whole of the traffic on -the road was hung up whilst his pass was -being examined. I do not say that the precaution is altogether unnecessary from a military point of view, but considering that these men have big private interests, I think that more latitude should be allowed them to arrange their private affairs. By adopting the password a good deal of the existing friction in respect of officers' leave might be avoided. ' My investigations have convinced me that -some very great change is necessary if we desire to make our military machine an effective one. I am sure that one of the causes of dissatisfaction in the Liverpool -Camp arises from the evil of centralization. I am assured that it is necessary to send to head-quarters in Melbourne for official confirmation of everything that is done at the Camp. The omcers dare not act without that oflicial confirmation. In his report last year General Ian Hamil -ton predicted that this would be the case if war ever broke out. He expressed his -opinion in very strong terms, as will be seen by reference to paragraph 73, at page 25 of his reportActually, the Australian system, as it exists to-day, is so purely a product -of peace procedure that it could not hope to carry on beyond ' the first few weeks of war. The centralization in the Defence Department at Melbourne exceeds anything I have experienced during more than forty years' service in India, in the United Kingdom, and in every part of the world where troops administered by the British War Office are stationed. That this centralization is due wholly to the existing system of financial control I am not prepared to assert; but, unquestionably, it is on financial grounds that the present mass of petty questions, which in a well-ordered business would be dealt with locally, are now referred from districts to head-quarters. Hence an inevitable tendency to centralize in other branches of work. Hence* also, an increasing unwillingB u t reness on the part of officers to act on their own responsibility. Hence, again, a real danger that, in course of time, the spirit of initiative throughout the Army may suffer. Hence, finally, the most fruitful cause of disaster in time of war-namely , the collapse of the officer trained for many years to be frightened to death of a sixpence when he is suddenlycalled upon to decide a matter in which thousands of pounds may be involved. That prediction is being verified to-day. I am of opinion that many of our high officers, as the result of living for years in an atmosphere of red-tape, have become absolutely incompetent to deal with the present position. It is only too true that men who have been long accustomed to such an atmosphere fail to utilize their f u l l powers of initiative. Whether the security of Government positions induces mental laziness, or whether there is some peculiar germ in the atmosphere of red tape which results in a kind of sleeping sickness, I cannot say. But I ' am justified in affirming that our military system is suffering from what may be termed""the blight of the official mind, which sits'u'pon the service like a frost, and which nips the most promising shoots of originality in the bud. This blight is'cementing the whole of the service into a hard, inelastic mass, which is incapable of initiative or original thought. The Minister of Defence has a unique opportunity at the present time, but he is hampered-as anybody else in his position would be hampered-if he does not possess the courage to break the bonds which bind the service as effectively as Gulliver was ever bound by the L ill i putians. I am quite prepared to accept f u l l responsibility for my action to-day. Nobody regrets more than I do the necessity for bringing these matters before the House. about recruiting. W it h the knowledge I possess as the result of my visits to tlie Liverpool Camp, how can I conscientiously go on the public platform and advise people to send tlieir sons to the front? If my own son were of age, I would have to seriously consider the wisdom of allowing him to enter the Liverpool Camp unless some better conditions are substituted for those at present existing. member says that the fate of the nation criticise him too harshly in the circumis hanging in the balance. raw recruits against trained men-agains t Government benches, whenever any matveteran soldiers like the Turks. equipped than are any other troops in the blame the Minister, but some one else. world. to the f r o n t who lack necessary experience posite.

186,Mr Joseph Cook,"Yes; but 2that is where the German internment camp has been placed. There is high and dry ground only 3 or 4 miles from the river, but yet our camp is dotted over the river, so to speak. I am afraid, therefore, that a good many of the medical cases reported there are due to the location of the camp itself on the edge of gest another thing? I very much doubt whether the principal medical officer is given the requisite discretion and authority necessary for the preservation of the health of the camp, and when I say that, I am not speaking without book. mation ? information, but it is of a private character. I know the principal medical officer there, Colonel Perkins, and so does the honourable member. iu Australia. medical officer is a good man, in my judgment, and from what I know of him. I think in the old days he used to be a Labour man. pointing out that fact to suggest that if he has any bias it would be in the direction of this Government, and against the Opposition. But, as I have said, he is a good medical oflicer, in my judgment, and if he were given the necessary freedom, and had f u l l responsibility thrust upon hi3 shoulders, he would see that a Jot of the troubles lately reported were rectified. That is my firm opinion, and I urge upou the Minister that he sliould consult with this officer, who is on the spot, and is responsible for the health of the troops. If the medical officer has to shoulder the responsibility, he should have the requisite freedom to act according to his own judgment. A t any rate, he cannot be held responsible until the Minister has taken his advice, as the responsible officer on the spot. I now want to point to a case within my own knowledge. I had a complaint the other day, but I did not trouble honourable members with it . A man in my electorate rang me up to say that one of these young doctors at the camp had sent his brother-in-law, who resides with him, home for a day or two on account of a bad cold. When the man got home, however, the local doctor found that he was suffering from measles seven days old. The camp doctor had not diagnosed the illness, and had sent the man home for a day or two on account of a bad cold. The man, of course, was very indignant that his brother-in-law should the river. Now, may I sughave been allowed to roam about the camp, taking all the risks which come in cold weather to people suffering from measles, if not properly treated. disease. any inforadmitted time and again that, during this cold weather, the men on the sick list should not be lined up for medical inspection, but it is still being done.

227,Mr Archibald,"D o you not thinkto say to my honourable friend is that I have brought these things before the Minister mauy a time. which I have referred is the same range the settlement in connection with which occupied five years. It now requires only a little extra expenditure. right honourable member confine himself to the subject-matter of the motion 1 ing the question of r if e training at the Liverpool Camp, and pointing out that my own place is close to that locality, and that the authorities could easily take troops there and train them in the use of rifles if they would only go to the expense of duplicating the existing targets. That is one instance of reform which I am mentioning. We cannot get the authorities to incur the little expenditure necessary in such matters. Yeari n and year out we are at the Department, and here is a chance when the authorities have unlimited funds at their disposal. Nobody is questioning them on matters of economy, yet with all this infinite pressure upon us the trouble still exists, though it could be at once obviated by the Department if it would only spend a little money. regards the matters of administration referred to at Liverpool, I know that there are very serious complaints. The question of the supply of cloth has been referred to. The honourable gentleman made the statement that every place in the Commonwealth which can t u r n out a roll of cloth is doing so at top speed, but tliat is not so. Notwithstanding the statement of the Assistant Minister, it is not the case. monwealth there are mills which are not supplying cloth to the Department, while there are other mills which are not working f u l l time. In a time like this every ounce of energy ought to be pressed into all the preparations, no matter where they may be made, because the matter is as serious as it can be, both for our troops and for our cause and all that relates to the preservation of our Empire. I ask the Minister himself to look into these matters, particularly .into the health of the troops. I have suggested to him a way of getting at the truth . I suggest to him that, instead of being content to ask a general question of the Commandant, who no doubt answers to the best of his ability, and on whom I make no The range to reflection, the man for him to consult in regard to the medical conditions of the camp is the Chief Medical Ofliceri n charge of the camp and of the State. If the honourable gentleman w ill do that, I Will the shall await with the greatest possible interest the outcome. I am discusswill ask him for a report. gentlemau should do more than ask him for a report; I have no doubt that he has' already had yards of reports from the medical officer which he has turned down. commendation, too. for the honourable gentleman to call for a report if he is not going to act upon it . That ia the thing which we want done.

Owing to the fact that transfers of men in training from one State to another have been frequently necessary, it is not possible to work -out a percentage which would accurately indicate the ratio of deaths to the number of men trained in each of the several camps.

[4.26] -Had I been present yesterday when the Estimates of the Postmaster General's Department were under discussion, I should have asked some questions about a matter of some importance to the working of that Department-the application of preference to unionists in its administration. Some time ago, the line repairers aud others obtained from Mr Justice Higgins, as President of the A r b i tration Court, an award whose benefits were conferred only on those who were parties to the plaint. As these did not constitute nearly the whole of the employees of the Department, the Public Service Commissioner recommended to the last Government that the terms of the award should be applied throughout the Department. made a common rule. Department was concerned. done, but I understand that this Ministry has repealed the act of its predecessors. The award, amongst other things, fixed the terms and conditions of officers as well as of the men in the Department, and, I understand, affected officers of salaries as high as £40 0 a year. This Government, in reversing the act of their predecessors, have practically decided that from to-day no man in the Department may expect an increase of wages or of salary u n t i l he has joined a union. As there are no unions of officers for this section of the Public Service, that means t h a i a manager or overseer must join the men's union, whence it will follow that, while the men may be under the control of their overseers during tlie day, they can at night haul them before the union and place them under control. A r e you likely to have discipline under a system of that kind? This is, in my judgment, carrying unionism to an absurd extreme. Outside the Service, men in many cases refuse to allow bosses to join their unions, objecting to their influence there, but in the Department of the Postmaster-General you compel the managers and overseers to join the men's union, because you refuse to pay them increases unless they do so. 0 a year obtain increases under the award ? such officers were fixed by the award. creases 3 are in the union. honourable gentleman is forcing the others to join. now to form a union of their own. ing the question of unionism per se; I am dealing now only with its application. Ministers are so tying themselves up by this action that they will ultimately be glad to get out of it . How can you expect discipline if the bosses can be hauled before a union to be brought to book by generally the men under their control ? What does it all mean? It means that honourable members have had to say to the men, "" We, your special representatives, have been unable to give you justice, and have, therefore, set up an outside court to do That was so."" Their action in that matter was a confession of failure.

It is unfair to apply this form of coercion to the officers. of the statement made in regard to the sugar question, I think the Ministry ought to carefully avoid entering into any understanding with the Queensland Government that might forestall the deliberate judgment of this House as to the contract or arrangement. I do not think that any Government ought to give a contractual undertaking to, or make any binding agreement -with, any person in relation to the Tariff, and I include in that opinion the State Governments, because we cannot regard one State as representing the whole people of Australia, whom it is our duty to protect. There are one or two facts in connection with tlie sugar industry which we must not leave out of account. The Royal Commission which reported in 1912 stated tliat the adjustments made up to that date in connection with the sugar industry meant an annual subsidy by the Commonwealth of about £1,000,000 a year, and an obligation on the consumer of about £1,500,000 annually. I have been endeavouring to look up some figures, but I find it difficult, without checking, to which was to end in 1913 or 1914, there present them as I should like to do. However, there are a few statistics to which I wish to draw attention. When we began to deal with the sugar question in 1901, the. import duties produced £780,000 per annum. Looking at the Budget figures for this year, I find that in 191? the Commonwealth received only £351,821, and that the estimate for this yeara time of drought and of shrinkage in production as well as in importation-is ' £90,212. What is apparent is that we have wiped out at least three-quarters of the revenue we were receiving in 1901 from a smaller population, whilst the sugar industry itself, though better in that white labour has been practically substituted for coloured labour, does not show that development which was one of the chief grounds upon which some honourable members advocated the adjustments that were made in 1901. Por instance, we had at first an import duty on cane sugar of £6 a ton, and I think there was a rebate of £4 a ton for sugar grown by white That is absolutely delabour. There was also, until 1907, an Excise duty of £ 3 a ton. About 1903, at the instance of Sir George Turner, we changed the rebate into a bounty. We continued to give this bounty until about twelve months ago, and imposed an Excise duty, keeping an effective rate of £6 a ton on cane sugar, with a comparatively ineffective rate of £10 a ton on beet sugar. The result of that policy is seen in the figures I have given. I am not going to deal with the development of the sugar industry throughout the world during these years, but, taking normal times, there is no doubt that there has been a large increase in the world's production of sugar, and had the more normal import duties that prevailed before 1901, which, I think, averaged £ 3 a ton, been maintained, we (should probably have been able to benefit more than we have done by the increased world's productionI mean that the large consumers in Australia, the purchasers for various industries such as jam making and confectionery, who use something like 60,000. or 70,000 tons a year, must have obtained a large benefit by the competition in the world's markets which would have been caused by a more moderate import duty. The thing we have to remember is that in 1905, when Dr. Maxwell reported on the sugar industry, and before we came to the arrangement were 28,614 persons directly or indirectly engaged in the sugar industry. Of these 21,970 were in Queensland, and 6,644 in New South Wales. The number in New South Wales has greatly declined, but for many years we had a rather foolish policy as regards bounties. We so framed our bounties that we paid New South Wales a fairly large sum-it ran to over £70,000 in one year, I remember-for growing sugar by white labour, but not",26,Bureau Of Agricultur Ebill Smaet

331,Mr Glynn (Angas) [4.48],"In viewfor substituting white labour for black labour, because almost all the production in New South Wales before 1901, when we brought in our Federal policy, was grown by white labour. Against the remonstrances of one or two of us, we made this blunder in arranging our policy, thinking that the Constitution would not permit the provision as regards bounties to be framed otherwise, and we actually paid New South Wales a very large sum, although it did not involve the substitution of white labour for black labour, which was the policy we wished to encourage, simply because tlie labour was white before. I might go on to show how misplaced tliat policy-was by following up the figures for the last three or four years, showing the numbers engaged in the industry in New South Wales, but I "" think the Budget-papers disclose that there has been a considerable diminution. I have not got the Queensland figures for 1912, but I do not think there has been a great variation in the proportion as against earlier years. I think the Budget-papers show that ou 31st December, 1912, there were 24,789 persons directly or indirectly engaged in the production of sugar ""n Queensland and New South Wales-that is, practically in all Australia. These figures compare with 28,614 in 1905, so that the prophecies that there would be a large development in the sugar industry which were made in support of the policy of 1905 and 1906, when wo extended the provisions of the Acts of 1903 and 1901, have been falsified by the figures given in the Budget-papers. This is a somewhat serious matter for the people of Australia. Let us remember in connection with the sugar industry have been legislating on the basis of understandings and undertakings. I hope that this Government will not again make the mistake of entering into any undertaking with the Government of Queensland that w ill forestall the better judgment of this House, because I say deliberately that there is no precedent anywhere for binding a Government with a private party, or even with a State, to continue duties, or to modify duties, or to abolish duties. If we do such a thing at all, we ought to do it , as we did in 1901, by making it part of the schedule of a Tariff Act. with regard to bounties; we have done so with the import duties; we have done so in connection with the Excise Tariff on stripper-harvesters. The matter is one of general policy, which should be incorporated in the schedule of an Act of Parliament. I repeat that our legislation has all through been based on understandings. In 1885, Queensland determined to put an end to the importation of Kanakas, and, in 1889, in consequence of the report of a Commission which then sat, ten years' grace was granted-fro m 1892 to 1902in the matter of the introduction of Kanakas. We then had a sort of implied undertaking--som e called it a contractwith the producers of Queensland to take up the sugar question under some sense of moral obligation, which led to the policy to which I have made reference. I could go further, and show that it is a great mistake to enter into any understandings of this sort. Let us look at the report of the Royal Commission of 1912. That Royal Commission gave the net revenue of 1910-11 as £157,000. The figures for 1901-2 were £780,000. The Royal Commission spoke of the f u t i l it y of bounty and Excise systems as a means of promoting a just apportionment of the profits of the industry, in that it virtually abolished all competition by placing the control of prices in the hands of large industrial concerns. It spoke of the failure cf these.systems as a means of securing fair wages. We have, since then, provided by Act of Parliament for better means of accomplishing that end. The report also spoke of the connection between Tariff and Trusts, citing two American authorities, one the President of the American Sugar Trust, to show that the mother of all Trusts is the Tariff, though the Commission regarded that statement as too that from the first we sweeping. Nevertheless, the Commission did admit that it must be apparent that an unnecessarily high import duty, unless it is stringently safeguarded, by tending to eliminate internal competition, renders the formation of Trusts more easy, and their despotic control very effective and enduring. It did not for a moment declare that there was a Trust of the class established as a result of the bounties in Australia, as had been suggested before the inquiry of the Commission. I am not, however, going toenter into that question at all. I am merely giving the evidence of an American authoW e have acted similarly r it y , cited by that Commission, as to the effect of the policy that had operated in Australia, America, up to that date. The Commission also suggested that there should be a standard price fixed for both raw and refined sugar. price for Australian refined sugar should be fixed on a basis of not less than £21 10s. per ton, adding that, on account of the Australian the price of raw sugar should be fixed on a sliding scale by the Inter-State mission. criticise that policy. I am only referring to it now because it is the occasion of correspondence between the Premier of Queensland and the Prime Minister of Australia. Fisher was not led into any arrangement with the State which would have had the effect of binding the hands of the Commonwealth as regards what the rate of duty should be. I notice that in one telegram sent between 6th December and 11th December, 1912, the then of Queensland Statute, £21 10s. ?If so, it will be necessary for you to secure such power under the Tariff as will preclude foreign sugar being sold in Australia under that price."" extent, at least, a State speaks with a continuous desire, if not on a continuous policy. is generally a fairly well-marked tion existing from year to year as to what the State's view is, and I am merely referring to this matter now by way of caution, because I think it is only fair that we should beforehand, to some exteat, indicate the trend of our desires in this matter, which is, at present, in an unsettled condition as between the two Governments. direct interest in the sugar question, apart from this matter of purchase, which I am not dealing with, the Government Queensland have. At the time Dr. Maxwell reported a return which stated that the Queensland Government had an indirect, if not direct, relation with the mills established in that State under the Sugar Works Act of 1893-5. I notice that an estimate was given of the obligations due to the Government in respect of thirteen aud one tramway, about £584,000. sum, and I should be only too glad if the 'Government would give us a statement of Mr Glynn. the exact financial relations between the as well as iu Queensland Government and the sugar producing industries in Queensland at the present time. They are all factors which must infiuenoe the Ministry It said that the standard when they are asked to enter into an arrangement with a particular State on the basis of the purchase of all the sugar available. I am only throwing cost of production, out a few words of caution, but I do say that, considering the enormous sacrifices Comof revenue that we are making, and the I am not going to defend or to tremendous burden upon the consumerthe big sacrifices that we have made to attain a good end regarding the kanakaswhich have by no means given the large benefits that were anticipated, the MinLuckily, at the time Mr istry should be particularly cautious as regards the terms of any contract or undertaking that they may enter into or make with the Government of Queensland. A t the beginning of the war Mr. McKenna made a large purchase of sugar for the United Kingdom. Premier fix the minimum price at on the English market? there was a tremendous slump. Nothing that he anticipated actually resulted. To some That shows how very careful Ministers ought to be. Estimates were submitted of the loss that would be incurred on that Governments change, but there purchase amounting to some hundreds inclinaof thousands of pounds. I have seen very high figures quoted, but as some are rather contradictory, I do not propose to put them before the House. I hone that what I have said will have some effect upon the Ministry, and help them in the consideration of this matter, which is of vital importance to the consumers of Australia. a letter to the London Times a few weeks ago, Lord Denman, a former Governor of General, commended tbe Commonwealth Parliament for having brought into operawas obtained, tion a system of compulsory military training for Australia; and, in doing so, gave credit to the present Prime Minister, the Minister of Defence, and the AttorneyGuarantee General, for having been chiefly responsible for the great piece of legislation by which it was enacted.

Speaking to that amendment, he said, as troduction of Senator Dobson's Bill, and reported in Hansard, page 3094I propose that they shall present themselves placed before this House the comprehenat such places as may be determined upon, sive defence policy of which his Governnot all at once, but in such numbers as may ment approved-the question of defence be considered convenient. Colonel McCay, another memher of the held in Brisbane, when, for the first time, Liberal party, who is now serving at the the policy of a "" Citizens Defence Force"" front, interjected, "" Are they to be paid ?"" was embodied in the fighting platform of To which the present Attorney-General the party; while in its general platform replied, ""Most emphatically no."" Furthe following plank was inserted:ther on Mr Hughes saidI merely propose to make compulsory, in reference to the male population between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one years, attendance at certain detached drills, and tlie undergoing of fourteen days' continuous training each year, which has been regarded both here and in England as sufficient for the Volunteer Forces. That was the original proposal made by the present Attorney-General. Crouch, a member of the Liberal party, was the first to propose in this House a system of compulsory training for cadets, but the first member of this Parliament to put into concrete form a proposal for the compulsory military training of junior and senior cadets was ex-Senator Dobson, another member of the Liberal party. On 5th September, 1907, he introduced in the Senate a Bill which provided thatAll boys and youths over twelve and under nineteen years of age shall join, and continue to be members of a naval or military cadet Mr Sampson. corps, and shall receive such instruction in naval or military drill as may be prescribed. That Bill lapsed at the second-reading stage. As we are all aware, Mr Deakin, We propose a system of universal training in order to form a National Guard of Defence in which every young man in the Commonwealth shall be required to serve during his In that celebrated speech Mr Deakin laid down a comprehensive scheme of defence for Australia, and his proposal for a National Guard of Defence was the first of a comprehensive character to be made. It has since become law, and today leads the whole Empire on the important subject of citizen defence. In July, 190S-twelv e months after the inseveral months after Mr Deakin had was considered at a Labour Conference Citizen Defence Force, with compulsory military training, and Australian-owned and controlled Navy. On 29th September, 1908, Sir Thomas Ewing, a member of the Liberal Government of that day, introduced in this House a Bill providing for the compulsory training of cadets between the ages Colonel of twelve and eighteen years, and for the compulsory training of all males between eighteen years and twenty-six years of age. That measure, however, lapsed at the second-reading stage. The present Prime Minister came into oflice on 13th November, 1908, but did little in the matter of defence until 30th March, 1909, or eighteen months after the defence policy of the Deakin Government had been enunciated. On that date Mr Fisher enunciated the policy of his Government, which made provision only for three years' compulsory training. In June, 1909, the Fisher Government were defeated, and tlie Deakin-Cook Government came into office. During the sestion of 1909 the right honourable member for Parramatta, aa Minister of Defencei n that Administration, introduced and placed upon the statute-book of the Commonwealth the first measure to provide for compulsory military training of junior and senior cadets. The whole groundwork of the scheme, as we have it to-day, was placed on the statute-book in 1909 by the present Leader of the Opposition, as Minister of Defence. The Government, however, were not satisfied; and it was decided to invite LordK it chener, the greatest living soldier in the world, to come to Australia. and rightly. Lord Kitchener was invited here in the following terms, in a cable sent to him at Simla, in India, by the Prime Minister on the 9th July, 1909Tlie Government of tlie Commonwealth is now proposing to Parliament large and costly schemes for the defence of Australia by land and sea. In respect to Naval Defence, the consultative conference in London this month, at which we shall be represented, is certain to bo most valuable. It would be a very great advantage to the Commonwealth were this supplemented on the military side. If , in the course of your projected tour this year, we can bo honoured by a visit of sufficient duration to enable you to inspect our forces and fixed defences, in order to advise this Government upon the best means of developing and perfecting the land defence of the country, we should have much more confidence in completing our schemes. Thab meant the completion of the scheme which had already been passed into law. nineteen years was the maximum age. had the whole scheme in operation as the law of the' land before Lord Kitchener came. TheB ill did not become law until after the invitation had been sent to Lord Kitchener, b u t it was law before he made his visitA visit from you will .be particularly welcome to Australia on personal grounds, and we trust you will consent to be our guest during your stay. As a Government, we venture to urge your acceptance, not only in the public interests of the Commonwealth, but also for Imperial reasons, as, for instance, the recent arrangements regarding the General Staff, so as to associate the military forces of all the Dominions with tliose of the Mother Country. The following was the cable sent by Lord Kitchener to the Prime MinisterWith reference to your telegram 9th July, after attending foreign manceuvres, Japan, early in November, it will give me pleasure to accept your kind invitation to visit Australia. I will be glad of this opportunity of meeting again the men who served so well under me in South Africa, and to help the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia with any advice that I can give. Then the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth cabled to Lord Kitchener on the same dateGovernment of the Commonwealth of Australia extremely gratified your cordial acceptance, which is warmly appreciated throughout Australia. At your convenience, would be glad to learn probable date of and place In the world? arrival, probable duration of stay, and of any preparations that can be made in advance to facilitate your inspection. It is a matter of history now that Lord Kitchener came here, and reported on the whole military system, suggesting i m provements and extensions of the scheme that has become law. In his report, dated 12th Februarv, 1910, he says, in paragraph 12I desire to place the facts before honourable members with as little comment as possibleThe new Defence Act will give sufficient numbers to defend the country effectively if the force provided under it is efficiently trained, organized, and equipped. He is speaking there of the law of the land-of the DefenceA c t that had been passed by both Houses of Parliament, and had received the Royal assentI t must, however, be distinctly recognised that a national force, maintained at a high standard of efficiency, can only be produced by the work of years, and that such work must be steady and continuous; any divergence from the policy decided on may, and probably will, lead to chaos and useless expenditure of money. On page 5 of his report, in paragraph 6, he saysThe Defence Bill 1909, which has just been passed by the Commonwealth Parliament, gives effect to the principle that every citizen should be trained to defend his country, and I therefore propose to base the following advice as to the manner in which the force of 80,000 fighting men should be enrolled, organized, and trained on the principle embodied in that Act, which is designed to call into existence a National Citizen Force. It will be noted that he did not make any alteration in the fundamental principle of the Act, b ut simply presented a scheme of organization based on those principles which had received his endorsement and",30,Bureau Of Agricultur Ebill Smaet

The policy then adopted was that in operation today, and that which was endorsed by Lord Kitchener without alteration, except in the way of organization. I think that the facts do not require further comment. comparison of the schemes, or even refer to that laid down by the present Prime Ministeri n March, 1909. That scheme provided for only three years' training ; but, however that may be, I desire now to refer, as rapidly as I may, to one or two documents which have reference to the NavalU n it . It has been claimed by the Labour party that they have to be credited, not only with the scheme of military defence, but also with the scheme of naval defence. The present Prime Minister, in his Gympie speech, on the 29th March, 1909, a few months after the Imperial Naval Conference, detailed the proposals of the Labour party. H is scheme, however, was quite different from that proposed at the Imperial Conference. The unit was to consist of twenty-four vessels-fou r ocean destroyers, with a speed of ten knots, and with twenty-six knots in an emergency; nineteen destroyers of the River class; and one armed vessel for police duties. That would have been an insufficient defence for Australia. I am afraid that we should have found ourselves very insecure if that had -been recently the only naval defence in the Pacific. In response to the invitation of the Imperial Government, the Liberal Government sent Colonel. Poxton to England as the representative of the Commonwealth. A t that Conference the lines All these for the NavalU n it of the Commonwealth were laid downa scheme which would fit in with the Imperial system of defence. first? Why, the able member is not going back to the days when Mr Watson was here, and first suggested a Navy. Watson's proposals or statements amongst my notes, but do not wish to detract from the Labour party's advocacy of an AusThen Senator Dobson tralian Navyi n the early, years of Federation. All I am endeavouring to show now is that the crystallized .efforts of the Mr Deakin. in 1907, unfoldedLabour party for years and years meant this proposal by the present Prime Ministeri n 1909. I guarantee that the two vessels which were sunk at Falkland Islands would have blown such a unit out of the water in an hour. As against that scheme, we had the one enunciated when our representative was present at the Colonial Conference in 1909. It was decided that the Commonwealth should construct one armoured cruiser, the Australia; three second-class protected I have not time to go into auy cruisers, Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane; six destroyers, Parramatta, Warrego, Yarra, Torrens, Ber went, and Swan; and two submarines. A certain number of these have already been sent out, and one of our second-class cruisers is almost ready for launching, although it should have been launched long ago. The Australia, in my opinion, was really a substitute for the proposal of the Liberal party to present a Dreadnought toGreat Britaina step which would have been more effective than halfa-dozen fleets such as those suggested by the present Prime Ministeri n March, 1909. I think I have shown very .clearly that the first member within this House who suggested compulsory military training was Colonel Crouch. Subsequent debates on the subject took place here in which members on both sides spoke, the views being of a more or less declaratory character, affirming in some form or another a citizen soldiery responsibility. Resolutions were moved by Senator Dobson on the one side, and afterwards by the present A t torney-General on the other side. These were individual and preliminary views on a subject which was occupying much public attention in the press, and in the",32,Bureau Of Agricultur Ebill Smaet

The first real authoritative responsible pronouncement was the unfolding of a comprehensive compulsory system of cadet and citizen soldiery, also an Australian Naval policy, by Mr Deakin, in 1907. This was followed by a B ill embodying that policy by Sir Thomas Ewing, then Minister of Defence, in September, 1908. however, did not pass the second reading. It was not unti l after Mr Deakin's declaration, in 1907, tliat the citizen defence scheme found its way into the Labour party's programme. Soon after Sir Thomas Ewing's B ill of the 29th September, 1908, the Labour party gave the Deakin Government notice that it withdrew its support, and the Fisher Labour Government came into power in December of the same year, and held office until June, 1909, during which period it did nothing. Then the DcakinCook Government came into power, and Mr Cook, as Minister of Defencej n that Government, carried through the House, and passed into law, amidst the stormiest scenes and fiercest opposition from the Labour party yet experienced in ' this House, the great scheme of citizen and compulsory training, which provided for the training of our youths from twelve to 'twenty years of age. . That system is now in force. The same Minister, in proposals Unit, of which we are so proud, and which has done such valuable service to Australia and to the Empire; and, not satisfied with tbese two monumental, colossal pieces of achieved statesmanship, he also advised that Lord Kitchener, the greatest active soldier of tlie Empire and the world, be invited to Australia. This was agreed to by Cabinet, and an invitation, in the terms already read to the House, was extended to Lord Kitchener by Mr Deakin. Lord Kitchener accepted the invitation in 1909, and in February, 1910, finished his notable and comprehensive report, which, while endorsing in 1909 complete scheme of extended torial organization to enable general effect to be given to the Cook military law, and advised that the age, as already contemplated, should be increased to twenty-five years. It was in A p r i l , 1910, two months after Lord Kitchener reported, that the Deakin-Cook Government were defeated and the Labour party proceeded to extend the existing DefenceA c t on the lines he had recommended. In the case of the NavalU n it , the representative at the I m perial Conference in 1909 was a Liberal Minister, and the U n it agreed upon, including the AustraUa, was ordered by Mr. Cook, the Minister of Defence. This ThatB ill , U n it superseded tlie obsolete, low-speed, River class destroyers, which were the policy of the' Labour party, as enunciated by Mr Fisher at Gympiei n 1909. Whatever may have been the nature of the preliminary discussions and suggestions on the question of defence by land or sea, and whatever may be the ultimate achievement of our system, these facts from the history of the Defence schemes of Australia prove irrefragably that, whilst a substantial majority of the House has endorsed the policy laid down in the Deakin-Cook law of 1909, the authors of the two schemes-the military scheme, which is attracting world-wide attention and approval, and the existing Naval scheme, which satisfies Australian aspirations, and forms a substantial addition to the Imperial Naval defence strength-ca n rightly be claimed to be the Liberal party. It is due that we should give to one the same session, gave us the honourable member of this House the merit for the Australian Naval of having a considerable and early hand in the formation of our defence system. I refer to the present Attorney-General, the honourable member for West Sydney. Very early in the history of this Parliament, when Sir John Forrest, the then Minister of Defence, introduced the first DefenceB ill , the honourable member for West Sydney had some words to say upon the subject which indicated the trend of his mind at that time, and those of us who knew what he had been saying on public platforms in regard to Defence matters knew that he was heartily in favour of an Australian-owned and controlled Navy, and of what is known as to to the Australian law of our compulsory training system. I quote then, in force, proposed a from the first volume of the Commonterriwealth Hansard, at page 744, 5th June, 1901, the following: That leave be given to bring in a Bill to provide for the defences of the Commonwealth.

Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a first time. That was but a short discussion, but the system which the honourable member for West Sydney had in mind at the time, as indicated by . him on public platforms, was a system of compulsory training and an Australian-owned and controlled Navy. He had given expression to these views sometimes in the face of much opposition, and, at that time, at considerable risk to his political reputation. If I had gone to the same trouble as that taken by the honourable member for Wimmera, I could, no doubt, bring forward convincing proof as to who was the first to take a stand in regard to our present defence system. correction in regard to the quotation that I shall now read from page 2960 of Hansard of the first session of tlie Commonwealth Parliament. July, 1901, Colonel Crouch, the then member for Corio, was speaking on the second reading of the DefenceB ill , introduced by Sir John Forrest: but I shall not make from it the same deduction that was made from it by the honourable member for Wimmera. Colonel Crouch saidAlthough we cannot adopt the principle of conscription, because of labour and sentimental difficulties, in regard to able-bodied men, every times before meetings almost exclusively boy should be in a position, on reaching the age of eighteen, to join some militia or volunteer corps, and take a part, if necessary, in the defence of his country. This cadet system is one of the cheapest forms of military training that has yet been designed. At the present time the metropolitan corps of senior cadets, consisting of SOO youths, costs only £400 a year; and when we remember the extravagance that military organization usually involves, I Mr Fenton. think that that is a very creditable result. The cadet movement should be very largely extended and encouraged, and I would suggest to the Minister that the system should be made compulsory to the extent I have indicated. The words "" to the extent I have indicated "" qualify Colonel Crouch's claim that the system should be made compulsory. Crouchi n order to show that he was the first man who gave expression to the principle of compulsory training. Crouch did not have in mind the compulsory training we now have, and I say so with considerable knowledge of that gentleman. On the 31st July, 1901, the honourable member for West Sydney, speaking to tlie same B ill , and dealing with naval matters, saidNow, since our chief danger to Australia must take the form of a bombardment, we have a right to demand that the first feature of our defence scheme should be to provide complete and satisfactory means for protecting us from that possible and even probable contingency. I want honourable members to realize that this question of a bombardment, or of an attack from a marauding expedition, or whatever you may please to term it, is by no means a chimerical idea, but it is the one thing which has made Federation possible in these States. As a matter of fact, does any man believe that Australia-sinc e she has elected to take the part, for good or for ill, of standing by the Motherland-wil l over be permitted to stand out as though she were an indifferent factor, entirely unconnected with the great BritishI am open to Empire?. I do not think so. For good or for evil, she has allied herself to the fortunes of Great Britain, and she must share alike in her glories and in her defeats. Whenever the time to which I refer comes, whether it be On the 24th soon or late, we shall have to rely upon ourselves. There he indicates, in respect of the Navy, that we would have to rely upon ourselves. From the public journals of Victoria and New South WalesI could. quote speeches delivered by the honourable member for West Sydney, in which he laid before the public, and someLabour, his ideas in respect to the defence of Australia1 Well, "" a volunteer,"" the maxim goes, "" is worth a dozen pressed men.""

I believe that the Postmaster-General is sympathetic with many of the views expressed by honourable members in this Chamber. My own opinion is that we ought to'do more work in our postal workshops, instead of sending out of Australia for many of our requirements. I am in formed that there is in progress a "" wetblanketing "" process in connection with some schemes recently evolved for providing the equipment and material necessary in the carrying out of telephonic and postal work. I understand that the Department is waiting u n t i l the more commodious workshop at the corner of Spencer and Bourke streets. Melbourne, is in a position to turn out the articles that we need. In this connection I have received numerous complaints, not merely from workmen, but from contractors. The latter complain that some of the articles whicli we require are being imported fro m other countries. For instance, there are telephone boxes the manufacture of which is very simple. I am sure that the Postmaster-General will admit that Australia can turn out woodwork equal to that turned out in auy part of the world. tralia. ral will find that, while some officers are very desirous of manufacturing our own materials, others wish to throw cold water upon any such scheme. tion on the part of the honourable member. activities of this Department confined to our own workshops. When that is done, we shall be able to manufacture articles for our own requirements cheaper than contractors can supply them. ploy fewer men.. have provided the machinery and plant, we shall be able to do work cheaper than contractors can do it . This has been well illustrated at the Newport Workshops, which are turning out a particular class of engine for £1,000 less than it can be manufactured by the Baldwin works in America. .member is an apostle of cheapness. ing the good qualities of our Australian workmen. I say that their superiors cannot be found in any part of the world. I would counsel the Postmaster-General not to defer action in this connection unti l the completion of the new building at the corner of Bourke and Spencer streets. The requisite plant might easily be transferred to that building when it is completed. I believe that private contractors are doing well out of the Postal and other Departments, just as they are doing well out of other Departments. The sooner we eliminate them from the manufacture of our reouirements, the sooner we shall be in a position to pay our employees better wages, and to oive them better conditions generally. I presume that this year's Estimates will make provision for giving effect to the award of the Arbitration Court in the case of the letter sorters. That award w ill come into operation on the 1st August. In the Postal Department I find that there are 17,322 permanent employees and 12,969 non-official or temporary employees, making a total of approximately 30,000. It will be seen, therefore, that the Postmaster-General is a very large employer of labour. Amongst that large body of employees there must be some who are in a position to give the Department the benefit of new ideas, and I hope that the honourable gentleman will lend a willing ear to any representations of this character. There must be men in the Department who are capable of making valuable suggestions. I wish to see all the have already made suggestions, and have been rewarded for so doing. be. The leading firms of the world recognise the worth of employees who aid ' them by making valuable suggestions.

As an old public servant, I know that it sometimes happens that when a junior places a brilliant idea before his superior officer, it is either turned down or some months later is suddenly evolved in quite another quarter, and the superior officer very often obtains credit for the invention or improvement.

I have noticed with much satisfaction that my ideal of a Ministry has recently been carried into effect in London, namely, a Ministry of all the talents in the Parliament, irrespective of the political party to which they belong. I welcome that innovation as an indication of what can be done under the stress of urgent necessity, and a step which will probably lead in the near future to what I regard as a very great reform in parliamentary government. I regret that members of the present Government, and those who are behind them, cry out to the Opposition to cease party warfare, especially when we happen to be offering some useful and necessary criticism, and yet, when they get outside this chamber, they are ready to claim for their party, and in relation to the war, a credit to which they have no right whatever, unless they are prepared to give equal credit to their political opponents. I refer to the claim made time and again that it is to the Labour party, and to that party alone, that our present defence system should be credited. ment is absolutely without foundation, and I speak as one who knows, perhaps, more about this matter than does any other member of the Committee. have a fairly good knowledge of the position of both parties in this connection. I wish to endorse what has been said here this afternoon w it h regard to tlie magnificent work done by the honourable member for West Sydney, the present Attorney General. There is no doubt whatever that the honourable gentleman has done great work in educating the members of his parliamentary party, and also the supporters of that party outside. There has been, and still is, a section of the Labour party very strongly antagonistic to any [165]2 kind of war preparation whatever. The honourable member for Maranoa will agree with me when I say that, at one time, the members of the Labour party holding the views which the honourable member for West Sydney has so ably and forcibly exI have pressed inside and outside of this House, were not particularly numerous. row to hoe for years, but in view of the developments taking place in the world the conviction gradually grew in the Labour party that Australia should do something definite, and do it soon, in order to prepare for the evil day t h a t was coming on the Empire. There was an essential difference between t he attitude taken ug by the Labour party as a whole, or at least by a large majority of its members, and that taken up by the members of the opposite political party. The ideal of a majority of the Labour party was preparation solely for local defence in connection with both our Naval and M i l i tary Forces. Our Naval Force, according to their idea, was to be a purely local fighting unit. permit our vessels to leave Australian waters. their position. There were members of the Labour party who did not take that view, but they were in a hopeless minority. The attitude of the party, as a whole, was that we had really nothing to do with the affairs of tlie Empire, and were concerned only with our local defences. Again the present Attorney-GeneralI say that that statecame to the rescue w it h his magnificent enthusiasm, and made the supporters of Labour outside Parliament realize that we are vitally associated with the interests of the Empirei n all respects, for good or In what way? for evil; that the cause of the MotherI n this way, that I land is our cause, and that we have to stand or f a l l with the people of the Old Country.

That preposterous ally been recognised in the Old Country. Again, I say that these questions should be altogether above party considerations. I feel sure that where the welfare of Australia or of the Empire as a whole is concerned, there are sufficient men in both political parties to take the true, broad, national, and patriotic view that will iusure the establishment of a condition of affairs which will make for the security of Australia and of the Empire at the same time. I was interrupted earlier in the day when making a reference to the necessity for vigorous action by the Defence Department. I want to repeat my statement that the present Minister of Defence is a very estimable man in all respects, but that he does lack the initiative we have a right to look for from the head of his Department at the present time. This has been proved in no way more conclusively than by his action in regard to the Small Arms Factory. Our whole difficulty in connection with the Expeditionary Forces begins and ends there. It is because of the insufficient output of the Small Arms Factory that we have not been able to take all the recruits that have offered. It is because of it that we have not been able to arm our men in sufficient time. We are now told, after several months have elapsed, that steps are to.be taken to institute a double shift at the Factory. We had two reports from Parliamentary Com. mittses, but, not content with them, the Minister of Defence called for a third report, and he has since received that report. In my opinion, that third report should not have been called for at all. It was practically an insult to Parliament that the Minister should have waited for that third report in view of the opinions expressed by both the Parliamentary Committees that investigated this matter. They said in no hesitating words that the introduction of a second shift at the Factory was both desirable and practicable. I say that if a Liberal Minister had permitted matters to slide for so long as Senator Pearce has done, the Liberals in this country would not for a long time have heard the last of it. We should have had the neglect and delay discussed morning, noon, and night, as not so long ago a mistake made by a Liberal Minister was dinned into our ears in .similar fashion. I have already said in this Chamber today, and now repeat the statement, that claim has actuSenator Pearce is almost the last man of the party opposite who should occupy the position of Minister of Defence at the present time. I can imagine the honourable member for Maranoa in the chair of the Minister of Defence, asking why a second shift was not going at the Small Arms Factory, and being told that it was not practicable at the present time. Would the honourable member have given the same instructions as Senator Pearce gave, "" If it is not practicable at present, do it as soon as you can?"" I can imagine the honourable member for Maranoa saying, "" I will give you a month, and if it is not going then you will have to get out."" That is what Senator Pearce should have said at least six months ago. If a Liberal Minister had made the mistake that has been made with regard to the cruiser Brisbane, I wonder whether we would have heard so little about it as we have heard. Just imagine a ship of that kind being constructed high and dry at a place where no preparation was made to launch her. Imagine, too, the time that has been lost in the building of the vessel, the unnecessary additional expense that has been incurred, and, above all, the deplorable fact that if she had been built as the Liberal Government proposed, she would be afloat and fighting the battles of Australia and the Empire to-day. saved to build another boat. and omniscient Minister, whom no one should criticise at all, has allowed the matter to drift on in the way it has been doing up to the present time. Let me remind honourable members of what happened under the Labour regime in the Defence Department with regard to the rifle clubs. Honourable members opposite know, as we all do, that the present Minister of Defence permitted the rifle clubs to be almost starved out of existence, deliberately and intentionally, by the per-",38,Defence Bill

My complaint is that Senator Pearce has left himself almost unreservedly in the hands of his subordinate officers. Unfortunately, he had to do it , because, until he took the position of Minister of Defence, he was a man who by natural bent and inclination kept as far away from military matters, soldiers, rifles, and bayonets, as he could possibly get. That was his disposition, and he found himself in charge of a Department to which he had previously given very little attentiou. He had to leave himself in the hands of his permanent officers, who, of course, exercised the influence they had under those conditions, as they thought, for the benefit of the country, but sometimes to their own advantage as well. Consequently, the present Minister of Defence has had his reputation created for him by those same gentlemen who w ill , one and all, tell you that he is the best Minister they eyer had. If you ask them why, they w ill tell you, "" He has done just as we wanted him to do, including the multiplication of well-paid positions and the increase of salaries where any kind of excuse was offered for it . , "" "" We will get no money t ill Pearce comes back."" 1 have always had in regard to our Defence Forces concerns the manufacture of our own rifles. A t th© time it was first mooted I did my level best to get the Defence people to consider the question of adopting tlie Ross rifle. It is a notorious fact that the rifle we are manufacturing to-day, in common with the rifle manufactured by the British Government, is the worse-shooting military rifle in Europe. I can bring competent authorities to prove that the rifle that we and the British Army are using is absolutely the worse-shooting rifle in Europe. mans with them. they are doing very well with them, but if they had had better rifles we should The have had even better shooting results. I would remind the honourable member for Maranoa that in international matches in which Canadian teams have competed the Bisley authorities have found it necessary to handicap the Ross rifles. It is a better rifle in all respects than ours, and I feel sure that, in stead of the trouble we have had i u equipping the Small Arms Factory and getting it to work, with its excessive initial cost, if we had made a business-lik© arrange^ ment with the Ross Company of Canada we could have had the best military rifle in the world, as the Ross rifle undoubtedly is, at half the cost of the present one, so far at any rate as regards equipping and getting the Factory to work. trouble about the Ross rifle quite recently ? been given only recently by the Imperial authorities to the Ross Rifle Company of Canada for 170,000 rifles. It may be that some of these have not been quite up to the mark on account of the haste with which they have been turned out. But I have gone into the matter very thoroughly, and I know that th© Ross rifle, up to quit© lately, was recognised as the best military rifle in existence. to recall soine of them, in order to refix some of-the sights/ say, is anything of consequence in that inatter, any more than there has been in regard to our own rifle. There is not the slightest doubt that the Australian rifle, within the limitations-of the pattern, is as well made as possible, and any minor defect is of no material consequence. But my trouble in regard to the Defence Department is that it persists in proceeding on the old-fashioned jog-trot lines. SirI a n Hamilton, in his valuable report, pointed out time and again that the organization of the Department would probably go to pieces in a few weeks if it were actually face to face with war, and I believe it has done so. He also said that it badly needed a business head to deal with business matters in a business-like way, and",39,Defence Bill

There is no doubt that at a time like the present a little more energy and common sense than we have seen up to the present needs to be shown by some individual in a responsible position in the Department; and we cannot but hold the political head of the Department responsible. That.is what constitutional government means. I do not regard the present Minister of Defence as by any means sacrosanct, and if I do not see more activity and common sense at work in the Department than has so far been in evidence, the Minister will hear from me not infrequently in the future.

Sitting suspended from 6.27 to 745 p.m. not have had anything to say on this Bill but for the remarks made by the honourable member for Wimmera. the cruiser Brisbane? them over the cruiser Brisbane if I had my way. The honourable member for Wimmera went to a good deal of trouble bo let the Committee and the country know who originated the defence system, both naval and military, in Australia. It appeared to me that he searched Hansard ever since the inception of Federation to find out who did anything in connection with our defence scheme. just -as much as suited his book, and I suppose he thought he was going to sneak it into Hansard without any reply whatever. But, having been a member of this House from the beginning of Federation, and having taken a very lively interest in defence matters myself, I know a little about the subject; and it is only right that I should give the Committee the benefit of the knowledge I possess. I am pleased to know that I had something to do in the framing of the first Defence Bill in this House; but I want to say that, at that particular time, the man who was most consistent and persistent over the whole business of soldiering and compulsory drill for the juniors of Australia was the Honourable William Morris Hughes, member for West Sydney, and our present Attorney-General. A t that time, too, it was a most unpopular thing for a Labour member to advocate soldiering; and I might tell the honourable member for Wimmera that, after the experience we had in the 1891 strike, with what we called the ""scab"" protectors, or the Military Forces of Queensland, I came into this House with the fixed determination to singe the wings and cut the spurs of the ""gold-spurred roosters'-' as the honourable member for Darwin would call them. But, after I listened to the several debates, I came to the conclusion that the time had arrived when something should be done to protect this young nation from the peril which we then thought confronted it I refer to the Japanese. That was the consideration which induced me, and several other members of the Labour party, to advocate compulsory training, and I was very pleased indeed to hear the honourable member for Perth give a small meed of praise to the Attorney-General for his consistency at that time in regard to the compulsory training system. But, after all, what does it matter to us to-day who was the father of, or who was the sponsor for, our system of continuous military training and the establishment of. the Naval Unit? What does it matter to Australia, so long as we have it? I give the Opposition credit for being just as anxious as we were to introduce compulsory training, only I want to make it clear that if the Labour party had not been in favour of it, we would not have had it in Australia to-day. I take that much credit for our party. Had we opposed it as a party, the system, would He quoted not have been in force to-day, and the honourable member for Wimmera would have had some other tale to chronicle. Let us get down to. the facte. We know very well that the then honourable member for Richmond, Sir Thomas Ewing. introduced compulsory training in this House; and we all know the fate of that Bill.

Thomas Ewing was Minister of Defence in the DeakinM in is t r y I mean tiie old Liberal Ministry, not the Fusion moband he moved the second reading of the DefenceB ill on the 29th September, 1908. On that occasion, he saidThe main principle remained the same as in the scheme outlined by the Prime Minister in December, 1907, in almost every detail. . It provided for compulsory military training. Now, the honourable member for Wimmera this afternoon sought to lead honourable members of this House and the country to believe that the Liberals, as he called them, were then whole-heartedly in favour of compulsory training ; but Mr, now Sir George, Reid, then member for East Sydney, as Leader of the Opposition, saidBut all I want to say is that within the next ten years no such training, beyond the training of our Militia, and Volunteer Forces, is necessary. I am speaking of the land forces. I look to the training'of the British Ifavy as good enough for us for many years ahead. . . . Our present forces, developed, expanded, and properly equipped, are good enough for the next ten years; believing that, I am not going to drag all the young men who may be eighteen years next year in Australia out of the industries into cajnps. That would be a criminal, cruel wrong to them. . . . In my opinion, the only justification -for compulsion in the matter of service is a national emergency within a reasonable prospect of time. . . . Do not let us forget that Great Britain, the Dominion of Canada, -South Africa, and every other British Dominion have been able from time immemorial to solve their difficulties in even darker hours than these without resort to this foreign method of compulsory training. . . . I sum up my attitude upon this subject by. stating that I regard these projects as wild and impracticable, as being not founded on necessity, -or even in prudence, but arising either from hysteria, fear, or from a craze for militarism tliat is foreign to the history and the spirit of the British race. That' was a statement of Sir GeorgeReid's views, and well we remember the day he spoke, for we cheered him to the echo. ""thing very much the same in 1910. What is the use of it all? I am not saying this in a can tell the country what Senator Pearce said. I am telling him what his leader said on that occasion. it all ? for Wimmera has been trying to fix things on to this party, and, as I said before, it Sir is not my wish to have any quarrel as to who started the movement. We are in it now, and I believe every honourable member on both sides of the House is eager to do the best he can for Australia, and to do it as quickly as possible. But the honourable member for Wimmera went out of his way to launch a tirade against the Labour party, simply because one or two members of the party talked bosh on the platform. But what does it matter who inaugurated the scheme? All honourable members of this House glory in the results of our compulsory training as' disclosed in the recent operations at the Dardanelles, and in the achievements of the NavalU n it , and surely the time has come when we should cease to use these arguments as to who was responsible for the defence scheme for political purposes. Members should cease trying to get these into Hansard to be used against one another at the earliest possible opportunity. Y e t that is what the honourable member for Wimmera has done. His whole object was to use the facts, as he presented them, against us for party purposes, and "" paste"" us over the referenda. Warracknabeal paper.

The honourable member for Parramatta, who was Minister of Defence at the time, saidWe propose also to recruit the fighting line to war strength from the reserves of the young manhood of Australia-that is to say, we propose to train young men compulsorily up to twenty years of age, and from those we hope to get enough to make the Militia the first fighting force, equipped at war strength, ready to meet any emergency that may arise. The honourable member for Gippsland, who was sitting in opposition, said, ""Another Liberal plank given away."" Continuing, the honourable member for Parramatta saidWe begin, then, with the cadets at twelve years of age, training them chiefly by physical exercise. After they attain the age of fourteen years they will enter upon more advanced military training, and from the age of fourteen out of revenue. to eighteen a number amounting in the aggregate to 75,000 will be organized uniformly. Then he apologized for going beyond that, and saidWe propose to brigade him in the higher formations, and take him into the field and camp 'and compel him to train for another two years. Mr Hall, the present Attorney-General of New South Wales, interjected, ""The honourable member alludes to those between eighteen and twenty years of age,"" and the honourable member for Parramatta saidThat number includes the cadets, and represents all that we can hope to grapple with for the purposes of compulsory training at the present time. He told us next that the Government had invited Lord Kitchener to come to Australia. Thomas Ewing for the Deakin Government provided that f*r the first three years the trainees must put in every year eighteen working days. The honourable member for Parramatta, when he was Minister of Defence, proposed to have only one muster parade per year. Mr they would show the Old Country and the Hutchison, the honourable member for Hindmarsh, moved this amendmentThat the words "" on registration of one musto. ter parade"" be left out, with a view to insert "" seven whole days in camp of continuous training."" The amendment was lost by thirty-two votes to seventeen, Sir Thomas Ewing and the old Liberals in the Fusion voting against it. The honourable member for Wimmera has a lot to take credit for, indeed. With regard to the Naval Unit, it is not five years since a battle raged here over the Naval LoanB ill introduced by the right honourable member for Swan, as Treasurer for the Deakin-Cook Fusion party, to raise a loan of £3,500,000. For what purpose? Not to start an Australian Navy, but to present a Dreadnought to the Old Country. We all know how that memorable division was taken. After a good deal of fighting in the House, we got an amendment made to the effect that the loan was not to be proceeded with until after the elections. vide a Fleet, not to present a Dreadnought to the Old Country. The question at issue was whether the Fleet should be provided out of loan money or is right, and I am right.

They, .never decided on giving a Dreadnought. bers who talked on the platform about it. for Swan talked about giving an increased subsidy to the Old Country, and presenting it with a Dreadnought. You, sir, remember as well as I do that we went to the country with that proposal fresh in our minds, and you recollect, too, The Bill introduced by Sir the fiasco that occurred. You know well what took place in Sydney. There were bands playing in the streets, .with much flag-wagging, and a great dinner was given in the Town Hall. Patriotic speeches were made. Men went round with a subscription list, and said that Imperial Government what the sentiments of the Labour party in Australia amounted They declared that they would present the Old Country with a Dreadnought raised by public subscriptions.

On the following morning, when the mayor and his secretary went round the city to collect the money to present it to the Old Country, many of the banqueters were found with a bandage round their heads, or sitting in their office with elbows on the table and chin in their hands: while some of them did not even recollect putting their names on the pad, and when the entries were shown to them, they did not recognise their signatures. You, sir, remember the trouble which was experienced in collecting the money. It was announced iu the press in Melbourne by the Fusionists that they were going to show the loyalty of the citizens of Sydney and the loyalty of the people of New South Wales by subscribing the money for a Dreadnought. It is a matter of history now how much money they raised. I think £46,000 was collected from this great wealth-producing centre-the Chicago of Australia. Their loyalty was worth £46,000! the money? .member directly. On the night the banqueters had the "" shicker "" in them, and did not know what they were doing with the pad, they subscribed £2,500,000; but when the mayor went to collect the actual cash, after several weeks or months, the great patriots who had done the flag-wagging and set the bands playing, had to part up to the tune of £46,000. They offered that sum to the Old Country to purchase a Dreadnought, and the Imperial Government said, "" No, thanks; we are not that hard up. We do not want your money. You had better do something with it in Australia."" The Fusionists put the money in a bank at fixed deposit, and found that nobody would have anything to do with it. They were like the kid in the advertisement for Pears' soap. They were not happy till they got it, and when they got it they did not know what they were going to do with it . After all the "" flapdoodle "" and flag-wagging, the Fusionists had £46,000, and they wanted to present the Minister of Defence with the money to furnish the Naval College on condition that it was to be built within so many miles of Sydney. The Minister could not accept the offer conditionally, and the consequence was that the money was handed over unconditionally to the Federal Government to buy furniture with which to furnish the Naval College now being built at Jervis Bay. It is of no use for honourable members on the Opposition side to think that the public have such a short memory that they do not remember these tilings. I , for one, have never claimed, either on the platform or in this House, that the Labour party did anything more than its just share, and it should only get its just Teward, in connection with the starting of compulsory military training and the establishment of the Naval Unit of Australia.

Surely, then, there can be no harm in referring to mat^ ters of a littl e more recent date! The member's time has expired. What impressed me in the remarks of the honourable member for Maranoa was the apparent sincerity with which he deprecated the importation of party feeling into the speech of the honourable member for Wimmera, and the gusto with which he himself made free and unjustifiable use of recent history in an attempt to gain kudos for the Labour party in regard to Australia's preparations for defence. The speech was an extraordinary mixture of half-facts and whole nonsense; but I must congratulate the honourable member on his imagination in referring to a banquet which he should have known did not take place, because, had it been held, he would have contrived to be at it . tended it . banquet such as the honourable member referred to. He seems not to think that any one could do a generous thing unless as the result of a good dinner.

Although the honourable member threw gibes' at the donors, other honourable members are thankful for their generosity. the acceptance of the money. would not have done so had it been offered to himself. The inventivegenius of the honourable member is considerable, but it is playing it low down to cast ridicule upon the generosity of others; and I do not think that the Committee wishes to hear anything more about the matter. I do not propose to quarrel about how the dreadnought Australia came into being; about how our Citizen Forces came to be created; or about the party, or set of persons, to whom credit is due for what has been done in the past for the defence of this country. Our business now is to I can well underdo the best we can at the present time, and to put past squabbles behind us. It These old tales are true. The is not as if we were facing an election, and had to be constantly taking liberties with the truth ; we are confronted by a serious national crisis; and, unless we concentrate our attention upon the problem we shall be false to the trust which the people have reposed in us. I regret the absence of the Assistant Minister of Defence, because there are one or two matters to which I wish to direct his attent i o n ; b u t I have no doubt that he w ill read the Hansard report of my speech. I cannot help thinking that there is something wrong with the CentralA d ministration of tlie Defence Department, though whether the faul t is in its organization or in the allocation of duties I am not in a position to say. I strongly sug-. gest that Ministers should look into this matter, and wipe away the corroding dust which is clogging wheels that should revolve silently and expeditiously. I will take a few matters which have come within my own notice. It should not be impossible for the Department to pay witH reasonable exI have not attended a pedition; yet the overtime payments of the ordnance storemen in Sydney are about ten months overdue. These men have waited for their money month after month, and a week or so ago they had not been paid overtime since last September ;. and, so far as I know, have not yet received it . My last question to the Minister on the subject drew forth the reply that one must expect delays during a time of considerable stress. But these are delays which should not occur after the initial stress. The Department ought I , and others, voted against to have expanded, and if it has not yet expanded, ought immediately to expand sufficiently to enable all questions of payment to be settled with expedition, and facility. Let me give another instanceof departmental demoralization: I hold in my hand papers relating to a matter which, was plaoed in my charge in Sydney last week by the representative of two ladies who had given money to provide a motor ambulance for the F i r s t Australian L i g h t",45,Defence Bill

465,Mr Kelly,"The honourable memberHorse Brigade, and had reoently received a cablegram from the officer in charge at the front, sayingMotor ambulance not arrived. No advice. Urgently needed. Make inquiries. They made inquiries in Sydney, and found that their draft, which was dated 8th February last, was forwarded by the New South Wales Commandant to the Minister at Melbourne on the 8th or 9th of that month. But, according to a letter which I have received from the Secretary to the Defence Department, it was not u n t i l the 30th March-seve n weeks after the money had been received in Melbournethat a cablegram was sent to the High Commissioner in London advising him that this donation, with others, had been received, and asking him to make the necessary arrangements for the purchase of the ambulance, and to inform the Department here what action had been taken in the matter. The letter added that this advice, which it was expected would come by mail, had not yet been received. A donation is given to provide a vehicle which is urgently needed for the use of our wounded soldiers, and yet the money is kept unused in Melbourne for seven weeks. Something must be radically wrong for that to have been possible. bringing forward these matters to give offence to honourable members opposite. member was trying to make political capital out of them. the paltry motive suggested by the honourable member; my concern is to get matters of urgency dealt with speedily. Why should our wounded men have to: suffer needless misery because of the inaction of some one in Melbourne, or for the want of some one here to take action ? A few days ago another instance of the same sort of slackness was brought under my notice, but in this case there was some excuse for the Department. Some time ago a friend came to see me on behalf of a contractor in Sydney who was the lowest tenderer for a Defence contract for the manufacture in Australia of signalling lamps. Certain parts of the signalling lamps could not be obtained in Australia. I went to the Department, and suggested to the officer in charge of contracts that, in the circumstances, the best thing to do would be fco cable at the contractor's cost to the H i g h Commissioner to obtain quotations, and arrange for the immediate shipping of the goods, and then the contract could proceed with facility. The officer in charge of that sub-department recognised the suggestion as a sane one, and I thought there would be no further trouble. To my astonishment, however, about a week ago my friend, together with the contractor, who had been obliged to come across from Sydney, interviewed me and asked me to see the Department about the matter. ThereI found that the cable, which ought to have gone to the H i gh Commissioner the day after my previous visit, because the matter was allegedly one of urgency, had been delayed for some reason for three weeks, and was then sent, not as an urgent cable at the cost of the contractor, but as a week-end letter at the cost of the Department. most absurd red-tapism, but in this case there was the excuse, which did not exist in regard to the more serious instance I previously mentioned, that the Defence Department has never had a rough-andready method of solving a difficulty of this kind. The Department had never preI am not viously had to inquire at the contractor's cost for some essential of his contract. Apparently, the practice would be to call for tenders afresh, or to start negotiations It looks as if the honourable with one of the unsuccessful tenderers. I had suggested a rough-and-ready method hitherto unknown in the DepartI am not actuated by ment of overcoming the difficulty and of bringing the lamps into existence a couple of months earlier than they will now be available. Stories of the wildest character are in circulation as to happenings in the Department, and I have no wish to foist any of those stories on the Committee, but I shall mention one incident which has been related to me, of the truth of which I know nothing. I heard in Sydney, about ten days ago, that a telegram had some time previously been received from Melbourne asking for twenty-eight bakers for a field bakery. The men were needed urgently, the wire said. The twenty-eight bakers were engaged the next day, and the Sydney office, for the following two or three weeks, was telegraphing to Melbourne without result to ascertain what to do with them !

The proposals for compulsory military service and an Australian Navy have been advocated by leading members of the Labour party for many years. The right honourable member for Parramatta, during the Defence debates in this Parliament in 1903, saidhe objected to the proposals for a Citizen Army compulsorily trained. The old volunteer system was sufficient, and compulsory training contrary to the genius of our race. Then there was the attitude of the present Leader of the Opposition on the subject of the Australian Navy so recently as 1909. A t a meeting held in the Sydney TownH a l l in that year, he saidT nail my flag once and for all to an increased subsidy to Great Britain.

AB ill was passed to come into operation by proclamation, but the proclamation was never issued. When the Labour party came into office they put into operation, sympathetically, the platform they had been fighting for for years. While the leaders of the present Opposition were jeering at these proposals, the Labour party had to educate public opinion up to them, and, though the then Deakin section under duress made a somewhat lame move, it was the Labour party that organized and set the scheme in motion.

The Leader of the Opposition on the date mentioned saidThe substantial fact remains, and cannot be rebutted, that every effort to pass an Agricultural Bureau Bill has been strangled by honourable members opposite, and I wish to put this on record because it will be useful in the near future. The right honourable gentleman further saidI made a statement at Maryborough which was wrong in one small detail. I said that every effort that had been made to pass the Agricultural Bureau Bill had been defeated by the Labour party. . . . The only particular in which I was incorrect was in the statement that the Bill had not left this Chamber. As a matter of fact, the Bill had [166] left this Chamber on the day before Parliament was prorogued. In those circumstances, I think, I might well have been forgiven for making that small mistake. The honourable It conmembers who prevented that Bill from reaching the statute-book were the supporters of the party now in power. I say, moreover, that the honourable members on the Government side of the House have defeated every effort to date to place a similar measure on the statute-book. That statement cannot be controverted. Several war-ships The Leader of the Opposition very cleverly confuses events, and refers to statements that were made when the Agricultura l BureauB ill was previously before the House. To be f a i r , he should have confined himself to the effort that he said was made by his party to pass that B ill during the session they were in power. The records show that it was the Liberal party that, in the 1913 session-the last term they were in office-evidentl y had no sincere desire to promote this B ill ; and this I can prove from the records. The Leader of the Opposition, in his policy speech at Parramatta, reported in the Sydney Daily Telegravh of 16th July, 1914, s a i d It is with infinite regret, and not a little disgust, that I have to announce that the Bill to establish a Pederal Agricultural Bureau is still among the proposals for legislation. It should have been on the statute-book, and On the 27th would have been there but for the determinain the House, tlie Leader of tion to prevent it on the part of the Senate.

I refer to the regulation dealing with the appointment of temporary employees in the Public Service. The regulation states that any temporary appointments shall be given to those who are members of a trade union or industrial organization; that is to say, shall be given to them in the first place. The object and spirit of the Public ServiceA c t is to remove patronage of Ministers, influence of members of Parliament, and influence of all sorts generally from the Public Service, and to entrust all appointments to a Commissioner, who is supposed to be removed entirely from political life, and to be in a position to deal with appointments on merit alone, subject to no in fluence from Ministers and members of Parliament or any other person. That was the intention of the Legislature when the Public ServiceB ill was introduced in the first Commonwealth Parliament in 1901. I have taken the trouble to refer to what was said on that occasion; and, 1 as I recognised that the quoting of what was said by persons no longer in the House, or persons not in the present M in istry, would be of little use, I looked up what had been said on the subject by the present Attorney-General when the B i ll was under discussion in 1901.

518,Sir John Forrest,"Did it emaGovernment have no right whatever to direct the Commissioner to frame such a regulation. The fact is that a reign of terror exists in our Public Service, and, as a result, public omcers are afraid to do their duty. I do not blame them much, because I know that they would be venomously pursued for the rest of their lives if they offended the party now in power. to make. true anyhow. If any one offends the Labour party he is never forgiven. However, I do not wish to say anything offensive, and I withdraw it if I have done so. I ask whether it is right for the Government, with a Public Service Act such' as we have, to order the Public Service Commissioner to frame such a regulation for the carrying out of his responsible and independent powers or . duties under the Act? I know the Public Service Commissioner pretty well, and have always found him to be an upright, independent, honourable man, most anxious to do his duty to the best of his ability. I confidently make the statement that I do not believe ever framed such a regulation as that to which I have referred, and must, therefore, have been directed to do so by the Government. If he was directed to do so, and I believe he was, the action of the Government was absolutely wrong and i l legal, being contrary to the Public Service Act. . It imports political influence into the administration of the Public Service in a way which I very much regret, and which, in my opinion, cannot be defended.

I do not propose to discuss the matter any further than to say that steps have been taken to accelerate the production of rifles there. able gentleman knows in his heart that the criticism was right. or wrong, I can say from my heart that, whatever opinion any honourable member may hold, if he express it honestly here, I am prepared to give him credit for it, whether his remarks be aimed at the Government or not. By tlie honest expression of opinion in this free House we should be able to achieve some good results. The Assistant Minister of Defence has told honourable members what has been done regarding the working of the Small Arms Factory as it stands to-day. I have taken the responsibility, in conjunction with the Minister of Defence, of taking further action, involving considerable expenditure, which will provide for the future. Perhapsi t would be better that I should read a statement in reference to the matter. It is as follows : Small Arms Factory. The question of duplicating the present capacity of the Small Arms Factory has been under consideration for some time, and meanwhile inquiries were made regarding the additional plant required. The Government having decided to proceed with the dupli[9.27] I cation, an order for the bulk of the necessary machines has been placed with the Pratt, Whitney Company, the firm that supplied the existing rifle-making plant, at an approximate cost of about £48,000. Further machines and tools, at an estimated cost of £3,700, are to be obtained from other sources, aud it is anticipated that nearly all of.these will be made or obtained in Australia.

Under the proposal now made, a slightly increased price will have to be paid, b ut the increase amounts to not more than 10 per cent. Taking everything into consideration, if all goes well with these arrangements we shall be placed in a position of advantage, should the war continue, as compared with the position we occupy at the present time. rangements will be made for housing the machinery immediately it arrives? giving effect to this order will be proceeded with without delay. This will mean, of course, that before this Parliament goes into recess I shall have to make a financial statement dealing with the whole question, and get the necessary appropriation, nob only for this, but for other purposes. As honourable members are aware, yesterday marked the close of the financial year, a year the most eventful in the history of Australia, and perhaps in the history of the whole world. 1 am glad to be in a position to say that the financial difficulties of the Commonwealth are not at the present moment visible, but there are reasons for care, caution, and courage, if I may put the matter in that way. The following statement will indicate the position better than I could explain it in the course of a speech : Revenue.

I desire again to take this opportunity of thanking the private financial institutions for the manner in which they came forward to meet the crisis, for their own advantage as well as for the advantage of the nation. The emergency was met by the use of the national credit, £1,222,401 which is, I think, safe beyond any dreams of trouble. It was the desire of the Go.. 22,364,264 vernment at the time not to borrow any money at all for war expenditure. It was .. . . £23,586,665 obvious that what we are doing now could 38,345,169 have been done without borrowing at a l l ; but at that time it was impossible for the States to borrow, and it was impossible . . £14,758,504 for the Commonwealth itself at the time to borrow except for war purposes. Both private institutions and Governments were in a high state of tension lest their credit . . £14,100,000 should fail at the period when they wanted money. I have secret documents with me, which can be seen if there is any .. 658,504 doubt in the matter, to show that it became absolutely necessary that credit should Commonwealth and State Governments.

That was a perfectly fair and legitimate bargain for the mutual advantage of both parties. So far as regards the criticisms of the uote issue, I ask honourable members and the public to believe that there is no shadow of a doubt as to its stability at the present time. trouble, and really no apprehension up to the present, but, having said this, I am in duty bound in my official position to say that, although the issue can be increased up to a certain stage, it is inevitable thab a point will be reached at which it would be dangerous to go further. therefore, to warn honourable members and the people that ib is not the business of the Government to reach that danger point. cheers on the other side. Several Honorable MEMBEBS -Hear, hear! orable friend, the Leader of the Opposition, might have refrained from that in terjection, because honourable members behind me understood tlie note issue when it was inaugurated, and they do not get excited when they are told of its success, that being nothing new to them. Be that as it may, there is no citizen of Australia who does not appreciate the fact that, by our own credit, and without the shadow of a doubt or difficulty, we have been able practically to avoid raising another £20,000,000 upon which we would have had to pay interest, and without being in any way helped further forward than we are under present conditions. I lake this opportunity of saying to the Committee that I hope to have an early opportunity of making a Budget statement forecasting, as fa r as can be seen, the financial position for the next half-year, and providing for any eventualities that may arise. In a Democracy like ours, with an educated and free people, it is the business of Ministers to lay the financial position before them at the earliest opportunity; and I shall endeavour, on behalf of the Government, to do so. I am sure that whatever view honourable gentlemen opposite may take of it , I shall be able to claim their assistance in giving effect to the policy of this country for the prosecution of the war, the carrying on of our industries, and the protection of our own people. [9.48] I can only say, in reply to the right honourable the Prime Minister, that he will at a l l times receive the assistance which he has just now sought from members of the Opposition. such a curious way. again! The honourable member is only saying over again what his Leader said the other night, that we never gave tlie Government any assistance except in a nagging way. Whether we nag or not, this assistance is sought, and I hope it I want, will always be freely rendered. I want now to congratulate my honourable friends over there on tlie unanimous cheer that went up just now when the possible limitation of the note issue was mentioned, I do not hear any and when they were warned by their own Prime Minister of the dangers of an unlimited note issue. May I suggest that the war has done one good thing ? It has I think my right honheaved overboard that old-time notion, of the invulnerability of a note issue, which honourable members opposite preached assiduously over the length and breadth of this country. A little practical application of tlie principle has knocked all that nonsense out of their heads, and I congratulate them sincerely on their financial conversion, at auy rate. Now, I want to say a word of congratulation concerning the magnificent revenue which has been derived from Customs and Excise during this war year. Is this not the best of all tributes to the might and invulnerability of the British Navy, which has kept our seaways open for us, with the result that our trade has been unmolested from the beginning u n t i l the end of the year ? I remember, when this war broke out, that the officials of the Treasury wore an aspect of gloom for some days, and they were talking of having no revenue, if the war lasted, by the end of the year. Thanks, however, to the way in which Jellicoe has kept the seas open, there has been no diminution in our Customs revenue, which means that our acti-",58,Never Bbought On Again

There is just one other matter upon which I would like the attention of the Prime Minister for a moment.

Prime Minister is quite right. £1,222,000 less £347,000. The debit for have imposed during the year, they have the year, therefore, is, roughly, £900,000. gone to the bad on the year's financing to standing; on account of land taxation. standing fro m fresh taxation to the exmeantime, our income has kept u p ; it is tent of about £3,000,000 that has been better than we anticipated at the beginimposed.

I am trying to get at the facts, for this reason. We ought to remember that in war time a l l special expenditure arising out of the war should be met generously and without question. But that only lays upon us a greater obligation to see that our ordinary administrative expenditure is kept to tlie lowest possible point. The more we can save reasonably and consistently with efficiency on the ordinary But you have to take administration, the more we shall have to ' spend for special war administration.

I would just as soon take the opinion of the man who is associated with the machinery every day, arid knows what it can do, as the opinion of any one else. He knows what he can do, and he has told the Government that they ought to have had two shifts long ago. I know that; The point I got up to stress is that the Government ought not to rely on the duplicated plant for any relief during the war. They will be building on an insecure foundation if they do.

We have a plant here, and the Government's own chairman says in his report that it can supply, and ought to supply, 20,000 rifles per annum on the basis of an eight hours' shift. I do not see any reason why, in I would rather these stressful days, the Factory should not very soon work up to an output for three shifts of 50,000 rifles per annum. There is hope in that direction. There is not very much immediate hope here. The financial statement presented by the Treasurer to-night must afford to every It w ill be of member of the House, as well as to the ordinary governmental Departments of congratulation. But perhaps the most cheering and satisfactory feature of the I do not care whole statement, is that, for actual war expenditure, Australia has been able to He says that to us offifinance itself.
