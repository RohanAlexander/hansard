It is The Queen's wish that I convey to you and honourable members of the House of Representatives Her Majesty's sincere thanks for the loyal message to which your Address gives expression. Governor General 13 April 1967 Minister)I wish to inform the House that the Minister for External Affairs( Mr giving slowly diminishing percentages of Hasluck) left Australia on Saturday on an official visit to attend a meeting of the South East Asia Treaty Organisation Ministerial Council in Washington and a meeting of Australian heads of missions in Mexico. He expects to return to Australia about 1 May. The Minister for Health (Dr Forbes) will leave on Thursday to attend the Twentieth Assembly of the World Health Organisation in Geneva and to undertake official visits to the United Kingdom and North America. He will be away until 20th May. During their absence, the Minister for Education and Science (Senator Gorton) and the Minister for Civil Aviation( Mr Swartz) will act as Minister for External Affairs and Minister for Health respectively. Until Mr to the Minister for Defence regarding a Hasluck returns questions relating lo external affairs should be directed to me. During Mr Forbes' absence the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Freeth) will represent the Minister for Education and Science in this chamber. 4127/67-R-[53 ] TAX CONCESSIONS Treasurer. What requirements must be met to enable gifts which are made to worthy organisations to qualify as tax concessions? Are gifts to the present civil aid programme in Vietnam tax deductible? If they are not, will he take up this matter at Cabinet level and urge that such gifts be made tax deductible? on which taxation deductions for aid gifts can be made is that the aid must be for Australia's internal purposes and to permit the development of Australian activities, for example, in respect of Aborigines, Australian cultural development, conservation of natural resources and the like., The Government has decided also that special agencies of the United Nations will be permitted to have the benefit of taxation deductions. Although it has been said before in the House, I mention, because I believe it ought to be repeated, that Australia's participation in aid programmes is a big one. The growth this year has been up to $125m and aid now represents very nearly 0.7% of our gross national product. If we look at the figures of other countries we see that Australia practically leads the field and that most other countries, far from giving this proportion are their gross national product for this purpose. As well, we give it on a free basis with no tags or ties attached. Most other countries impose conditions. We do it voluntarily and unconditionally. As to the scheme mentioned by the honourable member, it has not come within the scope of the present policy of the Government but nonetheless, for his purposes, 1 will have a look at it again and will convey the answer to him. proposal to use Australia as a rest and recuperation centre for American servicemen from South East Asia.

We have readily agreed to the presence for Defence has already said in a public in Australia of a four-man survey statement and also in answer to a question team, but I should point out that up in the House pretty well all that can be to this point of time no decision of any said about this matter.

As to the second part, the Government does review from time to time the contribution it is making, both in the military sense and also in the area of civil aid. As my colleague the Treasurer has just pointed out, Australia has not been lagging in the assistance it has been giving to people in other countries for various helpful purposes, and certainly the civil aid requirements of Vietnam would have a very strong claim upon our considerations. The concern which the honourable member expresses on this matter is reflected in the Government and will be borne in mind in any future consideration we give to this question. Mr J. R. FRASERI ask the Minister for the Interior: Has he been able to reach a decision on a proposal I put to him some time ago that a rebate scheme should apply to payments of land rent due to the Commonwealth by pensioners who are the owners of houses on leased land in Canberra, similar to the rental rebate scheme that applies to tenants of Government cottages? Further, has he been able to reach any decision on the proposal that rates payable by pensioners be reduced or waived? second part of the question first. I said the Treasurer in relation to sales tax on the yesterday, when announcing that revaluaitems mentioned. I am sorry that I cannot tions would be arrived at, that provision give an explicit answer to the first would be made for people to make requests part of the question. However, I will treat for rebates or concessions in rates.

If so, is the money to be provided by way of grants or loans? Has the Commonwealth Government received applications from the States for this assistance? If not, is the Government now prepared to receive and consider such applications? member is correct in suggesting that this was one of the policy undertakings that we made in the course of the last election campaign, and action has already been put in train to implement it. I cannot say just what stage has been reached with each of the State governments, but it is our intention to make this arrangement effective as soon as possible. The proposal was that what we would provide would be by way of grant and would be additional to what the States themselves would be providing for this important purpose. many educational requisites or items of stationery which are used by school children and other students are subject to sales tax? Are items such as rulers, pencils, exercise books, notebooks and ball point pens subject to sales tax ranging upward from 12%? Does the Treasurer think that the imposition of sales tax on these items is reasonable when they are used exclusively for educational purposes? Finally, has the Treasurer been requested by representative bodies to abolish sales tax on such items? the question, I have no recollection of any",16,Vietnam

I was wondering whether the time limit had been extended. of order? giving information. stance in the point of order. the notice of the right honourable gentleman that this allegation was repeated in a recent ABC television programme entided This Day Tonight'? Is there any truth in the allegation? Has there been any attempt by this Government to influence the policy or management of the ABC? Lastly, can the right honourable gendeman assure the House that the allegations concerning himself, the Treasurer and the Minister for Labour and National Service are without foundation? which, in the light of developments, has caused me a good deal of concern. The existence of these news sheets is well known to members of the Parliament. I do not know how many there are. I am neither a subscriber to nor a regular reader of them, I challenge Mr Whitington to produce one but occasionally one is brought under my notice when some matter which it is felt should occupy my attention is placed before me. This particular item was placed before me. At the time. I did not take any action to correct it because, frankly, so frequently do statements of an erroneous kind occur in either these news sheets or the Press that colleagues who had been named whether it would be beyond one's normal range of time or operation to correct every one. Most honourable gentlemen are aware that what the publishers of the news sheets purport to do is to give what they would describe as the news behind the news, or information of a confidential character of we put our own assessment on their accuracy. As I frequently have a complete knowledge of events which are referred to I do not need to read an erroneous or incomplete account of them in the news sheets concerned. The matter mentioned in this case was a specific allegation which, until further developments occurred and I found it widely reported upon and subsequently made the subject of the ABC broadcast to which the honourable gentleman has referred, I did not take very seriously. The principal of 'Inside Canberra'-the news sheet in which these allegations appeared-is well known to us. He is an amiable fellow and my own personal relations with him over very many years have been quite cordial. The fact that often I have read things which I knew to be incorrect has not troubled me unduly. For example, he referred in this particular news sheet to some relationship between Sir Howard Beale and myself which had a bearing on my own election to the deputy leadership of the Liberal Party. He stated that Sir Howard had been the only New South Wales member to vote for me on that occasion and that I narrowly won the ballot by one vote. As to the first part I have good reason to believe that that was incorrect, and as to the second part I know that it was incorrect. Be that as it may, the specific allegation was made that I as Prime Minister had exercised in some way indirect or improper pressure upon the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I give that an emphatic rejection. I label it as a lie, and tittle of evidence that at any time. I have exercised any improper or indirect pressure upon the Commission or any of its officers. That goes also for the Commission, l f it can produce any such tittle of evidence it is welcome to do so. I took the opportunity to ask my they could give me the same assurance. They both did so unhesitatingly, and I am sure they would repeat the same invitation to Mr Whitington or to the Commission.

27,Mr Harold Holt,"This is a matterto time by ABC reporters. Once in recent times I had occasion myself to contact Mr that objective which we maintain for Duckmanton in order to inquire what time was going to be made available to the Parties and to the 'Yes' and 'No' cases in the forthcoming referendum. I repeat that at no point can it be alleged with any honesty or accuracy that indirect or improper pressure has been exercised. The aspect of this matter which really troubles me is that the Commission followed up this uncorroborated item in this news sheet. I am sure Mr Whitington would not reject the statement that his own political views are well known and are in sympathy with those of honourable gentlemen opposite. His own forecast of the outcome of the last election was hardly a reliable indication of the state of public opinion at that time. But when the Commission sought to make some feature of this report on its programme, 'Tonight and Today' I think it is called be accurate; it is 'This Day Tonight', which in itself has a somewhat ambiguous ring about it. It is rather like the Beatles' 'Hard Day's Night'. When this item appeared the two people who were chosen to comment on this statement, uncorroborated in this unofficial news sheet by a known Labor supporter, were Mr Michael Willesee, who is a son of Senator Willesee, a Labor senator, and who as far as I am aware does not disagree' violently with the political views of his father, and Mr Allan Fraser, the recently defeated Labor candidate for Eden-Monaro. ThereI thought was a very good example of objectivity and impartiality. While honourable gentlemen on this side of the House the thinking of the interjector if he were to have a drink himself. On this matter honourable gentlemen on this side of the House share the views of those who have offered their criticism.

I hope we can have the support of all honourable members from whatever side of the House they come in achieving ourselves. Minister a question supplementary to that asked him by the honourable member for Mallee concerning the proposed $50m grant to the States for water conservation projects. I ask the Prime Minister to clarify the position in the light of an answer which he himself gave a fortnight ago to the honourable member for Gwydir, and an answer which the Deputy Prime Minister gave to the honourable member for Dawson on the same day. The right honourable gentleman said: The Government has not yet completed its consideration ot the details of the proposed scheme. However, we expect to do so shortly and will then be in touch with the State governments about it. The Deputy Prime Minister said: The initiative rests with the State Governments to make proposals to the Commonwealth. I ask the right honourable gentleman: Has he made any approaches to the State governments, or have they made any approaches to him, about these grants during the last fourteen days since the time these questions were asked and up to the time of his answer earlier today? lection that there has been correspondence between some of the premiers and the Government on this matter. I shall try to get an authoritative statement for the honourable gentleman as promptly as I can. It is not customary to make public any communications between the heads of State Governments and the Commonwealth Government, but so far as I am capable of satisfying the inquiry of the honourable gentleman, I shall do so. the Treasurer.

Are Regular Army personnel with considerable experience in Malaysia being brought back to Australia to reinforce the 2nd and 7th battalions which are shortly to leave for Vietnam?

Is it proposed that national service trainees will be replacing these men in Malaysia? of members from the 4th Battalion at Terendak were brought to Australia to reinforce the 2nd Battalion which is in the relief force going to Vietnam. So far as I know, although these men probably have been out of Australia for up to two years -dependin g on whether or not they went with the original force or as reinforcements -onl y those who were willing or wanted to join the 2nd Battalion have done so because obviously this was going to involve them in another year's absence from Australia.

Can the Prime Minister inform the House whether these assertions are true or false? statement was made by the Leader of the Opposition at a political gathering in support of Labor candidates and therefore a certain amount of hyperbole of Jaycees. makes the offence even worse. I was giving the honourable gentleman credit for a little enthusiasm and poetic, or political, licence in support of his own cause; but if he was correctly reported, then I suggest that he should place the authority for his statement before this House. I assert quite categorically that no country can point to a higher general standard of housing for its people than can Australia. No country can point to a higher percentage of home ownership than is to be found in Australia. The records of the United Nations confirm this assertion. I cannot speak with the same authority about education, but I do know that in VictoriaI happened to look at these ngures only yesterday-n o less than 29% of the total State Budget is devoted to education. I would be surprised if there were many places in the world which could show the devotion of a higher proportion of financial resources to purposes of education. In other words the Australian standard State by State is very high. toria is less per head than in any other State. Victorian percentage, which on anybody's calculation is high. In the Australian Capital Territory, Darwin and the Papua and New Guinea area-ith e areas over which we have special jurisdiction-ther e is a very considerable degree of urban planning. What is done by the State governments in relation to their cities is, of course, a matter within their province. Looking around the world in my travels I have not felt that Australia need apologise for the standards of its cities and the facilities they provide, nor for the thought, care and devotion which are given to the problem of urban development by those, charged with responsibility for these matters. Shipping and Transport a question. I preface it by saying that in a joint statement issued recently the responsible Government Ministers said that Australia had to be prepared for containerisation on all trade routes and that the Government must have in advance all the answers to the problems which might arise when European, Japanese, American and other major ship owners began running container vessels to Australia. I ask: Does the Government not think that the most effective answer to protect our great Australian community from exploitation by avaricious foreign ship owners, who have been making enormous profits out of Australian exports and imports, would be to begin immediately construction of a Commonwealth owned overseas 'ine of container ships? man's question was highly coloured by a lot of rather false assumptions. I do not know whether very high profits are made by avaricious ship owners or whether in fact the ship owners are avaricious. The plain truth is that, on the information available to us at the present time, no shipping line registered in Australia and manned by Australian crews would be able to provide a cheaper shipping service for overseas cargoes. With this situation in mind the Government has started inquiries and examinations of the facilities available in Australia, so as to ensure that a reasonably efficient service is provided for all ships which carry containers to Australian shores. I might add that the Government is continuing at all times to investigate the ost n of carrying cargoes overseas to see at any time whether it is feasible for Australia to enter into this business. It is quite significant that no Australian ship owner is willing to engage in this kind of operation as a private enterprise venture. for National Development a question.

I stated that I knew of no specific instances and that I had merely heard rumours, but I felt that if there were any substance in the rumours we ought to be looking for ways in which to make it more difficult for people with known criminal records to enter Australia. Asked to elaborate further I said that it might be possible for Australia to refer to a list of known criminals which could be kept at police headquarters in the capital cities of the major countries. I was asked whether I had in mind Italy only. I said no, that it was something which could be worked out on an international basis. I told the reporters I wished to make it clear that I was not criticising either the Government or the Department of Immigration because Australia could not afford to make it more difficult for visitors to enter Australia than it would be for them to enter other countries. Otherwise we would annoy business people and tourists and lose valuable revenue. I said that a business man might require to come to Australia at twenty four hours notice and in fact could come here in about that time or a little more and that it would not be reasonable to hold him up for days or weeks while a comprehensive character check was made.

That was bad enough, but during the last four yearssince the Deputy Prime Minister's first outburst-w e have had a further deficit of $2,100m. or an average annual deficit of over S500m in the last four years. In fact, during the last two years there haa been a yearly deficit of over $800m. This compares with an average yearly deficit of $290m during the twelve years from 1950. Our total deficit with all countries since 1950 has been $5,500m. During this period our trading position has deteriorated alarmingly with the United States of America and the United Kingdom. We have had a combined deficit in current account with those two countries of over $8,700m. This has been made up of $4,500m with the United Kingdom and $4,200m with the United States. The deficit has been paid by the inflow of over $5,000m unplanned private foreign investment during this period-earnin g in some cases, up to 600% on original investment-comprisin g $3,500m private new investment and S 1,500m unremitted profits.

The latest outburst appeared in the 'Bulletin'. In an editorial on 4th March 1967 about foreign investments the writer stated: One of the most explosive issues of the future is embedded in this very question. He went on to say: Beyond question of political expediency, it is also surely in our general interest that the exploitation of our natural resources should be a matter over which we ourselves have the main control. Otherwise, international companies can use Australian mineral development as part of their own international politics, stopping or starting in accord with their own interests instead of ours, or even perhaps fiddling prices to their own advantage.

61,Mr Speakeri Have Received A Letter,,24,Overseas Investment In Australia
62,Mr Uren (Reid) [3.21],"On 2nd Aprilto all honourable members. We on this side will join any honourable member, any newspaper, any section of the Australian community in attempts to reduce and control our reliance on unplanned and uncontrolled foreign investment in Australia. We propose an all-party Parliamentary committee to inquire into all aspects of foreign investment in Australia. The Australian people have very limited knowledge of how much of Australia's industries and natural resources are owned or controlled by foreign investors. A survey was made in 1963 by the Stanford Research Institute of the USA, but it merely skimmed the surface of the subject. The Vernon Committee made certain observations in 1965 but it dealt superby foreign investment is that of our natural ficially with the question. Mr J. G. Wilson of Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd said in 1965 that Australian secondary industries overall were then already controlled by foreign investors to the extent of between 25% and 30%. This statement was contained in a report in the Melbourne 'Age' of 18th February 1965 which dealt with a paper delivered by Mr Wilson at a Stock Exchange symposium on the subject 'Foreign Ownership in Australia', in which he listed the proportion of control by foreign investment of various Australian industries. According to Mr Wilson'sfigures,the pharmaceutical industry had a foreign controlled equity of 97%, petroleum refining and distribution 96%, motor vehicle manufacture 95%, oil exploration and production 85%, telecommunications 83%, soap and detergents 80%, bauxite and aluminium 75%, chemicals 60%, food 50%, lead, zinc and copper 45% to 50%, and heavy engineering 30%. Imagine Australia's food industry controlled by foreign investment to the extent of 50%. There are other examples but my time is limited. I have, however, managed to give a brief outline of the extent of control of Australian key industries by foreign investment. In the few minutes left to me I would we do to prevent the takeover of our like to tell the House of some of the takeindustries and natural resources? What can overs by foreign investment that occurred we do to rectify the present position in in 1966 alone. In January W. R. Grace which we are relying on the uncontrolled (Aust.) Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of a United and unplanned flow of foreign investment States company, acquired an 83% interest into Australia? The Government should in Cresco Fertilisers Ltd. In March Consponsor a major public information drive tinental Oil Co. of Aust. Ltd acquired a to explain the policies we intend to adopt controlling interest in Amalgamated Chemicals Ltd for S5m. In November Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. of Ohio acquired a 70% interest in Hardie Rubber Co. Pty Ltd. This was a $4.8m deal. Also in November Parsons General Foods Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of Generals Foods Corporation of the United States of America, took over Cottee's Ltd for S 12.8m. Why was it thought necessary to sell Cottee's, a producer of foodstuffs? Of course this Government had provided no controls to prevent such a takeover. All in all, 1966 was not a bad year for the American investors. Another field which is being exploited resources. Sir Harold Raggatt, a former Secretary of the Department of National Development, was reported in the 'Australian' of 25th June 1965 as having stated: We must not be in pawn to foreign capital. Australia needed a national mineral development policy and companies should be encouraged to process mmerals before they are exported. Too great a foreign ownership of Australian mineral resources could mean a conflict of interests between Australia and the owners. The owners could take the understandable view that Australia was primarily a source of raw materials. The Government has had seventeen years in which to plan. It has had available to it the historical experiences of other countries. an off the cuff statement to the Press, as reported in the Canberra 'Times' of 28th March 1967, when giving details of the proposed bankers development refinance corporation: I wept with anguish at what happened with Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Limited. If we had had a corporation like this earlier we would have been in on the ground floor in both Hamersley and the aluminium complex at Gladstone. One would think that the Treasurer had not been a member or supporter of the Government for the last seventeen years. It is not my function, Mr Speaker, merely to criticise.

If we look at the figures in the 'Monthly Bulletin of Statistics' of the capital for the benefit of the Labor Party United Nations for the month of February great percentage of everything we produce is invested in future development. We are because it is critically important to an understanding of the problem, is that not This debate divides itself into two sections, the first of those sections being whether or not there is an increasing overseas control of our industries. Incidentally, I would like to add to that: Are they exploiting this country and, if so, what is to be done? Secondly, I wish to answer the question, which is a purely political one, of whether or not we should permit another committee to be established to try to create political and not for the benefit of the Australian",26,Overseas Investment In Australia
65,Mr Mcmahon (Lowe,"Treasurer ) [3.36] second only to Japan in what we do andcommunity. As to whether there is growing control, I think the House can take it from the figures I have just quoted that in fact there could not be growing control because of the high degree of Australian investment in ourselves. I will make two facts available to the House; the first indiwe have drawn 90% of our total overseas cates the increase in growth in overseas capital investment related to the total increase in investment in Australia. Over the period of the last three years there has been a growth in overesas investment compared with the three previous yearsI say thank heavens for it-of from $404m to $548m. That, Sir, is a growth of about 36% between the years I have mentioned. However, when we look at the gross increase in capital investment of this country we find that it has gone from $2,404m to $3,285m between the same two periods. In other words, looking at it in a percentage fashion there has been an increase of 37% as compared with the increase in overseas investment of 36%. Therefore, the argument that the Government and I want to put is that far from control moving into the hands of overseas investors it is steadily increasing in favour of Australians. I also want to mention the question of inflow of $900m, and this year we will be exploitation, because I think it fits nicely very lucky if there is a private capital into the picture. The figures that I have inflow of $500m. This must have one effect had extracted for me by the Treasury show on us against the fact that we are a country that the profit made on overseas investhungry for capital and hungry for development over the last four years has not ment and with immense opportunities that increased but steadily decreased. In 1962-63 are available to few other countries in the the company income payable abroad as a world. However, if the Labor Party wants percentage of accumulated overseas investto take action to drive it out and to stop ment was 6.8% whereas last year it was these overseas countries from investing 5%.

Against this background, can any sane and they must take some responsibility for person, any person who has reliability or the consequences. who has a wish to be true to the facts of life, possibly say that there is growing out to the House because they are control by overseas representatives of Auseloquent. They indicate the fact that we tralian interests? Could any such person must continue to induce private capital to possibly say that there has been exploitation? come here and to supplement Australian These are the facts I wanted to put before resources. I want to point to one other the House. We need international private fact to indicate how foolish and how illinvestment, and in the daysto come we informed were the statements made by the will need it to complement our own activities honourable member. He said that we ought in an unequalled way. Let me come to the next aspect. Here the honourable member for Reid clearly has the problem right out of perspective. If he had known what he was talking about he would have directed attention to the fact that the two countries from which hitherto funds have placed restrictions on the movement of capital to this country. In the case of the United States of America, the Department of Commerce announceda couple of days ago-that there would be a reduction of $US400m or 20% in private capital investment in the developed countries. We thought only a few weeks ago that thefiguresfor 1966 would be repeated, but we now find that there is to be reduction in comparison with what has happened in recent years. We all know that in recent days the United Kingdom Chancellor of the Exchequer has stated that the restrictions, so-called voluntarily imposed last year, will be continued this year. What is the effect of this on us, and what is likely to be the effect on our future? Here again the Labor Party must face up to the facts of life. I wUl draw attention later to its political activities. Last year we had private capital better living standards rests heavily upon the shoulders of the members of that Party, These are the figures I wanted to point to borrow more money from overseas. The simple fact is that it is extremely difficult to borrow overseas. This year, far from borrowing, we are repaying at least $90m of money we previously had received. It is well nigh impossible, unless we go to rates of interest in excess of 7%, to borrow overseas. The honourable gentleman would have to tell me whether he thinks 7% is an injurious rate as against 5% on private capital investment here. I do not know whether he wants it to be 7% or 7 i % , but I assure him that as Treasurer I do not wish to borrow on those terms. We come back to the last question raised left wingers and isolationists-the only ones by the honourable gentleman. Do we in who will speak in this debate-determine d fact want to have an ad hoc or a standing that we shall go back to where we were in committee to look into this question of the days of the Eureka Stockade. That is private capital investment here and its the age of their thinking. direction? I think that when we look at the list of speakers put up by the Opposition we will see that with one possible exception -Order! The Treasurer's time has expired. every one of them is a left winger and an isolationist. Every one of them, in terms of the defence of this country and in terms of its economic development, wants to stand I have not time at this stage to criticise a aloof from the rest of the world and to get bank that has not yet been established. back into a little shell that might have What the Opposition wants to draw attenbeen Australia in 1770 but certainly is not the honourable member for Reid( Mr Australia today.

If we want to see, in practical terms, what can be done we can look at the Mount Newman project, the biggest effort we have made at the development of Australian national resources in our history, involving more than $200m. Over 60% of this sum will be contributed from Australian sources including a consortium of banks and a consortium of life insurance companies. This is the kind of contribution we want to make to the greatness of Ihis country. On the opposite side we see the tion to in this debate this afternoon-and I would like firstly to draw attention to somefiguresthat are contained in a paper",27,Overseas Investment In Australia

67,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Lucock),,29,Overseas Investment In Australia
68,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports) [3.51],"To indicate the disparity between foreign investment and internal investment, I will quote from a publication of the Australian Industries Development Association. Surely that organisation is not regarded as being sympathetic to the aims of the Labor Party. The May 1966 issue of 'Director Reports', published by the Association, shows the source of figures that the Treasurer has been talking about. The publication reveals that gross private investment in Australia rose from $ 1,732m in 1960-61 to $2,386m in 1964-65-the last year for which figures are available. The author broke down the figures for new capital expenditure by private businesses and showed that whereas the rate of increase for local industry in 1964-65 was 20%, for foreign industry it was 39.5%, or almost double. Time is limited this afternoon but I want $US 1,677m. On the basis of those ngures to say one or two things about what is there will be a doubling of the total from happening concerning investment from the 1962 to 1967. Going back to 1951-as we United States of America. I draw attention can in Dr Brash's book-w e find the level to a very interesting book. I hope that the was $US255m. Every five years since 1951 Treasurer will read it if he has not done the figure has doubled.

Dr Donald T. Brash. On pages 6 and 7 doubled itself every five years. Therefore he lists a number of questions that he conit is absurd to suggest, as the Treasurer has, siders require answering in Australia. We that there is no evidence of increased in the Australian Labor Party have never relative foreign investment. Of course said that in no circumstances should there there is. be foreign investment. What we have said is that we should scrutinise where that investment goes. We should integrate it into from the September 1966 issue of 'Survey the kind of economic development that we of Current Business' show expenditure on would like to take place. Dr Brash agrees. plant and equipment by United States firms He said also that in Australia there was: A combination of strongly-held opinions and petroleum, and manufacturing, in 1964 little factual information on which to base them . . .

One is the fluctuation. otherwise insignificant occurrence triggering hasty In one year investment rose by $136m or ill-considered action. The honourable member for Reid did not this indicates the difficulty that foreign propose the discussion of this subject in investment casts upon the smooth economic order to present cut and dried remedies, development of Australia. What we do not although he suggested a number of things know-thi s is why I suggest that this kind which he would alter. He indicated that of inquiry would be valuable-is the this subject was so important that it ought relationship of that amount of investment to to be referred to an all-party parliamentary the total fixed private investment in Auscommittee for inquiry. I would iike to refer to some figures appearing at page 22 of Mr Brash's book and to bring them up to date. In the five minutes or so that I have left I can cover only a couple of aspects. At page 22 there is a table showing the amount of direct American investment in Australia. In 1956 the total amount was $US545m. By 1962, seven years later, the figure had doubled to $USl,097m. Between 1962 and 1963 the figure rose-and I take this information from the September issue of 'Survey of Current Business' published by the Department of Commerce in the United States of America-fro m $USl,097m to $USl,274m. There was an increase of SUS197m in that year. From 1963 to 1964 it rose from $USl,274m to $USl,475m, an increase of $US201m. Between 1964 and 1965 it rose by another $US202m from SUS 1,475m to The other figures I would like to take in Australia, by majpr industries. They show that in the fields of mining and smelting, there was investment of $306m. In 1965 the figure was $440. In 1966 it was S538. There are two interesting things about and in another year it fell by $68m. Surely tralia. We are deficient in adequate statistics showing fixed capital investment. If we take 1967 and a projectedfigureof $470m, I should say that the American investment will probably be near to one-quarter or 30% of the total amount that will be needed to make Australian industry as a whole grow in the next twelve months. I suggest that this is an unhealthy symptom. The Government does not know the rate at which foreign investment is expanding; this is the sort of information we can no longer afford not to know. This is the sort of information which any intelligent government that knows where it is going ought to have in its possession. We get in American publications better information about what America is doing in Australia than we get from Australian publications. We have to go to the American publications to find out what the position is. I suggest that it is time an adequate directory of foreign investments in Australia was kept. Order! The honourable member's time has expired. National Development) [4.2]-The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr capital in a number of other countries. Crean) has tried to show that overseas investment is going ahead at what he calls an explosive rate and that Australian investment is not keeping pace with it. The figures he has quoted just do not add up, because when one takes Treasury figures-I should think that Treasury figures are much more competently produced than are the figures taken by the honourable member from a newspaper or a book-the picture is quite different. I shall refer to two sets of figures only, because I know it is very easy to prove anything by quoting figures. These figures will show that the honourable member is on wrong premises when he says that our overseas investment is going ahead at an explosive rate and that Australian investment is not keeping up with it. The first set of figures I bring before the House deals with the percentage of company income payable abroad in relation to total company income in Australia. It is noticeable that over the whole of this decade the percentage has consistently dropped. It is true that the figure has fluctuated a little; it started at 25.6% and finished up at 21.3%. There was quite the there is a Labor Government? I admire reverse of an explosive increase in overseas investment. Starting at 1959-60, the relevant figures for the ensuing years are 25.6%, 26.8%, 22.6%, 24.8%, 24.1%, 22.8% and 21.3%. There has been a gradual drop in company income payable abroad compared with total company income payable throughout Australia. The same is true of the actual rate of increase in investment. In the three most recentfinancialyears private overseas investment in companies in Australia averaged $548m annually compared with an average inflow of $408m annually in the preceding three years. This is an increase of 36%. On the other hand, the total investment in fixed capital equipment in Australia averaged $2,404m in the three years to 1962-63 and $3,285m in the three years to 1965-66, an increase of 37%. The increases in both cases are almost identical. What does the Labor Party want? My posed this question. It is a question which we all ought to ask ourselves. Does the Labor Party want an industrial backwater here? We have seen the action that has been taken against the investment of foreign Those countries became industrial backwaters. The Labor Party itself never knows where it stands. As my colleague said, when it is in opposition the more radical people, the left wing people, are constantly seeking political advantage by attacking the investment of foreign money in Australia. But when the Labor Party is in government it could not act more quickly in going overseas to attract overseas investment. We have only to consider the case of General Motors-Holden's Pty Ltd. Was it not Mr Chifley who persuaded the organisation to come to Australia? Let us consider the number of men who went overseas when Labor was in oflice in New South Wales. Mr Cahill, Mr Heffron and Mr Renshaw all went abroad. Does anyone tell me that they went overseas merely for a holiday? Of course they did not. They went overseas to try to persuade people to invest in New South Wales. They knew that Victoria was going ahead at a faster rate and that they had to step up their rate of investment or be kicked out of office.

71,Colleague The Treasurer ( Mr Mcmahon),"Mr Reece very much for what he did. He put to me very strongly that the development of the Savage River project should be allowed to proceed although it was very largely financed by overseas investment. When Labor is in oflice and has the responsibility it realises the advantages of foreign investment, but when it is not in office it becomes irresponsible and its back benchers then bring out all these horrible skeletons. The proposal brought forward by the Opposition is based on wrong premises. Overseas investment in Australia is not increasing; it is declining and is being restricted and will be reduced even more. This is particularly so in relation to the United Kingdom and the United States of America, both of which are restricting the flow of capital overseas. Australia's own rate of investment is particularly high. As the Treasurer has told us, capital formation its profit in Australia because it must in relation to our gross national product is higher in Australia than in any other country, with the exception of Japan. Income payable abroad is declining; as we have seen, it is down to nearly 5% of the total investment. There are advantages and disadvantages to be derived from overseas investment in Australia, but as far as I can see the advantages very considerably outweigh the disadvantages. The only disadvantages relate to repayments of interest, dividends and royalties. As I have said, these amount to about 5% of the total sum invested in Australia. If one could borrow money at 5% one would be very happy indeed. As the Treasurer has said we have to pay 7% or more. Not only are we getting money for which we are paying 5% , but we ere getting all the advantages which I am about to point out. One of the great advantages of overseas investment is that we can go ahead at a rate which otherwise would be quite impossible. We can increase our resources and have a quicker growth rate. The greatest advantage of all-it is probably far more important than most of us appreciate-is that foreign investment brings increased know how into Australia. It brings in technology, efficiency, production, sales methods, patents, management, skilled personnel and fresh ideas. All these things flow it is able to undertake these big projects. in with the capital. Yesterday I read in a magazine that the greatest mining company in Australia, Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd, stated that it did not have the specialised and highly technical knowledge or resources necessary to undertake the programme necessary for drilling for oil off Victoria. If that company needs assistance, surely other companies would need it. These are the things that matter. Foreign investment means increased government returns. It is all very well fbr somebody to say, in relation to an overseas owned company, that the profitsflowoverseas. What are the true facts? First of all, such a company has to pay taxation in Australia and purchase equipment in Australia before it reaches the stage of being able to make a profit. If a wholly owned overseas company makes a profit of $lm it immediately has to pay 42i% in company taxation. It must then pay a withholding tax of 15% or 30% where there is an overseas agreement in existence. It must retain a proportion of expand. Itfinishesup sending 5% of its total profit overseas. This is an advantageous situation. Let me turn to mining, because it has been claimed that we are not getting sufficient equity in mining. In iron ore nine companies have contracts overseas. Of those, five are Australian controlled and nearly all are completely owned by Australia, including the great company referred-the Mount Newman project, which is by far the biggest. project? Here you have a case of Australian management, an increase in Australian equity and an agreement with the State which has led the company to go into the processing of these ores. In fact, the company has entered upon the processing of the ores quicker than its agreement with the State required and it has a commitment to enter upon the vast project of steel making. Surely all this is of tremendous advantage to Australia. It is not just a case of mining and exporting; Australia is getting a much bigger share of the income derived from the new deposits, partly because Australian business has reached the stage where At an earlier stage Australian firms did not have the finance to undertake these",31,Overseas Investment In Australia
72,To Which The Treasurer ( Mr Mcmahon),,32,Overseas Investment In Australia
73,Mr Luchetti,What about the Hamersley,32,Overseas Investment In Australia
74,Mr Fairbairni Will Come To That.,"projects, but now we see completely under Australian control such projects as those at Groote Eylandt, the phosphate deposits at Duchess, the nickel deposits at Kambalda, and deposits at Gove, Cobar and Tennant Creek. There is no doubt that we are reaching a stage where we are able to undertake more of these projects. As a result the percentage of overseas investment in these projects is lower than it has been in the past. Accordingly I see no point in setting up a committee to look into this matter. Minister for National Development ( Mr purchased in companies in Australia with the Fairbairn) said that he sees no reason why there should be an investigation into overseas investment in Australia and its affects on the Australian economy. It was his Government which in 1963, following agitation from honourable members on this side of the House, decided to set up the Vernon Committee of Economic Inquiry to report on, among other things, overseas investment in Australia, including. likely sources and trends and an assessment of its significance to the Australian economy.. As recendy as 1963 the Government decided that there shouid be an investigation into these matters. I admit that the Government was forced into its decision by Opposition members. Not one Labor member of the right or the left was on that Committee. In its report the Committee recommended that an up to date catalogue should be kept of capital flowing into this country from overseas and the purpose for which it was being used. The Committee recommended also that the amount entering the country should be limited to $300m a year. Since then the Government has allowed more than twice as much capital to come into the country each year from overseas. The Committee's report was very voluminous and costly. It cost the people of Australia more than $500,000. In one of its more important comments about overseas investment in Australia the big businessmarised, means that if you are an Ausmen and economists who made up the Committee pointed out that insufficient data is available upon which to make a proper assessment of foreign capital entering Australia and its effects on the community and the economy. I have revealed to the people of Australia who read Hansard that the Government does not know very much ms about the amount of capital flowing into Australia or its effects. In a question on asked: 1. What is the (a) value and fb) area of the rural lands of Australia owned overseas? 2. What is the (a) value and (b) area of leaseholds of Australian lands held by overseas interests? 3. What is the value of real estate in towns and cities of Australia owned overseas? The reply was, in effect: ' I do not have the slightest idea.' In another question on notice I asked the Treasurer: 1. What is the present value of investments following yearly inflows of private overseas investmentI gave the figure for each year up to 1964-65, when it was £258m. The Treasurer replied: In the absence of established market values it is not practicable to calculate the 'present value' . . . In other words, he did not have the slightest idea. In another question on notice I asked the Treasurer: 1. With what countries and when has Australia made double taxation agreements? I asked for information as to the effect of such agreements and the advantages that they may give to investors overseas. In his reply the Treasurer said that we have double taxation agreements with the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and New Zealand. He also said that statistics are not available to show what advantages would accrue to people in countries with which Australia has double taxation agreements. Not satisfied with that answer I asked the Treasurer: What amount of tax would be payable on dividends of (a) $5,000, (b) $10,000, (c) $20,000 and (d) $50,000 (without any deductions being allowed) received by (i) an Australian resident in Australia, (ii) a United States resident who is an investor in an Australian company. . . . I received a lengthy reply which, sumtralian and you receive $5,000 in dividends, you pay $1,140 in tax. But if you are an American living in New York, you pay only $750. If you have a taxable incoine of $10,000 and you are in Australia you pay $3,487, but if you are in New York you pay only $1,500.

I would not believe for one moment that he would have failed to port the proposition introduced by the have seen the Directory of Overseas Investhonourable member for Reid( Mr Uren) ment in Australia, which was published in that there should be a joint committee of 1966.

It gives a very clear ample evidence of concern from the MinisHe would also know that a responsible Minister, the Minister for Trade and Industry, made a statement at the time of the issue of the report. He sard at that time that the total assets of these 872 companies amounted to some $6,086,697,200. He then went on to refer to the proportion of ownership in the interests mentioned in the report. This gives a very concise picture of the posithe management of overseas investments. The position today is one of concern to under Labor or if we think of the problems in the United States, Australia's record is Dr. J. F.

82,"Picture Of Overseas Investment In Australia. Ter For Trade And Industry ( Mr Mcewen),","from the former Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, and from the present Prime Minister( Mr Harold Holt). As was pointed out by the honourable member for Scullin( Mr Peters), the Government saw fit some years ago to instruct the Committee of Economic Inquiry, known as the Vernon Committeea top level committee-to investigate this very question, but little has on the roads; we may say that there should been done as a result of the Committee's report. There is ample evidence that many people, including members of the Government, other distinguished government supporters and newspapers in many parts of Australia share the Opposition's concern on this matter. What has been the answer to this from spokesmen on the other side of the House? Let us consider firstly the honourable member for Cowper( Mr Robinson) who preceded me in the debate. He began by saying that the case put by the Australian Labor Party was destructive and actuated not in the interests of Australia. I suggest that when a member of a political party in this place or anywhere else begins a debate in an aspect like that it is quite impossible to continue it with him. If he will not give the Opposition any more credit than to describe its activities as destructive people outside the Parliament. and not actuated in the best interests of Australia there is very little that can be carried on in the form of a debate in this national Parliament. The honourable member for Cowper followed the Treasurer described what had been said by the honourable member for Reid as foolish, uninformed and irresponsible. He said that he did not know what he was talking about. I believe that a pretty sorry state of affairs has been reached in a national Parliament when its leaders, or some of them, are prepared in this way to dismiss serious submissions put by the Opposition. If anyone listened carefully to what the Treasurer said in the debate he would have realised that he said nothing to justify that form of attack. I remind the House that the honourable member for Cowper, from his heights of impeccable superiority, condescended to say: 'I shall reduce what I am about to say to something clear enough for the Opposition to understand.' Honourable members can imagine the honourable gentleman coming down from his great heights of superiority and condescending to put a proposition that he felt would be simple enough for the Opposition to understand. What was that proposition? He said: 'We in the Country Party may say that there should be better driving on the roads, but this does not mean that there should be no driving be better education, but this does not mean that there should be no education at all.' Having reduced the proposition to these simple terms, the honourable member failed to realise that this was precisely the way the Opposition was putting its propositions in the debate. We are saying that there should be better foreign investment in Australia; we are not saying that there should be no foreign investment. Apparendy the honourable member has become so simple that he cannot understand his own simplification which he put forward for the edification of the Opposition. This is the atmosphere in which so many Government supporters, with their massive superiority, condescend to debate great questions in the Parliament. If that attitude is missed by a number of honourable members, it certainly will not be missed by a number of The Opposition has put forward a very careful case. We say that we recognise the value of foreign investment in some cases. We recognise that there has been a contribution to overseas funds and that we have had more overseas funds available as a result. We recognise that probably this has accelerated the rate of increase of gross national product, that we have had made available processes, techniques and management skills which might not otherwise have come to us. But what we are emphasising, and what we have made clear that we are emphasising in this debate, is that there is too much and too easy reliance upon the capital inflow into this country, that the cost involved in the capital that we have obtained has been too high, that the investment is uncontrolled and unplanned, that there arefluctuationsin it and that it is unwise to rely, as the Government is relying, so much on things that fluctuate as much as foreign investment does. We say that it has resulted in the control of resources and, importantly, the control of a significant part",35,Overseas Investment In Australia
83,( Mr Mcmahon) In This Attitude. He,"of Australia's exports. Apparently any criticism is distorted by the Government. The Minister for National Development ( Mr Fairbairn) said that if we take notice of the Labor Party's case we would have an industrial backwater and we do not want an industrial backwater. He said that in a different situation Labor Party State premiers go overseas and try to obtain foreign investment. I agree that they do, but what the Labor Party Opposition has said about that was that it would be a very good thing if we had an Australian authority to go overseas seeking investment so that the premiers of the States were not competing one against the other. To use the honourable member for Cowper's simplification, we said there were some bad methods of getting foreign investment and we wanted good methods. So when we say that there ought to be better driving on the roads, we do not mean that there should be no driving on the roads; and when we say there should be better methods of getting foreign capital into Australia, we do not mean that there should be no methods of getting foreign capital into this country. However, we do say that the cost has been extremely high. It is ridiculous to talk about the cost of foreign investment in Australia being 5%, 6%, 7%, 8% or 10%. In many cases the cost is 600% or 700%, depending upon how it is measured. It is valid to measure the return on the amount of money invested by comparing the return to that amountnot to the watered capital, not to the issue of bonus shares or ploughed back funds, all of wbich are added together and then the returns compared to those highly inflated funds. In many ways the funds held in Australian companies by overseas investors are ten or twenty times the amount that they have put in. So when the returns are said to be 5%, 8% or 10%, the truth of the matter is that those returns in some cases are 10, 20 or 100 times as mush as the reported figures which have been artificially reduced. The fact that returns are high is shown by the figures cited by the Minister for National Development. He said that he would quote Treasury figures to show that overseas investment was not increasing at an explosive rate. Then he Order! The honourable member's time has went on to say that company income payexpired. able overseas as a percentage of company income payable in Australia was about 25.6% in one year and 21.3% in another. But he did not tell us that the actual amount of overseas capital invested in Australia, in contrast with the total capital invested in Australia, meant that foreign capital represented only about 12% or 14%. In other words, 12% or 14% of invested capital is getting something like 25% or 21% of the total returns on capital. This indicates that the returns on foreign capital are far higher than the returns on local capital. The Minister for National Development said that recently there had been an increase of 36% in foreign investment in Australia as against 37% in investment from local sources. This means, he said, that there has not been an explosive rate of overseas investment in Australia. However, let us look at the significant areas. We are not thinking about investment in areas in which there would be little or no foreign investment at all; we are thinking about the key areas where control not qnly of investment but also of exports has fallen completely into overseas hands. In the pharmaceutical industry it is 97% overseas control; in petroleum receiving and distribution, 96%; in motor vehicle manufacturing, 95%; in oil exploration, 85%; in telecommunications, 83%, and so on. In significant sectors of the economy, as the honourable member for Reid pointed out, foreign capital has control not only of the whole industry but also of the policy of that industry. This control has increased rapidly. There is no doubt that there has been an explosive increase in these fields, and there is n'o doubt that concern has been expressed not only by members on this side of the House, but also by newspapers and by leaders of the Government including the Prime Minister himself and his predecessor, Sir Robert Menzies, as well as the Minister for Trade and Industry who has proved the case to the hilt more thoroughly thsn has anyone else. The time has certainly arrived when there should be a joint parliamentary committee to investigate the consequences of foreign investment in Australia.",36,Overseas Investment In Australia
84,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Lucock),"can readily understand the injury which the pride of the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns) has suffered this afternoon. His arguments concerning overseas capital investment in Australia revolved around two essential points which are worth examining in some detail. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr the beginning of the year 1955-56 and Crean), who has considerable expertise in these matters, also touched upon them. They referred to overseas control. Whether one speaks of real capital or watered capital-whateve r capital is referred to-in various ways the servicing charges lay on Australia as a result of these investments. It is my intention to look at the rate of return in some detail so as to elicit what, in fact, is our pohcy and what, in fact, is the policy of some members of the Party opposite. But before I deal with this in detail I to about 7% and lower, varying slightly should like to refer to the general arguwith the method of calculation. The overall ment of the honourable member for Meljudgment that is made upon this table to bourne Ports. He spent some time praising which the honourable member for MelDr Brash for his excellent survey of bourne Ports referred was as follows: American investment in Australia and while he quoted from the preface and initial noticeable decline in the profitability of overseas chapters, if he had read the book comdirect investment since the mid 1950's and that pletely it should have dawned on him this decline has been particularly pronounced in quickly that Dr Brash confessed to a tbe case of American affiliated companies. change of attitude towards American investThe essential feature then is that, as a ment as his survey conveyed to him greater country with the capacity to attract overseas knowledge.

He failed to indicate the apparent profitability of this investment and the apparent profitability by the Treasury method of evaluation. Let me refer to these matters quickly.

If there are increases in wages or service costs in the intervening years there are clauses in the agreement by which the rate of payment can be increased. This is the boat that the Opposition has been rowing for some time. I would suggest that while the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, the honourable member for Yarra, the honourable member for Reid( Mr Uren) and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) have been rowing the boat they should look at some of their passengers, because there has been a signincant mutiny in their ranks. They may have to go to another stream or another tide to progress. I have called them political sunflowers in the past-the y retain these qualities. The Opposition has a responsibility, but Labor Premiers of States and Labor local authorities are not applying to their judgments the principles that the Opposition suggests should be applied. They would lot be able to apply them. The attitude of the Tasmanian Premier to the Savage River project gives an illustration of this. The attitude of the former Labor Premiers of New South Wales also illustrates this. They offered inducements-indirect , but real inducements-to overseas investors because it was worth a great deal to them. The facts of the situation that we are faced with in Australia today are quite simple. We live in a world in which there is a shortage of capital. It is our obligation, if we want a high rate of economic growth, to attract a fair proportion of this capital to our country. We know also that in this field economic nationalism, as the Opposition would apparently like to practice it, does not work. If we look at Canada, which has been cited so often by the Oppotion, we will find that Quebec, the one province which would not practice economic nationalism, has enjoyed a much higher rate of growth than the other provinces. Economic nationalism does not pay. The proposition put forward by the honourable member for Reid( Mr Uren) was quite a simple one. He wanted a committee set up. He wanted a committee to investigate overseas investment in Australia. He wanted some members of the Opposition, presumably, to be on this committee. From our examination of the attitude of honourable members opposite it would seem that they would like to be on such a committee to develop a policy of their own or, if they were not able to do so, to try to learn something about the significance of overseas investment to the economic growth of this country. Order! The time allotted for the discussion has concluded. PITT EXCHANGE BUILDING, Approval of Work-Public Works Committee Act Works) [4.52]I move: That in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1913-1966 it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which tbe Committee has duly reported to this House: Erection of a new telephone exchange building in Pitt Street, Sydney. The proposal involves the erection at an estimated cost of $7.2m of a building comprising two basements, ground and fifteen upper floors on vacant land adjacent to the existing City North Telephone Exchange building. The building, which will be of steel and concrete construction, will be faced externally with precast concrete panels and stone. It will accommodate automatic telephone equipment to meet the growing demand for telephone facilities in the city. In reporting favourably on the proposal, the Committee has recommended that the possibility of segregating tea-making facilities for female shift staff should be further",38,Overseas Investment In Australia

90,Mr Kelly (Wakefield,"Minister forexplored. This recommendation is under consideration by the Postmaster-General's Department. The Committee has also drawn attention to the urgency of the project, and as indicated in evidence to the Committee, action has already been taken to proceed with contract documents. Upon the concurrence of this House in this resolution, detailed planning can continue in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee. I would like to say a few words about this project. I do not want to delay the House, but I do want to remind honourable members that this work is of very great importance to the growth of the city of Sydney. My main regret is that so much delay has already taken place in having this work carriea out. I am not blaming the Minister for Works( Mr Kelly) or anyone else for this; apparently there has been a lack of understanding or a lack of appreciation of how fast this area of Sydney is developing, and I believe that for this reason a great deal of valuable time has already been lost. The Minister has said that this project will be made a matter of urgency. There is present in the House at the moment, besides the Minister for Works, the Postmaster General( Mr Hulme). I think this is quite appropriate because what we are considering is not merely the construction of a building but also the technical equipment which will have to be provided to make up the exchange itself. In my experience of matters such as this, in which there are two or more major requirements, I have found that generally speaking there is considerable is estimated. It tells us that in the city delay in completing the project. I appeal very sincerely and earnestly to both Ministers to make this a matter not merely of urgency but of extreme urgency. If this is not done I believe we will find ourselves in great bother and cause inestimable damage to industry and commercial undertakings in the city of Sydney. In the area that will be covered by this 5,000 lines will all be absorbed by early new exchange there are most of the recently 1970. Then on page 18 the report says: constructed multi-storied buildings in the city, buildings which are actually the resources to meet demands in the area 'for new greatest to be found anywhere in Australia. subscribers' Tbere is the big new building for the large ings will be necessary before that time if new banking institution, new buildings for services are to continue to be available. insurance organisations, the very large building for State Government offices, and now the Australia Square tower which is of record height and is just nearing completion. In other words there are many thousands of new offices which will need telephones. It is a wonderful thing to see Sydney growing into a great city. Years ago citizens of Sydney who visited other cities of the world, such as New York, were amazed at the appearance of those cities. Now they see their own city growing into a great national city. This exchange is the one that will service the area, and it is for this reason that I rise and appeal to both Ministers to make sure that this is made a matter of great urgency. I feel certain that the Government, realising the gravity of the situation, will make the necessary funds available to carry out this project as a matter of great urgency. If this is not done great losses will be sustained by the commercial community because it cannot carry on business without the necessary facilities which can be provided by this telephone exchange. It is implicit in what I have said that I approve of all that the Minister has said about urgency, but, I repeat: make this matter not merely urgent but extremely urgent. I support what the Minister for Works( Mr Kelly) has said and what the honourable member for Bennelong ( Sir lohn Cramer) has said. I want to refer to some passages in the report of the Public Works Committee, which is before the House. It seems to me regrettable that the report does not give us the detailedfigureson which demand north area, which is the main developing area of Sydney, there are only 5,000 lines which can be obtained from the normal accommodation available to the Post Office before the new work is completed. Then on page 2 it lists the existing exchanges and the number of lines in each.

91,Sir John Cramer (Bennelong) [4.54],,40,Sydney New South Wales
92,Mr Wentworth (Mackeuar) [4.58],"It is unthinkable that in this central area of Sydney new services would not be available as required. It would seem that the Government is already committed to a costly programme of expedients. This subgests to me that the Post Office has not allocated its priority programme with sufficient foresight. On the material available in this report I do not want to go outside the reportit would seem that quite a serious situation has already arisen. From 1970 forward the Post Office will be involved in very costly expedients in order to maintain normal telephone services in the middle of Sydney. The fact that it will be so involved shows, I think, that not sufficient foresight has been exhibited by the Post Office in regard to its programme for the middle of Sydney. I am inclined to think that the Committee's estimates may be under the mark and that even before April 1970 these 5,000 lines will be absorbed and the Post Office will be driven to spend its funds in an uneconomic way-to waste money, as it werebecause it has not had the foresight and has to put in these costly expedients. As honourable members know very well, Minister for Works( Mr Kelly) might think the cost of exchange equipment is far about this. I put it to the Minister that he greater than the cost of the building which had better think again and get the building houses it. In this case we are talking about finished within a reasonable time, because a building which will cost between $7m and it can be done. $8m, but the equipment which will go into it will be worth very much more than that sum. It does not seem reasonable that a reasons I have given. Unless it is completed programme involving very expensive equipbefore the target date, to provide a telement should be messed up because we have phone service for the main area of Sydney been unable to provide this small sum of the Government will be driven into costly money to construct the exchange building expedients which will waste money. If this in time. The site was purchased some years matter is looked at from the point of view ago and has been lying virtually vacant. I of efficiency, the thing to do is to get this do not know what was paid for the site, but building completed as soon as possible so it was a very good site and would have that telephone services can be provided cost a considerable amount of money. To without money being wasted in costly exhave this money out laid and idle is not good pedients. I have the greatest sympathy with planning. It would have been far better if the telephone technicians who are called the building had been put in hand some upon to cope with these costly expedients. time earlier. However, this is crying over We have seen litde exchanges wired in specispilt milk, and I would rather turn to someally. I understand that one is proposed for thing more constructive. I turn now to page 18 of the report old General Post Office. These expedients where, under the heading 'Programme', the are costly in terms of both money and Committee says: . . . the preparation of working drawings and cians battling manfully with complicated tender documents was commenced in November connections which could be simple and 1966 . . . this phase of the work is expected to which would be simple if only the space be completed early in 1968. This is not efficiency. This is a fairly standard building which will cost a mere sum of S7m. It is not a major work like the Sydney Opera House, yet it will take from November 1966 until early 1968 for working drawings to be completed and tender documents to be prepared. This is not a reasonable length of dme. Surely it is possible to shorten it in this emergency. I suggest to the Minister that, if he cannot get his departmental architects to complete their drawings and plans more expeditiously than this, then he should perhaps look outside and find somebody who can do it, because the job can be done. I say from practical experience that there is no valid reason for this lengthy delay. Secondly, occupation of the building is not expected to commence before April 1971, which will be three years from the completion of the tender documents. It should not take three years to complete a building like this once the plans have been prepared. It is simply stupid when an emergency exists for the Government to say that it will take three years to complete a building costing $7m on a site in the middle of Sydney. The The building is needed urgently for the the basement of the Commonwealth building and another for the basement of the skilled labour. One can see telephone techniwere provided. The cost of space is only a small part of the total expenditure. Cheeseparing on space means extravagant expenditure on equipment, because these little expedients have to be relocated. This involves all sorts of expenditure and frustration. As I have said, I sympathise very much with the telephone technicians who are battling against time with complicated wiring diagrams. This would be unnecessary if only a building were provided in time. I turn now to page 19 of the report, where of installation of new telephones in the area the Committee says that there will be a increases by some 10% to 12%. This is crisis-the Committee calls it a period of higher than the gross national product extreme emergency-in the provision of increase, and it is higher, as I have said, telephone services for both subscribers and than most of the indices in Australia. The subscriber trunk dialling in the northern trunk calling rate is 16% higher than in the Sydney area between 1970 and some time previous year. late in 1971. This will probably be a period of two years, and temporary expedient for Mackellar and to members of this House exchanges for 6,000 or 7,000 subscribers that on this basis it is impossible for the will probably be involved. This delay will Post Office, with the money available to it; mean a wastage of money and real resources to meet the demands which are being made the extent of which I do not know.

It is not authorities in New South Wales, that we that the Post Office under-estimated the requirements. Each year there is submitted to this Parliament an indication of the money which is made available and which is appropriated by the Parliament for the purposes of the Post Office capital works programme. I believe there are few indices within the Australian community at the present time which show a developing rate such as that which applies in relation to our telecommunications. Year by year the rate I want to say to the honourable member that at the present time 95% of the capital funds available to us are being used in In relation to the Pitt Exchange it is so Works, the Cabinet, and the Public Works Committee of the Parliament; but what the honourable member has not mentioned and (Petrie-Postmaster probably what he does not even know is",40,Sydney New South Wales

Is the honourable member going to suggest to me that that was wrong, that in fact we should have gone ahead with the building as it had been planned and that we should then have tried to find another expensive piece of land in the city of Sydney to do the other things which in fact can be done in this particular area? I think it is as well to remind honourable members that we are providing facilities for 50,000 subscribers, not for the next five years but for very many years into the future. It is now possible to provide an automatic trunk exchange and associated trunk amplifying and carrier equipment, an enlarged manual assistance centre and a new international trunk exchange. These things within the telecommunications area are all tremendously important and necessary. I believe that while some delay occurred because of this reorganisation it was completely justified. Perhaps it was not completely justified in terms of the provision of facilities for this particular area of Sydrelation to this particular matter. ney, but Sir, we do not always get the co-operation of those who are going to put up these substantial buildings. If anyone in 1960 or 1961 had suggested that all the buildings that have gone up in Sydney in the last two or three years had at that point of time been envisaged for the future we would have said: 'No. Sydney in fact will not be able to use them if they are built.' 1005), on motion by Mr Sinclair: I still suggest that Sydney will have a good deal of vacant accommodation as a result of the building programme that has been undertaken.

If we are to spend in 1968 the money allocated for 1970 somebody will have to go without in 1970. I suppose if I were a Sydneysider I would not mind if the rest of Australia went without so long as I did not go without in Sydney, but that cannot be the approach of an organisation which has the responsibility approach. may interject that this has been the approach. I reject the suggestion entirely. A long while ago I made a submission to Cabinet in relation to this particular matter recognising Sydney's requirements, and I have indicated to the honourable member why it was necessary to have some changes in regard to the matter. I suppose these things would not be understood unless we indicated them in the House.

Naturally, everything has not been granted but at least it is a step forward in the approach to this most deserving section of the community. In a conflict of politics, Mr and J will say why it is important at a later Speaker, differences of opinion are inevitable. This applies also to legislation of this nature. I would not like it to be thought, however, that any criticisms or constructive suggestions put forward by myself or by members of the Opposition on this subject would be misinterpreted as reflecting on the sincerity of the Minister or of any other member of the House in their desire to assist this needy section of the community. It would also be true to say that none of us feel that we are going fast enough with these social reforms which cover so many yet cater for so few. I hope that, whatever our views, we will all be united in our efforts to achieve the perfect system whereby those coming within the scope of this legislation will be given the opportunity to take a prominent place in society and, within their limitations, enjoy to the full what this country has to offer in this age of affluence and progress. I want to deal briefly with the provisions of the Bill. The Minister mentioned them in detail. I will summarise them at this stage to remind honourable members. Firstly, it provides assistance on a $2 for £1 basis to eligible organisations towards the capital cost of purchasing, erecting or extending premises for use as sheltered workshops. It also provides assistance on that basis towards the cost of items of equipment required for the operation of a workshop or to increase its efficiency or productivity, and towards annual rental of premises for use as a sheltered workshop for up to three years. Finally, it incorporates, continues, and expands the assistance previously available under the Disabled Persons Accommodation Act. The Minister mentioned the eligible organisations. They are churches, charitable and benevolent groups, ex-servicemen's organisations and local governing bodies. Other voluntary organisations may be approved by the Governor General. Trustees under a trust established for charitable or benevolent purposes may also be approved. The organisations are of the same bodies, that are now eligible under the Disabled Persons Accommodation Act and the Aged Persons Homes Act. It is very important that honourable members note that local governing bodies are now eligible stage. The Minister dealt with the requirements for eligibility. It is unnecessary for me to repeat them because they are fully covered in the Bill. The Minister mentioned that the capital subsidy will apply to buildings purchased or erected, including any necessary fixtures for their use, and that the land value will be included in the capital cost. On the question of funds, it is interesting to note that organisations cannot attract subsidy for funds borrowed or received from the Commonwealth Government or a State government or an authority other than a local governing body established under a Commonwealth or State Act. At a later stage in my speech I intend to devote a little attention to that provision. Concerning accommodation, the Minister stated that local governing bodies will be eligible for assistance on the same basis as that relating to the capital cost of the premises which provide sheltered employment. The subsidy provided under this Bill will be payable for buildings, land purchased or buildings commenced or in course of construction on or after 26th November 1966. That is very desirable and it is a pity that the rest of the provisions do not apply also from that date, which was the date of the election. The rental subsidy will be payable from the date of commencement of this Bill. The subsidy will not be granted for equipment purchased prior to that date. The Minister also made this clarification, and it is worth repeating: Capital subsidies will not, however, be limited to projects where employees are receiving the proposed sheltered employment aUowance. This is a very desirable move. The records will show that the Labor Party suggested something along those lines during previous debates in this Parliament. Sheltered employment is a new term in legislation and it can be so declared, according to the Minister, 'if a substantial number of the persons employed or to be employed on the premises are disabled persons and they are paid for the work they perform'. A project is not necessarily disqualified if some persons who do not come within the definition of a disabled person are on the premises. an allowance. said that the Disabled Persons Accommodathis was his answer: tion Act is repealed by and incorporated in this legislation. This is a matter I will come to the Government. back to. The Minister stated: There is however one important addition in that who, according to the newspapers and other local governing bodies become ehgible for media, was recognised in this Parliament assistance. The inclusion of local government bodies as rights of pensioners, had this to say: being eligible for assistance-and I say this plank plundered from the policy of the either now or in the future.

IfI may Then Sir Keith Wilson went on to say: stir the embers of the past I will remind honourable members that on 10th October State government or a local governing body that 1963I do not know whether the present was called upon to provide the remaining oneMinister for Social Services was a member third. of this House then-durin g the debate on The very eminent honourable member for the Disabled Persons Accommodation Bill Swan( Mr Cleaver) was outspoken on this 1963, I said: During the committee stage the Opposition will described as one of the great steps forward move the amendments circulated in my name, by the Government. This is what the honourwhich are designed to give effect, to the proposal able member for Swan had to say about to permit the Commonwealth Covernment to subthat amendment as reported at page 1709 sidise State government instrumentalities and local government on all moneys spent in building homes of Hansard of 10th October 1963: and infirmeries for the disabled. The Opposition will also indicate the need to include other bodies such as trade unions in the programme for providing homes for the disabled. the honourable member is right sometimes. what the then Minister for Social Services had to say when we moved the amendment to include those bodies. This is recorded in Hansard of 10th October 1963. Mr Makin, the honourable member for Bonython at that time, gave effect to my words by moving the following: In sub-clause (3.), omit 'or of a State; or (b) a ment that was moved in 1963 to provide local governing body established under the law of a State,'. He said: . . . I appeal to the Government to recognise the merits of the proposal that local government organisations and State instrumentalities be brought within the scope of the bill in order that we may extend all possible help to those handicapped people who urgently require housing or hostel accommodation convenient to sheltered workshops. This appeal was not considered urgent by Mr Chairman, the amendment is unacceptable Let us go a little further. Sir Keith Wilson as one who was constantly fighting for the There is one of the amendments proposed by between the Government and organisations performing charitable work. If we made the That would be tbe position whether it was a important subject, which the Minister State Government and local government moneys do not qualify for the subsidy. This is in line with the provisions of the Aged Persons Homes Act. Honourable members opposite say that this is not fair. They would like contributions from State governments and local government authorities to attract the £2 for £1 subsidy. Perhaps on some occasions we have had cases in our own electorates in which local authority representatives have said to us, 'Don't you think our contribution should also be trebled?' Basically this is not a sound proposition, and honourable members opposite know it. Today the Minister brings forward this provision and refers to it as one of the important provisions of the Bill.

It is interesting to notethis amendment might well have been said in the course of his speech when dealaccepted four years ago; but it was rejected ing with the sheltered employment allowby the Government, which now introduces ance: the proposal as its own. One more vote in 1963 would have ensured that this benefit thc sheltered employment allowance will cease was given to disabled people. The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) sponsored a resolution which was somewhat similar to the provision incorporated in this legislation. He voted against the Labor Party at a time when he was a very reticent rebel. He was very outspoken but he did not often vote the way he should have on these things. We also advocated, as I do again today, assistance to State governments in providing homes for the disabled, but that proposal also was rejected. Will the Government have another change of heart on this matter before the next elections? Perhaps it will. Who knows? The Liberals work splendidly when their future is at stake, particularly a month or so before an election. In any case, whatever has prompted the Government to adopt Labor's policy at this late stage, it is a belated and long overpetuating discrimination against the disdue recognition that our policies were sound and in the interests of disabled people and should not have been discarded at that time. I congratulate the Minister, the honourable member for Swan and other supporters of the Government on their brief excursion into the world of Socialism. I hope that when Labor next proposes reforms those reforms will not be discarded so promptly. I hope they will be given the consideration they deserve and not kept as an election gimmick to win votes and in the process people be left to suffer for years. The Government now adopts our proposals; what is more, it claims them as its own. That shows the paucity of thinking on the Government side on matters of social reform. being political. being political. I do not think the Minister can object to my reminding him that this proposal came from the people on this side of the House. Let us have a look at the proposal in regard to the means test that In days gone by workers have been proseapplies to sheltered workshops. The Minister cuted by Liberal governments for applying Where there are no olher means as assessed when earnings reach $36 a week in the case of an unmarried person or $47 a week in the case of a married person where the spouse is not in receipt of a pension. He continued: It is proposed that blind pensioners employed in sheltered workshops will bc eligible for the allowance free of the means test but the additional allowances payable for children after the first and any other allowances will, as at present, be subject to the means test. That is the position under the legislation we are now discussing. 1 say to the Government, whose pledge on the means test was made as far back as 1949, that if ever there was a golden opportunity for the Government to give expression to its sincerity it was when introducing this legislation. It could have abolished the means test for disabled people. The cost would not have been great but the benefits would have been tremendous. Tne Government is perabled. Surely this is a niggardly and mean approach to a very great human problem. 1 shall show the Minister what the abolition of the means test would mean to these people. I propose to quote from an excellent survey entided 'Sheltered Workshops in Australia', which was carried out by the Department of Social Services. It is one of the few Government surveys that have been made. Although it is only a minor survey, it is still effective to some extent. Referring to the people who come within the scope of the legislation, this is what the survey states: It was estimated by workshops that were it not for the restriction on earnings resulting from the invalid pension means test, 601 of their pensioner employees would be able to earn between $10 and $20 per week and 148 more than 520 per week. Some of the employees in this category were reported to produce regularly at a rate which warranted payment of more than S7 or $8 per week which they received, but in mose cases the employees either reduced their output to a level which would ensure that they earned no more than the maximum permissible amount, or adjusted their hours of employment to the limit on earnings.",45,Sheltered Employment

It was said that this was not in the interests of the nation. tion of this legislation -namely , to make these people independent member that it still works that way. A very humane approach could have been made to this problem by eliminating the means test. There should be no means test in a sheltered workshop while persons remain eligible for the sheltered employment allowance. The problem is that these people will lose their pensions when their income exceeds the limit prescribed by the means test. In addition to that, I am advised that some of them naturally will have their medical benefits terminated. This is a very important matter to which I will refer later. medical benefits cut off. what is allowed. If they earn more than a certain amount they will lose their medical benefits as I shall indicate shortly. Mr SinclairI do not think that is so. person is eligible for a sheltered employment allowance and qualifies medically for a pension he should be able to earn full wages without losing medical benefits. That is not the position, because already the Minister for Health (Dr Forbes) has advised the House that he will have to go to his masters-the Australian Medical Association-and ask that medical benefits be provided for people who will benefit under this legislation. sons getting a sheltered employment allowance. I have before me facts relating to the case of a man with no arms who is working in a certain workshop in Sydney, which I would like to cite. He is married and has three children and an ailing wife. He cannot afford to let the pension go because his family requires medical benefits. He is quite capable of earning a good wage, but were he to do so he would exceed the amount he is allowed to earn and still obtain medical nurseries. The new definition of a sheltered benefits. He has inhibitions about earning additional income because he fears he will 4127/67-lt-[54 ] lose the pension and sheltered employment allowance and the medical benefits that are so necessary to his wife. This, in effect, is the reverse of what we desire to do today and able to take their place in society. If what I have said is trueI am inclined to think it is-the n this man should be encouraged to go off the pension, and this provision should be eliminated from the scheme. sheltered employment allowance he will be entitled to the pension. tain amount his pension will be cut. the allowance, then he no longer has an entitlement to the benefit. man is capable of earning in excess of the permissible amount he must, as it were, keep to the darg, so as not to lose his medical benefits. Those who work in the sheltered workshops are extremely worried about the manner in which the allowance is to be implemented and checked. I hope the Minister will give an assurance to the ParliamentI am certain he will-that inspectors will not be employed, as in the old days of the dole, to see that people are earning just a certain amount. The implementation of this means test could be very complex to the sheltered workshops and to the Government. I think that a lot of trouble could have been saved at very small cost if the means test had been abolished. Many anomalies would have been avoided. The change from sheltered workshops to sheltered employment is desirable, and the reasons are understood. One of the problems of establishing sheltered workshops has been that few of them have been established in country districts. There are disabled people in country areas just as there are in the cities. It is gratifying to know that persons who are disabled mentally or physically will be assisted in a rural environment in the growing of grain and vegetables, in raising poultry and livestock, and on orchards and workshop provides for coverage of these people.

114,Mr Daly,"That is so. Although thisemployment in these areas is to be commended. I have already expressed concern at the possibility of exploitation under this provision, but my fears have been allayed by the definition and I do not intend to press the matter further. I think there is adequate protection in the legislation to prevent any unfortunate occurrence of that nature. I want to say a little about the proposals for sheltered workshops. The Commonwealth will make grants to eligible organisations which have purchased land or constructed or commenced to construct buildings on or after 28th November 1966that is, immediately after the Government was returned to office. But grants will be made only in respect of rental paid subsequent to the commencement of the Act. A subsidy will not be granted in respect of equipment purchased prior to the commencement of the Act. Wliy this discrimination? Why not make all benefits retrospective to 28th November 1966, as has been done in relation to the capital cost of sheltered workshops? The same arguments apply in this case as applied in relation to the homes savings grant and our demands with regard to age and invalid pensions. I do not intend to traverse all that I said a few days ago about retrospective payment of pensions, but the Government finds it very difficult to justify retrospectivity in some legislation and a refusal of retrospectivity in the problems that we face. I ask: Is the legislation which affects one of the most deserving sections of our society-the disabled. There is a great need to extend the scope of this Bill. As we said in the debate in 1963, State housing authorities should come within the scope of this legislation. The records show that they are doing commendable work in this field. They depend on the Commonwealth for money. If the States had the funds, coupled with their own resources and skilled staff, they would be able to play a most influential part in giving effect to the aims and objectives of the legislation to assist the disabled. I do not want this suggestion to be discarded out of hand in the way that our suggestion that local government bodies be permitted to participate in the scheme of homes for the aged was discarded, but later adopted. If our proposals are worthy of support wby not adopt them now without making people suffer by unnecessary delay? What is the Government doing to encourage the trade union movement to participate in this scheme in a big way? Perhaps the trade unions come within the scope of the legislation, but so far as grants are concerned there is little evidence that they do. They are vitally interested in this matter. They have tremendous influence and they have financial resources. Latest figures indicate that there are between 300 and 400 trade unions in Australia with a membership of more than two million. Surely these resources should be tapped. What about the registered clubs? This should be a lucrative field. In New South Wales these clubs are flourishing. They are charitably minded. They have huge financial resources. An approach to them to assist in the provision of sheltered workshops probably would be very fruitful. What action has been taken to encourage employers to participate in this scheme, in providing both training and employment? This is a field in which they are vitally interested. In fact, their co-operation is basic to the scheme. As the Minister pointed out in a recent speech, some do co-operate. There should be a great personal interest on the part of our huge employing industries to assist in this scheme. Having made a brief survey of the legislation I now wish to deal with a few of Government doing enough at this time in this important field? Let us look at the problems of the disabled in Australia and ask how this Bill meets those problems. Under the Bill expenditure next year will amount to $500,000. To date the Commonwealth has made grants totalling $374,818 under the Disabled Persons Accommodation Act, enabling 160 beds to be provided. The report for 1965-66 of the Director General of Social Services shows that $1,659,720 has been spent throughout Australia on rehabilitation. The report shows that 24,193 cases were referred to the Department for rehabilitation in that year. Of that number 1,434 were accepted. The number placed in training was 377 and 309 completed their courses. The number placed in employment after training was 307 and the number placed in employment without training was 810. The number placed in employment is not very large having regard to the number of disabled persons in the community. In a total budget for social services of $758m, an expenditure of $500,000 on grants for sheltered workshops is a long way from what is needed. expenditure. expenditure envisaged at this stage for 1967-68 is not high. How many disabled persons in the community require assistance? This question has never been accurately answered by a full inquiry, although the Department of Social Services did make an important survey into sheltered workshops. Its survey was a good one as far as it went. It was fostered, I think, by the Association of Sheltered Workshops. The sheltered workshops found that after three years they were not getting as far as they would like. I believe the Department, having made the survey, offered to assist them. I do not quibble at that. Broadly, the Government granted what was sought. The report by the Department is worth mentioning. Let us look at the problem of sheltered workshops. In 1963 Miss Forsythe, Honorary Secretary-Treasurer of the Association of Sheltered Workshops wrote to me. I was speaking to her again recently. She assured me that although the ngures contained in her letter to me in 1963 may now be out of date, proportionately they are valid. She wrote: This means an estimated 13i% of the State population are handicapped in some major fashion. She was referring to the situation in New South Wales. The letter continued: Estimated i ' % of State population, i.e 20,837 people would benefit from Sheltered Workshops engaged in sheltered workshops. It reads: (this is based on findings in other countries). At present there are facilities for approximately 1,500 the time of the survey there were 3,397 handicappeople in workshops in this State. Miss Forsythe pointed out that her figures 2,083 were for New South Wales only but that invalid pensions. Of the remaining 812 some were the percentages would be similar in other being paid award wages, while others were States. It was obvious that the demand was receiving age, widows' or war pensions, unemployexceeding available services by many ment or sickness benefits, workers compensation thousands of people. The survey conducted dent by the Department of Social Services is 10% of the employees were married. interesting. It states: There are now more than 100 centres, located in all capital cities and many country towns, which speaking about the application of the means are described by .their sponsoring organisations as test. I will give the number of employees sheltered workshops. The number and types of workshops are shown in a table in the report. The table reveals that there are 87 workshops throughout the Commonwealth. Of that number 47 cater mainly for mentally handicapped persons and 40 cater for physically handicapped persons. The report states: State Government assistance, where provided, is usually in the form of a contribution towards the capital cost of the workshops. In some cases, however, State governments assist organisations to meet maintenance or operational costs. In such cases why should the States not be reimbursed by the Commonwealth, because they are accepting a liability that is rightly the Commonwealth's? The report deals with highly mechanised workshops and their effect on production. To an extent this Bill provides for highly mechanised workshops by making it possible for them to obtain more efficient machinery. The report deals with income derived by workshop production organisations from production and appeals. In 1964-65 income from production throughout the Commonwealth amounted to $998,091. Income from appeals amounted to $127,323. Total income for the year was $1,125,414. That was a rather commendable effort by handicapped people. The report indicates that a major item of expenditure with many workshops was the provision of transport for handicapped employees. It reads: Fifty-one workshops reported that they either provided free transport or subsidised the cost of fares for public transport While the average earnings of handicapped employees were shown as being somewhat less than $3.00 per week, the earnings of the physically handicapped were, on average, substantially higher than those of the mentally handicapped. The report refers to the number of people Working on this basis it was disclosed that at ped persons employed in sheltered workshops, males and 1,314 females. A considerable majority of these employees, 2,585, were receiving or superannuation payments or had small indepenincomes.

118,Mr Daly,"Thes e were. Mr Hayes said:people are in receipt of the invalid pension. and does not know how many of them are capable of some work. I commend the book from which I have read to the Minister. It goes beneath the surface of this problem and reveals facts that probably are not known to a vast number of people. I have no doubt that everyone will agree that this is a huge problem. We can read in this book about the difficulties of the disabled people. We frequently forget some of their little worries, sucb as getting their wheel chairs up steps. The book brings all those difficulties to light. But what is wanted immediately and what the Australian Labor Party has sought on many occasions is a national inquiry into the problems associated with poverty and the means of helping people such as those who will gain from the Bill now before us. The Minister said that the Bill does not place a limit on the amount that can be expended. However, that is not much good if we deal with only one section and neglect another section of which we know little. We need a planned programme to meet the needs of people in this category and their needs would be brought out in a national inquiry. If such an inquiry were conducted by a widely representative body, it would undoubtedly meet with general support and would have the co-operation of all those people and organisations interested in this problem. RecentlyI came across a book entitled 'Social Benefits in Sweden'. The need for a planned programme is revealed in this book. I will not read all that it has to say about disablement; it covers this problem at page 35. It states: A person is entitled to vocational training, pension, etc., if he is liable to be disabled, totally oi partially, more or less permanently. (If the person has defective sight, hearing, speech or limbs, or is suffering from chronic tuberculosis, heart disease, rheumatism, nervous disease, etc.) It lists the help that is available, and this includes: Allowances for further education, learning a trade or new trade at specially arranged courses, vocational training centres or individual employers. Allowances (determined by a means test) for travelling, personal (and where necessary family) maintenance, fees for courses, and cost of materials, etc. Those who cannot obtain employment in the open competitive market can be provided with libraries, or arrangements are made for them to work at home. The book contains two or three pages giving a planned programme of help for this section of society, and I commend it to the Minister and his officers for their consideration. My time is almost exhausted, and I finish with this observation: the legislation, which is not opposed by the Opposition, is in line with the proposals of the voluntary organisations interested in this problem. Their action was prompted, as I said earlier, by the need to find some way in which those engaged in the workshops could earn over and above the amount allowed by the means test-that is, more than the $10-withou t an equivalent amount being taken from their pension. In this way, it was felt that those engaged would retain certain pension benefits all the time but be able to earn more. This was an indication, both in the workshops and outside, that disabled persons were capable of earning more. It was felt that this might encourage employers to engage them as a step towards open employment. The Bill will make administration of the means test by both the Department and the workshops difficult and will involve a good deal of extra work for both. Ultimately it may prove to be as beneficial as we all hope it will be. The provisions of the Act, although limited to some extent, are a step forward. Questions arise as to what are the standards for eligibility under the Act, for example, for the subsidy. Only time will show how that provision will be interpreted. Other standards are broadly known, but this one is not quite clear. What equipment will be provided will not really be known until the Act comes into operation. I believe that the concept of the Act should be kept as broad as possible and administered liberally. In this way it will go a long way towards fulfilling the hopes of those who made the submissions. As an experimental piece of legislation I believe that it should be constantly under review and amended without delay, where necessary, to ensure that the spirit of the Act is not impaired and that the disabled shall receive this contribution towards their welfare to which they are so justly entitled.

119,Mr Sinclair,"We do know how many work, as a rule, at special workshops, in archives",51,Sheltered Employment
120,Mr Daly,"Yes, but fhe Governmentwith the actual provisions of the Bill itself I want to refer to one matter which was raised by the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) who led for the Opposition. He took the Government to task on the question of retrospectivity. He tried to draw a comparison with the retrospectivity which has been granted by the Government with respect to homes savings grants, grants under the Aged Persons Homes Act and grants which are covered in this Bill and the non-retrospectivity in respect of pensions. I put it to him that the grants that are made retrospective affect no more than a few hundred people, whereas we now have about 750,000 pensioners. He has only to consider the work involved and the number of calculations that would be required to appreciate the difference between the two types of assistance. I am aware that when we change pension rates or ease the means test a fresh set of calculations has to be made, but if pension increases were made retrospective, two sets of calculations would have to be made. Not only would calculations have to be made concerning future rates but separate calculations would also be required for the retrospective period and the work would be increased because not all pensioners get the same rate. Hundreds of thousands of calculations would have to be made, so It is not fair to make a comparison as the honourable member suggests. During a debate last week I pointed out that when his Party was in government about twenty years ago it did not make pension increases retrospective. I am not trying to compare what was done twenty years ago with what is done now. I agree that our methods have improved and that the way these matters were adjusted twenty years ago was different. I appreciate that we have better equipment to make calculations, including automatic data processing, but we have double the number of pensioners nowadays and double the calculations to make. It was difncult for his party's government to make pension increases retrospective twenty years ago, and it is difncult to do so today. It is not reasonable tive that the organisation be not conducted to draw a comparison and I am sure that on reflection the honourable member will agree with me. I do not intend to speak on the Bill at length because from discussions I have had with representatives of the Sheltered Workshops Association in VictoriaI know that its members are happy with the provisions, lt is fair to assume that organisations that are interested in the provision of sheltered employment in other States are also happy with the Bill. Discussions I have had with my colleagues support this view. No one suggests, nor do I , that this Bill represents the ultimate in what ought to be achieved by way of assisting sheltered workshops, but it is a start. It is the first real breakthrough in securing Federal recognition of sheltered workshops. The purpose of the Bill is to enable the Government to make grants to eligible organisations to help them in establishing and equipping workshops to provide sheltered employment for people who would normally be eligible to receive an invalid pension-peopl e who cannot enter ordinary types of employment but who have the capacity and the desire to contribute to our national production. The Bill is designed to help them in four ways. Firstly, it provides a $2 for $1 subsidy towards the capital cost of purchasing, erecting or extending premises, including the cost of land on which the premises are built. Secondly, it provides a similar subsidy towards the cost of the items that are necessary to enable sheltered workshops to operate or to increase their efficiency and productivity and, at the same time, the earning capacity of the people employed in them. As the Minister for Social Services( Mr Sinclair) pointed out, we are actually referring to sheltered employment. I am using the expression 'sheltered workshops' in the broad sense: I realise that the Bill is designed to help those in sheltered employment. Thirdly, the Bill seeks to contribute towards rental costs for a period of up to three years and, finally, it seeks to conrtbuite on a $2 for $1 basis towards the cost of providing accommodation for people employed in sheltered workshops. In order for an organisation to be eligible to receive the grant under this legislation it is imperafor the profit or gain of its individual members. Secondly, it must employ, in the main, persons who would, were it not for their",51,Sheltered Employment
121,Mr Fox (Henty) [8.0],"Before dealingemployment in sheltered workshops, ordinarily be eligible to receive an individual pension. The Minister has made it clear that the fact that some people who do not fall into this category are employed in a sheltered workshop would not be sufficient to render that workshop ineligible to receive a subsidy. Thirdly, in order to receive a subsidy it is essential that the workshop be equipped to operate efficiently. Fourthly, it must give the people employed in that workshop a reasonable reward for their labour. AH of these requirements are just and reasonable. The Minister pointed out that in Australia there are almost 100 sheltered workshops. He said that they were producing goods and services to the value of about $lm a year. He pointed out that more than half of these workshops have been established in the last five years. I have visited several sheltered workshops, not only in Victoria but in other States, and 1 have nothing but admiration for the workers themselves, for the quality of the work they produce and for the voluntary workers and charitable organisations without whose help many of these workshops would not be able to function. I know, from personal experience, that people employed in these sheltered workshops are proud of their accomplishments and of the fact that they are contributing to the Australian economy. In his second reading speech the Minister said that their rate of production is naturally lower than that which we can expect from people who are not handicapped. I know that while the rate of production is low, the quality of the work is of a high standard. I have seen letters from business Arms to the management of a sheltered workshop in Melbourne testifying to the quality of the work and, in fact, stating that the quality of the work received from the workshop was of a higher standard than that of a similar type being provided by outside contractors. I am referring to a workshop employing mentally handicapped people. It is equipped with various devices that are designed to ensure that the employees do not make mistakes. There are no errors due to carelessness, and this does not apply to ordinary employees in normal industry. I should like to refer to a letter I received only yesterday from Mrs H. N. Bedwin of Sydney. She and her late husband were associated with the Civilian Maimed and Limbless Association of New South Wales for a long while. She can speak with the authority of personal experience and personal knowledge of the work performed in this Association's workshops. She is familiar with the problems confronting such workshops and her views are to be respected. She draws a comparison between the situation in Australia and in Holland. She has chosen these two countries because she says that the populations are similar as are the standards of living. I have no authority other than Mrs Bedwin's letter, but I have no reason to doubt any of the figures she quotes. She says that in Holland a new sheltered workshop is subsidised to the extent of 90% of the wages paid to the handicapped workers during the first year. This amount reduces each year until at the end of three years the annual subsidy represents 60% of the amount paid to the handicapped workers. Mrs Bedwin tells me that the capital expenditure and the administrative costs must be financed from the production of the workshop, so that instead of providing a capital subsidy the government provides a maintenance subsidy which is 90% of the wages paid in the first year and which reduces over a three year period to 60% of the wages paid, and presumably is maintained thereafter at that rate. Mrs Bedwin says that this encourages the workshop to absorb more workers so that it may make more money to meet its capital costs and costs of administration, and also sets a proper standard for the remuneration of the people employed in the workshop. Mrs Bedwin has cited figures showing that for the financial year 1960-61 the Australian Government paid out nearly $316m in age and invalid pensions but spent less than $1.4m on rehabilitation and nothing at all on sheltered workshops. She contrasts this expenditure with that uf Holland, a country which, as I have said, has a similar population and a similar standard of living. During the same period Holland spent $140m on age and invalid pensions, against our expenditure of S316m, but spent $36m on rehabilitation and sheltered workshops. I interpret these figures to mean that if we spent more money on rehabilitation and sheltered workshops we would not have to spend so much money on invalid pensions because these people would in fact be employing themselves and supporting themselves. I think this is a proposition well worthy of thorough investigation because of Mrs Bedwin's particular knowledge in this field. I know that she hoped that I , after reading her letter, would be able to persuade the Government to alter the BiU in some way. She has suggested that the action proposed by the Government is rather palliative and does not meet the community's demand for help. As honourable members know, it is not possible at this stage to alter a Bill which has already been drafted, which has been discussed with the sheltered workshop organisations in the various States and with which those organisations are happy. But, as I have pointed out, this is the first real breakthrough and I have no doubt at all that the Minister for Social Services( Mr able member for Henty( Mr Fox) always Sinclair) is taking particular notice of the figures that have been supplied to me by Mrs Bedwin and which I have quoted, and I know that he will be pleased to investigate the possibility of making some change along the lines suggested when next the legislation is being amended. Mrs Bedwin pointed out to me that of the pensioners in Australia at the moment there are about 150,000 who are handicapped by either mental or physical infirmity and who could reasonably be expected to find employment in sheltered workshops. She said that her experience with her husband in the sheltered workshop conducted by the Civilian Maimed and Limbless Association of New South Wales showed that mentally handicapped and physically handicapped people working together achieve a productivity, on the average, equal to about 40% of normal productivity. She said that this means we have a potential work force equal to 120 million man-hours a year. This is at our present population level. Relating this to the production of Holden cars she said that this would be sufficient for the assembly of Minister for Social Services( Mr Sinclair) 1,950,000 vehicles a year. The Minister said in his second reading monwealth Government established the Commonspeech that the people in our sheltered wealth Rehabilitation Service to assist severely workshops today are producing goods and handicapped persons to live a normal life in the services to the value of about $lm. If Mrs community. Bedwin's figures are correct-and again 1 might otherwise have become invalid pensioners have no reason to doubt them-obviousl y have been restored to gainful employment. the potential production of these people who could be employed in sheltered workshops if the workshops were there to employ them is very much greater than the present production of existing sheltered workshops. Mrs Bedwin concludes by saying: Even if one should ignore the human happiness and satisfaction involved in taking a course of action to encourage the opportunity for employment of these people, surely economically we cannot afford not to. I find myself in complete agreement with those sentiments. I wish to congratulate the Minister for Social Services and the officers of the Department of Social Services who worked so hard to produce this Bill. I want to congratulate also the Government for having the good sense and the humanity to introduce legislation of this nature. impresses me with the sentiments he expresses in this House on social services. He seems to possess a much greater degree of humanity and a deeper human feeling than most honourable members on the Government side who speak on such subjects. The Bill we are discussing is the Sheltered Employment (Assistance) BUl 1967. As the House is aware, the Labor Party does not oppose this legislation, but it avails itself of the opportunity of stressing the need to provide assistance to the unfortunate members of the community who have, usually from birth, been mentally or physically retarded. Unfortunately it is not until the rising tide of public opinion becomes sufficiently strong that one finds the Government moving in this direction. Apparently, as agitation increases over the years, it finally 'assumes sufficient strength to force the Government to move, mainly for the purpose of gaining greater electoral support, especially in borderline seats, so many of which are held by the Government today. Early in his second reading speech the said: It is now almost twenty years since the ComSince its establishment in 1948 more than 20,000 invalid pensioners and people who",52,Sheltered Employment
122,Mr James (Hunter) [8.15],"The honourOf course the Minister did not say that it was a Labor Government which twenty years ago introduced the Commonwealth rehabilitation legislation. He would not pay the Labor Government the tribute of acknowledging the human feelings which Labor has always had, and which motivated the Labor Government when it established the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service twenty years ago. But we all know that Labor first introduced this legislation and that it has been very little improved in the many years in which the Government has been in office. The goal of vocational rehabilitation is employment.

The parents told me that, had it not been for the generosity of Apexians and members of Lions Clubs, they would not be able to send the children to receive the training they need, because the father's wages are only a little more than the basic wage. I would like to see the Government as soon as possible make available to sheltered like those I have spoken of sold at Commonwealth auctions in Canberra for £200 or £300.

An ideal place to set up a sheltered workshop for these unfortunate people would have been the old Rathmines air base, which already had workshops equipped with lathes. We all know that some handicapped people are able to operate lathes, and these and other items of equipment were available at the base. Before the Government disposed of this base, I mentioned this matter in the hope that it would be used as a sheltered workshop or as a place where the physically or mentally handicapped could be trained, as this would give them independence and remove a great mental burden from the minds of their parents. ideal place. read the newspapers to know that.

I believe the Minister was present at the Newcastle office of the Department of Social Services and met Gary Hooper, of whom departmental officers are very proud. Gary, who has represented Australia overseas at the Olympic Games, now lives in my electorate. I have known him and his parents for many years. He has been rehabilitated because of the aid he has received from the Department. As I said, although he is crippled from the hips down, he represented Australia at the Olympic Games. itated.

128,Mr James,"Yes. He mows his lawnthink they get any concessions such as the right to purchase petrol less sales tax. These are things I believe the Government should do without delay. Indeed it could do a lot more. Mr Allan Fraser, the former member for Eden-Monaro, who was one of the most forthright men of this Parliament, played an important part in agitating and appealing to the Government to acknowledge the importance of this matter and to recognise the unfortunate forgotten people, as they were once described. In 1963 there was a move by Mr Hugh Roberton, the then Minister for Social Services, who is now Ambassador to Ireland. He initiated legislation which indicated a positive move to relieve the burden on these unfortunate people. There is no limit to what physically and mentally handicapped people can achieve with government assistance and proper training. Many years before I ever thought of becoming a member of this HouseI had the opportunity of meeting in Sydney that distinguished American woman, Helen Keller, the deaf, dumb and blind authoress. I believe she is still living in America today. She was befriended and given an opportunity to cultivate and improve her talents and display them to the world, and she has become a historical figure. We do not know what can be achieved by these mentally and physically handicapped people if they are given a chance. In one book I read it was written that the day may come when these people, given a chance, could reach a position as high as that of Prime Minister of Australia. Roosevelt? America's greatest Presidents. I do not want to branch out on another subject, but I say it is a pity that he is not alive today, because the United States of America would be regarded much more highly by the world's people if the principles of Roosevelt were being pursued today. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was physically handicapped like the young boy Gary Hooper whom I mentioned earlier in my remarks. Gary Hooper, who lives in my electorate, is handicapped from the hips down. These physically and mentally handicapped people -grea t people like Helen Keller, President Roosevelt and I suppose many more distinguished people of the world-were given the opportunity to attain great heights in society and establish themselves in history. The Minister stated in his second reading speech: These as well as other handicapped people in the community want to work and play a role in our society. They are unable to enter ordinary employment but have some capacity for work, and it is felt that they should not be condemned to a life of idleness. Certainly they have been condemned for too long, and it is time this Government moved much faster and in a more positive way than by means of the provision that it is making in this legislation. The Minister also said: The development of sheltered workshops, both in Australia and overseas, has been carefully watched for a number of years and has been discussed with many of the people wbo are operating sheltered workshops. SinceI have been in this Parliament 1 have noticed that one of the most favoured words used by politicians is 'watched'. Another favourite expression is 'give attention to'. If members look at Hansard they will find these expressions used frequently in most members' speeches-w e must give attention to this, or we must watch that. I say act, not watch. There is too much watching by politicians; they watch and watch for years and then do a bit of acting just before an election in order to get some votes. I hope the Government will consider the matters I have submitted. I consider that the subsidy is not enough, and I will rejoice when the Government doubles it. I hope that in the not too distant future about President the number of sheltered workshops throughout this nation will treble, because they are more urgently needed than most members of the public and most members of Parliament realise. I think I said before that the basic principle of all Christian religions is that the better off or the rich should give more to the poor, but I do not believe this Government is going as far as it should. I appreciate what it is doing, although I only wish it was doing more and that these unfortunate people who have been handicapped from an early age or from birth were given much more sympathy and consideration than the Government is giving them.",56,Sheltered Employment
129,Mr Birrell,What,57,Sheltered Employment
130,Mr James,"Yes. He was one ofcommencing point, I say that the Bill before the House has two main functions. Firstly, it enables the Government to make grants to eligible organisations to assist them in establishing and equipping sheltered workshops. Secondly, it expands the provisions of the Disabled Persons Accommodation Act which, we remember, was introduced in this House by the Menzies Government in 1963. Therefore, we could sum up by saying that in general the whole purpose of the Bill is to foster and encourage the sheltered workshop movement. I think we should have a look at the background of this work. A previous speaker has already referred to a survey carried out last year by the Department of Social Services. I wish to refer to that again because I think probably I can bring out some additional points from it and also from some of the figures already mentioned. I hope by emphasising these figures to bring out a lesson from them. In MayJ 966 the Department brought forward the results of the survey. We find that there are more than 100 sheltered workshops in the Commonwealth, these being in metropolitan areas and also in country areas. I was most interested to find from the report of the survey that more than half of these workshops have sprung up in the last five years. This is indicative of the growing interest in this particular work. The figures dealing with employment have already been quoted; at that time there were 3,397 people in 87 of these workshops which answered a questionnaire which was sent out. I want to say a little more about those figures. Of that total, 2,585 were invalid pensioners. Of the remainder, some were on award wages, lt is interesting to note the break-up. Some were receiving age, widows or war pensions, and others were receiving unemployment or sickness benefits, workers' compensation payments, or superannuation payments. I shall refer a little later to the question governments for capital costs and for mainof workers compensation. A few of the people I have mentioned had small independent incomes. The point I want to make is that here we have quite a substantial work force which has not been fully tapped. Also included in this number of people attending these workshops were 272 who were not handicapped in any way. They were employed mainly in a managerial or supervisory capacity. ThefigureI find of interest is that approximately 750 to 800 people were awaiting employment. This is an optimistic figure, if it is put forward as representing the total in the Commonwealth. It is the figure given by these eighty-seven workshops of people known by them to be living within their areas. There must be many more indeed. As the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) said, nobody knows just what number of people is involved. The Minister for Social Services( Mr Sinclair) said that he anticipates that employment in sheltered workshops can provide opportunities for thousands more people. The survey also dealt with work capabilities. This is quite interesting. I recommend the report to any honourable members who have not already read .t. One interestingfigureis the work output of these people. It averaged from 20% to 50% of the output of workers in industry. Surely that is a very wide range, but 1 think the report gives us a pretty good idea of the capabilities of these people. We are told that industrial norms are sometimes exceeded. When we couple these factors I have mentioned, two things are apparent. Firstly, there is a very sizable production potential in this group of people, and secondly, this Bill, with its provision for further mechanisation, will result in increased productivity not only from the whole group but from individuals. The report also deals withfinance,which is very relevant in discussing this Bill. In 1964-65 production worth §998,000 came from over eighty-seven workshops. Public subscriptions in all forms, art unions, raffles, direct contributions and so on, all organised by this great band of willing workers, built that figure up to 31,125,000. Those figures relate to only eighty-seven of the 100-odd workshops. In addition, there has been limited assistance from State tenance and operating expenses. Two big things are revealed in this report. The first is that total income falls short of total expenditure. That is the first lesson onfinance.The second thing is that only a few of these workshops were able to meet their total commitments from income raised by production. That is the background",57,Sheltered Employment
131,Mr England (Calare) [8.37],"As aagainst which we look at this Bill which is designed to assist voluntary organisations. This assistance of voluntary organisation is the fine point of this Bill. It will accomplish this by increasing the number of workshops and by improving the equipment in them. Grants will be made on a $2 for $1 basisa basis common to other similar legislation and one that fosters initiative and offers incentive. This Bill provides four ways by which the Government can assist in establishing and improving sheltered workshops and accommodation. Firstly, the Commonwealth will contribute to the capital cost of purchasing or building workshops; it will assist in the expansion of workshops already in existence and probably of workshops to be built in the future. Secondly, the cost of equipment will be subsidised. This will naturally add to the efficiency and productivity of this group and the idea is commendable. Thirdly, the annual rental of workshops will be subsidised for up to three years. That again is a great encouragement to voluntary workers. Fourthly, the Bill not only continues but will expand the assistance available under the Disabled Persons Accommodation Act to which I referred earlier. Whilst doing all these things the Bill will preserve both independence and initiative. I feel very strongly that this is a very good point. The scheme will not interfere with the independence and initiative of the voluntary agencies now doing this work. My mind immediately goes to the workshop I know best, which is in Orange in my electorate. I know the people involved. All honourable members probably can think of similar workshops where people are doing splendid work in a voluntary capacity. They will know of the New South Wales Association of Sheltered Workshops and other bodies. I pay due commendation to the work and the sheltered workshops, just as there that all these people are doing. Without it is between business groups and the workthe system would not carry on. I also would shops. like to compliment the managers of these workshops. They have to be jacks of all trades; they are important and efficient great labour forces of Australia. They are men. They have to give constant attention already producing over $lm worth of salable to business principles. They are engaged in goods a year. Let us do all we can to a constant search for work that can be done develop this force and to use it. What can by handicapped people. I want to pay more governments do about providing work? We attention to this matter a little later in my are dealing in this Bill with finance. It speech. They have to exercise, even more occurs to me that the Commonwealth than other employers, extreme personal care because of the type of people with whom they are dealing. They have to study constantly the aptitude, experience and temperament of those with whom they work. Truly this must be a very rewarding job inwardly for these people. Honourable members who have had any experience with these sheltered workshops and who have seen partially disabled people working will realise the terrific benefit that work is to them. The lift to their morale and to their self-respect is apparent when one sees them. They are given a great opportunity to discover the dignity of work. That is one of the greatest results of this scheme. These people are able to join with others in the community and become part of the great work force of Australia. Referring again to the workshop at Orange, the one I know best, there is one point I want to emphasise. I have visited the workshop and have been in touch with the people running it on a number of occasions. I have always come away from the workshop with a couple of phrases ringing in my mind. I remember the words of the manager: 'We want work'. The workshop wants work from outside sources but it is a lot more difficult in country areas than in city areas to find the type of work that these people can do. Incidentally, it is excellent to see this type of activity being extended to farming operations of various kinds. The other words which ring in my mind are 'competitive prices'. The managers of these places talk constantly of competitive prices and the ruling commercial rates. I think this is good. It is business like. It is good to see this approach. There is no sweated labour in these workshops. There is no abject pity. None is asked for and none is wanted. All they want is work. Luckily, there is a great history of co-operation between the trade union movement These people are potentially one of the Government could do more in the way of providing work. I think, for example, of the Department of Supply. I think also of the Services;-the Navy, the Army and the Air Force-the Postmaster-General's Department, the Department of Works and the Government's stores. It should be possible to bring work from these sources to the sheltered workshops for these people to do at ruling rates and competitive prices. This is probably not a job for the Minister for Social Servces, but because I know of his interest in this matter I am sure that he would be willing to try to work on his colleagues who could probably help. I am approaching the matter from the personal angle. I know that people, particularly those in country areas, are seekwiping the slate clean of the promises we ing the type of work which will keep everybody employed. There are certain types of articles which these people could make. I have seen them do all sorts of work. I know they can make articles such as seats and tables that are built to last. In the State sphere possibly the hospitals could provide work for these people. I know that this has nothing to do with this House and I mention it only in passing. I ask the Government to bend its efforts to do all it can to provide additional work for these people. I do not think that it should prove to be an insuperable task. It is just a matter of getting down to business and working something out. I wish now to deal with the subject of workers compensation. We know that sheltered workshops will receive the $2 for $1 subsidy, providing that the employment, they offer is 'substantially for disabled persons'. I do not think it is difiicult to interpret that definition. However, one group of disabled persons with whom I am concerned, coming as I do from a reasonably highly industrialised area, are those whose injuries are the subject of court action for workers compensation or third party insurance. I have been directing my comments to the Government and have been exhorting it to provide work for disabled people, but now I say to employers that they should help these injured employees. In the first place, before a grant of damages is made employers might contribute to eligible private organisations to provide employment to avoid injuries becoming permanent. We are familiar with the term 'insurance neurosis'. This relates to a condition which some pepole develop during a long wait for a court case to be heard. The workshop should be assisted to provide employment for these injured people both before and after a grant of damages is made. It is necessary that there be continuity in the working lives of such people. EarlierI threw something into the ring for the consideration of the Government; now I throw this into the ring for the consideration of employers. I support the Bill. I do so for two reasons. Firstly, it is the fulfilment of another election promise which was endorsed by the majority of the people in this Commonwealth. We are, as it were, have made. Secondly, I am glad that assistance is being provided in the four phases to which I have referred. There has been assistance of a capital nature. Last week legislation was passed by this House to liberalise the means test. We have further liberalised the mean test for sheltered workshop personnel. Now we are providing additional grants for accommodation for disabled persons. All these factors will encourage voluntary workers in this field. They will boost output; they will tap further potential; and will assist this large work force which, as I have said, is not yet fully harnessed to Australia's national effort. aspects of this Bill are unique. They have been introduced for the first time in the Federal Parliament. A Disabled Persons Accommodation Bill was introduced in 1963, but that dealt only with individuals who worked in sheltered workshops. This Bill goes far beyond that and caters for the workshops themselves, their equipment and the land upon which they are built. It represents a definite widening of the principles contained in the Disabled Persons Accommodation Act, which it repeals. It is always good to see new legislation coming into this Parliament which creates a new field of assistance. The Bill is a recognition of a tremendous voluntary effort in the difficult field of giving the disabled people of Australia a place in the suna chance to live a useful and normal life. This Bill is humane and constructive; that is why we support it. The",58,Sheltered Employment
132,Mr Duthie (Wilmot) [8.54],"Manyvoices of representation that have been shouting at the door of this Government for many years have achieved a remarkable breakthrough at the level of the Commonwealth Parliament. At least eleven years ago I was asking questions about Federal help for sheltered workshops. Later, Mr Len Reynolds, who entered the Parliament in 1958 as the honourable member for Barton, joined forces with me and others on this side of the House. He made several splendid contributions to our effort to obtain Federal assistance. Unfortunately Mr Reynolds was defeated in November 1966, but he must feel deep satisfaction today to know that Federal recognition has at last been given and given in the most generous manner. Mr Reynolds made some splendid speeches on this subject and was in direct communication with the workshop movement in Sydney. I remember, too, that we have had several this. visits from Mr and Mrs H. Bedwin, who have already been referred to in this debate. They were a remarkable couple.

Let At this point I want to criticise the Comus remember, and let me stress, that the monwealth Public Service for what it has sheltered workshop movement is a volunnot done for restored invalid pensioners. tary movement and has nothing to do with This is a scandalous story of neglect of all governments. Private citizens have banded those people who, with not very great distogether to establish these sheltered workabilities, have tried to get into the Commonshops in which disabled people and others wealth Public Service. The Commonwealth may work. The achievements of these people are remarkable and praiseworthy. Now the Government is to give assistance. It not only is recognising their existence but is providing substantial help. The Commonwealth is carrying out its own work in the rehabilitation centres, which were introduced in 1948 when Mr Chifley was Prime Minister of Australia. Since that time 20,000 invalid pensioners have been restored to gainful employment in industry. This is truly a thrilling story, a story behind the scenes, for not many people visit rehabilitation centres and many people lose interest in their fellow men once they are disabled. For all some people care, the disabled may as well be buried. Yet behind the scenes for years the rehabilitation centres have been fitting invalid pensioners for the work force. There is no greater story of human regeneration than At the rate of 1,000 a year these disabled right attitudes. I pay a tribute tonight to those leaders of private enterprise who have should take a leaf out of the book of private enterprise. Fancy a Labor man speaking in these terms about private enterprise, but I do so quite sincerely and quite objectively. Private enterprise is not the only avenue by which to get these people back to work, but the Commonwealth Public Service, which should be doing something in the field, has done practically nothing. I criticise it as vigorously as I can. I have tried to get people with a slight disability accepted into the Public Service but this high and mighty organisation, this holy of holies, will not accept anybody unless he is about 101% fit. The incapacitated do not get the chance they deserve in the Public Service. It is a disgrace that this should be so. The Public Service treats the disabled as forgotten people. Some of them used to be in the Public Service. They may have been injured in a car accident. Eventually they got back on their feet, but they were not readmitted to the Public Service. But this Bill deals primarily with private voluntary organisations which over the years have tackled the task of providing useful work for the disabled. The story of this facet of aid is truly magnificent. The debate on such a bill as this gives us an opportunity to speak about these organisations. Today there are 100 sheltered workshops in Australia. I can remember when there was only one, and that was not very long ago. This is a marvellous story of private co-operative effort, of people getting together and helping others who cannot help themselves-caterin g for the physically and mentally disabled. What a tribute we must pay tonight to that vast number of instructors who over the years have worked so devotedly in the sheltered workshops. I must mention here that these workshops are operated as a business undertaking. This is good. Not only have these voluntary organisations given new hope and life to the disabled but also they have reduced the number of Australians in receipt of the invalid pension. I wonder how much the Commonwealth has saved in its social services expenditure by these people going back to work and ceasing to receive the invalid pension. It is my view that the number of disabled persons in the community will increase in future years because the number of car accidents is increasing at an alarming rate. Each year 3,000 Australians are killed on our roads. This is tragic enough, but do honourable members realise that between 50,000 and 60,000 Australians are injured each year. Far worse than the war in Vietnam or the war in Korea is the war on our roads. With the assistance provided by the Commonwealth for capital expenditure and the provision of equipment, the sheltered workshop movement now will play a more important part than ever in rehabilitating and giving worthwhile work to our disabled. Mr Deputy Speaker, there seems to be another parliament meeting in the corner on my left. Members of the Country Party have had their say and they should be prepared to listen to somebody else. able member for Calare( Mr England) with respect, and I expect the same courtesy from the honourable member for Gippsland. He has a good record of attendance in this House and normally he listens attentively to speeches. I am sorry if my speech has no interest for him. Each year about 55,000 people are injured on our roads. Many of them, because of permanent incapacity, will probably seek work in our sheltered workshops. So the expenditure now being undertaken by the Commonwealth may do more than we realise in the years ahead. In his second reading speech the Minister for Social Services( Mr Sinclair) said: What this measure seeks to achieve is the development of an increased number of well equipped workshops which will enable severely handicapped people to earn up to the limits imposed by their disabilities. The honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) asked the Minister how much these people could earn without losing their pensions. The Minister did not give an adequate reply, although in his second reading speech he made it clear that they may earn up to the limits imposed by their disabilities. He did not say that they may earn up to the limits imposed by the restrictions of the Social Services Act. I would interpret the Minister's remarks to mean that these people may earn more than the statutory amount fixed under the Social Services Act and still retain their pensions. We on this side claim that this is the proper interpretation; that they may",60,Sheltered Employment
133,Mr Nixon,Shame.,62,Sheltered Employment
134,Mr Duthiei Listened To The Honour,"continue to earn as much as they can, even if their earnings exceed the statutory limit imposed by the Social Services Act. These are special people with a special handicap. They are earning money often at some physical discomfort to themselves. They should not be limited in what they can earn. The Minister continued: Some will eventually be able to graduate to is designed to raise productivity. Subsidies outside jobs, others will find permanent and will be available for the initial equipment. rewarding employment within the workshops This equipment is very expensive now. themselves. . . . Although the average output of Subsidies will also be available for the the disabled workers may be lower than that of the able bodied, to some extent this can be offset expansion and re-equipment of existing by the use of specially designed or modified equipworkshops. However, one penalty has been ment and by sympathetic and skilful management. written into the Bill. The Minister said in The Minister went on to say: Broadly, the Bill before the House does four things. It provides assistance on a $2 for $1 basis to eligible organisations: First, towards the capital organisation to repay a grant to the Commoncost of purchasing, erecting or extending premises for use as sheltered workshops; secondly, towards the cost of items of equipment required for the operation of a workshop or to increase its efficiency of an item of equipment. or productivity; in the third place, towards the annual rental of premises for use as a sheltered workshop for up to three years This will enable the organisations to save towards building their own premises at the end of three years: and, finally, it incorporates, continues and expands the assistance previously available under the Disabled Persons Accommodation Act. Organisations which are eligible for assistance are churches, charitable and benevolent groups. . . . Local governing bodies are also included, although they were not included in ""the 1963 legislation, notwithstanding that the Opposition sought to amend the Bill to have them included. Ex-servicemen's organisations are also eligible for assistance in the building of sheltered workshops. The assistance that can be given is quite generous. The capital subsidy which will provide sheltered employment will apply to buildings purchased or erected, including anything necessary for their intended use. The value of land may be included in the capital cost. I think the Government is very generous to permit this value to be included, because the price of land is now a very big capital cost. Land within cities has been built on and the boundaries of cities have extended. The result is that the cost of land in recent years has been very high and is continuing to rise. Grants may also be made towards the cost of renovating, altering or extending existing premises. Land used or to be used for farming activities in which disabled workers are employed may be approved and a grant may be made towards the cost of such land and approved fixed improvements on the land. I think that too is a most generous provision, because it extends the sheltered workshop movement beyond the confines of the cities. The subsidy for approved items of equipment his second reading speech: To ensure that the purpose of a grant is fulfilled the agreement may also require the wealth in the event of a breach of the undertaking or an adjustment to be made in the event uf an organisation being given approval to dispose The Minister also mentioned the way in which the grant will apply. He said: This does not mean that borrowed funds or funds received from a State Government cannot be used to help meet the cost of a project. Prior to this he had said funds cannot attract the subsidy if they come from a State or Commonwealth grant. He went on to say: For example, if an eligible organisation had raised $20,000 from public appeals, had received a donation of $10,000 from a local governing body, $7,500 from a State Government, and horrowed $7,500, the amount of $30,000 received from the public appeals and the local governing body's donau'on would be the amount that could be subsidised. This would attract a grant of $60,000 and by using all available funds the organisation could obtain a sheltered workshop costing up to $105,000. What the Minister was saying was that, though the amount of $7,500 received from the State Government would not be counted for subsidy purposes, it can be included in the total capital made available to the organisation to build a workshop. The rental subsidy will be paid for three years while the organisation builds up capital funds with which to purchase suitable buildings! This is a very wise provision. We know that many of the workshops are paying rent. They will be subsidised for three years and this will encourage them to make a public appeal to raise the funds that will attract the subsidy at the end of the three years and thus enable them to build their own workshop. Another very interesting feature of the Bill, as the honourable member for Grayndler said, is that its operation is back dated to 28th November 1966. It is a pity that a provision similar ment, but there are some who could go out to this is not included in other pieces of legislation that provide benefits for pensioners. However, the back dating of this benefit will mean that any work commenced since 28th November 1966 will be eligible for subsidy. In Launceston in Tasmania we have a very well conducted sheltered workshop, which was started by a Mrs Terry. The chief instructor is Mr Murray who is performing an outstanding service. It has been operating for only about two years. We have another in Hobart and a third in Devonport. Mrs Terry told me at the weekend that their greatest need is space and equipment. This Bill will assist the workshops to obtain the space and equipment they need. There is room for the Launceston workshop to expand at the site where it is now operating, beside St George's School in Amy Road near the St Giles Home for crippled children. Tenders have been called for work that will double the size of the workshop. Mr Pendrith, who is a leading person in the organisation and a member of the committee, asked me at the weekend whether the Bill would enable the organisation to obtain the subsidy. I assured him that it would. It is good to know that the Bill will enable this organisation in Launceston, which already has one-third of the cost of this big building programme in hand, to attract the subsidy of $2 for $1 and enable it to finish the project within a short time and to build the workshop to the size that is needed. At the moment the organisation conducting the workshop in Launceston must use space outside the shop. Some of the people employed there must work outside the shop. It can hold only twenty, but thirty-five young people work there. Some are put outside to work when the weather is fine, but there is a very big crowd in the workshop when the weather is bad. The increase of the size of the building will be of tremendous advantage. Most of the people working there are children from three schools in Launceston that cater for crippled children. They are the St Giles Home, which is one of the best in Australia, the St sons can operate electric drills. This extends George's School and St Michael's School. The children are paid 10s a week for their work. Many of them will stay the rest of their lives working in this type of employinto the world and work in normal industry. However, some of them are afraid that they may lose their pension. There is always the thought that if they give up their pension they will have nothing if for any reason they find they are unable to work outside. The fear of losing the pension stops some of them from going out into the world to work. I think the Minister should make quite clear in his reply to this debate how the earnings from this work will affect pensions that these people receive. I think that they should hold their pension and be allowed to earn as much as normal people do for their work. of this is that it gives them a concession if they pass the limit of permissible earnings, provided that under the Social Services Bill they are acceptable as persons receiving a sheltered workshop allowance. This Bill is separate from the Social Services Bill. This Bill provides for the capital benefits. The sheltered workshop allowance is the new type of concessional benefit that permits additional earnings within the concept of the invalid pension for persons who work in these places. has divided the two fields of assistance. I hope it will work out as he intends that it will and that our fears for these people will not materialise. The motto of the workshop in Launceston is: 'A chance to work, not charity.' That is an excellent motto for a place of this type. The problem that it faced at the beginning was finding a way to sell the goods that were made in the workshop. This is always a problem for these places. Cardboard containers gave the workshop a start. It was given a contract to make cell packs for fruit. The people in the workshop made fifty cartons a week and they were happy doing this. But then they had trouble with the cartage contractors and the work ceased. Then Kelsall& Kemp (Tas.) Ltd, manufacturers of blankets and other articles in Launceston, helped them and has now been helping them for quite a while. It has been found also that disabled per-",62,Sheltered Employment

Lately they have been engaged in packing newspapers which go to Malaya where they are used for wrapping food and for pulping. In performing this work disabled persons are contributing to our export trade. To enumerate some of the fields in which these persons are operating gives an interesting sidelight to the sheltered workshop movement. The scope of their work is remarkable and we must congratulate the leaders of the movement on the ingenuity they showed in providing different types of work for disabled people and in providing special equipment. This Bill will cater for the provision of that equipment. So in all I feel sure that the legislation now before us will add a new chapter to the story of these men and women who are placing our disabled people in useful work, giving them a sense of belonging to the community and rescuing them from the land of the lost. is one of the most important from a social those industries which have made annexes and humane standpoint that the Government available for the disabled.

Before the scheme was implemented the disabled had only the pension to look to and the comfort and attention from near relatives. The CommonweaUh Rehabilitation Service through hospitals and other institutions will continue and persons injured or afflicted by disease will be rehabilitated. It is estimated that more than 1,000 of such persons will return to normal life. Unfortunately, many people, because of their disabilities, cannot be fully restored and thus vocational rehabilitation must be limited to those who appear likely to secure jobs in competition witb fit persons. There are others who, through no fault of their own, cannot stand up to the normal conditions of employment in commerce and industry. This is where the sheltered workshop plays an important part. Specially designed mechanism is set up to assist the disabled to operate and control machines and to do work that otherwise tbey would not be able to perform. I pay tribute to those voluntary organisations which initiated This measure is designed to bring about more sheltered workshops and to in the organisations-churches , will need to comply with certain standards",64,Sheltered Employment
137,Mr Irwin (Mitchell) [9.22],"This Bill the sheltered workshop movement and toand operate, or plan to operate, at a level which will enable their employees to receive a reasonable reward for their labour. It is not proposed that the qualifying standards should be inflexible. It will, nevertheless, be necessary to differentiate between sheltered workshops and activity centres or similar establishments which are primarily intended to serve a purpose other than that of enabling handicapped persons to achieve some degree of financial independence. Broadly the Bill does four things. It procluded in the one Bill, as has been done vides assistance on a $2 to $1 basis to eligible organisations, firstly, towards the capital cost of purchasing, erecting or extending premises for use as sheltered workshops; secondly, towards the cost of items of equipment required for the operation of a workshop or to increase its efficiency or productivity; thirdly, towards the annual rental of premises for use as a sheltered workshop for up to three years; and finally, it incorporates, continues and expands the assistance previously available under the Disabled Persons Accommodation Act. Two requirements for eligibility are that an organisation must not be conducted for the profit or gain of its individual membecause the Minister has always adminisbers and that it must not be controlled by persons who have been appointed by the Commonwealth or a State government. As I said in my opening remarks, this is a wonderful scheme which was introduced following a promise by the Government in the policy speech delivered by the Prime Minister( Mr Harold Holt). I am sure that churches and similar organisations will be attracted to it and that the subsidy of $2 for $1 will enable such organisations to localise activities. This is most necessary because of the inability of disabled people to get from their homes to their places of employment. I here pay a tribute to the Lions Club in the Kogarah district. It did a tremendous job for almost two years in rostering memoers to go daily to the homes of disabled people, take them to the sheltered workshop and return them to their homes after work. When one realises just what this entailed one cannot but admire those self-sacrificing people who rendered this wonderful service to the disabled persons. I commend the Government on its action and I am sure that great good will come from this Bill. While my views may be somewhat more critical than those expressed by previous members in this debate, I welcome the introduction of the Sheltered Employees (Assistance) Bill 1967 as a practical measure designed to assist some people who otherwise would be resigned to a life of idleness. It is unfortunate, however, that the Bill has to be studied in association with the Social Services Bill 1967 for I believe that both measures could have been inwith the repeal of the Disabled Persons Accommodation Act which this Bill incorporates. This measure which, when enacted, could well be the vehicle by which a future Labor government will give full effect to its 1948 legislation which established the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service. In that regard it is worth noting that the Minister for Social Services( Mr Sinclair) in his second reading speech did not possess enough chivalry to allow him to mention that it was a Labor government which brought in the initial legislation in 1948 to help the rehabilitation of handicapped people. I am sorry for this, tered his portfolio in an admirable fashion. However, the Minister did recognise the Labor Government's objective in bringing down legislation at that time when he said: It is now almost twenty years since the Commonwealth Government established the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service to assist severely handicapped persons to live a normal life in the commumty. Since its establishment in 1948 more than 20,000 invalid pensioners and people who might otherwise have become invalid pensioners have been restored to gainful employment. The Minister's statement that in nearly twenty years more than 20,000 invalids and others bave been restored to gainful employment highlights the importance of this Bill, but I feel that the Minister should have been more specific by saying who, or what organisations, were responsible for that great achievement. I am sure it was not achieved by the Government alone, despite the fact that the Minister would have the general public think so. I want to pay a tribute also to people everywhere who are assisting disabled persons. I pay a tribute especially to the convenors of the Civilian Maimed and Limbless Association and, in particular, to Mr",65,Sheltered Employment
138,Mr Griffiths (Shortland) [9.32],"and Mrs Bedwin, who originally initiated the sheltered workshop movement, for only they know what a struggle it was to get going, the difficulties of raisingfinance,of being able to get people interested in the movement and all of the 101 problems associated with the launching of such a project and of keeping it financed in the early years of its existence. This must have been a phenomenal task and I am sure noone will deny them any success they achieve. I doubt very much whether there is one member of this House who has the slightest knowledge of what is entailed in looking after a mentally defective person or, for that matter, a quadriplegic or paraplegic or any of those persons who suffer from numerous other types of mental diseases and deformities, yet by this Bill we pose as having done something outstanding in the field of invalid and mental rehabilitation, whereas the truth of the matter is that at government level little of a practical nature has been done up to the present. Of course, the Bill will provide, for the are also acceptable organisations, apparently first time, practical financial assistance for because the Government is aware that local the sheltered workshop movement in the government can induce extra taxation, by provision of equipment and capital for rating, to provide the funds needed in buildings, and it will extend the provisions running sheltered workshops. This, in turn, of the Disabled Persons Accommodation would relieve the Commonwealth of the Act as distinct from what has been done in need to find extra finance. WhatI want to the Government's own rehabilitation know is why all this finessing by the centres. The Bill, as I see it, is very comGovernment in a matter so important to plex. It is possibly the most important piece the welfare of the people. Why is the of welfare legislation ever to have been Government allowed to spend so much introduced into this House, but in my view money on so few while refusing to allow it is to be leg-roped from the outset. It multitudes of other people the right to live could, I suppose, some time in the future, decently, as in the case of married aged on the return of a Labor government, form couples and widow pensioners? the foundation upon which might be built the superstructure of all problems associated with the rehabilitation of invalids, the mentally defective and the otherwise deformed debate on the Social Services Bill, that of and retarded people of this country.

But what of the tens of thousands of invalids and others, both young and old, who are unable to meet the educational requirements of sheltered workshop administrations? The definition of a disabled person in clause S of the Bill is restricted. It means a person: (a) who is, for the purposes of Division3 of Part III. of the Social Services Act 19471967, permanently incapacitated for work or whose physical or mental condition is such that, in the opinion of the Director General, he would become so permanently incapacitated for work if he were not provided with sheltered employment; or (b) who is permanently blind; The definition of eligible organisation is equally restrictive and expressly excludes the Commonwealth Government or a State government or an organisation which carries on its business for profitable gain. This means that it is left to church, charitable, benevolent, service and other similar organisations to bear the burden of the administration of sheltered employment. Local government and trustee organisations Only last week 1 pointed out, in the thousands of our incapacitated people while The section of the Social Services Act which covers eligibility for invalid pensions is as unreal as it is possible to be. I urge a reconsideration of the section to allow some elasticity to medical practitioners in their judgments of the state of health of patients. I believe the section should read 'persons incapacitated to the extent of 75% to 85% of their earning capacity', for in that way many more people would be able to obtain pensions and peace of mind. Until a year or so ago the attitude of the Department to a person undertaking casual work was, to say the least of it, cruel and unreal. Until about 1953 an invalid pensioner was absolutely prohibited from earning even one cent by way of supplementary income. It stands to the eternal credit of the late Athol Townley, who at that time was Minister for Social Services, that he issued an instruction to his Department that an invalid pensioner was to be allowed to earn upwards of 15% of the basic wage provided the employment was of a sedentary or semi-sedentary type. Even for years after that some officers of the Department were found to be spying on invalids who were endeavouring to supplement their pension by earning a pound or two. I am pleased to see that the present Minister for Social Services( Mr Sinclair) early last year saw the light and somewhat eased the burden on invalids by allowing invalid pensioners to have their earning capacity gauged on medical issues rather than on the ability or desire to work. For record puiposes I propose to read to the House a letter I received from the Minister following correspondence between us because I am sure there are many people who are unaware of the altered conditions now applying to invalid pensioners. On 29th June last year the Minister wrote a letter to me in which he said: On 10th JuneI promised to write to you again about the employment of invalid pensioners. The question of invalid pensioners undertaking employment was reviewed recently and this has resulted in some modifications insofar as the effect of earnexplained in the debate on the Bill the other ings is concerned. Broadly, the question of whether or not an invalid pensioner in employment is permanently incapacitated for work will be determined, in future, on the medical evidence alone. The previous policy was that an invalid pensioner who earned more than fifteen per cent of the wage normally payable in the type of employment in which he was engaged (or $4 a week where the basic wage was payable), was, as a general rule, regarded as having ceased to be permanently incapacitated for work to the extent of 85% and therefore ineligible for further pension. This will no longer apply. Except for means test purposes, therefore, earnings in future will not be a disqualifying factor for invalid pension. Where an invalid pensioner commences employment a medical review will not be carried out unless the earnings exceed $7 a week. If the earnings exceed $7 a week a medical review, involving an examination by the Commonwealth Medical Referee, will be conducted. The Commonwealth Medical Referee will be furnished with details of the employment before commencing the examination and the question of whether the pensioner is still permanently incapacitated for work to the extent of 85% will be determined in the light of the Medical Referee's report. _ The above policy will apply to all invalid pensioners, including those in sheltered workshops, but married pensioners in sheltered workshops will continue to be allowed to receive $8 a week from the workshops before a review of their medical eligibility for pension will be required. Two steps will thus be necessary in future where an invalid pensioner engages in employment: Firstly. Where the pensioner commences employment at a wage in excess of $7 a week ($8 a week in the case of a married pensioner in a sheltered workshop), a medical review will be carried out to see whether the pensioner remains medically qualified for pension. Secondly. Where the pensioner remains medically qualified for pension, the rate will be reviewed to take into account the income received by way of earnings. The changes I have outlined represent a modification to the methods adopted in the Department to determine whether a person is permanently incapacitated for work to the extent required to qualify for invalid pension and does not in any way affect the provisions of the Social Services Act. For this reason I did not see a need to make a public announcement. I feel sure that the information contained in the Minister's letter will be of the greatest interest to many people. There must be many who have been unaware of the change that has taken place, and I personally appreciate the Minister letting me know the change of policy. now been increased, of course, to $10, subject to the means as assessed, as was day. appreciated.

140,Mr Griffiths,"That is very muchreferred to the Department for rehabilitation purposes, only 4,915 of them had been placed in employment. I therefore challenge the Minister to tell the nation what has become of the remaining 80,393, who apparently failed to make the grade in rehabilitation training. What everyone in this Parliament seems to forget is this-and it is one of the most important aspects of our social service system: for an applicant to obtain an invalid pension he must be incapacitated for work to the extent of not less than 85%. The question of invalidity has always been a frightening one for general medical practitioners. In my experience the great majority of them are afraid to state on paper that a person is permanently incapacitated. In many ways I have a very great sympathy with them in their dilemma, because it is almost impossible for a doctor to say with certainty that a person is 85% or more incapacitated in cases involving carcinoma plus other internal conditions, heart diseases, emphysema, hypertension, nephritis or any of the dozens of kinds of arthritis with their crippling effects. Then, of course, there are patients whose central nervous systems go wrong, and these are really hard to deal with from the doctor's point of view. Employers will not employ them. I have no doubt that many doctors would say immediately that patients who were 60%, 70% or 80% incapacitated were permanently incapacitated, but would hesitate to say that these patients were 85% incapacitated. Apparently a person in this category must continue to eke out an existence to the best of his or her ability without any thought ever having been given to employment in a sheltered workshop or the grant of an invalid pension. Is it any wonder that statistics showed that more than 1,250,000 people earned less than £12 10s a week in the 1962-63 income year? The numbers of people earning income around this level are considerably higher today. I could virtually fill a book with cases contain only machinery provisions, whereas that have come to my attention over the the Minister in his second reading speech years in which the Department has rejected made many significant statements which applications for invalid pensions even in must have aroused the curiosity of many the face of medical certificates stating that people. I propose to refer to some of the the patients concerned were not capable of Minister's remarks, which I think are work, and in which the Department relented important to the future welfare of sheltered and approved of an invalid pension only after further medical evidence was presented. I remember a case many years ago of a woman who had had thirteen children and whose application for an invalid pension was rejected and who within six weeks was admitted to a mental hospital and within six months was dead. My own brother-in-law had to die at the age of sixty-two before his doctor found out that he had been sick enough to get an invalid pension. I believe that sheltered employment would have enabled him to enjoy life a little longer, because he was an excellent carpenter and joiner. About three years ago a neighbour of mine begged me to get her an invalid pension. She was about forty-six years of age and the widow of one of Newcastle's best known doctors. I asked her to see her step-son, who also was a medical practitioner, and obtain from him a medical certificate indicating the complaint from which she was suffering and with which she was permanently incapacitated. Over a period of about two years, although it was evident to everyone who knew her that her health was deteriorating, the doctor refused to provide a certificate that his step-mother was permanently incapacitated. However, within a few weeks of entering a hospital this woman died at the age of forty-eight years. The doctor later admitted that even medical practitioners err in their judgment at times. That woman virtually starved to death because she had no form of employment, sickness benefit or anything else. She died as a result of the inability of a medico to realise that her condition was so bad. I am sure that she would have been an acquisition to any sheltered workshop or some other place of employment, because many years earlier she had occupied a position as a doctor's secretary. In Australia today there are literally thousands of this type of case which the Minister and the Government ignore. The Bill is vague and appears to me to workshop employees and those people who when, in relation to vocational rehabilitaadminister the sheltered workshop movetion, he said: ment. Early in his speech the Minister said: Notable advances in training and employing disabled persons, particularly the mentally disin competition with those who axe able bodied. abled, have been made in a rural environment on various types of farms. I refer to the growing provided with assistance by the Commonwealth of grain and vegetables, the raising of poultry and livestock, as well as work in orchards and plant nurseries. The Minister then invited honourable these members to think of similar undertakings generosity of the many voluntary organisations which could encourage invalids to work which have pioneered this field and to which but which would not be designated as workmuch credit is due. In Australia today, there are shops. It was apparent that the Minister more had been thinking in terms of maximum and the mentally handicapped. More than half opportunities for the infirm and aged. To of these workshops have been started within the my mind, this was a good omen for the past five years. Their purpose is to help handisuccess of this venture. Earlier the Minister capped people. In doing so they are producing when speaking on the Social Services Bill goods said: For example we would not wish to exclude employment in a rural colony engaged in general fanning, or a poultry farm or a plant nursery. Later, he said: Two requirements for eligibility are that an organisation must not be conducted for the profit or gain of its individual members and that it must not be controlled by persons who have been appointed by either the Commonwealth or a State government. Later in the same speech the Minister said that capital subsidies would not be limited to projects where employees would receive the proposed sheltered employment allowance. What does this mean? Is it proposed that some rural undertakings will be eligible to receive the assistance while others will not be eligible? Does it mean that capital subsidies will be granted to establishments which obtain the Minister's blessing even though the type of work in which the employee engages is not eligible to receive the sheltered employment allowance? Perhaps the Minister will be good enough to clarify what he really means. I believe there are numerous opportunities for the mentally retarded or the infirm to work at rural undertakings if only proper arrangements could be worked out. Conditions of employment, hours, wages, holidays and accommodation would all need to be safeguarded, and the same would need to apply to persons who work in sheltered workshops. The Minister referred in particular to the objective of the legislation Treatment and training therefore are limited to those who appear likely to be able to secure jobs Each year, however, several hundred people are Rehabilitation Service but fail, through no fault of their own, to measure up to the exacting requirements of normal employment in commerce and industry . . . It was to meet the needs of people that sheltered workshops were established through the initiative, enterprise and than 100 sheltered workshops of various kinds catering for both the physically disabled and services which last year added about $lm to our national production. A little later he said: What this measure seeks to achieve is the development of an increased number of well equipped workshops which will enable severely handicapped people to earn up to the limits imposed by their disabilities. Some will eventually be able to graduate to outside jobs and others will find permanent and rewarding employment within the workshops themselves. What does all this mean? Is it to be inferred that wherever possible invalids are to be got back to work and that in other cases they will remain permanently in the employ of sheltered workshops? Does it mean that production from these people is continually to be built up? That is as I see it, especially in the light of the Minister's statement that last year about $lm was added to our national production by about 100 sheltered workshops. Does it mean that by the time there are 1,000 sheltered workshops the contribution to the national production will be $10m or more? If that is so and provided it can be achieved without taking toll of the already reduced state of health of the invalid, I would welcome it. However, I am not too sure about what the future holds for many of these people. The Minister has already told the House that pensioners employed in sheltered workshops would have their pensions suspended but that they would receive an allowance of an equal amount plus earnings. It appears to me that a single pensioner will receive $13 a week plus certain earnings, but what will the earnings amount to? Will the employee be paid by contract, at piecework rates, by the day or by the week? What will be the weekly hours worked? How many hours will constitute a day's work? What difference will there be between 'the hours worked in a workshop and the hours worked in a farm or plant nursery? From what I glean from the Minister's statement, it appears that for many pensioners there will not be very much in it. The fact that the first $10 of earnings will be taken as the permissible earnings, after which one half of the excess will be held against the pensioner's merged income, will mean that the more the pensioner earns the less will be the value of the pension. If the pensioner should have invested a couple of thousand dollars which he or his parents saved for him, the position would be worsened. lf what I have said is not correct, will the case of injury or death of an employee the Minister give an assurance that a single who had been certified by a medical panel pensioner's allowance, which is to be equal as being retarded was to be transferred to his invalid pension plus his earnings up to from the employer to a nominal defendant $36 a week, will not be interefered with or such as the Crown, then I am sure more reduced? Will he also give a similar assuremployers would engage retarded employees. ance in regard to a married sheltered I further believe that the cost would be employee? Will he give an unequivocal more than justified in the final analysis. assurance that the pensioner's hospital and medical benefits will be held inviolate from interference? Perhaps he will also say whether an invalid pensioner's wife will wealth doctors that they were not percontinue to receive a wife's allowance and manently incapacitated died within short a children's allowance under the Bill and periods from heart disease. These people that the pensioner's earnings will not be virtually were compelled to work, many of reduced below $47 a week should he be capthem up to the time of their death, simply able of earning that amount. All these matbecause medical opinion had erred, and ters are of great importance to an invalid, without ever being granted a pension. I because his costs of living are frequently appeal to the Minister to give consideration much higher than are the costs for pensionto the proposal of my colleague the honourers who live normal healthy lives. I think the matters to which I. have reinvestigate poverty in Australia and the ferred reflect the extent of the Government's means of combating it, for I am sure interest in the rehabilitation and employment nothing but good would flow from the of invalids, the unemployed and the unemwork of such a committee. ployable, without mentioning the need to assist thousands of aged pensioners who receive only the base rate pension-especi for a few moments to support this very ally aged widow pensioners whose suppleworthwhile Bill which is designed to provide mentary earnings will be limited to $10 a Commonwealth assistance for the provision week.

It is disgusting to see married unemployed people receiving only $14.50 a week to live on while seeking employment in this day and age when costs are so high. The Government should do something about this situation. One of the greatest difficulties the Government is up against in being able to convince employers to employ retarded personnel is the fact that the employers have a definite responsibility under State law for the compensation of an employee once he has been engaged. I know that the employment of some people in any circumstances is a colossal responsibility to accept and that some employers will not be in it. However, if the responsibility for compensation in Many people who in the past had been told by medical practitioners and Commonable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) for the setting up of a joint committee to",68,Sheltered Employment
141,Mr Hallett (Canning) [10.2],"I riseIt has been the lot of a few people in Australia, realising the importance of giving disabled persons an opportunity in life, to see that something was done to assist them. In many cases it has not been easy to set up the workshops that we see throughout Australia today and the various facilities which are provided to give these people an opportunity to enjoy something of life. I feel that over the years they have been neglected by society to a large extent. This Bill will enable the organisations interested in these people to advance the workshops to a state where disabled persons will have an opportunity to live the fullest life possible, because it will make available occupations which should be available to them. From my own experience in the State of Western Australia. I am aware that citizens who have known that such people should have an opportunity have gone to tremendous trouble to get a few dollars here and there to set up workshops and provide facilities that would enable them to enjoy life. We have found that some parents have almost hidden their children for many years because of their handicap. In some cases the people concerned had not left the confines of their homes because they had not realised that there was an opportunity available to them. I am sure that this Bill will assist in a great many cases throughout the Commonwealth to give these people the opportunity they deserve. It was easy for most of us to go off to school in a normal manner, as people expect to do, and to take our chances to learn as we went through life. That is up to us. We have our full faculties. These other children, right from an early age, were left behind. They stayed at home, without the same opportunities, until such time as the organisations I have mentioned came forward and endeavoured to do something for them, to lift them out of their situation, and to assist their mothers sheltered workshop allowance, legislative and fathers. The parents of such children must find it almost impossible at times to know what to do to assist their children. Such assistance is beyond the average person, and as I see it this work must be done by the various organisations which are operating in Australia today. They have the technical knowledge, the know-how and the ability to teach these people to use their bands and the abilities they possess. If we look around we find that many of these people have tremendous talents, and if they are given the opportunity to use them they can live a very useful life. They can be occupied for the full day if given the opportunity. I am pleased to be associated with this Bill. I believe that it will make opportunities available for so many of our citizens, who in the past have been neglected. In the future they will have the opportunity to lead a useful and full life. for Social Services) [10.7]-in reply-As I said in my second reading speech to this House, before the Bill was brought down the details were discussed with various representatives of the sheltered workshop movement. Reference has been made during this second reading debate to some of the people who are concerned in the field of sheltered workshops. Very correctly, praise has been given to so many of these worthwhile organisations and individuals who have done so much to help the less fortunate members of our society. I would like to mention specifically the Australian Council for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled, a body which is now receiving a form of capital assistance from the Commonwealth and which is serving as a co-ordinating group amongst all people working in the field of disability. This body worked closely with the Government in formulating areas of assistance which it felt were most worthwhile, and as a result this Bill has been submitted to the Parliament as a step towards helping the sheltered workshops which have for so many years endeavoured to provide for people who are physically or mentally disabled. It is hoped that the capital assistance provided in this Bill, linked with the financial assistance provided through the provision for which was introduced into this House recently, will provide some additional assistance and will enable these organisations to operate on a viable basis in the future. 1 would like to refer to some of the matters specifically raised during the debate. In particular I want to assure honourable members-thi s matter was raised by the honourable member for Shortland ( Mr Griffiths) and, I think, the honourable",71,Sheltered Employment
142,Mr Sinclair (New England,"Ministe rmember for Grayndler ( Mr Daly), amongst others-that the benefits which a person would be entitled to receive as an invalid pensioner will be retained by him if he should receive the sheltered employment allowance. This was specifically referred to in the debate on another measure recently, and it is only through your latitude, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the matter has been referred to at all in this Parliament today. All these fringe benefits, such as child's allowance, wife's allowance and the pensioner medical entitlement, will be retained by a person changing from an invalid pension to a sheltered employment allowance. The general range of assistance that is being provided has been adopted on the basis that this seems to be the avenue in which the subsidy assistance will be of the most value to the people working in the field. The specific forms have already been dealt with, but there has been a suggestion before the House tonight that perhaps they should be of a greater amount or cover a wider range. The difficulty that arises is in determining in what way Commonwealth assistance can best be given. 1 hope that the various State governments which have taken unto themselves the responsibility for work in this field will maintain an interest and will continue their present capital assistthose people who suffer mental disabilities. ance. If they are not already giving some form of financial assistance perhaps now they will enter the field and provide additional help. I think there is a continuing area in which not only the Commonwealth Government but the State governments can exercise some responsibility for helping disabled people. I do not wish to deal in any detail with other matters. Where contributions made to the debate by honourable members have contained specific proposals, I will examine those proposals in detail. If there appears to be something worthy of implementation we will examine it and perhaps consider it in the light of the operation of the considerable advance made by this Bill in Commonwealth participation in assistance for disabled members of our community. The honourable member for Grayndler referred to the date of commencement of these benefits. As I explained in the debate on the Social Services Bill, where there is a provision of capital assistance the benefit is to be back dated to the first business day after the election. But where there is a subsidy provided either on rent or on the equipment in workshops, these benefits will operate as from the date of the Minister's consent. This is in line with normal practice. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Fox) explained in some detail some of the reasons why this has been so in the past and why, in my opinion, it should be so now. The final matter I would like to refer to is the fact that there is in this Bill no discrimination between the types of disability which persons working in a workshop may have and in respect of which capital assistance may be granted. Irrespective of disabilities sheltered workshop authorities may approach the Commonwealth Government and, subject only to compliance with the terms of the assistance, obtain this capital subsidy. This means, as in the case of farm projects which two or three honourable members referred to tonight, that there may well be people with mental disabilities rather than physical disabilities who will come within the category of sheltered workshop employees and for whom assistance will be available. The concept of farm homes, Mr Speaker, is one which offers particular benefits for many of One such farm is operating in New South Wales and it could well be a model for other organisations with an interest in this field. They may be able to draw on the experience of this farm and launch into similar projects of their own. This form of capital assistance, I should also mention, is not necessarily contiguous with the type of workshop within which the sheltered employment allowance is to be payable. In other words, a workshop for which capital assistance is provided need not necessarily be identical with a workshop within which all employees receive a sheltered employment allowance. This is primarily because at the stage of initiating a sheltered workshop it could well be that a body is not sufficiently organised to permit it to comply with the necessary requirements for the payment of a sheltered employment allowance. However, because of the very beneficial nature of a sheltered employment allowance, it is hoped that most sheltered workshops in due course will be able to transfer their employees from the invalid pension to the sheltered employment allowance. This, to my mind, gives disabled people the opportunity to strive to offset their disability and to play a more complete role in the community. This is the objective behind the Bill; to bring back into an active role in society those people with disabilities. If this objective can be realised then the support of the House in the passing of this Bill tonight will be well merited. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

CAIRNS (Yarra) [10.17]Mr pensions Speaker, the Bill before the House is a relaxation of the means test provided for small one which will have no great effect in recent legislation. The Minister went on on the provision of health or medical serto say: vices in Australia. Its short title confines it to the provision of certain health and affected by the proposed relaxations to the means medical services for pensioners. It is by are within the scope of that short title that I authorised by the Repatriation Act; sheltered empropose to say a few words on behalf of ployment allowances which will be authorised by the Opposition. Before being specifically the proposed amendment to the Social Services relevant to the Bill, I should like to point culosis out to the House that it is the purpose of the Australian Labor Party to provide a The benefits authorised by the Bill are, general, complete and comprehensive health firstly, hospital treatment in public wards and medical service in Australia, believing of public hospitals without charge in return without doubt that such a service does not for which the Commonwealth pays the hosexist today. In debating this Bill it will not pital concerned SS a day for each pensioner be possible for me to show how many gaps treated; secondly, the range of drugs and there are in the present general health and medicines that are ordered on the prescripmedical service in Australia. One of the features of health and medical services today is the existence of very significant gaps which cause a considerable amount of uncertainty, insecurity and worry to many members of the community. It is the purpose of the Australian Labor Party to provide a general, complete and comprehensive health and medical service primarily by the further development of the general or public hospitals in Australia. It is the intention of the Australian Labor Party that such a service should be financed by the community so that the citizen will not have to pay at the time he is ill and wili not have to pay in a lump sum. To ensure that full medical services are made available even to the poorest citizen in the community, it is the purpose of the Australian Labor quacy of medical attention shall have no relation to income or capacity to pay. That so in Australia; it must be made to be so. Much needs to be done to achieve this and Labor will seek immediately to reach this objective. As1 said, the Bill is far narrower than would allow adequate examination of the matters that 1 have just mentioned. The Bill concerns pensioners alone. As the Minister for Health (Dr Forbes) pointed out in his second reading speech, its purpose is to enable the benefits that are available to penNational Health Act to be made available to persons who will become eligible for and allowances as a result of the The pensions and allowances that will be test age, invalid or widows' pensions authorised the Social Services Act; service pensions Act; and allowances authorised by the TuberAct. tions of doctors in private practice without charge; and thirdly-provide d the Australian Medical Association agrees when it sees fit to have its meeting in May-the provision of free general practitioner medical service for the pensioners who have been brought within the scope of the ActsI have just mentioned. The Minister pointed out that the estimated annual cost to the Commonwealth is $550,000 for hospital benefits and $380,000 for pharmaceutical benefits. The estimated cost of extending the free general practitioner medical service for a full year is $450,000. So the Bill is not a significant one in tbe development of our medical services. Before looking at any other matters, I to the States and partly to voluntary and should like to point out that the Opposition charitable organisations. This is characreceives with some surprise and concern the teristic of the development of our health information that the provision of the general services, even in respect of pensioners. practitioner service for these new and additional pensioners depends on the meeting of the Australian Medical Association which, the provision of medical and health services as I have said, is not scheduled to take for pensioners. I am sure that each honourplace until May. This, of course, is as a able member has come across a sufficiently result of an agreement that exists between large number of cases to cause him to agree the Government and the Australian Medical with me when I say there is a vast inadeAssociation.

The Opposition believes that age and invalid pensioners and other pensioners in the community today are the responsibility of the nation and not of the States or any private or charitable bodies. There is plenty of scope for the States and private or charitable bodies to carry out their activities; but the Labor Party believes, and always has believed, that age and invalid pensioners are the responsibility primarily of the nation. The amendment to the Constitution providing the Commonwealth with power to provide health and social services that was adopted in, I think, 1946 or 1948 gave effect to the approach that the Labor Party has always made. We believe that the Australian nation is not discharging its responsibility towards age and invalid pensioners. We believe that increasingly the Commonwealth has passed this responsibility partly There are at least six serious defects in 1. Is it a fact that in most States there is a deficiency of (a) beds for acute geriatric cases in hospitals and (b) day centres or out the House. The answer was in two parts. This is what the Minister for Health said: 1. I have no detailed information regarding availability in the various States of either beds for acute geriatric cases in public hospitals or day centres or outpatient centres attached to public hospitals to meet the needs of aged persons. The Minister said: ' I have no detailed information'. How can the Commonwealth be exercising its responsibility for age and invalid pensioners if the Minister for Health has no detailed information about the number of beds for acute geriatric cases in public hospitals or day centres or outpatient centres attached to public hospitals to meet the needs of these persons? The Minister went on to say: The provision of hospital accommodation and services is a State responsibility; the Commonwealth's responsibilities in this regard are limited to repatriation hospitals and hospitals in Commonwealth Territories. This vastly and increasingly important field is, according to the Minister, a State responsibility. Well, the Opposition does not look at it that way. We start from the assumption that age and invalid pensioners are the responsibility of the nation. We do not believe in passing that responsibility to State governments or anyone else. The Minister continued: During the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers for Health held in Canberra last July there was discussion of a proposal for an inquiry into the needs, care and treatment of the aged. This matter has already been the subject of inquiries in some States and the State Ministers decided to study the reports that are already available on the subject before further discussions with the Commonwealth are held. While this is going on elderly people in Australia are dying and others are left neglected in rooms in many different parts of the country, having to rely on friends or neighbours to give them assistance. I do not know whether it is necessary for an inquiry to be conducted in order to ascertain the situation, but if the Minister and his State colleagues take the position that nothing further can be done unless they first find out what has to be done, then the inquiry is urgent and should take place into the position of elderly people these days and the need for geriatric care and attention. Not only is this a very great problem today but clearly it will become a much greater problem as time goes by. In a recent address the Honourable Sir John Barry, a Justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria, dealt with the matter. Among other things he said: I make no claim to familiarity with the mysteries of demography, but the projections of population in Australia during the next twenty years emphasise the urgency of planning for an increasing number of aged people. It is expected that the number of males aged sixty-five and over in Australia will increase from 412,800 in 1966 to 617,000 in 1986. He stressed, and I quote again: . . . the projections of population in Australia during the next twenty years emphasise the urgency of planning for an increasing number of aged people. No planning is going on anywhere in Australia today as to what will be needed by an increased number of aged people in the next decade or two. Like everything else that is being done, the future in this respect is unplanned. Our social service and health systems grow like an ugly tree, without system or pattern. A little is added here today as a result of pressures from this group of people; a little is added there because it means a few more votes for the Government from that group of people. But no overall plan or consistency is present in what is being done. no ugly trees. Dr. J. F. CAIRNSI can understand my friend's objection to my statement. I know he would agree that there is no such thing as an ugly tree. But sometimes when I look at a fig tree its distorted limbs and twisted trunk remind me of our social service and health systems. I think the honourable member for Reid knows enough about fig trees to realise the validity of the parallel. Of course, some inquiries have taken place. They have indicated a pretty unsatisfactory condition. I have time to refer to only one such inquiry. It was a survey conducted by the Old People's Welfare Council of Victoria of accommodation for elderly people in Australia. I would like to bring the attention of the House to one aspect of the inquiry, namely the limitation on meeting the need of elderly persons. The report of the survey reads: Organisations were asked, from their own experience, what existing conditions affecting accommodation for the elderly impose the greatest limitation on meeting the need. The following conditions were mentioned: 1. Insufficient infirmary care-bed s limited to residents only. 2. Lack offinancefor building and maintenance. 3. Limitations of Aged Persons Homes Act to the active elderly. 4. Limitations of Commonwealth Health Actinfirmary sections do not qualify for Special Account Benefits. 5. Lack of trained staff for institutions, with understanding of the needs of the elderly.",72,Sheltered Employment
143,Mr Uren,"Why belittle trees? There areThat is only part of the picture. The limitations include seventeen different items. I do not intend to go through all of them. This is merely an indication of what one survey found regarding the Umitations to which I have referred. I know of my own experience that long waiting Usts exist for admission to the only homes made available for elderly people in Victoria. Sometimes it is necessary for these people to wait up to eight months to gain admission to one of these homes. The Government provides some financial assistance to elderly people in this regard. It provides a housekeeper grant for those who look after old people in their own homes, but this is quite inadequate for the purpose. The Government provides a home nursing subsidy, but this is completely inadequate for the purpose. Directly and indirectly the Government provides some assistance for nursing homes, but these homes are totaUy inadequate. There are long waiting lists for admission to these homes. Many of the places that are available are far too expensive for even the averagely situated elderly person. There is an overall problem of increasing need to which Justice Sir John Barry referred and for which there is no long term planning at all. The Opposition believes that the kind of there is evidence that every State Governservice to which I am referring can at least ment must decide whether to sacrifice possess its main development as a developeducation or health.

But the ferring. There seems to be general agreement regional governments are being forced to among the medical profession that the economise and to choose between two such service to be found at the hospital in essential requirements as education and Newcastle is an excellent example of the health. The pensioners are not the accepted way geriatric treatment starts in the hospital, responsibility of the nation; they are becomwith a special ward for the purpose; where ing increasingly the responsibility of the convalescent or staging homes or hospitals States and voluntary bodies. can be provided; where a home service is provided based upon the general or public hospital concerned. Meals are taken out, this Bill is the need to provide specialist nursing is provided and housekeeping is medical services for pensioners. Pensioners provided. Even the laundering of bed linen -whe n the Australian Medical Association and such things is provided by the general agrees-ar e provided with a general prachospital. The point about all this is that titioner service. Is the assumption underlying it is much cheaper to provide for patients this that pensioners as distinct from other in this manner than to provide for the citizens do not require specialist services? patients in the ward of the hospital conOr is the assumption that pensioners receivcerned. It is cheaper to use the space in ing an income that is barely sufficient on the patient's own home than to use the any test to provide for the bare minimum space in the hospital. In many ways it is better for the patient that space should be utilised in this way. This is the first point I makes-the inadequacy of resources for geriatric treatment in Australia. This is the most glaring deficiency which this Bill leaves still existing in the Commonwealth today. The second point to which I refer is the inadequacy of the provision for public hospitals themselves. The Commonwealth has recently increased its hospital benefit to $5 a day, but this amount is totally inadequate. Thc costs of public hospitals today are, at the minimum, $10 a day, and I suggest that they would be $20 a day for each bed in a teaching hospital. When the Commonwealth contribution was first introduced, it was about 45% or near enough in some instances to 50% of the total cost of a bed in a teaching hospital. The contribution of $5 a day made by the Commonwealth now is no more than 20% of the cost of a bed in a general or teaching hospital. That is why I say that there is evidence that the responsibility of the Commonwealth for health and medical services and attention to pensioners is gradually being moved to th; States and to other bodies. Every State Minister of Health today has enormous problems and The third deficiency that is not cured by of needs are expected to pay for their own specialist services? The Opposition believes that this glaring deficiency must be quickly repaired and that panels of specialists must be made availableI suppose it must be by agreement in the traditions of the association between governments and doctors that prevails in this country-so that specialist services can be provided for pensioners. The fourth obvious deficiency that comes to mind is to be found in the increasing evidence that pharmaceutical drugs and medicines are not widely enough available. Many complaints come to hand that a pensioner's doctor has prescribed a drug or medicine as necessary for the patient and it is then found not to be on the list or has been taken off the list and a substitute is said to be available. A substitute is said to be ferent ways. This should no longer be a available by whom? By some other doctor who has never seen the patient, who knows little of his needs and who knows little of his reactions to specific drugs. However, the drug that the pensioner's doctor has said is necessary is not available. What can be done to meet this situation? Sometimes it is said that all pharmaceutical drugs and medicines that are on the market and prescribed by a doctor should be accepted by the Minister's advisers as necessary for the pensioner. I think there is a strong case to be made out for this suggestion. But at least if the Government is not prepared, because of its economies in this field, to go as far as that, the Minister should have and should be prepared to exercise some discretionary powers to make such pharmaceutical drugs and medicines as are prescribed by the pensioner's doctor available to him. Of course, if the Minister used discremust begin to explore them. tionary powers in this respect, he would have to act on advice from someone. I suppose it would be pointless to expect him the notice of the House as illustrating to act on the advice of the advisers who serious deficiencies in the service is the had already recommended that the drug or relationship of pensioners to benefit funds. medicine should not be made available. Who This is quite unsatisfactory. The pensioner can be independent in such a matter as this? hardly ever knows whether he should or The need in manyfieldsof health services, should not join a fund. If he does join a as in manyfieldsof social services, for some independent judgment to be exercised is fund he often has to pay more for the apparent. The problem must be solved in limited amount that he receives from the some way or other to give the doctor treatfund than has the ordinary member. He is ing a pensioner a freer, more effective and uncertain; he does not know what to do more appropriate choice. The fifth deficiency which I think is pay. The pensioner should be covered for obvious in the services for aged and invalid all needs without the necessity to join any pensioners and which is still left by the Bill is the failure to provide dental services and dentures for pensioners. There is hardly another country with a level of development similar to that in Australia that does not provide services such as this. If the Government cannot, with its economies, provide a full dental service and dentures it should surely be able to go .at least part of the way. In some States pensioners can obtain dental treatment free of charge; in others it is subject to a means test; and in some no service at all is provided. Again there are differences between the States. The Commonwealth is supposed to be responsible for the age and invalid pensioners, but the responsibility is being transferred to the States and the States are meeting it in difcharacteristic of the pensioner medical service. However, it is a characteristic of the general service and no doubt it will remain for some time. The presence of this situation in the pensioner medical service should not be accepted for a moment by a responsible government. There are at least two other deficiencies in this particular field. They are the need to provide hearing aids and optical treatment. Pensioners today are in need of these services. If pensioners must provide these services for themselves, they face considerable costs. The provision of a hearing aid is a complicated service and I am quite sure that many pensioners accept responsibility for the purchase of hearing aids that they cannot afford to buy and they are very often left in financial difficulties. These are areas of the service that remain almost unexplored and sooner or later a government in a country such as Australia The sixth point that I want to bring to and he very often must pay more if he does join than the ordinary person would private fund. This deficiency will remain as significant as ever after the passage of this amending Bill. Apart from these half dozen significant areas of deficiency that the Bill still leaves I want to refer to the development of two general provisions which the Opposition considers it should be the responsibility of the Commonwealth of Australia to accept. We believe that the Commonwealth should begin without delay to provide funds for a salaried staff at general and public hospitals. One of the main aims of the Australian Labor Party will be to develop the efficiency and adequate nature of hospital services in the general and public hospital wards by the provision of salaried staff. We believe also that another general factor which has very largely been ignored by the Government, which must be taken into account and which the Labor Party will take into account, is the provision of effective competition to the private oligopolistic drug companies by a responsible public corporation or commission wbich may grow from the development of something like the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. Most of the drug companies in Australia-ther e are not many of them -ar e in what the economist calls an oligopolistic situation. They have considerable power because of their size and by agreements between them over the prices they charge. They make large and excessive profits. The Commonwealth today is spending such an enormous amount of money to buy definition of 'adequacy' is, but the amount their products that it can no longer properly I. have stated seems to be a very substantial be willing to pay whatever prices these of old people. I come now to the general companies see fit to charge. The role of point that I wish to make. public enterprise in this field, as in many others, is to provide effective competition The honourable member for Yarra spoke with private enterprise, which is no longer of the 1946 amendment to the Constitution private in any sense of the word and about as though the terms of that amendment which, in many cases, there is not much were such that from that time forward the enterprise either. As I said at the beginning Commonwealth accepted full and complete of my remarks the Bill provides for a very responsibility to provide health and allied limited range of services. They are simply social services to the pensioner group in the those which have arisen because of amendcommunity. Nothing could be further from ments to the Social Services Act and the truth. All that the referendum did was Repatriation Act resulting mainly from to amend the Constitution to give the Comchanges in and a relaxation of the means monwealth power to play a part, to share test. This is all that the Government has in this field with those governing bodies in seen fit to introduce in the way of medical Australia which had the traditional responand health services for pensioners. No doubt sibility, that is, the State governments. So 4127/67-R-[55 ] the Minister will claim that this is the only responsibility the Government has at a time like this, but the Opposition makes the criticism that the Government should and must provide sooner or later for services in at least some of the areas that I have outlined to the House this evening. In addition to this it must plan over a long period to accept fully its responsibility for the adequate provision of a health and medical service for age and invalid pensioners in Australia. The Government shows no readiness to undertake any of these things. The Opposition is not opposed to this measure because it agrees with its provisions, although they are limited. It cannot object to the provisions contained in the Bill, but we point out to the House that the measure is totally inadequate to meet the Government's responsibilities for health and medical services for our age and invalid pensioners. Dr FORBES (Barker-Minister for Health) [10.55]-in replyI have no desire to detain the House at this hour, but I should like to make one broad comment on the remarks made by the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns) in criticising the provisions contained in the Bill. He spoke of them as being totally inadequate. I remind him that for a maximum of 41,000 pensioners they will provide benefits which will cost the Commonwealth Government in the region of $1,300,000 per year. That is in respect of those 41,000 pensioners alone. I do not know what the honourable member's contribution to the welfare of that number often when people talk about the national health service and the pensioner medical service they assume that the whole of the national health service is embraced by what the Commonwealth Government does in this field. It is not uncommon for people to compare the national health service in Australia with the national health service in Britain, forgetting completely that the service in Britain comprises virtually the totalgovernments. Let nobody suggest that a ity of hospital and medical care and allied services in that country, whereas in Australia what is called the national health serthese services through the provisions made vice is just a part of the totality of medical and hospital care. I believe that this is the answer to the honourable member for Yarra. He referred to the inadequacies in quite a number of respects of the pensioner medical service, but in doing so at all times he either people and the medical and hospital treatforgot or chose to ignore the traditional and continuing role and responsibility that the State governments have in this field. They must continue to have that responsibility. The Commonwealth Government does not operate hospitals, nor does it operate nursing homes. I have never heard any suggestion that the Commonwealth Government should enter this field, other than in its own territories. The State governments have traditionally operated hospitals and have traditionally taken responsibility for the procapable of providing it and are prepared to vision of physical health services. Confining my remarks only to the pensioner group and other old people in the community, over the years the Commonwealth by successive improvements in the benefits it makes available has lightened the load on the State governments and has enabled them, or should have enabled them, to do more in this field. It is not only the things that are provided in this Bill-the pharamaceutical benefits, the pensioner medical service, general practitioner services and the $5 a day contribution to the hospitalisation of pensioners-bu t other factors, including nursing home benefits, which cost this Government a large sum and which primarily benefit old people. The honourable member mentioned the home nursing subsidy virtually as though it did not exist. Further, I mention the standard rate benefit in respect of contributors to medical and hospital funds. All these things lighten the burden of State governments and make it easier for them with the resources they have available to fulfil their traditional responsibility for the sort of things the honourable member for Yarra advocated. He talked of the lack of specialist services being a gap in the pensioner medical service, but specialist services to the aged and indigent group in the community have always been the function of our great public hospitals that are operated by State pensioner cannot obtain specialist services without paying for them. He can receive by the States in the public hospitals. To suggest that this represents a deficiency in the pensioner medical service ignores the point that I am trying to make, namely, that the responsibility for the care of old ment of old people is shared jointly between the Commonwealth Government and the State governments. Dr. J. F. Cairns-And so jointly avoided. says 'jointly avoided' but in talking about dental treatment the honourable member pointed out that some States have accepted this as a clear responsibility and have provided free treatment. If some States are shoulder that responsibility, others should be too. This is no reason why the Commonwealth Government should step into the field. At least some States have accepted the responsibility and have the financial capacity to do so. One of the reasons why they have thefinancialcapacity is the continuing and increasing subventions provided by this Government by way of reimbursement grants. The Government accepts the fact that the States do have a responsibility in providing health services, particularly to old people. Dr. J. F. Cairns-I s the Minister member has spoken in this debate. change in the whole concept of Commonwealth and State relations, and in the amounts made available to the States in reimbursement grants, if we were to accept the proposition of the honourable member for Yarra that the whole responsibility for providing health and medical services for",76,National Health Bill 1967

Did the Nauonai Health and Medical Research Council on 2nd November 1961 adopt the recommendation of its Public Health Committee that imported cheese should be made from pasteurised milk only? 2. Did he on 8th July 1966 authorise amendments to the Quarantine (Animals) Regulations which prohibited the landing of cheese manufactured from unpasteurised milk? 3'. Does his department usually take so long to implement the Council's recommendations, and why did it take so long in this instance? able member's questions are as follows: 1. Yes. 2. Yes. 3. No. In 1961 the National Health and Medical Research Council made the following recommendation: 'That imported cheese should be made from pasteurised milk only.' At that time, the Food Standards Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council was considering Australian Food Standards for cheese. This Committee, in accordance with usual practice, forwarded a draft food standard for cheese to the public health authorities of the various States for detailed examination by the States' Food Advisory Committees. The draft was also forwarded to the Council of Australian Food Technology Associations for comments and suggestions. Tn 1964, the National Health and Medical Research Council formally recommended the adoption of a standard for cheese which included the provision that 'milk and milk products shall be effectively pasteurised. . . .' This standard was later formally adopted by the Food Advisory Committees of all States. Legislation to give effect to the new standard was included with other amendments of the Quarantine (Animals) Regulations, which were notified in the Commonwealth Gazette of 14th July 1966. In September 1966, implementation of the regulations was deferred when cheese importers and exporting countries pointed out difficulties in rental to blind persons? complying with testing and certification procedures called for in the regulations. Subsequently, the legislation was revoked and the whole matter has been referred back to the National Health and Medical Research Council for further consideration. I have traced the history of this matter to illustrate that the regulations were the result of a series of recommendations and examinations over a period. Department of Health: Medical and Dental Officers (Question No. 81) Mr Cross asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: 1. Do any medical officers employed by his department possess dental qualifications in addition to their medical qualifications? 2. Do any dental officers employed by his department possess medical qualifications in addition to their dental qualifications? able members questions are as follows: 1. Yes. One medical officer has both dental and medical qualifications. 2. No. Hospital and Medical Benefits (Question No. 131) Mr Hayden asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: 1. Is it a fact that his department earlier in this decade undertook a survey of people who did not contribute for medical or hospital benefits? 2. If so, were the results of the survey published in full? 3. If the results were not published, will he state why they were not published, and will he now arrange for this report, which has undoubted value as an insight into socio-economic problems in this country, to be made available to the public? able member's questions is as follows: My department has never undertaken a survey of persons who are not contributors to medical or hospital benefits funds. Telephones for the Blind (Question No. 185) Mr Webb asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice: Will he consider supplying telephones free of able member's question is as follows: The question of concessional rental has been considered by the Government and the current rate is regarded as the maximum assistance possible at the present time; this of course includes blind persons.",80,National Health Bill 1967

For example, Britain, Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States of America provide subsidies for the construction of vessels and Britain, Norway and Canada provide payments to vessel operators to meet deficiencies in earnings. For more detailed information on this subject. I would refer the honourable member to a report published in 1965 by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development entitled 'Financial Support to the Fishing Industry'. A copy of this report is available in the Parliamentary Library. Wheat (Question No. 209) Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice1. To which countries in South America, the Middle East and Africa were quantities of wheat sold and exported in 1966? 2. What quantity was sold to each country? 3. In view of the publication by the Canadian Government of wheat sales showing prices and terms, why does the Australian Wheat Board maintain such secrecy? 4. Is it a fact that wheat sales to India were not as favourable in price and extended terms as those made to Red China? honourable member's questions are as follows: 1 and 2.

The premise in this question is not correct. To my knowledge public statements by the Canadian Minister for Trade and Commerce on the subject of important sales of wheat disclose the buying country, the quantities of wheat involved, the duration of credit terms and, possibly, the grades or types of wheat sold. They may include an indication of the approximate total value of a contract but do not disclose the prices or the rates of interest charged. Similar announcements usually are made concurrently by the Canadian Wheat Board. The Australian Wheat Board is autonomous in its day to day marketing operations. From time to time it has released information on sales which are of major public interest including sales to Mainland China, India and Pakistan. The information in these statements is closely comparable to that in the Canadian statements referred to above. Both Boards are commercial selling organisations. Neither makes a practice of disclosing the price at which individual sales are made. The reasons for this are obvious, in line with normal commercial practice and quite clearly justified. 4. As staled in 3 the prices at which sales are made and the rates of interest charged are not disclosed by the Board. In any case, having in mind the frequent fluctuations in world prices for wheats of varying qualities, comparisons of prices for sales made at different points of time are unrewarding. I have the assurance of the Board, however, that in its pricing and sales policy it has not discriminated against India vis-a-vis any other market, including Mainland China. In other respects it is possible to compare terms of sale and in this connection the attention of the honourable member is invited to three statements made by the Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board, viz., (i) 1 December 1966; sale to India. 411 (ii) 14 November 1966; sale to Pakistan. .. .. 1 (iii) 2 November 1966; sale to Mainland China.",82,Answers To Questions Upon Notice

How many Australian servicemen have died in Vietnam? 2. Of these, how many have been buried in Australia, and at whose expense? able member's questions are as follows: 1. As as 23rd March 1967, a total of 106 Australian servicemen have died in Vietnam. 2. The remains of eighty-nine have been returned to Australia for burial. Approval was given in January 1966 for the bodies of deceased servicemen to be returned to Australia for burial where practicable and if requested by next of kin. Reimof February 1967, there were twelve persons regisbursement of cost was approved where bodies had already been returned at the expense of the next of kin. So far, under these approvals, the Government has met the cost of return of the remains of eighty-two servicemen. As far as the costs of burial are concerned, where the next of kin requests a military funeral all costs are met by the Government; where the next of kin requests a private funeral the body is transported at public expense to the area selected by next of kin and a contribution is made towards the funeral costs. Sales Tax: Motor Vehicle Seat Belts (Question No. 9) Mr Webb asked the Treasurer, upon notice: 1.
